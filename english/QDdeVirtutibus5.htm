    </p>
    <p>
      1. Things which are not distinct ought not to be numbered separately,
      since distinction is the cause of number, as Damascene says. But the
      virtues mentioned are not distinguished from one another, for Gregory says
      in the <i>Morals on Job</i> 22: Unless prudence is just and temperate and
      brave, it is not true prudence, nor is there perfect temperance which is
      not brave, just, and prudent, nor complete fortitude which is not prudent,
      temperate, and just, nor true justice which is not prudent, brave, and
      temperate. Therefore, these should not be called the four cardinal
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, virtues seem to be called cardinal because they are
      principles of other virtues; hence, what some call cardinal, others call
      principal, as is clear in Gregory <i>Morals on Job</i> 22. But since the
      end is principal with respect to what is for the sake of the end, the
      theological virtues which have the ultimate end as their object would seem
      to have a better claim to be called principal than the virtues mentioned
      which bear on that which is for the sake of the end. Therefore, the
      virtues mentioned ought not be called the four cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, things which belong to different genera ought not be placed
      in the same ordering. But prudence is in the genus of intellectual
      virtues, as is clear in <i>Ethics</i> 6 and the other three are moral
      virtues. Therefore, they are unfittingly called the four cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Moreover, among the intellectual virtues wisdom is more principal than
      prudence, as the Philosopher proves in <i>Ethics</i> 6, because wisdom is
      concerned with divine things and prudence with human. Therefore, if any
      intellectual virtue is to be listed among the cardinal virtues, it should
      be the more principal one, that is, wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Moreover, other virtues ought to be reduced to the cardinal virtues.
      But the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 2 opposes certain other virtues to
      fortitude and temperance, namely liberality and magnanimity and the like,
      which thus are not reduced to them. Therefore, the aforementioned are not
      cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Moreover, what is not a virtue should not be put among the cardinal
      virtues. But temperance does not seem to be a virtue, for it is not had
      when other virtues are had, as is clear in Paul who had all the other
      virtues yet did not have temperance, for concupiscence remained in his
      members according to Romans 7:23: “I see another law in my members,
      warring against the law of my mind.” The temperate man differs from the
      continent in this, that the temperate man does not have depraved desires,
      but the continent does, though he
    </p>
    <p>
      does not follow them, as is clear from the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the foregoing are improperly enumerated as four cardinal
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moreover, just as a man is well-ordered in himself by virtue, so too is
      he well-ordered to his neighbor. But by two of these virtues a man is
      ordered to himself, namely, fortitude and temperance. Therefore, there
      should be two virtues by which he is ordered to his neighbor, and not only
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Moreover, Augustine says in <i>On the morals of the church</i> that
      virtue is the order of love. But the love of grace is contained in two
      precepts, namely, love of God and love of neighbor. Therefore, there
      should be only two cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Moreover, the diversity of matter due to extension causes only
      numerical diversity. But the diversity of matter which is due to the
      reception of different forms causes a generic difference, on account of
      which the corruptible and incorruptible differ in genus, as is said in
      <i>Metaphysics</i> 10. But the virtues mentioned differ insofar as matter
      has a different way of receiving form. For the mode of reason in the case
      of the matter of temperance is to refrain the passions, but in the matter
      of fortitude to struggle toward that from which reason pulls away.
      Therefore, the virtues mentioned differ in genus and ought away. not to be
      conjoined in one order of cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Moreover, the definition of virtue is based on the fact that it has to
      do with reason, as is clear from the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 2, who
      defines virtue as being in accord with right reason. But right reason is a
      measured measure that is measured by the first measure, God, from whom
      reason has the power of regulating. Therefore, moral virtues have the note
      of virtue chiefly insofar as they attain the first measure, God, but the
      theological virtues, which are concerned with God, are not called
      cardinal. Therefore, moral virtues ought not be called cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Moreover, reason is the chief part of the soul, but temperance and
      fortitude are not in reason but in the irrational part, as the Philosopher
      says in <i>Ethics</i> 3. Therefore, they ought not be put among the
      cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Moreover, it is more laudable to use one’s own property than to give
      or take away another’s. But the first pertains to liberality and the
      second to justice. Therefore, liberality rather than justice ought rather
      to be called a cardinal virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Moreover, that which is the basis of others ought especially to be
      called a cardinal virtue. But humility is that, for Gregory says that he
      who has the other virtues without humility carries them as ashes in the
      wind. Therefore, humility ought to be numbered among the cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Virtue is a kind of perfection, as is clear from the Philosopher in
      <i>Physics</i> 6. But, as is said in James 1:4, patience has a perfect
      work. Therefore, as perfection patience ought to be numbered among the
      cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Moreover, the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 6 that magnanimity
      does the most among the virtues and is as an ornament to the other
      virtues. But this especially seems to count toward a virtue’s being
      principal. Therefore, magnanimity seems to be a cardinal virtue and the
      foregoing are improperly accounted the four cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      ON THE CONTRARY. Ambrose says in commenting on Luke 6, “Blessed are the
      poor in spirit,” that we know there are four cardinal virtues: temperance,
      justice, prudence, and fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESPONSE. It should be said that ‘cardinal’ comes from the hinge on which
      a door swings, according to Proverb 26:14: “As a door turns on its hinges,
      so does the slothful on his bed.” Hence, cardinal virtues are those on
      which human life is founded, by which the gate may be entered; but human
      life is what is proportioned to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In man, however, there is found first a sensitive nature, in which he is
      like the brutes; then practical reason, which is proper to man according
      to his level; and speculative intellect, which is not found in man as
      perfectly as it is in the angels, but as a kind of participation on the
      part of the soul. Therefore, the contemplative life is not properly human
      but superhuman; the life of pleasure, however, by which one adheres to
      sensible goods, is not human but bestial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The properly human life is the active which consists in the exercise of
      the moral virtues; therefore, those virtues are properly called cardinal
      on which the moral life somehow turns and is based, as the principles of
      such a life, which is why these virtues are also called principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four things involved in the virtuous act. First, that the
      substance of this act is modified in itself. This is why the act is called
      good, as bearing on fitting matter or clothed with fitting circumstances.
      Second, the act must relate fittingly to the subject, that is, be firmly
      rooted. Third, the act must be fittingly proportioned to something
      extrinsic to it as an end. These three all follow from the fact that the
      virtuous act is directed by reason, but a fourth is taken from directing
      reason, namely, deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philosopher touches on these four in <i>Ethics</i> 2 when he says that
      it does not suffice for virtue that things are justly or temperately done,
      which pertains to the modification of the act. Three other things are
      required from the side of the agent. First, that he be knowing, which
      refers to the directing knowledge; then, that he should will and choose
      for the sake of this: This refers to the rightness of the act as ordered
      to something extrinsic. Third, that it be stable, such that it firmly and
      changelessly characterizes the agent and his act. Now these four, namely,
      directive knowledge, rightness, stability, and moderation, although they
      are required of every virtuous act, each has a kind of special importance
      in certain matters and acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three things are required of practical knowledge. The first of which is
      deliberation, the second is judgment of what has been deliberated; of
      course, discovery, inquiry and judgment are also found in speculative
      reason. But because practical reason commands flight or pursuit, something
      speculative intellect does not do, a point made in <i>On the Soul</i> 3, a
      third note characterizes practical reason, namely, to ponder things which
      must be done. The other two are ordered to this as to what is principal in
      practical reason. What Aristotle calls <i>eubulia</i> – deliberating well
      – perfects a man in the first respect, and <i>synesis</i> and
      <i>gnome</i> enable a man to judge well, as is said in <i>Ethics</i> 6.
      But it is through prudence that reason is able to command well, as is said
      in that same place; so it is clear that what is most important in
      directive knowledge pertains to prudence, and this is why prudence is
      numbered among the cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, the rectitude of the act in comparison to something extrinsic
      has the note of the good and laudable even in things which pertain to
      oneself, but is especially praised in the things that pertain to others:
      that is, when a man makes his act right not only with respect to himself
      but also with respect to what he has in common with others. For the
      Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 5 that many can use virtue in what
      concerns themselves but cannot in what concerns others; justice is the
      principal virtue in this regard, since by it a man is adapted and made
      equal in a fitting way to those with whom he lives. Hence, those things
      are commonly called just which are adapted in certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moderation, or restraining, commands praise and has the note of the good
      chiefly when passion is intense and the restraint of reason is needed if
      the mean of virtue is to be achieved. Passions are most intense with
      respect to the greatest pleasures, that is, the pleasures of touch.
      Temperance is called a cardinal virtue because it restrains the desire for
      tactile pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firmness deserves praise and has the note of the good chiefly when
      passions induce us to flee, especially in the greatest perils which
      involve mortal danger. Fortitude is called a cardinal virtue because by it
      one is intrepid in the face of mortal danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these four virtues, prudence is in reason, justice in will, fortitude
      in the irascible, and temperance in the concupiscible, which are the only
      powers that can be the principles of a human or a voluntary act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the meaning of cardinal virtue is clear, both on the side of the
      modes of virtue, which are its formal notes, and on the side of matter,
      and on the side of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 1. It should be said that people speak in two ways of the four cardinal
      virtues mentioned, for some use these four names to signify general modes
      of the virtues, for example, calling any directive knowledge prudence, any
      rectitude that equalizes human acts justice, any moderation that restrains
      man’s appetite for temporal goods temperance, and all firmness of soul
      stabilizing man in the good against the assault of whatever evils,
      fortitude. It is in this way that Augustine seems to use these words in On
      the morals of the church, and in this way too that the remark of Gregory
      can be understood, because only one of the conditions of the true virtue
      does not suffice: All the conditions must be satisfied. On this basis the
      four are called virtues not because of different species of habits drawn
      from diverse objects, but according to different formal notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others however, like Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>, speak of the four
      virtues mentioned as special virtues determined to proper matters, and
      Gregory’s remark is true in this sense as well, for by a certain
      redundancy, these virtues bear on matters in which the four cardinal
      virtues are most powerfully needed. In this way, fortitude is temperate
      and temperance brave since one who can restrain his appetite for pleasure,
      the task of temperance, will more easily restrain the impulse to
      recklessness before mortal danger; and similarly he who can stand firm
      against the dangers of death, can all the more easily stand firm against
      the allurements of desire. On this basis, what belongs principally to
      temperance passes on to fortitude and vice versa. And the same can be said
      of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 2. It should be said that man’s appetite rests in the end, and,
      therefore, the principality of the theological virtues, which bear on the
      ultimate end, is not compared to a hinge, which moves, but rather to a
      foundation or root, which is standing and at rest, according to Ephesians
      3, 17: “rooted and grounded in love.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 3. It should be said that, according to the Philosopher in
      <i>Ethics</i> 6, prudence is right reason with respect to things to be
      done. But things to be done are called moral works, as is clear from what
      is said there. Therefore, prudence agrees with the moral virtues because
      of its matter, and on account of this is numbered among them, although
      with respect to its essence or subject it is an intellectual virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 4. It should be said that wisdom, because it is concerned with the
      divine and not the human, does not have its matter in common with the
      moral virtues, and hence is not numbered among them as if together with
      them it might be called a cardinal virtue. The notion of hinge is
      repugnant to contemplation, which is not like a door, whereby one enters
      into something else, but moral action is the door through which entry is
      made to the contemplation of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 5. It should be said that if the foregoing four virtues are taken to
      signify the general conditions of virtue, then all the special virtues of
      which the Philosopher treats in the <i>Ethics</i> are reduced to these
      four as species to genera. But if they be taken as special virtues dealing
      with the most basic matters, the others are reduced to them as the
      secondary to the principal; for example, <i>eutrapelia</i>, which
      moderates the pleasure of play, can be reduced to temperance which
      moderates the pleasures of touch. Hence, Cicero in <i>Rhetoric</i> 2 says
      that the other virtues are parts of these four. That can be understood in
      two ways: They are subjective parts if these virtues are taken in the
      first way, whereas they are potential parts if they are taken in the
      second way. Thus, sense is a potential part of the soul because it does
      not name the whole power of the soul, but something of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 6. It should be said that it is not of the meaning of temperance that
      it excludes all depraved desires, but that the temperate person does not
      experience as vehement and strong desires as those who do not try to
      restrain them. Therefore, Paul suffered inordinate desires because of the
      corruption of lust, but not strongly or vehemently, because he sought to
      repress them by castigating his own body and bring it into subjection.
      Hence, he was truly temperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 7. It should be said that justice, by which we are related to the
      other, does not deal with one’s own passions but with the activities by
      which we communicate with others, such as buying and selling and the like:
      But temperance and fortitude are concerned with one’s own passions and
      therefore, Just as there is one appetitive power without passion, namely,
      will, and two with passion, namely, the concupiscible and irascible, so
      there is one cardinal virtue ordered to the neighbor, and two ordering a
      man to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 8. It should be said that charity is called the whole of virtue not
      essentially but causally, because charity is the mother of all the
      virtues. But the effect is always more multiplied than the cause, and
      therefore the other virtues must be greater in number than charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 9. It should be said that the different senses of reception can be
      taken either from the side of the matter which is receptive of form, and
      such diversity causes diversity of genus, or from the side of the form
      which is diversely receivable in matter, and such diversity causes
      diversity of species. And so it is in the objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 10. It should be said that the moral virtues involve reason as their
      proximate measure, but God as their first measure. Things are specified
      according to proper and proximate principles, not according to first
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 11. It should be said that the rational is the principal part of man,
      but something is rational in two ways, essentially or by way of
      participation and, just as reason itself is more principal that the powers
      participating in reason, so prudence is more principal than the other
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 12. It should be said that the cardinal virtues are called more
      principal, not because they are more perfect than all the other virtues,
      but because human life more principally turns on them and the other
      virtues are based on them. But it is manifest that human life turns more
      on justice than on liberality, for we use justice in regard to all, but
      liberality in regard to a few. And liberality itself is founded on
      justice, for there would not be a liberal gift if one did not give of his
      own, but one’s own is distinguished from that of others through justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 13. It should be said that humility strengthens all virtues indirectly
      by removing what can undermine the good works of the virtues and cause
      them to perish; but the other virtues are directly strengthened by the
      cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 14. It should be said that patience is included in fortitude, for the
      brave person has what the patient person has, but adds even more, namely,
      that he drives off imminent evils in the way that he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 15. It should be said that, from the fact that magnanimity adorns the
      other virtues, it is clear that it presupposes the other virtues in which
      it is grounded, and from this it is also clear that the others are more
      principal than it.<br /></p

        Whether the virtues are connected such that he who has one has all</span
      >
    </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">And it seems not.</span></p>
    <p>
      1. In commenting on Luke, Bede says that the saints are more humbled by
      the virtues they do not have than extolled for those they have. Therefore,
      they have some and lack others, and the virtues are not connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, a man is in the state of charity after penance, and yet he
      experiences difficulty in certain matters because of his earlier practice,
      as Augustine says against Julian. But a difficulty of this kind seems to
      arise from a habit contrary to virtue, due to an acquired bad inclination
      incompatible with the contrary virtue. Therefore, someone can have one
      virtue, namely, charity, and lack others.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, charity is found in all those who have been baptized, but
      some of the baptized do not have prudence, as is particularly evident in
      the retarded and insane, who cannot be prudent, according to the
      Philosopher, and even in some simple adults who do not seem to be prudent,
      since they do not deliberate well, which is a work of prudence. Therefore,
      he who has one virtue, namely charity, does not have all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Moreover, according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 6, prudence is
      right reason concerning things to be done, as art is right reason
      regarding things to be made. But a man can have right reason with regard
      to one sort of makeable things, for example, tools, and not with respect
      to other artificial things. Therefore, he can also have prudence
      concerning one sort of act, for example, just acts, and not have it
      concerning another, for example, brave acts. Thus, he will have one virtue
      without the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Moreover, the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 6 that not every
      liberal person is magnificent, yet both liberality and magnificence are
      virtues; similarly he says that some are moderate and not magnanimous.
      Therefore, it is not the case that whoever has one virtue has them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Moreover, the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 12:4: “There are varieties
      of gifts;” and afterwards (8:9) adds: “To one through the Spirit is given
      the utterance of wisdom; and to another the utterance of knowledge” (which
      are intellectual virtues), “to another faith” (which is a theological
      virtue). Therefore, one can have one virtue and not another.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moreover, virginity is a virtue, as Cyprian says. But many have other
      virtues and do not have virginity. Therefore, not everyone who has one
      virtue has them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Moreover, the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 6 that although we call
      Anaxagoras and Thales wise we do not call them prudent. But wisdom and
      prudence are intellectual virtues. Therefore, a person can have one virtue
      without the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Moreover, in the same book the Philosopher says that some have an
      inclination to one virtue but not to another. It can happen,
    </p>
    <p>
      ere ore, at someone practices the acts of one virtue and not those of
      another. But from the performance of acts virtues are acquired, as is
      clear from the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 2. Therefore, the acquired
      virtues at least are not connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Moreover, although the aptitude for virtue comes from nature it cannot
      be perfected by nature, as is said in <i>Ethics</i> 2. It is manifest as
      well that it is not from fortune, because the goods of fortune are outside
      the realm of choice. It follows, therefore, that we acquire virtue either
      by putting our minds to it or from God. But it seems that one virtue can
      be acquired intentionally without another since one can have the intention
      of acquiring one virtue but not another. Similarly, someone can ask God
      for one virtue and not another. Therefore, in whatever way it be
      considered, one virtue can be without others.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Moreover, in moral matters, the end is related to the acts of the
      virtues, as principles are to conclusions in demonstrative matters. But a
      man can have one conclusion without others. Therefore, he can have one
      virtue without others.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Moreover, Augustine says in a letter about the judgment of Jacob that
      it is not a divine judgment that he who has one virtue has them all, and
      that a man can have one virtue without the others, for example, mercy and
      not continence, much as in the body one member can be well, handsome, or
      healthy, and another not. Therefore, the virtues are not connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Moreover, things are connected either by reason or principle or
      subject or object. But the virtues cannot be connected by reason of their
      principle, God, because then it would follow that all the goods that are
      from God are connected. Nor by reason of their subject, the soul, because
      not all are connected on that basis. And not by reason of object, because
      they are distinguished from one another by their objects and the principle
      of distinction and connection cannot be the same. Therefore...
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Moreover, the intellectual virtues are not connected with the moral
      virtues, as is most evident in the understanding of principles, which can
      be had without the moral virtues. But prudence is an intellectual virtue,
      which is numbered among the cardinal virtues. Therefore, it does not have
      a connection with the other cardinal virtues, which are moral virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Moreover, in heaven there will be neither faith nor hope, but only
      charity. Therefore, even in the most perfect state the virtues are not
      connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Moreover, angels and separated souls, which are perpetual and
      immortal, do not have sense powers, and they have charity and justice but
      not temperance and fortitude because these are virtues of the irrational
      parts, as is said in <i>Ethics</i> 3. Therefore, the virtues are not
      connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Moreover, some virtues are of the soul, but there are also virtues of
      body. But there is no connection among the bodily powers, since one can
      have sight and not hearing. Therefore, neither is there a connection among
      the virtues of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Moreover, Gregory says on Ezechiel that no one suddenly becomes the
      best, and in Psalm 83, 8, it is said: “They shall go from strength to
      strength.” Therefore, a man does not acquire the virtues simultaneously,
      but successively, and thus the virtues are not connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      ON THE CONTRARY. 1. Ambrose says in commenting on Luke that they are
      connected and interlocked such that he who has one is seen to have them
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, Gregory says in <i>morals on Job</i> 23 that if one virtue
      could be had without the others, either it is not a virtue or it is not
      perfect. But perfection is of the very notion of virtue. “For virtue is a
      certain perfection,” as is said in <i>Physics</i> 7. Therefore, the
      virtues are connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, with respect to Ezekiel 1:11: “Two wings of every one were
      joined,” the Gloss says the virtues are conjoined such that he who lacks
      one, lacks the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESPONSE. It should be said that we can speak of virtues in two ways, as
      perfect and as imperfect. Perfect virtues are connected to one another,
      but imperfect virtues are not necessarily connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In evidence of which it should be noted that since virtue is that which
      makes a man and his work good, the virtue that makes a man’s work and
      himself good is perfect virtue, whereas the imperfect does not make a man
      and his work good simply speaking, but only in a certain respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human acts are good simply speaking when they attain to the rule of human
      acts, one of which is, as it were, homogeneous and proper to man, namely,
      right reason, and the other a first transcendent measure, which is God. A
      man attains right reason through prudence, which is right reason
      concerning what is to be done, as the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 6.
      A man attains to God through charity, according to John 4, 16: “God is
      love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is then a threefold grade of virtue. For there are some wholly
      imperfect virtues which exist without prudence, not attaining right
      reason, such as the inclinations which some have to certain works of
      virtue even from their birth, according to Job 31:18: “For from my infancy
      mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother’s womb.”
      Such inclinations are not all at once in everybody, but some have an
      inclination to one and others to another. Such inclinations do not have
      the mark of virtue, however, because no one uses a virtue badly, according
      to Augustine, but a person can use such inclinations badly and harmfully
      if he acts without discretion, much as a horse if it lacks vision will run
      faster the harder it is beaten. Hence, Gregory in <i>Morals on Job</i> 22
      says that other virtues, unless those who desire act prudently, cannot be
      called virtues at all. Hence, these inclinations without prudence do not
      fulfill the definition of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second grade of virtues are those that attain right reason but do not
      attain God through charity. These are in a sense perfect with respect to
      the human good, but not simply speaking perfect, because they do not
      attain the first rule, which is the ultimate end, as Augustine says
      against Julianus. Hence, they fall short of the true definition of virtue
      much as moral inclinations without prudence fall short of the true
      definition of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third grade is of virtues that are perfect simply speaking, because
      they are with charity. These virtues make a man’s act simply good, as
      attaining the ultimate end. It should be considered further
    </p>
    <p>
      that just as moral virtues cannot exist without prudence, for the reason
      already given, so prudence cannot exist without the moral virtues, for
      prudence is right reason about things to be done. For right reason in any
      genus one must have estimation and judgment of principles, from which
      reason proceeds, as in geometry one cannot have a correct estimate unless
      his reason is right concerning geometrical principles. But ends are the
      principles in things to be done and from them is drawn the reason for
      acting. But a person has a right estimate of the end thanks to the habit
      of moral virtue because, as the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 3, as a
      person is, so does the end appear to him. For to the virtuous that which
      is the good according to virtue seems desirable as an end, but to the
      vicious the desirable is that which pertains to his vice. And it is the
      same with healthy and unhealthy taste. Hence it is necessary that whoever
      has prudence also has moral virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, whoever has charity, must have all the other virtues. But
      charity is in man by a divine infusion, according to Romans 5:5: “The
      charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has
      been given to us.” But to whomever God gives an inclination he also gives
      certain forms which are the principles of action and motion to the things
      God inclines him to, just as he gives lightness to fire so that it can
      quickly and easily leap upward. Hence, it is said in Wisdom 8:1: “and
      orders all things sweetly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is necessary that, along with charity, there should be infused
      habitual forms for expeditiously producing the acts to which charity
      inclines. But charity inclines to the acts of all the virtues: Since it is
      concerned with the ultimate end, it implies the acts of all virtues. But
      any art or virtue which pertains to the end commands those which are for
      the sake of the end, as the general commands the cavalryman and the
      cavalryman the maker of harness, as is said in <i>Ethics</i> 1. Hence,
      according to the fittingness of divine wisdom and goodness, along with
      charity, the habits of all virtues are infused along with charity, and
      therefore it is said in 1 Corinthians 13, 5: “Charity is patient, is
      kind,” etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, if we mean simply perfect virtues, they are connected because
      of charity, because no such virtue can be had without charity and, if
      charity is had, all of them are had. If we understand virtues perfect in
      the second grade, with respect to the human good, they are connected
      through prudence, because no moral virtue can be had without prudence nor
      can prudence be had if one is lacking moral virtue. But if we understand
      the four cardinal virtues insofar as they imply the general conditions of
      virtue, in this way they are connected in the sense that it does not
      suffice to the act of virtue that one of these conditions be present if
      all are not, and this is the reason Gregory gave for their connection in
      <i>Morals on Job</i> 21.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 1. It should be said that because of an inclination one has to the work
      of one virtue rather than another, which is either natural or a gift of
      grace, it happens that one more promptly performs the act of one virtue
      than another; and in this way the saints are said to have some virtues on
      which they are prompt to act and not to have others on which they are less
      prompt to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 2. It should be said that although habits as such make someone act
      promptly and with pleasure, this can be impeded by something supervening,
      as one having the habit of science is sometimes impeded from using it by
      sleepiness or drunkenness or something of the like. Therefore, one who
      repents receives by grace charity and all the other virtues but because of
      the lingering dispositions from his prior sins he experiences difficulty
      in the performance of virtues which he has received habitually. This does
      not happen with virtues acquired through the practice of acts, which at
      the same time remove contrary dispositions and generate the habits of the
      virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 3. It should be said that those who are baptized receive prudence along
      with charity and all the other virtues too, but it is not of the necessity
      of prudence that a man deliberate well in everything, for example, in
      trade and military matters and the like, but only in the things necessary
      for salvation, which are not lacking to those in grace, however simple
      they be, according to 1 John 2:27: “But his anointing teaches you
      concerning all things”; unless perhaps in some of the baptized the act of
      prudence be impeded on account of the bodily defect of age, as in children
      or those of deformed dispositions, such as the retarded and mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 4. It should be said that artifacts of different types have wholly
      different principles, so nothing prevents someone having one kind of art
      and not another. But the principles of morals are so interrelated to one
      another that the failure of one would entail the failure in others. For
      example, if one were weak on the principle that concupiscence is not to be
      followed, which pertains to desire, then sometimes in pursuing
      concupiscence, he would do injury and thus violate justice. So too in one
      and the same art or science, for example, geometry, an error about one
      principle leads to error in the whole science. Thence it is that one
      cannot be sufficiently prudent with regard to the matter of one virtue
      unless he is prudent with regard to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 5. It should be said that it happens that someone can be called liberal
      but not high-minded with respect to an act, because someone having little
      can use what he has to perform an act of liberality but not of
      magnificence, although he might have the virtue by which he could also
      perform the act of magnificence if he had the wherewithal. Similarly, it
      must be said of moderation and magnanimity. This solution is to be held
      without reservation in the case of infused virtues, but in virtues
      acquired through acts it can be said that he who acquired the habit of
      liberality in the use of little, not yet having acquired the habit of
      magnificence but actually having the habit of liberality, is in proximate
      potency to acquiring the habit of magnificence with but slight effort.
      Therefore, because what is close to being had seems the same as being had,
      what is lacking only a little seems not to be lacking at all, as is said
      <i>Physics</i> 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 6. It should be said that in those words of the Apostle wisdom and
      knowledge are understood neither as intellectual virtues, which, however,
      have no connection, as will be said below, nor as gifts of the Holy
      Spirit, which are connected through charity, but insofar as they are of
      grace freely given: namely, insofar as someone abounds in knowledge and
      wisdom so that he can spur others to the end and to the knowledge of God,
      convincing those who object. Hence, the Apostle does not say that to one
      is given wisdom and to another knowledge, but to one is given the
      utterance of wisdom, to other the utterance of knowledge. Hence,
      Augustine, in <i>On the Trinity</i> 14, says that many believers are not
      strong in such knowledge although they might be strong in faith itself.
      Faith does not mean here unformed faith, as some say, because the gift of
      faith is common to all, but means the constancy of faith or its certitude,
      which sometimes abounds even in sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 7. It should be said that some hold that virginity is not the name of a
      virtue so much as of a more perfect state of virtue. But it is not
      necessary that anyone who has a virtue have it in its perfect grade.
      Therefore, chastity and the other virtues can be had without virginity.
      Or, if virginity is taken to be a virtue, this will be insofar as it
      implies a habit of mind by which one chooses to preserve virginity for the
      sake of Christ. And this habit can exist even in those who are not intact
      in the flesh, just as the habit of magnificence can be without a lot of
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 8. It should be said that the intellectual virtues are not
      interconnected and this for three reasons. First, because virtues
      concerned with different kinds of things are not related to one another,
      as has been said of the arts. Second, because in the sciences principles
      and conclusions are not convertible, such that whoever has the principles
      has the conclusions, as has been said about moral matters. Third, because
      intellectual virtue is not related to charity by which man is ordered to
      his ultimate end. Therefore, such virtues are concerned with particular
      goods, for example, geometry with measuring abstract entities,
      <i>Physics</i> with mobile things, and so on with the others. Hence, they
      are not connected for the same reason that imperfect virtues are not, as
      was said about in the body of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 9. It should be said that there are some virtues which order man with
      respect to the things that occur in human fife, such as temperance,
      justice, patience, and the like, and with them a man Must either, while
      actually performing the act of a virtue, simultaneously perform the acts
      of the other virtues and thus acquires all habits of the virtues together,
      or he must be good in the one and bad in the others. But in the latter
      case, he acquires a habit contrary to a virtue and consequently the
      corruption of prudence without which, as has been said above in the body
      of the article, the disposition acquired through the act of any virtue
      cannot properly be called a virtue. Such acquired habits bearing on things
      that commonly occur in fife are already virtually had as it were in
      proximate disposition if one has other virtues whose acts frequently occur
      in human intercourse, as was said of magnificence and magnanimity in the
      solution of argument 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 10. It should be said that acquired virtues are caused purposely, and
      must be all caused together in a man who proposes to himself to acquire
      one of them, nor are they acquired unless at the same time one acquires
      prudence with which all are had, as was said in the body of the article.
      But infused virtues are caused immediately by God, and they are also
      caused by charity as by their common root, as was said in the body of the
      article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 11. It should be said that in speculative sciences principles and
      conclusions are not convertible as they are in morals, as was said in the
      body of the article. Therefore, he who has one conclusion does not
      necessarily have another. If this were the case, it would be necessary
      that whoever has the principles has the conclusions, as the objection
      assumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 12. It should be said that Augustine is speaking there of imperfect
      virtues which are dispositions to the acts of virtues; hence, he himself
      proves their connection in <i>On the Trinity</i> 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 13. It should be said that virtues are connected by reason of the
      proximate principle of their genus, which is either prudence or charity,
      not by reason of the remote and common, which is God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 14. It should be said that among the intellectual virtues prudence has
      a special connection with the [moral] virtues by reason of its matter, for
      it is concerned with changeable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 15. It should be said that in heaven where hope and faith disappear
      certain more perfect things succeed them, namely, vision and
      comprehension, which are connected with charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 16. It should be said that In the angels and separated souls there is
      not temperance or fortitude with respect to such acts as are performed in
      this life, namely, moderating the passions of the sensible part, but to
      other acts, as is evident in Augustine <i>On the Trinity</i> 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 17. It should be said that the powers of the soul are not convertible
      with its essence, for although no power of the soul can exist apart from
      essence, yet the essence of the soul can exist without some powers, for
      example, without sight and hearing because of the corruption of the organs
      of which such powers are properly the acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 18. It should be said that a man is not the best because he has all the
      virtues but because he has them to the greatest degree.<br /></p

      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Article 3<br />
        Whether all virtues in a man are equal</span
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And it seems that they are not.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. For it is said in 1 Corinthians 13:13: “So there abide faith, hope and
      charity, these three, but the greatest of these is charity.” But greatest
      excludes equality. Therefore, the virtues in a man are not equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. But it will be said that charity is greatest in its act but not as a
      habit. On the contrary, Augustine says in On the trinio that in things
      that are not quantitatively large, to be greater is the same as to be
      better. But the habit of charity is better than the habits of the other
      virtues, because it attains God more, according to 1 John 4:16, “God
      abides in him, and he in God.” Therefore, charity as a habit is greater
      than the other virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, perfection precedes the perfectible, but charity is the
      perfection of the other virtues, according to Colossians 3:14: “But above
      all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection,” and in 1
      Timothy 1:5, we read that “the purpose of this charge is charity.”
      Therefore, it is greater than the other virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Moreover, that which has nothing of imperfection connected with it is
      more perfect or greater, because the whiter is that which has no black in
      it. But the habit of charity has no imperfection mixed with it, because
      faith is of things unseen and hope of what is not had. Therefore, charity,
      even as a habit, is more perfect and greater than faith and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Moreover, Augustine, in <i>The City of God</i> 19 says that, unless
      virtues are referred to God, they are vices. From which can be gathered
      that the notion of virtue is perfected by an ordering to God. But charity
      more proximately orders man to God than the other virtues, because it
      unites man to God, according to 1 Corinthians 6:17: “But he who cleaves to
      the Lord is one spirit with him.” Therefore, charity is a greater virtue
      than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Moreover, the infused virtues have their origin in grace which is their
      perfection. But charity participates in grace more perfectly than the
      other virtues do, because charity and grace inseparably accompany one
      another, but faith and hope can be without grace. Therefore, since charity
      is greater than the other virtues, not all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moreover, Bernard says in <i>On consideration</i> 1 that prudence is
      the matter of fortitude, because without prudence fortitude is
      precipitous. But that which is the principle and cause of something is
      greater and more powerful than it. Therefore prudence is greater than
      fortitude. Therefore, not all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Moreover, the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 5 says that justice is the
      whole of virtue, and the other virtues are by way of being parts. But the
      whole is greater than its part. Therefore, justice is greater than the
      other virtues, so not all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Moreover, Augustine, in his <i>Literal commentary on Genesis</i> 6,
      says that if everything in the universe were equal, not all of them would
      exist. But the virtues are all had at once because they are connected, as
      the preceding article showed. Therefore, not all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      10: Moreover, the vices are opposed to the virtues, but not all vices are
      equal. Therefore, neither are the virtues equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Moreover, the acts of virtue ought to be praised, but some people are
      more praised for one virtue than for another. Hence, Cassian says in
      <i>On the Cenobitic constitution</i> 5: One is adorned with the flowers of
      knowledge; another by reason of an uncommonly robust discretion; another
      is founded on the gravity of patience; another of humility; another is
      preferred for the virtue of continence. Therefore, not all the virtues in
      a man are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. But it will be said that this is an inequality on the side of acts,
      not of habits. On the contrary, according to the Philosopher in
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i> 1, things which are for the sake of something
      are intended at the same time as the end. But habit by definition is
      related to act. For habit is that by which one acts when the time is ripe,
      as Augustine says in <i>On the conjugal good</i>. Therefore, if the act of
      one virtue in a man is greater than the act of another, it follows that
      the habits too are unequal.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Moreover, Hugh of St. Victor says that acts augment habits. Therefore,
      if the acts of virtues are unequal, their habits too will be unequal.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Moreover, in morals the habit of virtue relates to its proper act just
      as in natural things form relates to its proper motion or action. But the
      more of form a natural thing has, the more it has of activity or motion;
      for example what is heavier falls more swiftly, and what is warmer heats
      better. Therefore, in morals too the acts of virtues can only be unequal
      if the habits of the virtues are unequal.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Moreover, perfections are proportionate to the things perfected. But
      virtues are perfections of powers of the soul which are unequal, since
      reason excels the lower powers which it commands. Therefore, the virtues
      are unequal.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Moreover, Gregory in <i>Morals on Job</i> 22 and in his fifteenth
      homily on Ezekiel says that blessed Job, because he saw how differently
      the highest gift was distributed among men, called the increments of
      virtues steps, since by them they rise and come to attain celestial
      things. But where there is increment and grades there is no equality.
      Therefore, the virtues are not equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Moreover, things so related that the increase of one causes the
      decrease of another must be unequal. But when charity increases something
      else seems to decrease, because the condition of heaven, where charity is
      perfected, is opposed to the condition of the wayfarer where faith plays a
      role. When one of opposites increases the other decreases. Therefore
      charity and faith cannot be equal, so not all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>ON THE CONTRARY</p>
    <p>
      1. Apocalypse 21:16, says: “And the city stands foursquare, and its length
      is as great as its breadth.” The virtues are meant by the walls of the
      city, according to the gloss. Therefore the virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, as Augustine says in <i>On the Trinity</i> 6, 4: “Those who
      are equal in fortitude are equal in prudence and temperance. For if you
      should say that some are equal in fortitude but prudence is greater than
      fortitude, it follows that the fortitude of one is less prudent. And then
      they will not be equal in fortitude since this one’s fortitude is more
      prudent. And you will find the same in the other virtues, if you apply the
      same consideration to all.” Thus, those who are equal in one virtue need
      not be equal in others, unless all virtues in the same man are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, Gregory says in commenting on Ezekiel that faith, hope, and
      action are equal. Therefore, by parity of reasoning, the other virtues are
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Moreover, Ezekiel 46:22, says that there are four measures of one
      thing, that is, of the way we advance to virtue, according to the gloss.
      But things that have the same measure are equal. Therefore, all are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Moreover, Damascene says that virtues are natural, and are equally in
      everyone in the mode of being of accident. Therefore, virtues insofar as
      they are accidents are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Moreover, the greater the virtue, the greater the reward. Therefore, if
      in man there were one virtue greater than another, it would follow that
      the same man is owed greater and lesser praise, which is absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moreover, if simply follows on simply, then more follows on more. But
      when one virtue is had, all are had, because the virtues are connected, as
      was said above in the preceding article. Therefore, if one virtue were had
      more, it would follow that all were had more. Therefore, it is necessary
      that all virtues are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESPONSE. It should be said that things are called equal or unequal with
      reference to quantity. For things one in quantity are called equal, things
      one in quality, similar, and things one in substance, the same, as is
      clear from <i>Metaphysics</i> 5. But quantity implies the note of measure,
      which is found first in numbers, secondarily in magnitudes, and in a
      different manner in the other genera, as is clear from
      <i>Metaphysics</i> 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in every genus that which is most simple and perfect is the measure of
      all else, as whiteness in colors and diurnal motion in movements, because
      a thing is more perfect to the degree that it approaches the first
      principle of its genus. From this it is evident that insofar as a thing’s
      perfection pertains to its measurement it is from the first principle; and
      so too its quantity; and this is what Augustine says in
      <i>On the Trinity</i> 8 that in things which are not great in quantity,
      the better and the greater are the same. But since the existence of any
      non-subsistent form consists in its being in a subject or matter, the
      perfection of its quantity is of two kinds: one, according to the proper
      notion of the species; another, according to the existence it has in the
      matter or subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the proper notion of species, the forms of different
      species are unequal, but in the same species some forms can indeed be
      equals and some not. The specific principle must be taken from something
      indivisible. For the difference in such a principle causes the species to
      vary and therefore by the addition or subtraction of this principle the
      species necessarily vary. Hence, the Philosopher says in
      <i>Metaphysics</i> 8 that the species of things are like numbers, in which
      a unit added or taken away changes the species.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some forms that are specified by something of their essence,
      such as all absolute forms, whether substantial or accidental, and in such
      it is impossible that in this mode one form be greater than another of the
      same species, for there is not one whiteness which, considered in itself,
      could be greater than another. But other forms are specified by something
      extrinsic to which they are ordered, as motion is specified by its term.
      Hence, one motion is greater than another as it is closer to or more
      distant from the term. Similarly, there are some qualities which are
      dispositions related to something, as health is a certain commensuration
      of humors ordered to the nature of the animal. Therefore, what is called
      healthy in a lion would be illness in a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health is not specified by the degree of commensuration but by the nature
      of the animal to which it is ordered, and it also happens that the same
      animal is at some times healthier than at others, as is said in Etbi. cs
      10, insofar, that is, as there can be different degrees of commensuration
      of humors which realize what is fitting to human nature. And the same is
      true of science which derives its unity from the unity of the subject, so
      that geometry can be greater in one person than another insofar as the
      former knows more conclusions conveying knowledge of the subject of
      geometry, which is extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly too according to the quantity of perfection such forms have
      insofar as they are in a matter or subject, forms of the same species can
      be unequal insofar as they inhere more or less, because, as has been said,
      the specific principle should consist in something indivisible. That is
      why substantial form is more or less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if a form is specified by something indivisible in its notion,
      it will not admit of more or less. No more does two or any other species
      of number specified by the addition of a unit admit of more and less; nor
      do figures which are specified by number, like triangle and quadrilateral;
      nor determined quantities like the cube and pyramid; nor finally numerical
      relations, such as double and triple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But forms which neither give species to their subject nor take their
      species from something indivisible in its notion, can inhere more or less;
      e.g., whiteness and blackness and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all this it is evident that there are two ways in which equality and
      inequality pertain to forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forms specifically the same are unequal neither in themselves, as if one
      form could be greater than another of the same species, nor according to
      existence, such that it inheres more in the subject. This is the case with
      all substantial forms. Other forms do not admit inequality as such but
      only insofar as they are in a subject, like whiteness and blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some forms admit inequality in themselves but not as they exist in a
      subject; for example, one triangle is greater than another, because the
      base of one is larger than that the other, although they are specified in
      the same way so the one surface is not more of a triangle than another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some forms that admit inequality both in themselves and insofar
      as they exist in a subject, for example, health, knowledge, motion.
      Motions are unequal either because they cover more or less space, or
      because the moved moves more swiftly. Similarly too one person’s knowledge
      is greater than another’s either because he knows more conclusions or
      because he knows the same things better. So too health can be unequal
      either because the level of commensuration in one is closer to fitting and
      perfect equality than in another, and better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the equality and inequality of virtues against this
      background, we can say that, considered in themselves, specifically
      different virtues can be unequal. For since virtue is a disposition of the
      perfect to the best, as is said in <i>Ethics</i> 7, that virtue is more
      perfect and greater which is ordered to the greater good. Given this, the
      theological virtues, whose object is God, are stronger than the others,
      and among them charity is the greatest because it unites us more closely
      to God, and hope is greater than faith, because hope moves the will to
      God, whereas by faith God is in a man by way of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the other virtues prudence is the greatest because it governs
      the others, and after it comes justice by which a man is well ordered not
      only in himself but also with respect to others. After this comes
      fortitude by which a man disregards the perils of death for the sake of
      the good. Then comes temperance which disregards the greatest of bodily
      pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the kind of inequality found in science cannot be found within a
      species of virtue. Although it is not of the definition of science that
      anyone having the science should know all its conclusions, it is of the
      definition of virtue that one having it is well ordered with respect to
      everything pertaining to that virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the perfection or quantity of virtue insofar as it exists in a
      subject, there can be inequality even in the same species of virtue when
      one of those having the virtue is better related than others to the things
      pertaining to that virtue; and this because of a better natural
      disposition, or greater exercise, or a better judgment of reason, or a
      gift of grace. Virtue does not give species to its subject, nor does it
      have anything indivisible in its notion,pace the Stoics who taught that no
      one has a virtue unless he has it to the maximum, so everyone would have
      the same virtue equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this does not seem to be the meaning of any virtue, because diversity
      in the manner of participating in the virtue is gauged by the factors just
      mentioned, which do not enter into the definition of any particular
      virtue, for example, chastity and the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, virtues can be unequal in different people, not only with
      respect to specifically different virtues but also to virtues specifically
      the same according as they exist in the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in one and the same man virtues are unequal according to the quantity
      or perfection a virtue has of itself; but according to the virtue’s
      quantity and perfection as existing in a subject, all virtues must, simply
      speaking, be equal for the same reason that they are connected, since
      equality is a kind of connection in quantity. Hence, some give as the
      reason for equality that the four cardinal virtues are understood as
      general modes of virtue, and this is the reason of Augustine in
      <i>On the Trinity</i> 6. It can be otherwise assigned according to the
      dependence of moral virtues on prudence and of all virtues on charity.
      Hence, where charity is equal, all virtues must be equal according to the
      formal perfection of virtue, and for the same reason prudence with respect
      to the moral virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a certain respect, however, virtues in one and the same person can be
      called unequal and not connected because of the power’s inclination to
      act, which is from nature or some other cause. Because of this some call
      them unequal in act, but this must be understood only as an inequality of
      inclination to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 1. This argument, it should be said, is based on the inequality of the
      virtues themselves, not of the inequality in the way they inhere, of which
      we are now speaking. For charity, as has been said, taken as such, is
      greater than all other virtues, and yet, as it grows in a person, all the
      other virtues grow proportionately, as the fingers of the hand are unequal
      to one another, yet grow proportionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 2-7. Similarly, it should be replied to the second, third, fourth,
      fifth, and sixth, and the seventh too, which in the same fashion argued
      that fortitude was greater than the other virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 8. Similarly to the eighth, which proceeds in the same way concerning
      justice; although justice is the whole of virtue, it is not justice in
      that sense that is called a cardinal virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 9. And we should answer the ninth objection in the same way, because it
      is insofar as the virtues are in man that greater or less perfection of a
      species of virtue is distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 10. Similarly it should be replied to the tenth, because in this way
      the vices too are unequal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 11. It should be said that a person is more praised for one virtue than
      for another because of a greater promptitude to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 12. It should be said that where there is a greater habit there should
      be a greater act according to the inclination of the habit. But there can
      be something in a man that either impedes action or disposes to it yet is
      incidentally related to the habit, as one might be impeded from exercising
      the habit of science because of drunkenness. Therefore, with respect to
      such impediments or aids to action there can sometimes be an increase in
      the act without an increase in the habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 13. It should be said that in acquired habits greater exercise causes a
      greater habit; however, a habit acquired through many acts can still be
      incidentally impeded and not produce its act, as was said in the body of
      the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 14. It should be said that in natural things where there is equal form
      there can be inequality of act due to some incidental impediment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 15. It should be said that powers are unequal in themselves, insofar as
      one power is more perfect than another according to its proper definition.
      And it has been said that virtues are unequal in this way too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 16. It should be said that virtues inhere proportionately, as has been
      said; hence, the condition of heaven is opposed to faith by reason of open
      vision which one does not attain through an increase of charity; so it
      does not follow that faith decreases as charity increases.
    </p>
    <p>Responses to arguments advanced On the Contrary:</p>
    <p>Ad 1-4. The answers are evident from what has been said.</p>
    <p>
      Ad 5. It should be said that Damascene understands the virtues to be
      equally in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 6. It should be said that the essential reward responds to the root of
      charity; therefore, even if it be granted that the virtues are not equal,
      still the same reward is owed to a given man because of the identity of
      charity.
    </p>
    <p>Ad 7. We concede this point.<br /></p

        Whether all the cardinal virtues remain in heaven</span
      >
    </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">And it seems that they do not.</span></p>
    <p>
      1. For Gregory says in <i>Morals on Job</i> 16 that the accidents disposed
      for life pass away with the body. Therefore, they do not remain in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, once the end is attained, that which was for the sake of the
      end is no longer necessary: When one has come to port the ship is no
      longer necessary. But the cardinal virtues are distinct from the
      theological virtues in this, that the theological virtues have the
      ultimate end for their object whereas the cardinal virtues are concerned
      with what is for the sake of the end. Therefore, when the ultimate end has
      been attained in heaven, the cardinal virtues will no longer be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, take away the end and that which is for the sake of the end
      ceases. But the cardinal virtues are ordered to the civil good, which is
      not in heaven. Therefore, the cardinal virtues will not remain in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Moreover, that which does not remain according to its proper species
      but only according to some common notion of the genus is said not to
      remain in heaven, as faith is said to disappear although knowledge, which
      is its genus, remains. But cardinal virtues do not remain in heaven
      according to their distinct proper species, for Augustine says in the
      <i>Literal commentary on Genesis</i> 12 that the one and complete virtue
      there is to love what you see. Therefore, the cardinal virtues do not
      remain in heaven, but pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Moreover, virtues are specified by their objects. But the objects of
      the cardinal virtues do not remain in heaven, for prudence is concerned
      with the doubtful matters on which counsel is taken, justice with
      contracts and judgments, fortitude with deadly perils, and temperance with
      desires for food and sex, none of which obtain in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It might be said that in heaven they will have other acts. On the
      contrary, the difference of a thing, which enters into its definition,
      specifies it, but act enters into the definition of habit, for Augustine
      says, in <i>On the conjugal good</i>, that a habit is that thanks to which
      one acts when the time is propitious. Therefore, if their acts are
      different, the habits will be specifically different.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Moreover, according to Plotinus, as reported by Macrobius, the virtues
      of the purged soul differ from political virtues. But the virtues of the
      purged soul would seem especially to be found in heaven, while the virtues
      of here below are the political virtues. Therefore virtues of this life
      win not remain but disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Moreover, the condition of the blessed differs from that of wayfarers
      more than do those of master and slave or of husband and wife in the
      present life. But, according to the Philosopher in Politics 1, the virtues
      of the master differ from the virtues of the servant, and similarly the
      husband’s from the wife’s. Therefore, the virtues of wayfarers and of
      those in heaven must differ even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Moreover, virtuous habits are needed to facilitate the possibility of
      acting. But this comes about sufficiently through glory. Therefore,
      virtuous habits are not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Moreover, in 1 Corinthians 13:8, the Apostle proves that charity is
      more excellent than the others because it does not pass away. But faith
      and hope, which pass away, are more noble than the cardinal virtues
      because they have a more noble object, namely, God. Therefore, the
      cardinal virtues pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Moreover, the intellectual virtues are more noble than the moral, as
      is evident in <i>Ethics</i> 6. But the intellectual virtues do not remain,
      because science is destroyed, as is said in 1 Corinthians 13:8. Therefore,
      the cardinal virtues will not remain in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Moreover, as is said in James 1:4, “And let patience have its perfect
      work.” But patience remains in heaven only as a reward, as Augustine says
      in <i>On the city of God</i> 14. Much less then will the cardinal virtues
      remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Moreover, some cardinal virtues, namely temperance and fortitude, are
      in the sense powers of the soul, for, as the Philosopher says in
      <i>Ethics</i> 3, they are of the irrational parts of the soul, as is
      evident from what the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 3. But the sense
      parts of soul are neither in angels nor in the separated soul. Therefore,
      such virtues are not in heaven, neither in the angels nor in the separated
      souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Moreover, Augustine says in <i>On the city of God</i> 13 that in
      heaven we will have leisure, will see, will love and praise. But to have
      leisure is an act of wisdom, seeing of intellect, loving of charity,
      praising of worship. Therefore, only these remain in heaven and not the
      cardinal virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Moreover, in heaven men win be like angels, as is said in Matthew
      22:30, but men do not become like angels by sobriety, since they do not
      use food and drink. Therefore, sobriety will not be in heaven, and by
      parity of reasoning no other such virtues.
    </p>
    <p>ON THE CONTRARY</p>
    <p>
      1. There is what is said in Wisdom 1:15: “For justice is perpetual and
      immortal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Moreover, Wisdom 7:7, says, “Wherefore I wished, and understanding was
      given me: and 1 called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me.”
      But nothing is more useful for men in this life and in heaven there will
      be the fullest participation in wisdom. Therefore, such virtues will be
      more fully had in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Moreover, virtues are spiritual riches. But there is a greater treasury
      of spiritual riches in heaven than in this fife. Therefore, such virtues
      abound in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      RESPONSE. it should he said that the cardinal virtues remain in heaven and
      will there have other acts than here, as Augustine says in
      <i>On the Trinity</i> 13, 8 & 9: “What justice now does in succoring the
      miserable, what prudence does in forestalling harm, what fortitude in
      resisting evils, what temperance in restraining depraved pleasures, win
      not be there where there is no evil at all, but by justice one will be
      subject to the ruling God, by prudence one will neither prefer nor equate
      any other good to God, by fortitude adhere to him most firmly, by
      temperance taking delight in no harmful desire.”
    </p>

      In evidence of which it should be known that, as the Philosopher says in
      <i>On the heavens</i> 1, virtue implies the ultimate of a power. Obviously
      there is a different ultimate in power in different natures, since higher
      natures have higher powers extending to more and greater things.
      Therefore, what is a virtue in one is not a virtue in another. For
      example, virtue in man bears on the most important things in human life;
      human temperance lies in not departing from reason because of great
      pleasures, but rather moderating them according to reason; human fortitude
      consists of standing firm against the greatest perils, deadly perils, for
      the sake of the good of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the ultimate of divine power is not in terms of these but of something
      higher pertaining to the infinity of his power. Therefore, divine
      fortitude is his changelessness; temperance, the turning of the divine
      mind on itself; prudence is the divine mind itself; and the justice of God
      is his perennial law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be noticed that the difference in ultimates can be understood in
      two ways. First, when they are in the same series of motion; second, when
      they are wholly disparate, and not ordered to one another. If different
      ultimates are understood in the first sense, they will cause different
      species of motion, but they will not diversify the species of the first
      motor because the same principle of motion moves from beginning to end.
      Take the example from building where the ultimate term is the completed
      form of the house; but other ultimates occur as different parts of the
      house are completed. Hence, as the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 10,
      one kind of movement terminates in the foundation of the house, another in
      the superstructure, and another in the complete edifice, yet the building
      art is one and the same and is the principle of these three changes. And
      it is the same with other movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we understand different ultimates, not in a continuous change, but
      wholly disparate, then both the changes and the moving principles are
      specifically different. For example, the art of building a house is
      different from the art of building a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, where the ultimate is specifically the same, there is the same
      species of virtue, and the same act or movement of the virtue. Clearly,
      the ultimate that temperance achieves in me and in you is specifically the
      same, namely, the moderating of the pleasures of touch. Hence, neither
      temperance nor its act is specifically different in me and in you. But
      where the ultimate that a virtue attains is neither specifically the same
      nor in the same series of movement, there must be a specific difference
      not only in the act of the virtue but also in the virtue itself. This is
      clear insofar as these virtues are said to be from God and from man. But
      where the ultimate of a virtue is specifically different (yet it s
      contained in the same series of movements, so that by the one another is
      achieved), the acts are specifically different but the virtue is the same.
      For example, the act of fortitude aims at one ultimate before the battle
      and another during battle and at yet another in victory: It is one kind of
      act to go to war, another to stand bravely in battle, and yet another to
      rejoice in the victory achieved. But it is the same fortitude, just as to
      love, desire, and rejoice are acts of the same power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear from what has been said in this article that, since our state
      in heaven is higher than our state in this life, the former attains
      something that is more perfectly the utmost. If then the utmost attained
      by virtues in this fife is ordered to the utmost attained by the virtues
      in heaven, they must be specifically the same virtues, although their acts
      will be different. If they are not taken as ordered one to the other, then
      they will not be the same virtues nor the same act nor the same habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is obvious that the acquired virtues, of which the philosophers
      spoke, are ordered only to perfecting men in civil fife, not as they are
      ordered to achieving celestial glory. Therefore, they taught that such
      virtues do not remain after this life, as Augustine reports of Cicero.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cardinal virtues, insofar as they are gratuitous and infused, as
      we speak of them now, perfect man in the present fife as ordered to
      celestial glory. Therefore, we must say that the habit of these virtues is
      the same here and there, but that the acts differ, for here they have acts
      appropriate to those striving for the ultimate end, but there they have
      acts which are appropriate to those who are already at rest in the
      ultimate end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 1. It should be said that such virtues perfect man in the active life,
      as on a kind of path leading to the term of contemplation in heaven; and
      they remain in heaven in the acts consummated by the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 2. It should be said that the cardinal virtues deal with what is for
      the sake of the end, notas if these might be their ultimate term, as the
      ultimate term of the ship is navigation, but insofar as they are ordered
      to the ultimate end by way of the things that are for the sake of the end.
      The temperance infused by grace does not have for its ultimate end the
      moderation of the pleasures of touch, but does this for the sake of
      celestial similitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 3. It should be said that the civil good is not the ultimate end of the
      infused cardinal virtues, of which we speak, but of the acquired virtues
      of which philosophers spoke, as was said in the body of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 4. It should be said that nothing prevents one and the same thing from
      being the end of different virtues or arts. The preservation of the civil
      good is the end and term of both the army and of positive law; hence both
      arts and virtues have acts concerned with it as a final good, but the
      military provides for the preservation of the civil good insofar as brave
      battles bring it about, whereas positive law rejoices in the same end
      insofar as the civil good is preserved by the ordinances of law.
      Therefore, the enjoyment of God in heaven is the end of all the cardinal
      virtues, and there each rejoices in it, insofar as it is the end of his
      acts. That is why it is said that in heaven there win be one virtue,
      inasmuch as one subject will have that in which all the virtues rejoice;
      however, there will be different acts and different virtues according to
      the different reasons for rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 5. It should be said that something is called the object of a virtue in
      two ways. In one way, as that to which the virtue is ordered as to its
      end, as the highest good is the object of charity and eternal happiness
      the object of hope. In another way, as the matter on which it acts, as
      tending from it to another, and in this way the pleasures of coition are
      the object of temperance, for temperance does not intend attachment to
      such pleasures but intends the good of reason by constraining them.
      Similarly, fortitude does not intend to dwell on perils but by overcoming
      them to attain the good of reason, and the same is the case with reason
      with respect to doubts, and of justice in respect to the necessities of
      this fife. Therefore, the greater the distance from these as the spiritual
      fife develops, the more perfect the acts of these virtues, because the
      foregoing words refer to these virtues by way of a term from which rather
      than of a term toward which, which specifies the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 6. It should be said that not every difference in acts points to a
      diversity of habits, as has already been said in the body of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 7. It should be said that the virtues of the purged soul that Plotinus
      defined can belong to the blessed, for there prudence only intuits the
      divine, temperance forgets desire, fortitude ignores the passions, and
      justice consists in a perpetual covenant with God. But the political
      virtues of which he speaks are ordered only to the civil good of the
      present life, as was said in the body of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 8. It should be said that the ultimate of the virtues of master and
      servant and of husband and wife are ordered to one another, such that from
      one there can be a transition to the other, so the case is not similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 9. It should be said that facilitation of the works of the virtues,
      that comes about or is perfected by glory, pertains to these habits of
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 10. It should be said that faith is ordered to a truth that is not seen
      and hope to something arduous not yet had, and these specify them.
      Therefore, although they are more excellent than the cardinal virtues with
      respect to their higher object, nonetheless they pass away because they
      are specified by what does not remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 11. It should be said that knowledge is not destroyed as a habit but it
      has another act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 12. It should be said that patience does not remain in heaven according
      to the act that it has in this life, namely, tolerating tribulations, but
      remains according to an act appropriate to the end, as was said of the
      other virtues in the body of the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 13. It should be said that some teach that the irascible and
      concupiscible, the subjects of temperance and fortitude, are in the higher
      part, not in the sensitive part of the soul. But this conflicts with what
      the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> 3, namely, that virtues are in the
      irrational parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others say that the powers of the sensitive part remain in the separated
      soul either according to potency alone or according to act. But this
      cannot be because the acts of the sensitive power cannot exist without the
      body; otherwise the sensitive soul of the brutes would be incorruptible,
      which is erroneous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the act is the object of the power; hence, such powers are
      connected; and thus after death they do not remain in the actually
      separated soul, save virtually, as in a root because the powers of the
      soul flow from its essence. But these virtues are in the irascible so far
      as their derivation goes, but according to origin and beginning they are
      in reason and will, because choice is the principle act of moral virtue
      and it is an act of rational appetite. But by a kind of application this
      choice terminates in the passions of the irascible and concupiscible
      because of temperance and fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 14. It should be said that all four of these pertain to each act of the
      cardinal virtues in the manner of end, insofar as celestial happiness
      consists of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ad 15. It should be said that sobriety does not make us like the angels
      according to the act of this life which bears on the matter of food and
      drink, but according to the act of heaven where it bears on the ultimate
      end, like the other virtues.
