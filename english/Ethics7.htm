    Just as it is rare for men to be godlike—when the Spartans greatly admired
    someone, they used to exclaim: “This man is divine”—so also is it rare for
    men to be brutish; it is especially among the barbarians that brutishness is
    found. Men become brutish both on account of sickness and loss of loved
    ones, and on account of the prevalence of vice among them (for this reason
    they receive a bad name).

    It surely seems that continence and perseverance are good and laudable; that
    incontinence and effeminacy are evil and censurable. The continent man seems
    to be identified with one who abides by reason; but the incontinent man,
    with one who disregards reason. Knowing that certain of his actions are
    evil, the incontinent man nevertheless does them because of passion. On the
    other hand, the continent man, knowing that his desires are evil, refuses to
    follow them because of the judgment of reason.

    Likewise the temperate man seems to be continent and persevering and,

    according to others he is not. Some even maintain that all intemperate men
    are incontinent and all incontinent men intemperate, without distinction;
    others distinguish them. Sometimes they say that the prudent man cannot be
    incontinent; sometimes that certain prudent and godlike men are incontinent.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1292. After the Philosopher has defined the moral and intellectual virtues,
    he now begins to consider certain things that follow from them. First [Lect.
    1] he treats continence, which is something imperfect in the genus of
    virtue. Next [Bk. VIII, Lect. 1], at “After the previous discussions etc.”
    (B. 1155), he treats friendship, which is a particular effect of virtue.
    Finally [Bk. X, Lect. 1], at “After these matters etc.” (B.1172 a 18), he
    treats the end of virtue. On the first point he does two things. First [I]
    he discusses continence and its contrary. Then [Lect. 11], at “The
    investigation of pleasure etc.” (B. 1152 b), he discusses pleasure and pain,
    which are their matter. He treats the first point from two aspects. First
    [I, A] he distinguishes continence from other things belonging to the same
    genus. Second [I, B], at “It surely seems etc.,” he investigates them. On
    the first point he does two things. First [I, A, 1] he distinguishes
    continence and its contrary from other things belonging to the same genus.
    Second [I, A, 2], at “But later we will have etc.,” he shows which of these
    have been discussed and which remain to be discussed. He handles the first
    point in a twofold manner. First [I, A, 1, a] he enumerates the censurable
    habits or dispositions in moral matters. Then [1, A, 1, b], at “And the
    contraries etc.,” he gives their contraries.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1293. He says first that, after the treatment of the moral and intellectual
    virtues (245-1291)—so that nothing in moral may be passed over—we must make
    another start, stating that there are three kinds of states to be avoided in
    moral practice: vice, incontinence, and brutishness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1294. So it is necessary to understand the difference between these things.
    As a good action is not without practical reason and right desire—we pointed
    this out in the sixth book (1269)—a perversion of these two faculties can
    bring about an act to be avoided in moral matters. If then perversity occurs
    on the part of the appetitive faculty so that the practical reason remains
    right, there will be incontinence-a condition that is present when a man has
    correct evaluation of what he ought to do or avoid but draws away to the
    contrary by reason of the passion of desire. But if the perversity of the
    appetitive faculty becomes so strong that it dominates reason, reason
    follows that to which the perverted desire inclines, as a kind of principle,
    considering it to be the ultimate end. Hence a man will perform evil actions
    by choice and for this reason he is called bad, as was noted in the fifth
    hook (1058). Therefore a disposition of this kind is given the name of vice.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1295. But we must consider that the perversion of a thing happens from the
    fact that the natural disposition of that thing is destroyed. Thus physical
    sickness occurs in man because the proportion of humors belonging to this
    man is destroyed. In a similar way perversion of the appetite, which
    sometimes perverts the reason, consists in the destruction of the
    commensuration of man’s desires. But a destruction of this kind does not
    consist in a thing that cannot be added to or taken from another, but it has
    a certain latitude, as is evident in the natural disposition of humors in
    the human body, forhuman nature can be kept in good health with more or less
    warmth. Likewise, a correct relation in human living is preserved by various
    degrees of desire.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1296. In one way an upset in harmony of this kind can arise without
    exceeding the limits of a human mode of living. Then it will simply be
    called incontinence or human vice, like sickness of the human body in which
    human nature is preserved. In another way the correct relation in human
    desires can be so corrupted that it exceeds the limits of a human mode of
    living like the inclinations of a dumb animal, a lion, or a pig. This is
    what is called brutishness. It is just as if the temperament of a man’s body
    had been changed into the temperament of a lion or a pig.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1297. Next [I, A, 1, b], at “And the contraries,” he gives the dispositions
    contrary to the qualities just mentioned. First [I, A, 1, b, il he points
    out two dispositions about which there is no question, noting that the
    contraries of two of these are obvious, since to vice virtue is opposed and
    to incontinence, continence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1298. Second [I, A, 1, b, ii], at “The contrary” he shows what is opposed to
    the third, viz., brutishness. First [ii, x], he sets forth his proposition.
    Then [ii, y], at “In this manner etc.,” he explains it. He says first that a
    virtue, which exceeds the usual human mode and can be called heroic or
    divine,.is appropriately said to be opposed to brutishness. Indeed the
    pagans gave the name hero to the souls of their illustrious dead who, to
    their way of thinking, were even deified.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1299. To understand this we must remember that the human soul is the middle
    substance between the higher or divine substances, with which it shares
    intelligence, and dumb animals with which it shares sensitive powers.
    Consequently: (1) the affections of the sensitive part are sometimes
    perverted in man almost like dumb animals (and this is called brutishness,
    exceeding human vice and incontinence); (2) the rational part in man is
    perfected and formed beyond the usual mode of human perfection after a
    likeness to separated substances (and this is called a divine virtue
    exceeding ordinary human virtue). Indeed the order of things is so arranged
    that the mean between different parts touches the two extremes. Likewise,
    then, in human nature there is something that comes into contact with what
    is above and something that comes into contact with what is below; yes, and
    something that occupies the middle.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1300. Then [ii, y], at “In this manner,” he clarifies his statement. First
    [y, aa] he explains that in man there is a kind of heroic or divine virtue.
    Next [y, bb] at “In fact neither vice etc.,” he shows that this virtue is
    the opposite of brutishness. He illustrates his first point with two
    examples. The first example is taken from Homer’ who presents Priam as
    claiming his son Hector was so exceedingly virtuous that he seemed rather a
    child of God than of man-beyond the ordinary ways of man something divine
    appeared in him. His second example illustrates the same point by a pagan
    proverb believing in the deification of heroes. This is not to be
    understood, Aristotle says, in the sense that human nature is changed into
    divine nature but in the sense that the excellence of virtue exceeds the
    usual hum-an mode. Obviously, then, there is in some men a kind of divine
    virtue, and he draws the conclusion that this virtue is the opposite of
    brutishness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1301. Next [y, bb], at “In fact neither vice,” he proves his proposition by
    two arguments. The first [bb, a’] is that vice and virtue are said to be
    proper to man. Hence, neither vice is attributed to a dumb animal who is
    inferior to man, nor virtue to God who is superior to man. But divine virtue
    is more noble than human virtue, which for us is called virtue in the
    fullest sense. On the other hand, brutish perversity is a kind of vice
    different from human vice, which is vice in the unqualified sense.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1302. He gives his second argument, at “Just as it is rare” [bb, b’], by
    asserting that people rarely have such great virtue, and those who do seem
    to be divine. Hence, when the Spartans—citizens of a particular section of
    Greece—marvelled at the virtue of someone, they exclaimed: “This man is
    divine.” Likewise in regard to the vice, brutishness is rarely found among
    men.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1303. He presents three ways by which men become brutish. The first from a
    pagan manner of life, e.g., some of the barbarians, who are not accustomed
    to reasonable laws, fall into the vice of brutishness because of general
    vicious habits; the second way, from sickness and privations, i.e., loss of
    loved ones, which makes them lose their minds and. become animals; the third
    way, from an excessive growth in vice, which shamefully stigmatizes them
    with the name of beast. Since this is true, as divine virtue is rarely found
    among the good, so brutishness is rarely found among the vicious, it seems
    that the two things correspond by opposition to one another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1304. Then [I, A, 2], at “But later we will have,” he shows what kind of
    matters has been discussed and what yet remains. First [I, A, 2, a] he
    connects the preceding with what follows. Next [I, A, 2, b], at “Here,
    however, we must etc.,” he explains his method of procedure. He says first
    that, later in this book (1401-1403), he will review this habit of
    brutishness. Previously in the treatment of the moral virtues (528-1108) he
    discussed vice, the opposite of virtue. But now (1306-1468) he must
    investigate incontinence, which is censured when concerned with pleasures,
    and effeminacy and voluptuousness, which are censured when concerned with
    pain. Likewise he must investigate continence, which is commendable when
    concerned with pleasure, and perseverance, which is commendable when
    concerned with pain, in such a way, however, that we do not consider these
    to be habits—either identified with virtue and vice, or different in kind.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1305. At “Here, however, we must” [I, A, 2, b] he explains his method of
    procedure. Here we must proceed in the usual way, i.e., after stating what
    seems probable in the preceding discussions, the difficulties should be
    presented. In this way everything that is most probable in the matters
    discussed will be explained; or if not everything—no human mind is capable
    of this—at least many of the principal things, The reason is that when
    difficulties are resolved in any question and probabilities appear as true,
    a sufficient study has been made.

    1306. Next [I, B], at “it surely seems,” he investigates continence and
    incontinence, perseverance, and effeminacy. According to his plan, [I, B, 1]
    he first proposes what is probable. Then [Lect. 2: I, B, 2], at “Someone can
    raise a doubt” (B.1145 b 22), he brings forward the difficulties. Last
    [Lect. 3: I], at “First then we must try,” he solves the difficulties (B.
    1146 b 8). On the initial point he does three things. First [B, 1, a] he
    proposes what is probable concerning continence and incontinence themselves.
    Second [B, 1, b], at “Likewise the temperate man etc,,” he proposes what is
    probable from a comparison of them with other dispositions. Finally, [B, 1,
    c], at “Besides, men are etc.,” he proposes what is probable about this
    matter. On the first point he makes three probable statements. The first
    pertains to the goodness and the badness of these dispositions. He says it
    is probable that continence and perseverance are good and laudable while
    incontinence and effeminacy are evil and censurable. The second statement
    pertains to the definitions of the things themselves. He says that the
    continent man seems to be identical with the reasonable person who judges
    what ought to be done reasonably; but the incontinent man seems to depart
    from reasonable judgment. The third pertains to the operations of these
    dispositions; he says that the incontinent man knows these particular
    actions are evil, and nevertheless does them out of passion. On the other
    hand, the continent man experiences desires that he knows are evil, and does
    not pursue them because of the judgment of reason. These two remarks are to
    be extended also to perseverance and effeminacy in connection with pains.

    1307. Then [B, 1, b], at “Likewise the temperate etc.,” he makes two
    probable statements from a comparison of these with other dispositions. The
    first is taken from a comparison of continence with temperance. He says that
    the temperate man seems to be continent and persevering. Some philosophers
    even hold that every continent and persevering man is temperate, but others
    hold that he is not. Regarding the opposites of these, some were of the
    opinion that all intemperate men are incontinent, conversely, in a confused
    way, i.e., without any distinction; but others, that these differ one from
    another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1308. The second statement is taken from a comparison with prudence. He says
    that sometimes it is maintained that the prudent man cannot be incontinent;
    sometimes, that certain prudent and godlike, i.e., gifted, men are
    incontinent.

    1309. Last [B, 1, c], at “Besides, men,” he states what is probable about
    their matter, remarking that at times some are called incontinent not only
    for their concupiscence but also in connection with anger, honor, and gain.
    These then are the six statements that are usually made about continence and
    incontinence, perseverance, and effeminacy.

        Certain philosophers, therefore, say this is not possible for a man with
        knowledge. It is strange, as Socrates thought, that something else
        should control and enslave a man’s knowledge. Indeed Socrates completely
        defended this line of reasoning, so that for him incontinence did not

        the best, except out of ignorance.

        It would appear from this then that imprudence joined with incontinence
        is a virtue. That a man performs actions contrary to what he judges is

        pleasures will appear better than one who acts from incontinence rather

        1310. After the Philosopher has stated the conclusions that seem
        probable concerning continence and incontinence, he now brings up doubts
        about all that he has said [I, B, 2], not, however, in the same order in
        which he has presented them. In fact, he proposed the doubts in that
        order in which they first fall under consideration. But on any subject a
        man first considers the general aspect, for example, whether it is good
        or bad. Next, he considers the peculiar nature of the thing; third, its
        operation. Fourth, he compares it to other things with which it agrees;
        fifth, to those things from which it differs. Finally he considers its
        external surroundings.

        1311. But in presenting the doubts he first submits what is more
        doubtful [2, a]. So, then, contrary to these six considerations [2, b],
        he places six doubts. The first doubt concerns the third probable
        statement about the act of the continent and the incontinent man. Next
        [2, c], at “Therefore... prudence,” he places the second doubt concerned
        with the fifth probable statement, which referred to a comparison with
        prudence. The third doubt r2, d], given at “Besides, if the continent
        etc.,” deals with the fourth probable statement, which relates to a
        comparison

        with temperance. The fourth doubt [2, e], given at “Moreover, if
        continence etc.,” concerns the second probable statement, which had to
        do with the definition of continence and incontinence. The fifth doubt
        [2, f], given at “Furthermore, he who does etc.,” is concerned with the
        first probable statement which treated the goodness and badness of
        continence and incontinence. The sixth doubt [2, g], given at “In
        addition, if continence etc.,” regards the sixth probable statement
        dealing with the matter of continence and incontinence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1312. In regard to the initial point he first proposes the doubt [2, a].
        On this he remarks that someone can doubt how a man who judges correctly
        is incontinent in doing the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1313. Then [2, b], at “Certain philosophers,” he pursues the doubt.
        First he objects to one part [b, i]. Next [b, ii], at “This teaching
        etc.,” he objects to the other part. Last [b, iii], at “Some accept
        etc.,” he rejects the solution of certain philosophers. He says first
        that some hold that it is impossible for a man to be incontinent when he
        judges correctly as a result of knowledge, because the stronger is not
        overcome by the weaker. Since then knowledge is a very powerful
        principle in man, it seems that, with knowledge present, something other
        would command knowledge and drag it along as a slave, although reason—of
        which knowledge is a perfection—should rather be in control and command
        the sensitive part as a slave (so the objection runs). This was the
        argument of Socrates. So rigidly did Socrates follow his own argument
        that incontinence might seem impossible. Indeed, he thought that no one
        who judges correctly does anything except: what is best; but that all
        sin occurs through ignorance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1314. Next [b, ii], at “This teaching,” he objects on the contrary that
        Socrates’ doctrine on this point calls into question matters that are
        evident. Obviously some people do what they know is wrong. If they
        really sin through ignorance, which happens while they are under
        passion’s influence, whether concupiscence or anger, an investigation of
        the kind of ignorance involved is highly desirable. Obviously, before
        passion supervenes, the incontinent man does not judge he should do what
        he later actually does in the heat of passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1315. At “Some accept”. [b, iii] he rejects the solution of ceitain
        philosophers. First [b, iii, x] he proposes their solution-that some
        accept one saying of Socrates, that “Knowledge is not influenced; but
        reject another, that “the only cause of sin is ignorance.” They admit
        nothing can conquer knowledge, as being better and more powerful.
        However, they do not admit that man can do nothing other than what he
        thinks is better. Consequently, their position is that the incontinent
        person overcome by sensual pleasures does not have knowledge but
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IP6. Then [b, iii, y], at “But if it is opinion,” he rejects this
        solution by saying that such an incontinent person has either a firm or
        a weak opinion. If firm, then the same argument seems valid for it and
        for knowledge, because we do not adhere to one less than to the
        other—more on this later (1137). On the other hand, if the opinion
        against concupiscence is not firm but irresolute, i.e., remiss and weak,
        happening to people who are dubious, it seems this should not be imputed
        a fault but rather deserves tolerance. The reason is that in the face of
        vigorous concupiscence a man does not cling to opinions feebly held.
        However, tolerance is not extended to vice or to any of the other
        censurable dispositions. Incontinence is one of these but fault is not
        entirely imputed to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1317. Next [2, c], at “Therefore” he raises a doubt about the comparison
        of continence with prudence, which was the fifth probable statement.
        First [c, i] he objects to one part, concluding from the premises that a
        man can be incontinent although he has prudence directing him to virtue.
        If the incontinent man has an opinion contending against evil
        desires—and the opinion is not weak, since in this way they would not be
        charged as a fault—it remains then that he has a strong opinion
        maintaining the contrary. But prudence is the strongest of opinions.
        Therefore, the incontinent person in a special way has prudence
        contending contrary to desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1318. Second [c, ii], at “This, how. ever,” he shows that this argument
        is not tenable for two reasons. First [c, ii, x], according to these
        lines of thought it will follow that a man may be prudent and
        incontinent at the same time. This seems impossible, for no one holds
        that to perform the basest actions willingly is an act of prudence. It
        was noted previously in the sixth book (1173) that a person who
        voluntarily sins in the matter of prudence is more blameworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1319. He presents the second reason [C, ii, y] at “In this connection.”
        It was explained previously (1208-1212) that the prudent man is not only
        cognizant that a particular is an ultimate, i.e., has a correct
        evaluation of individual practicables which he called ultimates in the
        sixth book (1214).but also has the other virtues, namely, the moral, as
        was likewise indicated in the sixth book (1172). Consequently it does
        not seem possible for any prudent person to act contrary to the virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1320. After this, at “Besides, if the continent man” [2, d], he gives
        advice on the comparison between continence and temperance, which was
        the fourth probable statement. To make this clear, he must discuss three
        other observations he has made. The first is that a man is called
        continent from the fact that he has vehement evil desires and,
        notwithstanding these, is not led astray contrary to reason. If this is
        true, the temperate man will not be continent, nor the continent man
        temperate, for the man who is completely temperate does not have evil
        desires in any vehemence. So, to have vehement evil desires is
        inconsistent with being temperate. However, once the preceding
        supposition be made, it would be necessary that the temperate man have
        evil desires if he were continent. The second of the three is that the
        continent man may have not evil desires but good ones. This being the
        case, it would follow that whatever habit forbids the pursuit of these
        is evil. But such a habit is continence. Therefore, not every kind of
        continence is desirable. The third of the three is that the desires the
        continent man has might not be vehement but weak and feeble. Then, if
        the desires are evil, to be continent will be worthy neither of respect
        nor praise; if they are evil and nevertheless weak, it will not be
        remarkable to resist them. Yet continence is looked upon as something
        great and worthy of respect. Therefore something unreasonable seems to
        follow, whatever one of the three positions be maintained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1321. Then [2, e], at “Moreover, if continence,” he raises a doubt about
        the very definition of continence, which was the second probable
        statement. First [e, i] he presents a difficulty about the nature of
        continence as stated above (1306): that the continent person is also the
        man who lives by reason. He says that if continence makes a man embrace
        every opinion, i.e., persuades him to abide by every opinion and not
        depart from any, it will follow that some kind of continence is evil;
        for an opinion can be false. And it is good to reject such a view. Hence
        it is evil to be governed by it, although continence should be praised
        as something good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1322. Next [e, ii], at “Likewise, if,” he makes three objections to the
        notion of incontinence he has already given (1306), namely, that the
        incontinent man is inclined to abandon reason. The first [e, ii, x] is
        that if incontinence abandons every opinion or reason, it will follow
        that some kind of incontinence is good; nevertheless incontinence should
        always be censured as an evil thing. This is so because a conjectural
        reason may prompt the doing of an evil action which it is good to avoid.
        He gives an illustration. The poet Sophocles narrates that Neoptolemus,
        who fought in the Trojan war, was persuaded by Ulysses to lie to
        Philoctetes for a reason that seemed honorable. Afterwards, however, he
        did not retain the opinion, of which he had been persuaded, because
        lying was grievous and painful to him; and in this there is something
        praiseworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1323. He presents the second objection [e, ii, y], at “Further, the
        sophistic,” stating that the sophistic argument, because misleading,
        i.e., concluding falsely, is itself a doubt or rather a cause of doubt.
        The explanation is that the sophists, in order to appear wise, want to
        infer indubitable conclusions. But when they succeed by argument, the
        syllogism they devise causes doubt; for the mind of the hearer remains
        in suspense, since on the one hand the mind does not wish to abide by
        what reason infers, because the conclusion is not acceptable, and on the
        other hand, it cannot proceed to the opposite because it does not have
        the solution of the argument within its power. Nevertheless, the mind is
        not to be blamed because it did not abide by the reasoning which it did
        not know how to resolve. Therefore, it does not seem there is
        incontinence in abandoning any reason whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1324. He gives the third objection at “It would appear” [e, ii, z]. If
        to abandon any reason whatever is incontinent, it follows from this
        argument that imprudence joined to incontinence is a virtue. Thus virtue
        will be composed of two vices, which is impossible; and it seems that
        what was said will follow, that incontinence is the reason why someone
        performs actions contrary to his judgment. But the judgment he makes
        that good actions are bad and that he ought not to do them, is the fruit
        of imprudence. Hence it will follow that he performs good and not evil
        actions, which seems to belong to virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1325. Then [2, f], at “Furthermore, he who does evil,” he raises a doubt
        about the goodness and badritss of continence and incontinence. It seems
        that one who performs evil actions because he is persuaded they are good
        and consequently pursues and chooses pleasures as good in themselves (as
        the intemperate man does) is better than another who performs evil
        actions, not because of reasoning by which he is deceived, but because
        of incontinence. The man who has been persuaded seems to be more
        corrigible because he can easily be dissuaded from his present view. But
        the incontinent man does not seem to be helped by any good advice. Nay
        rather he seems to be indicated in the proverb that if water, whose
        drinking refreshes the thirsty, chokes the drinker, what can he drink?
        In a similar way, if a man performs evil actions as a result of
        conviction or deception, he will cease to do them when dissuaded, i.e.,
        when the persuasion is withdrawn, as thirst ceases when a drink of water
        is taken. But in the present case the counselled incontinent man even
        believes some actions are right, and notwithstanding does different
        things. Hence the good water of advice does not help but chokes him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1326. At “In addition, if incontinence” [2, g], he raises a doubt about
        the matter of continence and incontinence, which was the sixth probable
        statement. He affirms that if continence and incontinence concern not
        only concupiscence but anger, wealth, and everything of this kind, he
        will be unable to determine who is incontinent without qualification.
        Indeed, no one can be found who will have all the varieties of
        incontinence. But we do say that some are absolutely incontinent.
        Therefore, the assertion previously made (1225), that continence and
        incontinence concern everything does not seem to be true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1327. Last [3], at “Such then,” he sums up in conclusion by indicating
        that such are the doubts occurring in the matter under discussion. We
        must solve some of these doubts by showing that they tend to falsehood;
        others we can leave inasmuch as they are quasi conclusions. When we find
        the truth about a doubtful point, then we have a genuine solution to a
        doubt.

        Neither is a man said to be continent or incontinent only in this (for
        then continence would be the same as intemperance), but in conducting

        It makes no difference in the present argument to say that it is real
        opinion and not objectively verified knowledge against which people act
        incontinently, for there are some who have only opinion yet are not in
        doubt, for they think they know with certitude. If then it is said that
        men with opinion rather than objectively verified knowledge act contrary
        to conviction because they cling feebly to their views, we answer that
        this knowledge does not differ from opinion in this matter. There are

        Since we say that a man knows in two ways (for he is said to know both
        when he uses his knowledge and when he has the habit of knowledge
        without using it), it makes a great deal of difference in doing what he
        should not: whether a man has the habit of knowledge, but is not using
        it; or has the habit, and is using it. His situation seems difficult in
        the latter case, but not if actual consideration is lacking.

        Yet, since we must use two modes of propositions, there is nothing to
        hinder a man who knows both from operating against the knowledge he uses
        about the universal but not against the knowledge he has about the
        particular. This is so because operations concern particulars. But the
        universal is understood differently: in one way as it is in itself and
        in another as it is in a particular case. Thus “Dry foods are good for
        all men,” and “I am a man,” or “Such and such a food is dry.” But it is
        possible that a man may not know such a universal either habitually or
        in a particular case. There is so much difference in the modes of
        knowing that it should not seem unreasonable for one who acts
        incontinently to know in one manner, yet it would be astonishing for him
        to know in another.

        In addition, a mode of knowing different from those already discussed is
        found in man, for we see a difference in one knowing by way of habit and
        in a particular situation. Hence a man seems in some way to have and not
        to have knowledge, as is evident in one who is asleep or drunk. It is in
        this manner that those under the influence of the passions react.
        Indeed, anger, sexual desires, and certain passions of this kind clearly
        change the body; some even lead men to madness. Obviously then we must
        say that the incontinent are disposed in a similar way.

        The use of learned terms by the incontinent is not a sign that they
        operate by a habit of knowledge. In fact men under the influence of
        these passions mouth demonstrations and declaim the sayings of
        Empedocles; and youths beginning to learn prate doctrine but do not
        really know what they are talking about, for doctrine must become
        connatural to be known and this takes time. So then we must conclude
        that the incontinent in speaking this way are, as it were, pretending.

        Furthermore, someone may want to consider the reason in terms of man’s
        nature. There is one judgment that is universal; and another concerned
        with particulars that are properly the objects of sense. However, since
        one formal reason is present in such judgments, the mind necessarily
        comes to a conclusion, while in the practical order it must immediately
        be directed to operation. Thus, if a man must taste everything sweet,
        and this thing is sweet, such as wine or something of the sort, he will
        at the same time have to taste it when he is able, unless he be
        prevented from doing so.

        Now one universal judgment may say “You must not taste,” and another
        that “Every sweet is pleasant.” At the same time a particular judgment
        may say “This is sweet.” In such a case the sweet can be taken when
        appetite is present. Reason indeed declares that the particular thing is
        to be avoided but the appetite leads to it because the appetite can move
        any part of the soul. Hence it happens that a man may act incontinently
        contrary to reason and judgment.

        But this contrariety is not on the part of the reason itself but is
        incidental. It is appetite and not judgment which is in opposition to
        right reason. Because of this, dumb animals are not said to be
        incontinent since they do not have universal judgment but only
        imagination and memory of particulars.

        How this ignorance is dissipated and an incontinent man recovers correct

        But the ultimate proposition is a judgment according to sensible
        knowledge, and is directive of our actions; and the man who is under the
        influence of passion does not have this judgment at all, or has it in
        such a way that he cannot know actually, but speaks in these matters the
        way a drunken man repeats the words of Empedocles. Since the ultimate
        term is neither a universal nor—what amounts to the same thing—an object
        of scientific knowledge in the manner of a universal (in the practical
        order), what Socrates was looking for seems to follow. Indeed passion is
        not present with knowledge taken in the proper sense; and it is not this
        knowledge but that of the sensible which is dragged along by passion. We
        have discussed whether a person when he acts incontinently has knowledge
        or not, and how it is possible for him to have knowledge.

        1328. After the Philosopher has stated certain probable propositions and
        raised doubts about each, he now comes to the solutions. We should note
        he does not present the solutions in the same order in which he
        previously either stated the propositions or introduced the doubts, but
        according as the plan of the discussion requires, i.e., as the solution
        of one doubt depends on another. First [I] he states his intention; and
        then [II], at “In the beginning etc.,” he carries out his intention. He
        says first that, in order to solve these doubts, we must consider at the
        outset whether or not some people can be incontinent knowingly; and if
        so, in what way they know. This doubt is solved first because its
        solution belongs to the question whether or not there is incontinence.
        We stated previously (1315) that Socrates’ contention seemed to be that
        there was no incontinence. But first we must consider whether each
        (continence and incontinence) exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1329. Then we must consider in what kinds of matter we ought, to say a
        man is continent or incontinent; whether in every form of pleasure and
        pain or only in some specific forms. This doubt is solved in the second
        place, although it was proposed in the sixth place (1325), because the
        beginning of an investigation of the nature of any habit is the
        consideration of its matter, as is obvious in the manner of procedure
        followed by Aristotle in the preceding discussions. Since the continent
        man and the persevering man differ materially, we must ask at the same
        time whether they differ conceptually. Likewise, we must give our
        attention to all other matters having a connection and agreement with
        this consideration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1330. Next [II], at “In the beginning,” he begins to solve the doubts
        previously raised. First [II, A] he settles the question on the
        existence of continence and incontinence by solving the first doubt that
        was raised about the third probable statement. Second [Lect. 4, I], he
        determines the matter of continence and incontinence by solving the
        sixth doubt that was raised about the sixth probable statement. Then,
        because temperance and continence agree in matter, at the same time he
        here explains the difference between temperance and continence in
        solving the third doubt that was raised about the fourth probable
        statement. Likewise he shows whether the intemperate or the incontinent
        man is worse, in solving the fifth doubt that was raised about the first
        probable statement. This second part begins at “Now, we must consider
        etc.” (B. 1147 b 20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1331. Third [Leci. 9: I] he explains the nature of continence and
        incontinence in solving the fourth doubt that was raised against the
        second probable statement. Likewise, with this he answers the second
        question that was asked about the fifth probable statement, showing that
        a prudent man cannot be incontinent. This third part begins at “Can a
        man be called etc.” (B 1151 a 29). On the first point [II, A] he does
        three things. First [A, 1] he presents in advance certain notions which
        are necessary for a solution. Then [A, 2], at “It makes no difference
        etc.,” he rejects a false solution. Third [A, 3], at “Since we say
        etc.,” he gives the true solution, In regard to the initial point he
        does two things. First [1, a] he states his intention, and then [1, b ]
        at “Neither is a man etc.,” he carries it out.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1332. He says first [1, a, i] that to determine these questions our
        primary effort must be directed towards the knowledge of two points. The
        first point is whether the continent and the incontinent differ
        specifically in their subject, i.e., in having limited matter with which
        they are concerned, as mildness differs specifically from the fact that
        it has to do with anger; or also in the manner, i.e., in the way of
        dealing with any matter, as prudence deals with all moral matter but not
        in the same way as (other) moral virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1333. In explanation of his inquiry, he adds that we must consider
        whether a man may be called incontinent only because he is concerned
        with a particular matter, or even only because he is concerned about the
        whole of some matter without distinction; or whether a man may be called
        continent or incontinent not only from the one or the other but also
        from both, i.e., from a limited manner and a limited matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1334. Another thing that we ought to consider beforehand is whether or
        not continence and incontinence deal with all kinds of matter or with a
        limited matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1335. Then [1, a, ii], at “Incontinence in the unqualified sense,” he
        determines his statements: first [ii, x] the second statement, saying
        that continent and incontinent in the unqualified sense are not applied
        to anyone in all matters but in that limited matter in which he is
        temperate or intemperate, viz., in concupiscence and pleasures of touch.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1336. Second [ii, y (and “b”)], at “Neither is a man,” he determines the
        first statement, saying that someone is said to be continent or
        incontinent not alone in this, i.e., in respect of some limited matter
        (for thus he would be identified with the temperate or intemperate man
        since they deal with the same matter), but a person is said to be
        incontinent in conducting himself in such a manner, i.e., from the fact
        that he is concerned with limited matter in a certain way. The reason is
        that this man, viz., the intemperate, is led to commit sin by choice, in
        a manner judging that a pleasurable object presented to him always is to
        be pursued or accepted. But the incontinent man does not engage in this
        reasoning process; nevertheless, he pursues the pleasurable object when
        it is present to him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1337. Next [A, 2], at “It makes no difference,” he rejects a false
        solution that he has already treated (1316). He states that it does not
        make any difference in the present argument to say that the cognition,
        contrary to which some act incontinently, is real opinion but not
        knowledge. The fact is clear that some who act incontinently do not have
        a weak conviction, like people hesitating, but judge themselves to know
        certainly that against which they act. If then someone means that they
        are men with opinion rather than knowledge acting contrary to their
        convictions because their adherence to their judgments is ineffectual
        and feeble, our observation is that in the present instance knowledge
        does not differ from opinion. Some people are not less tenacious of even
        false opinions than others are of true knowledge. This can be seen in
        Heraclitus, who was so firmly convinced that everything is in perpetual
        motion and that no truth remains long in things, that at the end of his
        life, he was unwilling to talk lest truth should be changed in the
        meantime, but only wagged his finger to indicate something, as is
        related in the fourth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> (Ch. 5, 1010 a
        12-13; St. Th. Lect. 12, 683-684).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1338. At “Since we say” [A, 3] he gives the true solution. First [3, a]
        he solves the doubt by some distinctions, then [3, b], at “Furthermore
        etc,” by the nature of practical science. In regard to the first point
        he makes two distinctions. The first [3, a, i] is that we say a man
        knows in two ways: (1) by having a habit he does not use, e.g., the
        geometrician not studying questions of geometry; (2) by using his
        knowledge in actually considering its truths. It makes a big difference
        whether someone doing what he ought not has the habit but does not use
        it, or has the habit and does use it in thinking. It certainly seems
        hard for a man to act contrary to what he is actually considering. But
        it doesn’t seem hard for someone to act contrary to what he knows in an
        habitual way but is not actually considering.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1339. Next [3, a, ii], at “Yet, since,” he makes his second distinction.
        He says, since practical reason uses two modes of propositions, viz.,
        the universal and the particular, there is no apparent obstacle in a man
        knowing both propositions in an habitual way but actually considering
        only the universal and not the particular, and operating contrary to the
        knowledge. This is so because operations are concerned with particulars.
        Hence, if a man does not consider the particular it is not astonishing
        that he acts contrary to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1340. We should note, however, that the universal can be taken in two
        ways. In one way as it is in itself, as in the example “Dry things are
        good for every man”; in another way as it is in a particular object, for
        instance, “This is a man,” or “That food is dry.” Therefore it is
        possible that a man knows, both habitually and actually, the universal
        considered in itself but either he does not grasp the universal
        considered in this particular object, i.e., the universal is not known
        in an habitual way, or he does not bestir himself, i.e., the universal
        is not actually known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1341. Therefore what appeared impossible to Socrates according to these
        various modes of knowing differs so much that it does not seem
        unreasonable for a man, who acts incontinently, to have one kind of
        knowledge, viz., universal alone or even particular-if it is habitual
        but not actual. But it would seem unreasonable for the man who acts
        incontinently to have another kind of knowledge, i.e., actual, concerned
        with the particular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1342. Then [3, a, iii], at “In addition,” he makes a third distinction.
        First [iii, x] he sets forth a difference. Next [iii, y], at “The use of
        learned terms etc.,” he refutes an objection. First he speaks of another
        mode of knowing in man, over and above the modes discussed. That someone
        should know by way of habit and not by way of act seems to be understood
        differently. Sometimes a habit is so responsive that it can go into act
        immediately when a man wishes. But other times the habit is so bound
        that it cannot go into act. Hence in one sense a man seems to have a
        habit and in another sense not to have it, as is evident in one
        sleeping, a maniac, or a drunkard. Men are disposed in this way when
        under the influence of the passions. We see anger, sexual desires, and
        certain Vassions of this kind obviously change the body externally, for
        example, in causing body heat. Sometimes such passions generate so much
        heat that they lead people to insanity. So, obviously, the incontinent
        are disposed somewhat like those asleep, maniacs, and drunkards, who
        have the habit of practical science impeded in regard to particulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1343. At “The use of learned terms” [iii, y] he refutes an objection.
        Someone could object against the statement made that the incontinent
        sometimes use terms dealing with knowledge and with the particular. So
        it seems they do not have a habit that is held in check. But Aristotle
        refutes this objection, saying that their use of scientific terminology
        is not a sign that they have an active habit; and he illustrates this by
        two examples.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1344. The first is that even men who areunder the influence of the
        passions just mentioned, e.g., inebriated and demented, mouth
        demonstrations in geometry, for instance, and declaim Empedocles’
        sayings, which are difficult to understand because he wrote his
        philosophy in meter. The second example is of children who, when they
        begin to learn, put together words that they utter without any real
        understanding of what they say. To understand, it is necessary that
        those things that a man hears become, as it were, connatural to him in
        order that they may be impressed perfectly on his mind. For this a man
        needs time in which his intellect may be confirmed in what it has
        received, by much meditation. This is true also of the incontinent man,
        for even if he says: it is not good for me now to pursue such a
        pleasure, nevertheless, in his heart he does not think this way. So then
        we must judge the incontinent in saying these words are pretending, as
        it were, because they think one thing in their hearts and reveal another
        by their words.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1345. Next [3, b], at “Furthermore,” he solves the proposed doubt by the
        natural process of practical science in applying the preceding
        distinctions to what he proposed. First [3, b, i] he determines the true
        sense of the question. Second [3, b, ii], at “But the ultimate,” he
        answers Socrates’ objection. Regarding the initial point he does two
        things. First [b, i, x] he sets forth the natural process of practical
        science in action. Second [b, i, y], at “Now one universal,” he shows
        the obstacle which faces the incontinent man. He says first that if we
        wish to consider why the incontinent man can act contrary to his
        knowledge by the natural process of practical science, we must take into
        consideration the two judgments in this process. One is universal, for
        example, “Every dishonorable act must be avoided”; the other, singular,
        is concerned with objects which properly are known by sense, for
        instance, “This act is dishonorable.” But, since there is one formality
        underlying these judgments, a conclusion necessarily follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1346. However, in speculative matters the mind merely draws the
        conclusion, while in practical matters it goes into operation
        immediately. Thus, if the universal judgment is that we must taste every
        sweet thing but the particular judgment that this (some particular
        object presented) is sweet, the man able to taste immediately tastes if
        nothing prevents. So runs the syllogism of the temperate man who does
        not permit concupiscence to have mastery over reason pointing out every
        dishonorable act must be avoided. The same goes for the syllogism of the
        intemperate man. His reason does not resist the proposal of
        concupiscence which inclines to this: that every pleasure is to be
        seized.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1347. Then [b, i, y], at “Now one universal,” he explains how fault
        occurs in the incontinent man. First [y, aa] he shows that there is a
        restraining factor in this man. Next [y, bb], at “But this contrariety,”
        he explains the reason. Last [y, cc], at “How this ignorance etc.,” he
        explains how this restraint ceases. On the first point the proper
        consideration is this-reason in the incontinent man is not so completely
        overcome that he is without genuine knowledge of the universal. Put it
        this way. The reason proposes a universal judgment forbidding an
        inordinate tasting of something sweet, e.g., it says that nothing sweet
        should be tasted outside a certain time. But the appetite proposes that
        every sweet thing is pleasant, something in itself desired by
        concupiscence. And, since in a particular case concupiscence may bind
        reason, the proposal is not accepted under universal reason so as to say
        also that this is outside the time; but it is taken under the universal
        aspect of concupiscence so as to say this is sweet. So the conclusion of
        the operation follows. In this syllogism of the incontinent man there
        are four propositions, as already indicated (1346).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1348. That the process of practical reason sometimes occurs in this way
        is evident from the fact that when concupiscence waxes strong, reason
        declares by a universal judgment that a particular desirable thing is to
        be avoided, as we just mentioned (1347)But concupiscence inclines to the
        appetible object by freely proposing and accepting it without the
        prohibition of reason, now rendered impotent. Concupiscence can be so
        vehement it can sway any part of the soul, even reason itself if reason
        does not make a strong effort to resist. Thus the term of the operation
        takes place, viz., a man may act incontinently contrary to reason and
        universal judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1349. At “But this contrariety” [y, bb] he explains the reason for this
        opposition. He states that the present contrariety does not happen from
        reason itself, as in uncertain people, but only incidentally so far as
        concupiscence is opposed to correct universal reason. In fact there is
        no judgment in itself opposed to right reason, as some philosophers have
        maintained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1350. From this he infers a corollary, that dumb animals are not called
        continent or incontinent, for they do not make a universal judgment
        which is the foundation of rational action, to which concupiscence is
        opposed; for brutes are moved only by imagination and memory of
        particulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1351. Next [y, cc], at “How this ignorance,” he explains how this
        opposition ceases. He says that the problem of dissipating an
        incontinent man’s ignorance about the particular and of his recovery of
        correct knowledge is the same as in the case of one inebriated or
        asleep. Their passions are dispelled when some bodily change occurs.
        Likewise, since the body is changed by the soul’s passions, like
        concupiscence and anger, this physical change must cease for a man to
        return to a sound mind. Hence this problem is not proper to our
        investigation but rather we ought to hear it discussed by physiologists,
        i.e., physicians (<i>naturalibus</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1352. Then [3, b, ii], at “But the ultimate,” in accord with the
        premises he refutes the argument of Socrates, saying that the
        proposition and the ultimate, i.e., the particular, judgment is made
        according to sensible knowledge and is directive of actions concerned
        with particulars. But a man under the influence of passion either does
        not have this judgment or premise at all as a habit, or has a restrained
        habit so that he cannot know actually but speaks in these matters in the
        way that an inebriate repeats the verses of Empedocles. Since, then,
        these things are true, and since the universal, which is known by
        science, is not the ultimate term of practical operations, what Socrates
        held seems to follow. It is evident from previous statements that
        passion is not present with the principal knowledge that deals with the
        universal, since it is found only in the particular. it is not the
        knowledge of the universal but only the evaluation of the sensible,
        which is not so excellent, that is dragged along by passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1353. Finally, he summarizes the questions discussed: whether a person
        when he acts incontinently has knowledge or not, and how it is possible
        for him to have knowledge.

        Therefore, people who go to excess in these things contrary to right
        reason in them, are not called incontinent simply but with the added
        note that they are incontinent in matters of money, gain, honor, or
        anger; as if there were others absolutely incontinent and the former are

        pursues excesses and avoids discomforts without passion, or at least
        only with mild passion. What would such a person do were he to
        experience youthful lust and the serious discomforts from lack of
        necessities?

        Some kinds of desires and pleasures are in the category of the noble and
        good. (Some pleasures are by nature desirable; others, just the reverse;
        and still others are in between, according to the previous division, as
        in the case of money, profit, victory, and honor.) But in all the
        intermediate kinds, people are not blamed because they are affected by a

        Hence, those who in an unreasonable manner possess or pursue any of the
        things that are noble and good by nature, for example, people having
        more zeal than they should about the acquisition of honor, or the care
        of their children or parents (are not blamed as evil). Certainly these
        operations are good, and people solicitous about them are praised.
        However, a kind of vicious excess can exist in these matters, for
        example, if someone should rebel against the gods as Niobe did, or
        should act towards his parents as did Satyrus called “father-lover,” who
        seemed to have behaved rather foolishly in this matter.

        So then there is no vice in these pleasures because, as was said, each
        of them is naturally desirable in itself; only their excesses are evil
        and to be avoided. Likewise there is no incontinence in them, for
        incontinence not only is a thing to be avoided but is something
        censurable.

        But people speak according as there is a resemblance to passion, putting
        limits on incontinence about each thing, for example, a bad doctor or a
        poor actor whom they would (not) term a bad person without
        qualification. The same goes for the things called bad in this way,
        because badness is predicated of any of them only in an analogous sense.
        So in regard to conti- 10 nence we must judge that only to be
        incontinence and continence (unqualifiedly) which concerns the same
        matters as temperance and intemperance. But we predicate incontinence of
        anger because of a resemblance, and for this reason we qualify, adding
        that a man is incontinent in anger as we say he is incontinent in honor
        and gain.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1354. After the Philosopher has shown that a man can perform evil
        actions contrary to the knowledge he possesses (by this we can know
        whether continence and incontinence exist), he here determines the
        matter of continence and incontinence. First he shows the matter of
        each; then [Lect. 7, I], at “Continence and incontinence etc.” (B. 1150
        a 9), he compares them with other habits dealing with the same matter.
        To clarify the first point he employs a twofold procedure. First [I] he
        declares his proposition. Second [II], at “It is obvious etc.,” he
        carries out his proposition. The reasoning employed is this: in
        proposing the sixth doubt, it was already stated that if continence and
        incontinence were concerned with all matters, no one would be
        incontinent in an unqualified sense. So, in an effort to solve this
        doubt, he presents two questions for consideration. The first is: can
        anyone be incontinent without qualification or is everyone said to be
        incontinent in a particular way? The second question is, if a man is
        totally incontinent, in what kind of matter is he so incontinent?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1355. Then [II], at “It is obvious,” he carries out his proposition.
        First [II, A] he presents the general matter, saying it is evident that
        the continent and the incontinent and the persevering and the effeminate
        are said to be concerned with pleasure and pain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1356. Next [II, B], at “But of the objects,” he investigates the
        specific matter of these states. First [B, 1] he shows how continence
        may he used in different ways about different pleasures. Second [Lect.
        VI; B, 2], at “Now we will consider,” he compares the kinds of
        incontinence in different pleasures with one another (B. 1149 a 24). On
        the initial point he does two things. First [1, a] he shows how a man
        may be called continent or incontinent in different ways according to
        the difference in human pleasures among themselves; then according to
        the difference of human pleasures with regard to what is bestial [Lect.
        5; 1, b] at “Of natural pleasures etc.” (B. 1148 b 15). In support of
        the first statement he uses a double process. First [a, i] he explains
        his proposition. Second [a, ii], at “Some kinds etc.,” he clarifies some
        statements he had made. The first point demands three clarifications.
        First [i, x] he distinguishes human pleasures. Next [i, y], at
        “Therefore, people etc.,” he shows how in these pleasures a man is
        called continent or incontinent in different ways. Last [i, z], at “For
        this reason,” he infers certain corollaries from the premises.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1357. He says first of all that, of those objects giving us pleasure,
        some are necessary for human life; others are unnecessary but,
        considered in themselves, desirable for men, however much they are
        capable of excess and defect. He designates as necessary certain bodily
        requirements such as those pertaining to food, drink, sex, and material
        things of this kind, which we previously established as the matter of
        temperance and intemperance (267, 595, 599, 603). But things desirable
        in themselves, which he mentions as unnecessary, are victory, honor,
        riches, and other goods and pleasures of the same kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1358. At “Therefore, people” [i, y], he shows in what way a man may be
        called continent or incontinent in regard to these things: first [i, y,
        aa] concerning the unnecessary, and second [i, y, bb], at “But men who
        etc.,” concerning the necessary. His first remark is that people who go
        to excess in their pursuit of those unnecessary things in them that are
        contrary to right reason are not called simply incontinent but with a
        limitation, for example, incontinent in the matter of money, gain,
        honor, or anger, as if there were others absolutely incontinent. The
        former are called incontinent by way of likeness that the addition
        indicates; thus, when we say “man” the victor in the Olympics, the
        common notion of man differs little from the proper notion which this
        addition signifies, although it is different in some way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1359. As an indication that a man may not be called incontinent without
        qualification in these matters, he remarks that incontinence is censured
        not only as a sin that someone can commit even in pursuing what is good
        though in an inordinate manner; but incontinence is censured as a kind
        of vice by which we tend to some evil. There is vice either in the
        complete sense, e.g., when the reason and the appetitive faculty aim at
        evil (this is the real vice that is contrary to virtue) or in an
        incomplete sense, e.g., when the appetitive faculty, but not the reason,
        tends to evil ‘ which occurs in incontinence (proper). But none of the
        incontinent previously mentioned are censured as wicked but only as
        sinners because they strive for good, but beyond what is proper. Hence
        none of them is incontinent without qualification.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1360. Then [y, bb], at “But men who,” he shows how someone is called
        incontinent in regard to necessary things. He observes that men who
        behave badly in the matter of physical pleasures, with which temperance
        and intemperance deal, not in such a way that by deliberate choice they
        pursue excessive pleasures and avoid discomforts, e.g., hunger and
        thirst and suchlike pertaining to taste and touch—but so that they
        pursue these things contrary to the right reason in themselves; men of
        this ‘kind, I say, are called incontinent not with some limitation like
        the incontinent in regard to anger but without qualification. He also
        offers confirmation of this by the fact that people are called
        effeminate-closely related to the incontinent-in reference to such
        discomforts, for instance, because they cannot undergo hunger or thirst
        or anything of this type, but not in reference to other things, for
        example, because they cannot bear poverty and suchlike.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1361. Next [i, z], at “For this reason,” he infers certain corollaries
        from the premises. The first [z, aa] is that incontinent and
        intemperate, continent and temperate are placed in the same
        classification, not in the sense that one of them is the other, but
        because in some measure they deal with the same things, viz., bodily
        pleasures and pains, yet not in the same way, for the temperate and
        intemperate act with deliberate choice while the continent and
        incontinent act without it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1362. The second [z, bb], which follows from the first, he sets forth at
        “Consequently.” He says that, from the discussions, obviously the
        intemperate man is the greater sinner and to be censured because he sins
        more in pursuing superfluous pleasures and avoiding slight discomforts
        when he does not feel passion at all or feels it only gently, i.e.,
        mildly. For this reason he is worse than a man like the incontinent
        fellow, who sins in these matters from violent passion. What would a man
        do who sins without passion, if he were to experience the vehement
        desires of youth and the serious discomforts arising from the lack of
        necessities?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1363. At “Some kinds” [a, ii] he clarifies what he had said, assigning
        reaasons why there is no incontinence without qualification in the case
        of unnecessary things. First [ii, x] he shows why such must be the case.
        Then [ii, y], at “But people speak etc.,” he shows why only limited
        incontinence is predicated of such people. On the initial
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        point he makes three observations. First [ii, x, aa] he points out what
        kinds of unnecessary pleasures there are. Next [ii, x, bb], at “Hence,
        those who etc.,” he infers what kind of desire is aroused for these
        pleasures. Third [ii, x, cc], at “So then there is etc.,” he further
        infers that there is neither vice nor total incontinence in regard to
        them. He shows first that some species of desires and pleasures concern
        things that are good and praiseworthy in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1364. There are three kinds of pleasures. Some, to which nature
        inclines, are desirable by nature. Others are just the reverse, for
        example, those contrary to the natural inclination. Still others are
        midway between, witness the case of money and gain, victory and honor.
        Hence, in those of the middle kind, people are not blamed because they
        are affected by a desire and love for these things but because they
        desire them in an excessive manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1365. Next [ii, x, bb], at “Hence, those who,” he infers from the
        premises what kind of desire people have for these last types of
        pleasures. He remarks that those who, contrary to reason, possess or
        pursue any of the things that are noble and good by nature are not
        blamed as evil, for instance, people who are more zealous than they
        should be about honor or about the care of their children or parents.
        Certainly these operations are good, and men who are properly diligent
        about them are praised; nevertheless a kind of vicious excess can exist
        in such matters. Thus if a woman should rebel against God because of
        excessive love of her children, for example, in the event of their
        death, as we read of a woman named Niobe; or if a man should do
        something foolish out of immoderate love of a parent, as a certain
        Satyrus called <i>philopater</i> or “father-lover” seemed to act very
        foolishly because of the love he had for his father.’
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1366. Then [ii, x, cc], at “So then there is,” he infers that there is
        no vice in these pleasures because each of them considered in itself is
        naturally desirable while only excesses in them are evil and to, be
        avoided. Likewise there is no complete incontinence in these pleasures,
        because incontinence not only is a thing to be avoided as a sin but is
        something censurable as being disgraceful. Therefore it is with bodily
        pleasures, which are disgraceful and servile as was said in book the
        third (612), that continence is properly concerned. Nor are pleasures of
        this kind to be desired by men except on account of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1367. At “But people speak” [ii, y] he shows why partial incontinence
        should be predicated of unnecessary pleasures. He say this happens
        because of some likeness in passion: as someone has an immoderate
        passion for bodily pleasures, so too for money and other objects
        previously mentioned. There is a parallel case when we say a man is a
        bad doctor or a poor mimic, i.e., actor, who nevertheless is not called
        simply bad. So then in the things that are called bad in this way, we do
        not predicate badness of any of them in an unqualified sense but
        according to a proportionate likeness, because as a bad doctor is
        compared to what a doctor ought to be so a bad man is compared to what a
        man ought to be. Likewise in the genus of continence we call that
        continence and incontinence without qualification which is concerned
        with the same matters as temperance and intemperance. But with respect
        to anger we predicate incontinence by similitude, and hence say a man is
        incontinent in the matter of anger, as we say he is incontinent in the
        matter of honor or gain.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1368. After the Philosopher has explained that a man is called continent
        and incontinent in different ways according to the different human
        passions and pleasures, he here [1, b] explains that a man is said to be
        continent or incontinent in different senses according as his passions
        and pleasures are human or brutish. On this point he does two things.
        First [b, i] he shows among the different kinds of passion and pleasure
        which are human and which, brutish. Next [b, ii], at “No one would
        etc.,” he shows how continence and incontinence are attributed in a
        different sense to these (passions and pleasures). The initial point he
        develops in two stages. First [i, x] he distinguishes pleasures. Then
        [i, y], at “I call bestial etc.,” he clarifies his statement by
        examples. He says first that some pleasures are according to nature,
        others are not according to nature; and each group is subdivided.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1369. Of the pleasures that are natural, some are delightful to every
        creature with senses, for example, sweet is naturally pleasing to all
        who have the sense of taste. Others are naturally delightful to certain
        classes of animals and men. Some foods are by their nature pleasant to
        carnivorous animals, others to herbivorous animals. Likewise, among men,
        cold foods that moderate the temperament are delightful to the choleric,
        but warm foods are agreeable to the phlegmatic.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1370. Of the unnatural pleasures, some become delightful because of
        privation, i.e., on account of some supervenient sickness of the body or
        sadness of soul by which the nature is changed into a different
        condition. Others become delightful because of evil habit which brings
        about a quasi-nature. Still others become delightful because of vicious
        natures, as happens when people have corrupt and perverse bodily
        temperaments; and, accordingly both the perceptions of their imagination
        and the affections of their sensitive appetite are most perverse.
        Likewise, since these powers are acts of bodily organs, they are
        necessarily proportionate to the temperament of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1371. Because habits are diversified by a complete distinction of
        objects, corresponding habits will answer to these individual pleasures
        under discussion; thus some habits will be natural and others unnatural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1372. Next [i, y], at “I call bestial the pleasure etc.,” he exemplifies
        individually the different kinds of unnatural pleasures; and first [i,
        y, aa] those which are delightful because of the malignant nature of men
        who are, so to speak, bestial since they are like beasts by reason of a
        corrupt temperament. There is a story about one man who slit the wombs
        of pregnant women so he could devour the fetuses. Equally horrible are
        those who delight in practices of the kind reported of certain savages
        living in the forest near the Black Sea. Some eat raw meat, others human
        flesh; still others offer one another their children to be food for
        their feasts. Similar things are narrated about one Phalaris, a most
        cruel tyrant, who took pleasure in torturing men. Therefore, people who
        delight in deeds of this kind are, as it were, like beasts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1373. Second [i, y, bb], at “But some people,” he exemplifies things
        that become delightful and are contrary to nature because of particular
        ailments, for example, insanity or madness or something of this sort.
        There is a story about one man who on becoming insane sacrificed his
        mother and ate her; still another who murdered his fellow slave and ate
        his liver.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1374. Last [i, y, cc], at “Others become,” he offers examples of things
        contrary to nature that become delightful by reason of habit. Some enjoy
        unnatural pleasures because of mental unbalance or habitual perversion.
        For example, certain men out of habit take pleasure in pulling out their
        hair, biting their nails, eating coal and earth, and having sexual
        intercourse with males. All the preceding can be reduced to two classes.
        Some people do them because of the tendency of bodily temperament that
        they had from the beginning; others because of habit, becoming
        accustomed to things of this kind from childhood. Such people are like
        individuals who fall into this condition by reason of physical sickness,
        for evil habit is a kind of psychological sickness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1375. Then [b, ii], at “No one would,” he shows that these unnatural
        pleasures do not dispose to incontinence simply but only in a qualified
        sense. He does this in two ways; first [ii, x] by a reason taken from
        the disposition of those who enjoy the pleasures; second [ii, y] by a
        reason taken from the nature of the pleasures, at “To experience etc.”
        He says first that no one will accuse of unqualified incontinence men
        whose bestial nature is the reason for such pleasures. We have already
        said (1350) that dumb animals are not referred to as continent or
        incontinent since they exercise no universal judgment but only
        imagination and memory of particulars. But these men who, by reason of a
        malignant nature, are like wild beasts indeed do have some, although
        very little, universal perception, reason in them being weighed down by
        bad temperament, as is obviously the case with those physically sick.
        But what is very little seems to be as nothing. Nor is it likely that
        the force of a weak argument should repel strong desires. Consequently,
        these individuals are not called incontinent or continent simply but
        only in a restricted sense, insofar as some judgment of reason remains
        with them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1376. He offers the example of women in whom, for the most part, reason
        flourishes very little because of the imperfect nature of their body.
        Because of this they do not govern their emotions in the majority of
        cases by reason but rather are governed by their emotions. Hence wise
        and brave women are rarely found, and so women cannot be called
        continent and incontinent without qualification. The same argument seems
        valid for those who are ill, i.e., have a diseased temperament because
        of bad habits, which oppresses the judgment of reason after the manner
        of a perverse nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1377. Next [ii, y], at “To experience,” he shows from the very nature of
        unnatural pleasures that there is no incontinence in the unqualified
        sense but only in a limited sense. He states his proposition [ii, y,
        aa], then [ii, y, bb], at “Every excess of vice etc.,” he explains it.
        First [aa, a’] he proposes two things. The first is that to experience
        desires for these pleasures exceeds the limits of human vice, as was
        previously said also about brutishness (1296, 1299).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1378. The second [aa, b’] he proposes at “If anyone.” saying that if
        anyone should have these desires and overcome them, he will be called
        continent not simply but by reason of some resemblance to virtuous
        restraint. Or if he should be overcome by them, he will be called
        incontinent not simply but by way of a resemblance to complete
        incontinence. In this fashion we spoke before on incontinence in regard
        to anger (1367).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1379. At “Every excess of vice” [ii, y, bb] he explains his statement.
        First [bb, a’] he does so in regard to vice; then [bb, b’], at
        “Sometimes a man etc.,” in regard to continence and incontinence. On the
        first point we must consider [a’ a] that such an excess of vice can
        concern vices opposed to all virtues, for example, folly opposed to
        prudence, timidity opposed to fortitude, intemperance opposed to
        temperance, and harshness opposed to gentleness; and it can concern each
        one of the vices, for some of them are brutish habits arising from a
        malignant nature, others are diseased habits arising from physical or
        psychological sickness, i.e., a bad habit. Since he has already given
        examples of intemperance and harshness, he now first exemplifies
        timidity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1380. He does this at “Someone” [a’, b], saying that temperament may be
        so timid as to make some afraid of anything, even the squeak of a mouse.
        This is the timidity of a dumb animal. One man became so fearful from a
        pathological condition that he was afraid of a ferret.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1381. Then [a’, c], at “Certain silly people,” he gives examples of
        folly of some individuals irrational by nature, not because they have no
        reason but in fact very little, and this much concerned with particulars
        perceived by sense, so they live only according to the senses. Such
        individuals are—so to speak—brutish by nature. This happens especially
        to barbarians living at the ends of the earth, where from unhealthiness
        of the climate the bodies of the natives are likewise unhealthy,
        impeding the use of reason. Other people become irrational because of
        some sickness like epilepsy or insanity; and these are stupid because of
        disease.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1382. Next [bb, b’], at “Sometimes a man,” he explains his statement in
        regard to incontinence. First [b’, a] in what way continence and
        incontinence resemble the preceding vices. He remarks that a man may at
        times experience something of these unnatural passions and not be
        overcome by them, and this looks like continence. This would be the case
        if the tyrant Phalaris should keep a boy, wanting to use him either for
        food or unnatural pleasure, but nevertheless actually would not use him.
        At other times a man may not only experience desires of this kind but
        also be overcome by them; and this resembles incontinence.

        1383. Then [b’, b], at “As vice” he shows that in matters of this sort
        there is no complete continence or incontinence. He says that as vice
        according to the human mode is called unqualified vice but that which is
        humanly unnatural is called brutish or pathological vice, and not in the
        unqualified sense; so in the same*way incontinence that is unnatural is
        predicated with some limitation, like bestial or pathological, but only
        incontinence according to human mode is called unqualified incontinence.

        1384. Finally, in summary, he concludes it is evident from our
        discussion that only unqualified continence and incontinence treat those
        matters dealt with by temperance and intemperance, while some kind of
        incontinence predicated in a transferred rather than in the absolute way
        is concerned with other matters.

        Anger seems to listen to reason to some extent but to hear badly, like
        hasty servants who hurry off before understanding instructions and then
        make mistakes in performing them,, and again like dogs barking at the
        first knock before knowing if a friend is coming. Anger listens in this
        way but, because of the heat and impulsiveness of its nature, moves to
        inflict punishment without heeding the injunction of reason. When reason
        or imagination shows a man that he has suffered injury or contempt, he
        concludes he ought to attack the one who injured him, and immediately
        becomes angry. But desire, as soon as reason or sense declares a thing
        delightful, proceeds to enjoy the pleasure. In this respect anger
        follows reason in b some measure, but not so desire, which is thus more
        disgraceful. Indeed the man incontinent in anger is prevailed upon to a
        degree by reason but this is not so of one incontinent in sensual
        desire.

        Moreover, a man apparently deserves more pardon for sins about naturally
        desirable things, because tolerance is more readily extended towards
        such desires common to all, precisely because they are common. But anger
        is more natural and more difficult to resist than the desires for
        excessive and unnecessary pleasures, as is evident in the following
        examples. A certain man reprimanded for striking his father answered
        that the father had struck his own father who in turn had struck his
        father; then pointing to his son he said: “This boy will strike me when
        he becomes a man, for it is a family trait.” Another man, when dragged
        along by his son, bade the son stop at the doorway, as he himself had
        dragged his own father only that far.

        Again, double dealing sinners are more unjust. Now the angry man does
        not act deceitfully but openly, nor does anger flare up secretly. On the
        other hand desire acts like Venus who is called the deceitful daughter
        of Cyprus and is said to wear a multicolored girdle; of her Homer
        relates [Iliad, xiv. 214, 217] that she craftily steals the wits of the
        wisest man. Therefore, incontinence of this kind is more unjust and
        disgraceful than incontinence of anger; it is incontinence in the
        unqualified sense and is to some extent a vice.

        In addition, no one feels sad doing an injury. But what anyone does in
        anger he does with a feeling of sadness, while the one doing injury acts
        with pleasure. If then the more unjust things are those against which we
        are justly very angry, it follows that incontinence arising from sensual
        desire is more unjust, because no injury is involved in the anger.
        Therefore it is evident that incontinence concerning sensual desires is
        more disgraceful than that which concerns anger, and that continence and
        incontinence in the unqualified sense deal with sensual desires and
        bodily pleasures.

        Yet with only the first of these do temperance and intemperance deal.
        For this reason we do not call dumb animals temperate or intemperate in
        the proper sense; we do say, in comparing one animal with another, that
        one species differs from another in uncleanness, in stupidity, or in
        voraciousness, but this is a figurative way of speaking, for none of
        them have choice or reason; they are creatures separated from reason as

        However, brutishness has less the nature of vice (but is more frightful)
        for what is best has not been corrupted as in an evil man-it is not
        present to be corrupt. Therefore, making a comparison to find out which
        is worse is like comparing an inanimate thing with a living one. The
        viciousness of that which does not have an intrinsic principle of action
        is always less blamable, while the intellect is such a principle. So
        then it is like the comparison between injustice as such and the unjust
        man. The fact is that each is worse in some sense; certainly the evil
        man can do ten thousand times more evil than a dumb animal.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1385. After the Philosopher has shown how incontinence has to do with
        different pleasures in different ways, he now compares different kinds
        of incontinence with each other. First [2, a] he compares incontinence
        in the pleasures of touch, which is complete incontinence, with
        incontinence in the matter of anger, which is incontinence only
        partially. Then [2, b], at “But we must take up etc.,” he compares human
        incontinence with brutish or pathological incontinence. He treats the
        first point in a twofold manner. First [a, i] he states his proposition,
        that we must consider that incontinence in the matter of anger is less
        disgraceful than incontinence in pleasures of touch, with which both
        temperance and intemperance deal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1386. Next [a, ii], at “Anger seems,” he proves his proposition by four
        arguments. In the first [ii, w] he says that anger listens somewhat to
        reason, inasmuch as the angry man reasons in some measure that he ought
        to inflict punishment for injury done to him. But he hears poorly, i.e.,
        he listens imperfectly to reason because he is not careful to heed the
        judgment of reason about the amount and the mode of punishment. Among
        animals, who lack reason, we find anger—as also other activities similar
        to reason—according to natural instinct.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1387. In clarification of his proposition he introduces two examples.
        The first is of servants who, because they are very precipitate, hasten
        to act before they hear all their instructions, and consequently make
        mistakes in executing the command which they did not fully understand.
        The other example is of dogs barking at the first sound of someone
        knocking at the door before they are aware whether the one knocking is
        family or friend. So in anger a man listens somewhat to reason but,
        because of the natural heat and swiftness of the bile inducing to anger,
        he proceeds to administer punishment before he hears the entire
        injunction of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1388. Aristotle then, in addition, explains how this may happen. That a
        man has suffered injury or contempt is made known to him sometimes as a
        result of reason, as when this actually occurred, and other times as a
        result of imagination, as when the matter seems so to him, although it
        is not true. Then the man in anger apparently concludes he ought to
        attack the one who injured him and, taking an improper mode of
        vengeance, immediately bestirs himself in anger to inflict punishment
        before reason decides for him the mode of punishment. On the other hand
        sensual desire, as soon as something is declared delightful to it by
        reason or sense, moves to enjoy that pleasure without any reasoning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1389. The reason for this difference is that the pleasing object has the
        nature of an end desirable in itself and is like a principle in
        reference to the conclusion. But damage to be inflicted on another is
        not desirable in itself as an end having the nature of a principle but
        as something useful to the end, and has the nature of a conclusion in
        things to be done. For this reason sensual desire does not move by
        reasoning but anger does. Consequently, anger follows reason in some
        measure but not sensual desire, which follows its own impetuosity. In
        this way something shameful, which is contrary to reason, results in
        human affairs. So then, obviously, the man incontinent in sensual desire
        is more disgraceful than the man incontinent in anger. The reason is
        that the man incontinent in anger is prevailed upon by reason to a
        degree, but not the sensually incontinent man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1390. At “Moreover, a man” [ii, x] he gives the second argument, saying
        that if a man sins in things which he naturally desires he is rather
        deserving of pardon. An indication of this is that tolerance is more
        readily extended toward the common appetites, for example, of food and
        drink—since they are natural—if they are taken precisely as common. The
        desire for food but not for delicate food is natural and common. But
        anger is more natural and mote difficult to resist than desires (not the
        common ones which are necessary and natural, and less frequently the
        matter of sin) but those desires that seek superfluous and unnecessary
        things-those which temperance and intemperance treat, as he has said in
        the third book (619-624).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1391. To be a peaceful animal is natural to man from the common nature
        of the species inasmuch as he is a social animal (for every gregarious
        animal is naturally of this kind); but sometimes a strong tendency to
        anger results from an individual’s nature, which consists in the
        composition of the body, because of the heat and dryness of easily
        enkindled humors. The desire for superfluous objects, for example,
        dainty food, follows rather the imagination and is a conscious passion
        of the soul rather than a natural temperament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1392. Hence the tendency to anger is easily propagated from father to
        son, following as a result of the natural temperament, as is evident in
        the examples he adds. A certain man reprimanded for striking his father
        answered that he himself had also struck his own father who had in turn
        struck his father. Then the man pointing to his son said, “This boy will
        strike me when he becomes a man; it is a family trait.” He gives another
        example of a man who, when he was dragged out of his home by his son,
        asked the son to stop when they got to the doorway because he himself
        had dragged his own father only that far. So then a person incontinent
        of anger is less disgraceful because anger is more natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1393. At “Again, double dealing” [ii, y] he gives the third argument,
        saying that those who sin deceitfully are more unjust because, together
        with the fact that they cause injury, they also deceive. However, the
        angry man does not act deceitfully but obviously wants to take
        vengeance, for he would not be satisfied unless the one punished should
        know besides that he is being punished because he had given offense to
        the avenger. Nor does anger flare up secretly or cunningly but
        impulsively. But the desire for pleasures arises in secret and
        insidiously, so to speak. Since the pleasurable object is designed by
        nature to move the appetite immediately on perception, it draws the
        appetite to itself unless reason takes pains to hinder this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1394. Hence people speak of the deceitful Cyprian maid, meaning Venus,
        for she was queen of Cyprus, and so was called a Cyprian as if born in
        Cyprus. They attribute to her something of the artful woman, saying her
        girdle is multicolored, by which we understand sensual desire binding
        reason; varicolored because it directs one’s course to something
        apparently good inasmuch as it is pleasurable but really evil. Likewise,
        Homer writes “ that the cunning, Venus craftily steals the wits of the
        very wise man, because she binds the judgment of the reason in
        particular practical matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1395. Therefore, this incontinence concerning sensual desires is more
        unjust and disgraceful than incontinence concerning anger. If this is
        true, the incontinence dealing with sensual desires is incontinence in
        the unqualified sense, as was pointed out previously (1384); and it is a
        vice in some measure inasmuch as it is deceitful, not that it acts by
        calculation but that it enters by stealth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1396. At “In addition, no one” [ii, z] he gives his fourth argument: no
        one inflicting an injury acts with sadness. It has been explained
        previously in the fifth book (1035-1036) that a man who acts
        involuntarily does not do something unjust absolutely speaking, but only
        incidentally, inasmuch as what he does happens to be unjust. But what we
        do with sadness we seem to do involuntarily. Now anyone who acts
        immediately from anger is sad, not that he grieves about the punishment
        he inflicted—he is rather glad about this—but he is sad and moved to
        anger by the injury he has received. So his act is not simply
        involuntary because (if it were) what he does would not be imputed to
        him in any way; but it has a mixture of the voluntary and the
        involuntary. Therefore, what he does is less imputed to him inasmuch as
        he acts under provocation. But the man who does something apparently
        unjust in itself, when inflicting an injury, operates voluntarily and
        with pleasure. If then those things seem to be more unjust against which
        we are justly very angry, it follows that incontinence arising from
        sensual desire is more unjust because we are more justly aroused against
        it, as against an evil agent acting with complete voluntariness and with
        pleasure. But injury is not primarily in the anger but rather in him who
        has given provocation for the anger. Therefore, we are less justly angry
        against the angry person who under provocation sins with sadness, and
        for this reason is less unjust.
      </p>

        1397. Hence he summarizes in conclusion that, obviously, incontinence
        which concerns sensual desires is more disgraceful than that which
        concerns anger; that incontinence and continence in the unqualified
        sense deal with sensual desires and pleasures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1398. Then [2, b], at “But we must take up,” he compares human
        incontinence with brutish incontinence. He treats this point in a
        threefold manner. First [b, i] he takes up again different kinds of
        sensual desires and pleasures. Next [b, ii], at “Yet with only etc.,” he
        shows with which of these temperance and intemperance, and consequently
        continence and incontinence, are concerned. Last [b, iii], at “However,
        brutishness etc.,” he compares human with brutish vice or incontinence.
        He says first that, since continence and incontinence have to do with
        bodily pleasures we must take up their differences. Some of them, as we
        indicated previously (1368-1371), are human and natural, i.e., in
        keeping with human nature both in regard to the genus which is
        considered according to the things sought, and in regard to the amount
        which is considered according to the mode, intense or feeble, of
        seeking. Others are not natural but brutish because of a vicious nature,
        or they come about by reason of privations and sickness—among these are
        evil habits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1399. Next [b, ii], at “Yet only with the first,” he shows with which of
        these temperance is concerned. He states temperance and intemperance
        have to do only with sensual desires which are human and natural. Hence,
        properly speaking, we do not call dumb animals either temperate or
        intemperate. But, figuratively speaking of one animal compared to
        another, we do say that one kind of animal differs from another (i) in
        defilement—one is more filthy in living a more vile and unclean life,
        for example, the pig than the sheep; (2) in <i>sinamoria</i> i.e.,
        stupidity in general—one is more stupid than another, for instance, the
        ass than the horse; (3) in voraciousness—the wolf is most rapacious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1400. Hence, by a comparison with these animals which are excessive in
        this way, other kinds of animals are called temperate or prudent by a
        kind of similitude but not in the proper sense because none of them has
        deliberate choice or can reason but is separated from rational nature.
        All insane persons who have lost the use of reason are like this. But we
        have said before (1361) that a temperate and an intemperate man act with
        deliberate choice; and so temperance and intemperance are not found in
        dumb animals nor in brutish men, nor are they concerned with brutish
        desires.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1401. At “However, brutishness” [b, iii] he compares brutish with human
        vice or incontinence, saying that brutishness has less of evil in it
        considering the condition of a beast (or of a bestial person). But
        brutishness is more frightening because it does worse things. He proves
        that brutishness is less evil by the fact that,.the highest part, i.e.,
        the intellect, is not corrupt and depraved in-the animal, as in an evil
        man, but entirely lacking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1402. Therefore, to compare a beast with a bad man to discover which is
        worse, is like comparing a non-living creature with a living one.
        Non-living creatures, like fire that burns or rock that crushes, do more
        damage but are farther from the notion of fault. Badness in a thing
        without an inner principle of its actions is always less blamable since
        less fault can be attributed to it—badness in man is imputable because
        he has a principle making him master of his own actions. This principle
        is the intellect that the brutes lack. Therefore a beast is compared to
        a man as injustice to an unjust man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1403. For the habit of injustice by its very nature has an inclination
        to evil, but the unjust man retains the power to be good or bad. Each is
        worse in a measure, i.e., the unjust man is worse than injustice and the
        evil man worse than a brute because an evil man can do ten thousand
        times more harm than a beast by his reason which he can use to devise
        very diverse evils. Therefore, as a dumb animal is less guilty than an
        evil man but is more to be dreaded, so also brutish vice or even
        incontinence is more to be dreaded but is less culpable and more
        blameless than human incontinence or vice. Consequently people who are
        insane or naturally bestial are less severely punished.

        But some pleasures are necessary, others not necessary; some are
        necessary up to a point, while excesses and defects are not at all
        necessary. So it is in the matter of desires and pains. Hence a man is
        called intemperate who pursues excesses in pleasures by desiring them
        beyond measure or by deliberately choosing them for their own sake and
        not for the sake of something else. Since such a one is not sorry for
        his actions he cannot be cured. But the man who is deficient in things
        of this nature is the very opposite (i.e., insensible). And he who
        follows a middle course is temperate. Similarly, someone may shun bodily
        pains not because he is overcome but because he deliberately chooses. Of
        those who yield but not from deliberate choice, one is drawn by the
        force of pleasure and another by aversion from the pain of unsatisfied
        desire. Therefore these persons differ one from the other.

        Generally speaking, someone doing a shameful act without any passion at
        all, or with only mild passion, is worse than another who sins with
        violent passion. Likewise he who strikes another in cold blood is worse
        than one acting in anger. What would a man who sins without passion do
        under the influence of passion? For this reason the intemperate is worse
        than the incontinent person. In the latter there is rather a kind of
        effeminacy, while the intemperate man is opposed to the temperate.

        The continent man is set opposite the incontinent, and the persevering
        man is opposite the effeminate. In fact, one is said to be persevering
        in this that he holds fast, while continence consists in conquering. But
        holding fast differs from conquering, as not being conquered differs
        from conquering. For this reason continence is more desirable than

        The man, however, who fails in b resisting those pleasures which most
        people successfully resist is called effeminate and delicate. Indeed
        delicacy is a kind of effeminacy. Such is the man who trails his
        clothing to avoid the wearisome trouble of lifting it and imitates an
        invalid, not considering himself wretched in resembling a person who is.
        Likewise this applies to continence and incontinence, for it is not
        surprising for somebody to be overcome by the more intense and more
        extreme pleasures or pains; rather his action is excusable if he resists
        as Philoctetes did, in the play of Theodectus, when bitten by a snake,
        and Carcinus’ Cercyon in the Alope. The same can be said of those who
        try to keep from laughing but suddenly burst out like Xenophantus did.
        But a person is called incontinent and effeminate if he succumbs to
        those pleasures and pains which most people overcome, being unable to
        resist not because of a disposition of his nature (but because of a
        sickness of soul) as for instance, effeminacy among the Scythian kings.

        1404. After the Philosopher has shown the nature of the matter about
        which continence and incontinence in the unqualified sense are
        concerned, he now compares them to other habits that share the same
        matter. He discusses this point in a twofold manner. First [I] he shows
        how the continent and incontinent man differ from the persevering and
        the effeminate man, from and the temperate and the intemperate man. Here
        he solves the third difficulty that was raised against the fourth
        probable statement (1321-1324). Next [Lect. 8; II], at “But the
        intemperate man etc.” (B. 1150 b 29), he shows who is worse, the
        incontinent or the intemperate man, and by this he solves the fifth
        difficulty which was raised against the first probable statement. He
        treats the initial point under two aspects. First [I, A] he shows how
        incontinence differs from other habits. Then [I, B], at “One kind of
        incontinence etc.,” he distinguishes the different species of
        incontinence. He considers the first point in two ways. First [A, 1] he
        distinguishes continence and incontinence from temperance and
        intemperance, from perseverance and effeminacy. Next [A, 2], it
        “Generally speaking,” he compares these according to goodness and
        badness. He handles the first point in a twofold fashion. First [1, a]
        he distinguishes continence and incontinence from perseverance and
        effeminacy. Second [1, b], at “But some pleasures,” he distinguishes
        both (incontinence and continence) from temperance and intemperance. He
        discusses the first point from a double aspect. First [a, i] he shows
        the agreement; and then, at “Of these who etc.” [a, ii] he shows the
        difference. On the first he notes two points of agreement.

        1405. The first is according to the matter which continence and
        incontinence share with temperance. They deal with pleasures and pains,
        with desires and aversions—things pertaining to touch and taste about
        which temperance and intemperance are also concerned, as determined
        previously in the third book (339, 342, 616, 618, 651). The second point
        of agreement touches the manner of conducting oneself in regard to the
        passions. Some people act in such a way that they are overcome by
        passions in which most men are better disciplined or strong, that is to
        say, which they overcome; still others conquer those passions in which
        most men are less disciplined or weaker, that is to say, by which the
        majority are conquered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1406. Next [a, ii], at “Of those who,” he explains the difference. Men
        win and lose, he says, in contending with these pleasures and pains; and
        he who is overcome by those pleasures of touch where most people are
        victorious is called incontinent, but he who overcomes the pleasures of
        touch in which most people are overcome is called continent. In
        connection with the opposite pains, one overwhelmed by those which the
        majority endure is called effeminate, while another who triumphs over
        those to which many men succumb is called persevering.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1407. Because there are different degrees of pleasures and pains, and so
        of men who control and are controlled by them, it is evident that these
        habits can be for the most part “in-between.” However, those habits
        signifying evil incline more easily to the lower pleasures, for people
        are said to be more incontinent and effeminate who are overcome by minor
        pleasures or pains; just as good habits incline more to the higher
        pleasures, for they are called more continent and persevering who master
        the greater pleasures and pains. Likewise it can be understood that men
        may be inclined toward the worse habits, viz., incontinence and
        effeminacy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1408. Then [1, b], at “But some” he shows how these habits differ from
        temperance. He says some pleasures of taste and touch, for example, of
        food and drink, are necessary; other pleasures like different seasonings
        are unnecessary. Those necessary are so up to a certain point, for there
        is a quantity of food and drink necessary for man. But excesses (of
        pleasures) are unnecessary and so are deficiencies. The same is true for
        desires and pains.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1409. Therefore, someone who intentionally pursues excesses
        immoderately, i.e., in desiring them above measure, or even seeks them
        by deliberate choice for their own sake and not for the sake of
        something else, considering them as an end, is called intemperate.
        Because a man cleaves immovably to that which he intentionally seeks for
        itself, the intemperate man is necessarily not sorry about pleasures he
        has sought. Consequently his vice is incurable, for no one is cured
        except by being displeased since virtue and vice are in the will. As the
        intemperate man abounds in his quest for pleasures, so the insensible
        man—his counterpart—is deficient in the same affairs, as noted in the
        third book (630-631). But one following a middle course in these matters
        is temperate. And as the intemperate person seeks bodily pleasures by
        deliberate choice, so he shuns bodily pain, not by being overcome by
        them but out of deliberate choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1410. Still, of those who do not sin from deliberate choice, one, viz.,
        the incontinent is drawn by the pleasure’s power, another—the “soft”—is
        conquered by dread of pain following the desire, i.e., the deprivation
        of the thing desired. Hence it is clear that the incontinent, the
        effeminate, and the intemperate man are each different.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1411. We should note here that previously (1361-1362), in determining
        the matter of continence and incontinence—lest error creep in—the
        Philosopher incidentally touched on the difference between the
        intemperate and the incontinent man-a matter he now makes his prime
        concern.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1412. At “Generally speaking” [A, 2] he compares these habits according
        to goodness and evil. First [2, a] he compares the incontinent and the
        effeminate man with the intemperate. Next [2, b], at “The continent man
        etc.,” he compares the incontinent man with the effeminate. He says
        first that, generally speaking, one who does something shameful without
        any passion at all, or under the influence of what is only ineffectual
        or mild passion, is worse than one doing something shameful with violent
        passion. Likewise striking another in cold blood is worse than striking
        in anger. What might a man sinning without passion do if he was
        passionate? Consequently the intemperate man, not overcome by passion
        but sinning by deliberate choice, is worse than the incontinent man who
        is mastered by passion. Likewise one of these two conditions, being
        mastered by passion in running away from pain belongs rather to a kind
        of effeminacy, while the other, sinning by deliberate choice belongs to
        intemperance. Hence the intemperate person is worse than the “softy.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1413. Next [2, b], at “The continent man,” he compares the “soft” man to
        the incontinent, and the persevering man to the continent. He considers
        these points in three ways. First [b, i] he shows which is better. Then
        [b, ii], at “The man, however, etc.,” he explains a likeness previously
        mentioned. Last [b, iii], at “Although it might seem etc.,” he refutes
        an error. He says first that the continent man is contrasted with the
        incontinent, and the persevering man is contrasted with the effeminate.
        One is called persevering in this that he maintains his ground when
        another urges him to the contrary. But continence is designated from
        this that it conquers, for what we contain (<i>continemus</i>) we have
        in our power. It is necessary that we should stand firm against pain
        because pleasure must be bridled or kept in check. Hence the persevering
        man is compared to the continent man as the unconquered is compared to
        the conqueror who is obviously more perfect. Consequently continence is
        more perfect than perseverance. Effeminacy, however, seems worse than
        incontinence: each consists in defeat but the incontinent person is
        beaten by a stronger passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1414. Then [b, ii], at “The man, however,” he makes clear a likeness
        mentioned previously (1413), between the effeminate and the incontinent
        person, both are beaten by passions that many other people master. He
        says that the man failing in these pleasures against which even the
        majority fight to resist and can overcome is called effeminate and
        delicate. The effeminate and the delicate belong in the same class, for
        delicacy is a kind of effeminacy. Effeminacy inordinately shuns all
        weariness but delicacy in the strict sense shuns the weariness of toil.
        An individual, who trails his clothing after him on the ground to avoid
        the labor of carrying it—which pertains to delicacy, is overcome by that
        weariness which he thinks is at hand from tucking up his clothes.
        Although he acts like an invalid in dragging his clothes, and in this he
        seems not to be wretched; nevertheless he resembles a wretched person
        inasmuch as he shuns fatigue only to meet it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1415. What was said about effeminacy holds true for continence and
        incontinence. It is not surprising if a person is overcome by the more
        intense and more extreme pleasures and pains, so that he ought (not) to
        be called incontinent or effeminate for this reason. Rather he should be
        pardoned if he attempts to resist and does not yield at once. Aristotle
        gives the example of Philoctetes who, Theodectus the poet narrates, when
        bitten by a snake and suffering great pain tried to contain his anguish
        but could not. Something like this is told about a woman named Melopes
        who was struck by a man called Carcinus. So also it happens to those who
        try to keep from laughing, yet are not successful and suddenly burst
        out, as did Xenophantus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1416. But a man is then called incontinent and effeminate when he
        succumbs to such pains and pleasures as most people can overcome. Yet
        his inability to resist passions of this sort does not arise from his
        type of nature-by reason of which a thing serious for him would be
        slight for others-but from a debility of mind caused by evil habit. Thus
        effeminacy from an innate tendency is found in the kings of Scythia who
        cannot bear labors and pains because of their delicate rearing. The same
        thing is true of women in comparison with men by the weakness of their
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1417. At “Although it might seem” [b, iii] he refutes an error. It seems
        possible that the playful type, i.e., one too much in love with
        amusement is intemperate because there is a kind of pleasure in
        amusement, but the Philosopher says that such a person more properly is
        effeminate. Amusement is a quieting and relaxation of the mind, which
        the lover of amusement seeks to an excessive degree. Hence he comes in
        the classification of effeminate, whose characteristic is to shun
        difficulties and labors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1418. Next [I, B], at “One kind of incontinence,” he distinguishes the
        species of incontinence. He treats this point under three headings.
        First [B, 1] he gives the division, saying that incontinence has a
        twofold division: impetuosity and weakness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1419. Then [B, 2], at “Some incontinent,” he explains the members of the
        division. He says that some incontinent people do deliberate when
        passion arises, but they do not abide by the results of deliberation
        because of the passion which overcomes them. Incontinence of this kind
        is called weakness. Other incontinent persons are led by passion because
        they do not deliberate but when passion arises they follow it
        immediately. This incontinence is called impetuosity because of its
        quickness which forestalls deliberation. However, if they had
        deliberated they would not have been led astray by passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1420. Still others excite themselves in advance and afterwards are not
        moved when excited by others. This is the way also with those who,
        feeling the movement of passion beforehand and having previous knowledge
        of that to which passion inclines, arouse themselves in advance, i.e.,
        provoke themselves and their powers of deduction to resist sensual
        desire, and consequently they are not changed either by the passion of
        pleasure that overwhelms the incontinent man, or by the pain that
        overwhelms the effeminate man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1421. Last [B, 3], at “It is especially,” he shows to whom the second
        kind of incontinence called impetuosity is attributable. He says that
        the highly sensitive or the choleric and the depressed are especially
        incontinent according to the incontinence which is not restrained by
        counsel, and which is called impetuosity. Neither of these awaits the
        advice of reason but they follow the first sensual image: the choleric
        on account of the quickness of their wrath but the depressed on account
        of the vehemence of their intensified melancholy whose impulse no man
        can easily endure, for a dry object when kindled bums furiously. On the
        contrary we are to understand that men with sanguine and phlegmatic
        temperaments experience the incontinence of weakness on account of the
        humidity of their temperament which is not strong enough to resist an
        impression.

        Among the incontinent the impulsive sort are not as bad as those who,
        having the advice of reason, do not abide by it. These people give in to

        One man (the incontinent) pursues bodily pleasures excessively and
        contrary to right reason, and not because he is convinced that they are
        to be followed. But another (the intemperate) is convinced, because of
        his inclination, that these pleasures are to be followed. Hence the
        first is easily persuaded to change but not the second. The reason is
        that virtue and vice look to a principle that is destroyed by vice and
        preserved by virtue. Now the principle in actions is the end on account
        of which we operate, like axioms in mathematics; and just as reasoning
        does not teach principles in mathematics, so neither does reasoning
        teach the end in the sphere of action. But the right evaluation
        regarding the principle of things to be done is derived from a habit of
        virtue either natural or acquired. Therefore, the man who makes this
        evaluation is temperate, but he who makes the opposite evaluation is
        intemperate.

        Take the incontinent person exceeding the limits of right reason because
        of passion that so overcomes him that he does not act according to right
        reason; still he is not convinced that he should abandon himself to such
        pleasures without restriction. In this he is better than the libertine,
        and not absolutely bad, for he retains the highest principle.
        Nevertheless there is still another person, the very opposite, who keeps
        to right reason and does not go to excess in passion. From this, it is
        clear that continence is a good habit but incontinence an evil habit.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1422. After the Philosopher has shown the difference between the
        incontinent axid the intemperate man, he now shows which is worse [II].
        Thus he solves the difficulty raised in the fifth place (1325) about the
        first probable statement. Aristotle had considered this matter before
        but rather briefly and only incidentally. Now he gives it formal
        consideration by two o6perations. First [II, A] he explains his
        intention. Then [II, B], at “One man etc.,” he clarifies a matter
        formerly assumed. In the first part of the discussion he makes two
        points. First [A, 1 ] he shows that the intemperate is worse than the
        incontinent man. Then [A, 2], at “Although incontinence etc.,” he shows
        what is common to them. On the initial point, first [1, a] he compares
        the incontinent with the intemperate man. Then [1, b], at “Among the
        incontinent etc.,” he compares the two kinds of incontinence. First of
        all there are three arguments to show that the intemperate is worse than
        the incontinent man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1423. In the first reason he says, as was pointed out before (1409),
        that the intemperate man is not inclined to be penitent since he sins by
        a deliberate choice in which he persists, having chosen bodily pleasures
        as an end. But an incontinent man readily repents when the passion to
        which he gave in passes away. Therefore, it is evident, as previously
        indicated (1409), that the intemperate man is as incurable as the
        incontinent is curable. So from the quality of excess Aristotle solves
        the difficulty mentioned before (1409), which proceeds from this, that
        incontinence is more incurable than intemperance. Since the intemperate
        man is indeed more incurable, it is possible to conclude he is worse,
        just as an incurable disease is worse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1424. He states his second reason [a, ii] at “Now vice resembles,”
        saying that vice (intemperance) can be compared to long sicknesses such
        as dropsy and tuberculosis. But incontinence resembles those sicknesses
        like epilepsy which occur at intervals. This is so because
        intemperance-and every real vice-is without interruption, being a
        lasting habit which chooses evils. But incontinent is not continual
        because the incontinent man is moved to sin only by reason of passion
        which quickly passes. Thus incontinence is—so to speak—a kind of
        transitory vice. But a continuing evil is worse than a passing one.
        Therefore intemperance is worse than incontinence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1425. At “Generally speaking” [a, iii] he gives his third reason: the
        genus of incontinence is different from that of vice under which
        intemperance is contained. Real vice is hidden from the one having it
        and his deception consists in thinking that what he does is good. But
        incontinence is not concealed, for such a person in his right mind knows
        that the object to which he is drawn by passion is evil. But hidden evil
        is more dangerous than overt evil. Therefore intemperance is worse than
        incontinence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1426. Then [1, b], at “Among the incontinent,” he compares the kinds of
        incontinence. He says that among the incontinent, impulsive or impetuous
        people are better or at least not as bad as the weak who still have
        reason’s counsel, although they do not follow it. The weak are worse in
        two ways. First they are conquered by a milder passion, while the
        impulsive are overcome by an excessive passion either by surprise or
        vehemence. He has just proved (1423) by this argument that the
        intemperate man is worse than the incontinent. This can be considered a
        fourth argument connected with the preceding three. The second reason is
        that the weak are not without counsel like the impetuous. The same
        argument was used before (1419-1420) in the case of the incontinent and
        the intemperate man, as if the incontinent man deliberated beforehand
        but not the intemperate. This is not true, for the intemperate man has
        reflected in advance, sinning by deliberate choice. Therefore, he
        apparently introduces this point to show that it is really out of place
        there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1427. He gives an example, comparing the incontinent person in his
        weakness with people who quickly or easily become intoxicated by a
        little wine or by less than most men. Such persons have a poor
        constitution; in the same way weak people giving in to a milder passion
        have a poor soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1428. Next [A, 2], at “Although incontinence,” he shows an agreement
        between the incontinent and the intemperate man in two matters. First
        [2, a] in regard to the fact that, although incontinence is not
        unqualified badness it is still vice in some sense, as previously stated
        (1379); it is then a quasi-vice, being but transitory. It is obviously
        not unqualified vice because incontinence sins without deliberate choice
        but real vice with deliberate choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1429. The second point of agreement is given at “Besides, there is” [2,
        b]. He says incontinence and vice have a similar action, illustrated by
        one Demodochus, an ancient of the people, who chided the Milesians thus:
        “Milesians, you are not foolish but you do things like the works of
        foolish people.” So the incontinent are not really bad (i.e., unjust or
        intemperate) but they do unjust and evil things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1430. Then [II, B], at “One man,” he gives his reason [B, 1] for his
        previous statement, that the intemperate person is, in contrast to the
        incontinent, unrepentant. Next [B, 2], at “Take the incontinent person,”
        Aristotle tells us why the incontinent man repents, saying in the first
        place that one man pursues bodily pleasures excessively and against the
        order of right reason not because he is convinced these pleasures are
        good. Such a one is incontinent. Another, i.e., intemperate man on the
        contrary is convinced that these pleasures are to be chosen as good in
        themselves, because of an inclination he has by habit. Thus the
        incontinent person who is habitually unconvinced of the goodness of evil
        pleasures, though actually and in passion so convinced from his false
        evaluation on the spot, quickly changes when passion fades. In contrast
        the intemperate person judging physical pleasures are to be chosen in
        every instance does not depart from his judgment so easily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1431. After this he gives his argument: virtue and vice concern in the
        sphere of action a principle that vice destroys and virtue preserves.
        Now this principle of action is the end for the sake of which we act; in
        things to be done it takes the place that axioms or first principles
        have in mathematical demonstrations. just as principles in mathematics
        are not taught by reasoning, so neither is the end in the sphere of
        action taught by reasoning. But man acquires right evaluation regarding
        the principle of things to be done, i.e, the end, by the habit of virtue
        either natural or learned by custom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1432. Then the one making a right evaluation on the objective of
        physical pleasures, appraising the mean to be a good and an end in these
        matters, and excesses, an evil, is temperate. In contrast the one making
        the opposite evaluation from a habit of vice is intemperate. It is clear
        that anyone making a mistake in principles cannot be easily recalled
        from error because reasoning does not teach the principles. From this
        point of view he is not amenable or penitent until the habit causing the
        error is destroyed by a contrary practice of long standing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1433. At “Take the incontinent person” [b, 2] he shows that the
        incontinent are amenable and inclined to be penitent. He says that these
        people exceed the limits of right reason because of passion overcoming
        them to this extent that they do not act according to right reason, but
        still not to the extent of convincing them that they should pursue
        bodily pleasures as good in themselves without restriction. For this
        reason such people continue in a right evaluation of the end after the
        cessation of passion which passes quickly. Such is the incontinent
        person who in this respect is better than the intemperate person and not
        absolutely evil because he does preserve the highest principle, which is
        the correct evaluation of the end. But in a sense this man is evil in
        considering that something contrary to reason is to be done in a
        particular case. Another person, viz., the continent, the direct
        opposite of the incontinent person, stays by right reason and in no way
        departs from it because of passion even in his actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1434. From this it is clear that continence is a good habit because it
        abides by reason. But incontinence is an evil habit because it recedes
        from right reason in its operation. This was the first probable
        statement, which he now concludes after the solution of the fifth
        difficulty raised concerning it.

        There are others who do not stand by the things that seem good but not
        because of incontinence. Thus in Sophocles’ Philoctetes, Neoptolemus did
        not abide by what seemed good although he did this by reason of a
        pleasure that was good, for telling the truth was pleasing to him. He
        had been persuaded by Odysseus to lie. Surely not everyone who does

        Sometimes a man is disposed to enjoy bodily pleasures less than he
        ought, not abiding by the judgment of reason. Hence, between such a
        person and the incontinent man there is a mean, viz., the continent man.
        The idea here is that the incontinent man forsakes reason by enjoying
        physical pleasures too much but the other by enjoying them too little.
        But the continent man adheres to reason and is not diverted by either
        extreme.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1435. After the Philosopher has settled the question of the existence of
        continence and incontinence, and has explained their objects, he now
        settles the question of the precise species of continence. Here are his
        two operations: first [I] he discusses in what sense the continent man
        abides by every principle and the incontinent man forsakes every
        principle. Thus the fourth difficulty (1321) against his second probable
        argument is solved. Next [Lect. 10, II], at “Nor can the same man etc.”
        (B. 1152 a 7), he raises the question of a prudent person being
        incontinent. By this he solves the second difficulty raised against the
        fifth probable statement. On the first point he does two things. First
        [I, A] he shows how continence is related to the right principle which
        is understood as abiding by reason. Then [I, B], at “Sometimes a man
        etc.,” he shows how continence is related to the general nature of
        virtue which consists in following a middle course. He develops the
        first point in a threefold manner. First [A, 1] he shows to what
        principle the continent man laudably adheres and from what principle the
        incontinent man blamably departs. Next [A, 2], at “Some people, however
        etc.,” he shows how some men wrongly hold to a principle. Third [A, 3],
        at “There are others etc.,” he shows how others commendably forsake a
        principle. There are two considerations of the first point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1436. First [A, 1, a] he raises the question whether a man, who abides
        by any principle whatsoever, either true or false, or by any choice
        whatsoever, either good or bad, may be called continent. Or whether only
        he who abides by the right principle and choice is called continent.
        There is a similar question: whether a man who does not abide by any
        principle or choice at all, or who only does not abide by a right
        principle or choice may be called incontinent. Or the question can be
        framed in this way: can a man who does not abide by a wrong principle or
        choice be called incontinent, as was stated in the preceding
        difficulties (1322) ?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1437. Next [A, 1, b], at “A man who abides,” he solves the question
        raised, saying that a man who abides or does not abide by any principle
        at all is said to be continent or incontinent incidentally (<i
          >secundum accidens</i
        >), but a man who does or does not abide by a true principle and a
        correct choice essentially (<i>per se</i>) speaking is said to be
        continent or incontinent. He explains it in this way. If someone chooses
        or pursues, i.e., acquires this for the sake of or instead of that, for
        example, if he chooses gall in place of honey because he thinks it is
        honey from the resemblance in color, it is obvious that speaking
        formally he really chooses and seeks a different thing, namely, honey.
        But incidentally he chooses what is harmful, that which he chooses
        instead, viz., gall.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1438. The supporting argument runs this way: in desirable things, that
        to which the intention of the agent is referred is essentially desired.
        Good, insofar as it is known, is the proper object of the appetitive
        faculty. But that which is beside the intention is only incidentally
        desired. Hence the man who means to choose honey and chooses gall
        instead, essentially (<i>per se</i>) is choosing honey but only
        incidentally gall. Therefore, there may be people considering a false
        argument as true, e.g., someone believing as true this statement: “It is
        good to commit fornication.” If then he sticks by this false conclusion,
        really believing it to be true, he is essentially standing by a true
        reason but incidentally by a false reason. He intended to abide by a
        true reason. This same argument holds for the continent man who departs
        from a false reason which he considers to be true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1439. So it is evident that a man is essentially continent (or
        incontinent) who adheres (or does not adhere) to a true reason but
        incidentally to a false reason. Now what is essential is predicated
        absolutely but what is incidental we predicate in a limited way.
        Consequently he, who adheres to any opinion whatsoever, even a false
        one, is called continent or incontinent in some measure; but he who
        adheres or does not adhere to a true reason or opinion is called
        continent or incontinent in the absolute sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1440. Then [A, 2], at “Some people, however,” he shows how some men
        wrongly hold to a principle. First [A, 2, a] he identifies them. Next
        [A, 2, b], at “They resemble etc.,” he shows how such people compare
        with the continent man. Third [A, 2, c], at “But they differ etc.,” he
        shows the difference. Finally [A, 2, d], at “The word obstinacy etc.,”
        he shows how they compare with the incontinent man. He says first that
        there are some who unreasonably stand by their own opinion. These are
        the people called <i>ischyrognomones</i>, i.e., opinionated or
        obstinate, because it is hard to persuade them of anything. And if they
        have been convinced of something they are not easily changed from that
        opinion. This seems to happen especially to the melancholic who admit a
        thing reluctantly but hold to what they do accept, with great firmness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        140. At “They resemble” [A, 2, b] he compares these obstinate persons to
        the continent man. He says that they apparently have some likeness to
        the continent because they have in excess what the continent have, just
        as the spendthrift resembles a generous soul, and the rash are like the
        self-reliant or brave. Such people maintain their opinion more than they
        should, but the continent man as he should.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1442. Then [A, 2, c], at “But they differ,” he points out the many
        differences of the obstinate from the continent. For evidence of this we
        must consider that a person’s opinion can be changed in two ways. In one
        way on the part of reason itself, for example, if a better reason
        follows. In the other way, on the part of passion perverting the
        judgment of the reason, particularly in an individual practical case.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1443. This then is the difference, that the continent man is not changed
        from his principle by the passion of sensual desire, but nevertheless,
        when it is expedient, he will be rightly convinced when presented with
        another and better reason. Consequently, he is to be praised because he
        is not overcome by sensual desire but by reason. But the other, the
        obstinate, is not changed from opinion by a new reason but rather
        follows passion. And many obstinate persons are seduced by pleasures
        outside reason. They then are censurable in this way because they are
        overcome by passion rather than prevailed upon by reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1444. Next [A, 2, d], at “The word,” he shows what relation the
        obstinate have to the incontinent man. Those called obstinate, he says,
        are also known as <i>idiognomones</i>, i.e., self-opinionated,
        headstrong men. They are undisciplined because unwilling to be taught by
        anyone, they are rude in this way—always wanting to follow their own
        view, they cannot adjust to others. So they are opinionated in their
        excessive quest of pleasure and avoidance of pain. They are glad, when
        they triumph in conversation with others, i.e., if they are not changed
        from their opinion by some argument. They are grieved if their judgments
        or opinions seem so weak that it is necessary to abandon them. Now it is
        proper to the incontinent and effeminate man to desire pleasures and to
        avoid pains excessively. Obviously then the obstinate are more like the
        incontinent than the continent man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1445. At “There are others” [A, 3] he shows in what way some commendably
        forsake a principle. He says that there are still others who, do not
        abide by the things that seem good to them, not from incontinence but
        from a love of virtue. Thus, in Sophocles’ drama on Philoctetes,
        Neoptolemus did not adhere to the things seeming good to him, not from
        incontinence because he had done what he did for pleasure that was not
        really bad but rather good. He was seeking a good in a sense, in
        speaking the truth and this was pleasing to him. But he had been
        persuaded by Ulysses to tell a lie for the good of his country; he did
        not keep his resolution out of love for the truth. This did not make him
        guilty of incontinence. For not everyone who acts for pleasure is
        intemperate and evil or incontinent, but only those who yield to
        shameful pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1146. Then [I, B], at "Sometimes a man," he shows how continence is
        related to the notion of virtue, to which it pertains to follow the
        mean. On this point he does two things. First [ B, 1], he shows that
        continence like temperance consists in a mean. Next [B, 2], at “Since
        language is etc.,” he shows that continence, because of its similarity,
        is sometimes called temperance. He discusses this initial point under
        three aspects. First [B, 1, a] he shows in what things continence is a
        mean, saying that occasionally someone enjoys physical pleasures less
        than he should. not for a virtuous purpose but out of disgust. This
        state is not in accord with a correct and reasonable judgment which
        indicates some necessity for these pleasures. The incontinent man quite
        otherwise, we know (1444), is not reasonable in enjoying such pleasures
        more than he should.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1447. So the mean between these two extremes is represented by the
        continent man. For the incontinent man forsakes reason because of excess
        and the insensible man because of deficiency. The reason is that the
        first wants to enjoy pleasures more than he ought and the other less
        than he ought. But the continent man perseveres in reason and is not
        diverted from it by either extreme, i.e., too much or too little.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1448. Next [B, 1, b], at "Since indeed," he shows how (excess and defect
        of continence) are related to good and evil. It is evident from our
        discussions (1433-1434) that continence is something good. So it
        necessarily follows that the two habits opposed to it (by excess and
        defect) are bad, as is obvious from the very fact that they do not
        adhere to reason but take either too much or too little.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1449. At “But because” [B, 1, c] he responds to a foreseen question: why
        is incontinence alone apparently opposed to continence, which should
        have two contrary habits? This happens because one extreme—departure
        from reason by defect—is rare, and consequently not so evident as the
        opposite extreme. Indeed the departure from right reason by excess is
        quite frequent in bodily pleasure. By the same reason temperance seems
        to be opposed only to intemperance, since insensibility is not
        conspicuous because it happens in few cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1450. Here we should consider that extremes are opposed to continence in
        two different respects. First from the point of view of reason to which
        continence adheres, and under this aspect the analogy has already been
        presented (1441-1443): what prodigality is to generosity, obstinacy is
        to continence. The opposite extreme relating to the defect is the vice
        of instability. Second from the point of view of restraining desire
        there are extremes. And under this aspect continence is a medium between
        these extremes—our present problem.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1451. Next [ B, 2 1, at “Since language is,” he shows that continence is
        at times called temperance for its similarity. First [B, 2, a] in this
        similarity he compares continence with temperance. Next [B, 2, b], at
        "Although the incontinent etc.," he compares incontinence with
        intemperance. He discusses the first point under three subheadings.
        First [a, i] he states his intention: continence is sometimes called
        temperance metaphorically, since similar things permit metaphor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1452. Then [a, ii], at "Indeed the continent," he points up the
        resemblance. The continent person has the ability to do nothing against
        principle for the sake of carnal pleasures, and the temperate person has
        the same ability.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1453. Finally [a, iii], at “But the first,” he shows several
        differences. The temperate man does not have the evil desires of the
        continent because his sensual desire is well ordered by his habit of
        temperance. The second difference, stated at “and the second etc.,” [a,
        iii], is that the temperate man by his habit of temperance is not
        delighted contrary to reason, while the continent man is disposed to
        take unreasonable pleasure though he is not seduced by his passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1454. Then [B, 2, b], at “Although the incontinent,” he compares
        incontinence with intemperance: though the incontinent and the
        intemperate man seem alike, they do differ. Hence—by
        resemblance—incontinence is called intemperance. The resemblance is that
        both pursue carnal delights, but they differ because the intemperate man
        thinks he should follow such pleasures by perverse judgment on his goal.
        Quite otherwise the incontinent man has no such idea because his
        judgment remains unimpaired, as stated previously (1312, 1426,

        Then, too, the habitually incontinent are more easily cured than the
        naturally incontinent, for it is easier to change a habit than a nature.
        A habit is difficult to change for the very reason that it is similar to
        nature; as Evenus would have it: “I say that constant application
        evolves harmoniously, and it must become men’s nature in the end.” We
        have now discussed the notion of continence and incontinence, of
        perseverance and effeminacy; and we have shown in what way these habits
        are related to one another.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1455. Now that the Philosopher has shown how the continent stand by—and
        the incontinent depart from—reason, he goes on to raise the question
        [II]: ‘Can prudence (the right reason of things to be done) co-exist
        with incontinence?” And his answer resolves his second hesitation which
        he, was advancing on the fifth probability (1317-1319). In this business
        there are two steps. First [II, A] this conclusion that prudence and
        incontinence are incompatible; second [II, B], at “They are similar
        etc.,” the relationship of the incontinent to prudence. He discusses the
        initial step in a threefold manner. First [A, 1] he plots his course,
        saying that it is impossible for the same man to be prudent and
        incontinent at the same time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1456. Then [A, 2], at “for we have,” he proves this statement with two
        arguments. The first [A, 2, a], already explained in the sixth book
        (1172, 1273, 1275, 1285, 1287), is this: prudence accompanies moral
        virtue, so that a prudent person is likewise morally good But in the
        present problem of the incontinent there is no moral virtue insofar as
        the passions are seductive. There fore it is impossible to be prudent
        and still incontinent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1457. At “Again, one” he gives his second argument [A, 2, b]. Prudence
        involves not just knowledge but practice. According to previous
        discussions in the sixth book (1216, 1239, 1240, 1269, 1289) prudence
        not merely counsels and judges what is to be done; it commands. The
        incontinent man fails in practice, i.e., he does not operate according
        to right reason. Therefore the prudent man cannot be incontinent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1458. Third [A, 2, c], at “However nothing,” he offers a reason for the
        phenomenon of prudent people being incontinent. There is no reason why a
        shrewd character, ingenious and skillful, cannot be incontinent. So, it
        seems at times that prudent people are incontinent precisely because the
        shrewd have a reputation for prudence. Now the reason (for the mistaken
        idea) is the difference between prudence and shrewdness, which is (in
        the way already described in the sixth book—1275, 1279, 1280) that
        prudence as it were adds a further connotation to shrewdness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1459. Then [II, B], at “They are similar,” he compares the incontinent
        to the prudent man. He treats this point in a twofold manner. First [B,
        1] he compares the incontinent to the prudent man. Next [B, 2], at
        “Among the kinds etc.,” he compares the species of incontinence. He
        develops the first point in two ways. First [1, a] he makes the
        comparison. Then [1, b], at “The incontinent man etc.,” he uses a
        comparison. He handles the initial point in a twofold fashion. First [a,
        i] he makes his comparison. Then [a, ii], at “Therefore etc.,” he infers
        a corollary from that. There are three considerations on the first
        point. First [i, x] he says what he is going to do. He states that the
        incontinent is like the prudent man in a limited way—according to
        reason—for both reason correctly. But they differ according to
        deliberate choice, the prudent man following it and the incontinent man
        not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1460. Here, in the second place [i, y], at “This is not,” he shows in
        what sense prudence and incontinence approach reason, by denying that
        the incontinent person—as it were—habitually knows and actually
        speculates (i.e., considers) particular things to be chosen. Rather he
        acts like a dreamer or a drunkard and in whom the habit of reason is
        suspended (cf. previous explanation 1351-1352).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1461. Third [i, z], at “So he acts,” he clarifies his statement about
        the difference in deliberate choice. The incontinent person sins
        willingly enough, for he knows in a way (i.e., in general) what he does
        and why and the other circumstances. Therefore his act is voluntary.
        Still he is not bad because he does not act by choice; when he is not in
        the throes of passion, his choice is the good or equitable. But when
        passion sweeps over him, his choice crumbles and he wills evil. So the
        incontinent man differs from the prudent man according to deliberate
        choice because the choice of the prudent man is not corrupted but that
        of the incontinent man is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1462. Next [a, ii], at “Therefore,” he draws a corollary. Since the
        incontinent man did make a good choice before passion but wills evil
        through passion, he is consequently partly bad (he wills evil) but not
        absolutely unjust or evil (not a schemer doing evil-as it
        were-deliberately and by choice). However, one class of the incontinent,
        the weak, deliberate but do not stand by their resolution; another
        class, the melancholic and the highly sensitive—previously called
        impetuous (1421)—do not deliberate at all. So it is clear that neither
        do evil deliberately and by choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1463. From these discussions (1455-1462) we can gather what the subject
        of continence and incontinence is. We cannot say that the subject of
        each is sensual desire since the continent and incontinent are alike,
        both having evil desires; nor is the subject of each the reason since
        both have right reason. It remains then that the subject of each is the
        will because the incontinent man voluntarily sins, as was just pointed
        out (1461); the continent man voluntarily keeps to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1464. Then [i, b], at “The incontinent man,” he uses a comparison with
        which he does two things. First [b, i] he presents his comparison: the
        incontinent man resembles a city that plans intelligently, arranges
        everything logically necessary, has good laws, but keeps none of them.
        Thus Anaxandrides sarcastically said that a certain city wanted laws but
        cared nothing about observing them. Likewise, the incontinent man does
        not use the right reason he has. But the bad or the intemperate man in
        using perverse reason is like a city observing bad laws.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1465. Next [b, ii], at “Continence and incontinence’ “ he explains the
        last statement (how the incontinent man is like a city that does not
        observe good laws). In fact, not every excess of right reason makes a
        man incontinent, but continence and incontinence are so named as being
        beyond the inclination or habit of the majority. The continent man
        adheres to right reason more than most people can, for he is the master
        of sensual desires which are the master of most people. But the
        incontinent man abides by reason less than most men, because he is
        overcome by sensual desires which most men overcome, as indicated before
        (237, 439, 1406, 1410).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1466. At “Among the kinds” [B, 2] he compares the species of the
        incontinent according to two differences. First [B, 2, a] he says that
        among the kinds of incontinence, that by which the melancholic—who do
        not deliberate—incontinently operate is more easily cured than the
        incontinence of those who deliberate but do not abide by the
        deliberation. The reason is that the melancholic, it seems, can be cured
        when counsel has been taken, but not the others (1442-1443).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1467. Then [B, 2, b], at “Then too,” he compares the incontinent
        according to another difference. He says that those who are incontinent
        by habit are more easily cured than the incontinent by nature, i.e.,
        bodily temperament inclining to it, because a habit can be changed more
        easily than a nature. That, for the sake of which a thing exists, is
        itself greater. But a habit is difficult to change because of this, that
        it is like nature. Evenus the poet expresses it this way: “I declare
        that daily meditation (constant application) develops agreeably,
        smoothly and harmoniously. This, I say, in the end (when perfected) is
        nature for all.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1468. Finally he ends with an epilogue that we have discussed the notion
        of continence and incontinence, of perseverance and effeminacy; and we
        have shown in what way these habits are related to one another.

        COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1469. After the Philosopher has finished his investigation of continence
        and incontinence, showing that they are concerned with pleasures and
        pains, now he intends to investigate pleasures and pains themselves.
        First [I] he states that this consideration fits in with his present
        intention. Then [II], at “Some philosophers etc.,” he proceeds with his
        intention. He discusses the first point from three aspects. First [I, A]
        he states his objective, saying that a consideration of pleasure and
        pain pertains to the philosopher who applies himself to political
        science to which the whole of moral doctrine is reducible as to a
        principal science, as was pointed out in the beginning (2630).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1470. Second [I, B], at “for it is etc.,” he demonstrates his
        proposition by three arguments: first [B, 1], as the end of a master art
        is the measure to which all affairs of the art are referred, so is
        pleasure in the matter of moral study. Relevant to pleasure, one thing
        is called bad, and another, in like fashion, good. A good man is said to
        be one who is pleased by good things. A bad man, one delighted by evil
        things. The same judgment is passed on-actions inasmuch as something
        proceeding from wicked pleasure is judged wicked; on the other hand,
        good, as proceeding from good pleasure. In any science the principal
        consideration is that which is taken as a rule. Therefore the moral
        philosopher in a very special way concerns himself with pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1471. At “Besides, it is etc.” [B, 2] his second argument proceeds: it
        is not only proper but necessary for the moral philosopher to
        investigate pleasure because his duty is to study virtues and vices. As
        explained in the second book (266-267, 268, 269-272), moral virtue and
        vice are concerned with pleasures and pains. Therefore, it is necessary
        for the moralist to consider pleasure and pain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1472. Then the third argument [B, 3], at “Moreover, many people etc.”:
        the moral philosopher must consider happiness as the ultimate end. But
        the majority, including Aristotle himself, maintain that happiness is
        connected with pleasure. Hence, among the Greeks the term “happy” is
        derived from the verb “to rejoice exceedingly.” Therefore, it is the
        business of the moral philosopher to investigate pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1473. Then [II], at “Some philosophers,” he investigates pleasure and
        pain themselves: first [II, A] in general; then [Lect. 14] at “In the
        matter of etc.” (B. 1154 a 8), in particular he treats physical
        pleasures with which, as he has already said, continence and
        incontinence are concerned. He discusses his first point from a double
        point of view. First [A, 1] he takes up the opinions of philosophers
        opposing pleasure. Then [Lect. 13], at “But it is obvious etc.” (B. 1153
        b), he determines that the truth is the opposite. On this first point he
        has three operations: first [1, a] he gives opinions opposed to
        pleasure; second [1, b], at “According to them etc.,” he presents
        supporting arguments; finally [1, c; Lect. 12], at “From what follows
        etc.,” he refutes them. First then, three opinions. Some philosophers
        held that no pleasure could be good either intrinsically or
        incidentally; and that if a pleasurable thing is good, pleasure and good
        will not be identical. Others were of the opinion that some pleasures
        are good but most are evil. Still others maintained that even if all
        pleasures are good, nevertheless no pleasure can be the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1474. At “According to them” [1, b] he presents the arguments in favor
        of these opinions. At the outset he gives the arguments [b, i] for the
        first opinion. Then [b, ii], at “But not all etc.,” he gives the
        argument for the second opinion. Last [b, iii], at “Furthermore, no
        pleasure etc.,” he argues for the third opinion. Relative to the first
        point he offers six reasons. The first [i, u] is taken from the
        definition of pleasure given by those who say that pleasure is a kind of
        process of the senses to a natural term. When something, as it were
        connatural to us, is consciously produced in our nature, we delight in
        it, e.g., eating and drinking. Now no such process belongs to the class
        of ends (building something is not the thing built) but is rather a
        means to the end. But good has the nature (ratio) of end. Therefore no
        process, and consequently no pleasure, is good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1475. The second reason [i, v], at “Moreover, the temperate,” is this.
        No one is praised as virtuous for avoiding good; yet a temperate man is
        praised for avoiding pleasures. Therefore, pleasure is not something
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1476. He gives the third reason at “Again, the prudent” [i, w]. It is
        this: as the prudent man seeks freedom from pain so he seeks freedom
        from pleasure. But pain is not good and by the same token neither is

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1477. The fourth reason [i, x], at “Besides, pleasure,” follows.
        Prudence is not impeded by any good. But prudence is impeded by
        pleasure, and all the more as the pleasures are greater. From this it
        seems that of themselves and not merely incidentally they are obstacles.
        Thus, sexual pleasure obviously very intense impedes the mind to such an
        extent that no one is capable of exercising the act of understanding at
        the time of the act of pleasure, for the whole attention of the mind is
        drawn to it. Consequently, pleasure is not something good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1478. The fifth reason [i, y], at “Then too,” is the following. Every
        human good seems to be the work of some art, because man’s good comes
        from reason. But pleasure is not the product of any art, since no art is
        merely for pleasure. Therefore, pleasure is not something good.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1479. He gives the sixth reason at “Finally, children” [i, z], and it is
        this. What is childish and animal in man is blamable. But children and
        dumb animals pursue pleasures. Therefore, pleasure is not something
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1480. Next [b, ii], at “But not all,” he shows that not all pleasures
        are good. He says that this is proved by the fact that some pleasures
        are shameful, i.e., dishonorable, opprobrious, notoriously evil, etc.;
        and over and above this, other pleasures are evidently harmful because
        some cause sickness. So it is clear that not all pleasures are good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1481. Then [b, iii], at “Further. more,” he proves that no pleasure is
        the highest good, even if all pleasures are good, for the end is what is
        best. But pleasure is not an end but rather a kind of process.
        Consequently, pleasure is not the highest good.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1482. He concludes by way of summary: for all practical purposes, these
        approximate the points raised against pleasure.

        First of all, good can be distinguished into the absolute and relative
        good. This distinction is verified of nature and habits, and
        consequently of movements and processes. Some of these (processes) seem
        depraved, indeed some are absolutely wicked. However to a particular
        person they may not seem so, but instead desirable. And again some such
        processes, ordinarily undesirable, at times—even though the times be
        few—appear desirable. Some of these are not pleasures at all, but merely
        appear to be; those for instance that are painful yet taken by the sick
        as medicine.

        Besides, one good is an activity and another is a habit. Now those
        actions producing a natural habit are pleasurable only incidentally. But
        a pleasurable activity in the appetites indicates an undeveloped and
        imperfect state, and proceeds from some dispositional or natural
        principle. For there are pleasures without pain and desire, e.g., that
        which has to do with contemplative activity, and in these nature is not
        deficient. An indication of this is that delight is not taken in the
        same pleasurable objects when nature is normal and when it is surfeited.
        But a normal nature finds pleasure in things essentially enjoyable while
        a surfeited nature enjoys pleasures opposed to those which are naturally
        enjoyable, for example, pungent and bitter foods, none of which are
        pleasant either by nature or without some qualification. Therefore the
        pleasures they produce are not—simply speaking—pleasant; for, as
        pleasant things are compared, so the pleasures they cause.

        There is no need for some other thing to be better than pleasure because
        of the opinion of some that the result is better than the process.
        Indeed, not all pleasures are processes nor even involve them; in fact
        some are activities, and consequently, ends. Neither do such pleasures
        come from something achieved but from use. Not all pleasures have an end
        extrinsic to themselves but only pleasures connected with things leading
        to the perfection of our nature. Likewise, for this reason it is not
        correct to define pleasure as an experienced process; rather it should
        be called an activity of a natural habit. In place of “experienced” we
        should put “unimpeded.” But pleasure seemed to some a process because
        concerned with what is principally good (an activity), that they
        consider a process, although it is really something consequent to it.

        The arguments that the temperate man avoids pleasures, that the prudent
        man seeks a life free from pain and that children and brutes seek
        pleasures—all have the same solution; for we have shown how some
        pleasures are good in the absolute sense and how not all pleasures are
        of this nature. These non-absolute pleasures are pursued by children and
        animals and cause the grief that the prudent man avoids. The reference
        is to physical pleasures accompanied by both desire and pain. These are
        the kind just mentioned (non-absolute goods); and excesses in them make
        a man intemperate. The temperate man avoids these pleasures, for he has
        other pleasures distinctively his own.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1483. Now that Aristotle has stated the arguments for these previous
        opinions, he begins their refutation [i, c]. First of all [c, i] he
        outlines his discussion which will show that the arguments advanced do
        not really prove that pleasure is not good, nor that it is not the very
        best thing. He begins with the second opinion, “Not all pleasures are
        good,” because in a way this is true. The other two (i.e., the first and
        the third) he deals with together, because their arguments are so much
        alike that they can be answered simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1484. Then [c, ii], at “First of all,” he makes the actual rebuttal.
        First [ii, x] he introduces distinctions to be made, by which we can
        know how pleasure is good or bad. Next [ii, y], at “There is no need,”
        he refutes arguments already presented. On the first point he makes two
        distinctions, both taken according to the distinct good which is the
        object of pleasure. First [x, aa], something is good in two ways: first,
        absolutely; then, relative to some individual. Because all things tend
        to good, so do both natures and habits that are ordered either to good
        absolutely or to the good of an individual. And because movements and
        generations proceed from particular natures and habits, they too must be
        consequently related to these things in the same way: some are good
        absolutely and others for a particular individual. Hence on the
        supposition that pleasures are movements and processes, as our opponent
        contends, four kinds of pleasure must be distinguished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1485. Some of these are good absolutely, as pleasures in virtuous works.
        On the contrary, others seem absolutely bad, although in a way desirable
        to a particular person by reason of some necessity, for example,
        medicine to a sick man. A third class are not consistently chosen by
        anyone but only at times and for a short period, e.g., the taking of
        food in the case of extreme necessity. A fourth class of pleasures
        comprise counterfeit pleasures because of the perverse disposition of
        the one who delights in them: such are pleasures accompanied by sadness
        or pain, and taken to relieve that pain. This is evident of diversions
        resorted to by the feverish or the weak, for sometimes it seems a relief
        to a sick man to twist and turn in bed and take bitter foods and so
        forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1486. At “Besides, one” [x, bb] he makes the other distinction, that
        good is twofold. One is an activity, for instance, contemplation; the
        other is a habit, for example, science. But of these, activity seems to
        be the perfect good because it is an additional perfection, while habit
        seems to be the imperfect good because it is an initial perfection.
        Consequently, genuine and perfect pleasure is found in the good that
        consists in an activity. Nevertheless those actions or movements that
        produce a natural habit in man, i.e., which are formative natural
        habits, are indeed pleasurable but only incidentally. They do not yet
        have the nature of good because they precede even the habit itself,
        which is the initial perfection. But by reason of a relation to this
        good they have the nature of goodness and pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1487. Obviously a pleasurable activity accompanied by desire is not the
        activity of a perfect habit, since there is nothing left to desire that
        belongs to the habit when it is perfect. Therefore an activity of this
        kind must proceed from some dispositional. or natural principle, which
        is accompanied by pain; it is not without pain that a man covets a
        natural perfection that he does not yet possess.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1488. However, it is evident that not all pleasurable activities are of
        this kind, because some pleasures are without pain and desire, as
        obviously is the pleasure that has to do with contemplative activity.
        Such pleasure is not associated with any need in nature but rather
        proceeds from its perfection, i.e., from reason perfected by the habit
        of science. So then the pleasures connected with activities proceeding
        from habits, i.e., natures and forms already existing, are pleasures in
        the true and perfect sense. But those producing habits and natures are
        not pleasures in the true and perfect sense but only in an imperfect
        manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1489. An indication of this is that if pleasures of this kind were
        really and completely enjoyable, they would be so under any condition.
        This is patently false because a gorged nature (present when a man has
        eaten too much) and a temperate or well regulated nature do not enjoy
        the same pleasure. Nature properly controlled finds delight in things
        essentially enjoyable and in keeping with human nature. But a gorged
        nature enjoys pleasures just the opposite of those that are
        unconditionally enjoyable. In fact well-fed people enjoy pungent and
        bitter foods as a help to digestion, although nothing naturally
        pleasant, not being akin to human nature, but excessive. From this it
        follows that the pleasures produced by them are not pleasures in the
        unqualified sense. The reason is that, as enjoyable things are compared,
        so are the pleasures they cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1490. Next [ii, y], at “There is no need,” he refutes these arguments
        (1473-1481): first [y, aa] the refutation of the argument for opinion
        number three; then [y, bb], at “But to prove etc.,” the dismissal of the
        argument for opinion number two; finally [y, cc], at “However, neither
        etc.,” the refutation of the argument behind the first opinion. He says
        first there is no need to exclude pleasure entirely as the highest good
        so that something else must be better than pleasure. Some hold this for
        the reason that the result is more excellent than the process. But they
        consider pleasure a kind of process.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1491. Certainly there is a false supposition here, because not all
        pleasures are kinds of process nor are they accompanied by some process,
        as is evident from the premises (1487-1489). Only those pleasures that
        create habits with pain and desire are so. But some pleasures are
        activities, and have the nature of end because an activity is the second
        perfection, as has been pointed out (1486). Such pleasures do not come
        from production, i.e., from things that are being formed but from use.
        What Aristotle means is: these pleasures do not consist in the formation
        of habits but in the exercise of already existing habits. Obviously then
        it is not necessary that the purpose of all pleasures be something other
        than the pleasures themselves; this is verified only in pleasures
        following operations that lead to the perfection of a nature and
        accompany desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1492. Likewise, by reason of this we must reject the definition of
        pleasure introduced with the first argument for to define pleasure as an
        experienced process—this is proper to imperfect pleasures—rather we must
        make the definition that harmonizes with perfect pleasures: pleasure is
        the connatural activity of a habit already existing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1493. In place of the word “experienced” they used, let us substitute
        “unimpeded,” so that accordingly the definition of pleasure will be: an
        unimpeded activity of a habit that is natural, harmonizing with the
        nature of the one having it. Now the impediment to the operation causes
        difficulty in operating, and this prevents pleasure. For this reason it
        seemed to some that pleasure is a kind of process because pleasure is
        concerned with what is principally good, namely, an activity that they
        consider to be the same as generation, although it is not the same but
        something consequent to it. In fact generation is a process toward a
        nature, but activity is the use of a natural form or habit.

        1494. Then [y, bb], at “But to prove,” he disproves the reason for the
        second opinion. He says that to conclude that some pleasures are evil
        because some pleasurable objects lead to sickness is the same as to
        infer that some remedies are evil because they are expensive. We must
        say then that both, pleasurable and healthful things, are evil from one
        angle, inasmuch as pleasurable objects are injurious to health and
        remedies cost money but they are not evil in this, that they are
        curative or, delightful. Such logic leads to a conclusion that
        contemplation is bad because at times it injures health.

        1495. At “However, neither prudence [y, cc] he refutes the arguments
        supporting the first opinion-the first argument has already been
        resolved (1490-1494). Hence, first [cc, a’] he answers the fourth
        argument. Next [cc, b’], at “No pleasure etc.,” he replies to the fifth
        argument. Last [cc, c’], at “The arguments that etc.,” he disproves the
        second, third, and sixth arguments together. He says first that neither
        prudence nor any other habit is impeded by its own pleasure arising from
        the habit itself but by pleasure alien to it. Nay rather, proper
        pleasures are a help to every habit. Thus the pleasure which a man takes
        in investigating and learning causes him to investigate and learn more.
        So it does not follow that pleasure must be an evil to everyone.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1496. Next [cc, b’], at “No pleasure,” he replies to the fifth argument,
        saying that it is reasonable to maintain that no pleasure is a product
        of art. The reason is that what is truly and properly pleasure follows
        activity and not process. But art has the power to bring about some
        process because it is the right plan of things to be made, as was
        explained in the sixth book (1153, 1160, 1166); however, it does not
        have the power to bring about activity but only the capacity from which
        activity springs. Still a rebuttal could be offered: the arts of
        perfumery and cookery seem ordered to pleasures. Just the same these
        arts cannot give pleasure; they more precisely manufacture things which
        may give pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1497. Then [cc, c’], at “The arguments that,” he disproves the second,
        third, and sixth arguments. He says that the fact that the temperate man
        avoids pleasures (the second reason), that the prudent man seeks a life
        free from pain (the third reason), and that children and dumb animals
        seek pleasures (the sixth reason).all have the same solution. We have
        shown (1485) how some pleasures are good in the absolute sense, and how
        not all pleasures are of this kind. Such pleasures (the non-absolute
        kind) children and brutes seek, and it is the pain in these that the
        prudent man avoids. The question here concerns physical pleasures
        accompanied by desire and pain. These pleasures are not good in an
        unqualified way. And from their excesses a man becomes intemperate.
        Consequently these same pleasures a temperate man avoids. But still
        others are characteristic of the temperate man precisely as he enjoys
        his own activity; and these he does not avoid but rather seeks.

        1498. After the Philosopher has treated the opinions and answered the
        arguments of those attacking pleasure, he now shows the opposite truth.
        He supports his statement first [I] by direct proofs; then [II], at
        “Obviously if etc.,” by concluding to the inconsistent. On the first
        point he does two things. First [I, A] he shows that pleasure is a good;
        next [I, B], at “However, there is etc.,” that one pleasure is the
        highest good. He discuses the first point from two aspects. First [A, 1]
        he gives his argument. Then [A, 2], at “To answer etc.,” he rules out
        one answer. He remarks first that everyone admits that pain in itself is
        something bad and to be avoided; and this is twofold. For one kind of
        pain is evil simply, e.g., sadness about good; the other kind is evil in
        a limited way, as a hindrance to good, since even sadness about evil
        hinders the soul from doing the good readily and quickly.

        1499. Obviously there are two contraries of what is evil and
        inadmissible: one is evil and to be avoided, the other is good. Thus to
        cowardice, an evil, are opposed fortitude as a good and rashness as an
        evil. But to pain is opposed pleasure as a good; hence he concludes
        pleasure is necessarily a good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1500. Then [A, 2], at “To answer” he excludes an answer to this
        argument. The reason offered doesn’t seem valid because it concludes
        from one disjunctive element to its other part: if some good, or a thing
        to be avoided, is contrary to what is to be avoided it seems that
        pleasure which is contrary to pain-something to be shunned-is a good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1501. For this reason Speusippus, a nephew and successor of Plato in the
        Academy, answered that, as the greater is opposed to the less and the
        equal, so is pain opposed to pleasure, not as to an equal but as the
        greater to the less and conversely. Not as an extreme evil to a medium
        good but as one extreme evil to another, for example, what is deficient
        to what is excessive, or the reverse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1502. But Aristotle says that this answer is not plausible because it
        would follow that pleasure is really evil according to its own nature,
        like excess and defect. But no o ne maintains this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1503. The Platonists, who were of the opinion that pleasure is not a
        good, did not hold that pleasure is evil simply and in itself, but they
        denied that it is a good inasmuch as it is something imperfect or an
        obstacle to virtue, as is evident from the procedure of the previous
        argument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1504. Next [I, B], at “However, there is,” he shows that one pleasure is
        the highest good. First [B, 1] he explains his proposition. Then [B, 2],
        at “Bodily pleasures,” he assigns the reason for an error. He shows the
        first point [i, a] by two arguments; the second argument [i, b] begins
        at “The fact that etc.” On the first point he does two things. First [a,
        i] he gives his argument (the first). Next [a, ii], at “For this reason
        etc.,” he clarifies his statement by some indications, inferring some
        corollaries from the discussions. He treats the first point in a twofold
        manner. First [i, x] he refutes a contrary argument. Some pleasures seem
        to be evil; from this a person can conclude that pleasure is not the
        best thing. But Aristotle says that this does not prevent pleasure from
        being the highest good. Likewise we see that a particular science is the
        highest, viz., wisdom, as was pointed out in the sixth book (1184);
        nevertheless some sciences are bad, not precisely as sciences, but on
        account of a defect they have either on the part of their
        principles—because they proceed from false principles—or on the part of
        the matter, as appears in the practical sciences whose use leads to
        evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1505. Second [i, y], at “Perhaps it is,” he gives the argument for his
        statement. He says there are some unimpeded activities of every habit.
        But happiness is an unimpeded activity either of all good habits or of
        one of them, as is evident from the discussions in the first book (118,
        130). Hence it is necessary that unimpeded activities of this kind are
        desirable in themselves. But pleasure is an unimpeded activity as we
        have just indicated (1492-1493)Consequently there is a highest pleasure,
        that in which happiness consists, although many pleasures are
        unqualifiedly evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1506. At “For this reason” [a, ii] he clarifies his statement by
        indications, inferring some corollaries. The first [a, ii, x] is that
        because happiness is an unimpeded activity—and it also causes
        pleasure—everyone thinks that the happy life is pleasurable; and they
        understandably connect pleasure with happiness because no perfect
        activity is impeded. But happiness is a perfect good, as was explained
        in the first book (111, 112, 117, 118, 201, 122). Therefore it is an
        unimpeded activity inasmuch as it causes pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1507. From this he further concludes, at “Therefore the happy” [a, ii,
        y], that because happiness is an unimpeded activity, the happy man needs
        the goods of the body, such as general health and an uninjured state,
        then external goods-called goods of fortune-so that he may not be
        impeded in his activity by a lack of them. People who say that a
        virtuous man is happy even when tossed about and overcome by great
        misfortune talk nonsense, whether they say this willingly (as it were
        assenting to the statement by intuition) or unwillingly (as it were
        forced by reason contrary to the available evidence). The reference of
        course is to the Stoic opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1508. He infers a third corollary at “Because of this need” [a, ii, z]:
        since happiness needs good fortune, it seemed to some philosophers that
        happiness and good fortune are identical. But this is not so, because
        too much of the good things is an obstacle to happiness since some
        people are hindered by wealth from the work of virtue in which happiness
        consists. Then it is not right that a superabundance of this kind should
        be called good fortune, since the limit, i.e., the end, or the norm of
        good fortune is established in comparison with happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1509. Then [i, b], at “The fact that,” he gives his second argument (by
        inference) to prove that happiness is the highest good. Hence, he first
        states his argument [b, i]: the fact that everyone pursues pleasure is
        some indication that pleasure is the highest good; for a thing on which
        many, at least, agree cannot be entirely false. Thus, it is proverbial
        that a saying generally expressed among the people never dies
        completely. The reason is that nature does not fail in all or in most
        cases but only in a few. Therefore what is found among all or most men
        seems to arise from a disposition of nature which inclines neither to
        evil nor falsehood. So it seems that pleasure in which the desire of all
        men concur is the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1510. Next [b, ii], at “However, since,” he excludes a possible
        objection, “Not all desire the same pleasure,” by returning that his
        main contention is not so damaged. This for two reasons: first [b, ii,
        x] because the same nature and the same habit are not best for everyone
        either really or apparently; for the best tendency in a man is one thing
        and in a horse another. Likewise the best tendency in a young man is
        different from that in an old man. And because what is agreeable to each
        one is delightful to him, it follows that not all desire the same
        pleasure although all do desire pleasure. This is the reason why
        pleasure, but not the same pleasure, is the highest good for all; just
        as the same tendency of nature is not the best for all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1511. He gives the second reason at “Perhaps they” [b, ii, y], stating
        that it can be said that all men seek the same pleasure according to
        natural desire but not according to their own judgment. Indeed not all
        think in their heart or say with their lips that the same pleasure is
        the best. Nevertheless everyone is inclined by nature to the same
        pleasure as the highest, namely, the contemplation of rational truth
        inasmuch as all men naturally desire to know. This happens because all
        things have in themselves something divine, i.e., an inclination of
        nature—which is derived from the first principle—or even their
        (substantial) form itself which is the basis of the inclination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1512. At “Bodily pleasures” [B, 2] he assigns the reason why some
        philosophers were of the opinion that pleasure is not a good or the
        highest good. He says the reason is that bodily pleasures have usurped
        the name pleasure for themselves as an inherited possession because we
        are more often inclined to them as being connected with the necessary
        things of life, and because everyone shares in them as being sensibly
        perceptible and known to all. Moreover, they alone are commonly
        acknowledged because people consider them the only pleasures. Since
        pleasures of this kind are not the highest, some think pleasure is not
        the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1513. Then [II], at “Obviously if,” he explains his proposition by
        concluding to three inconsistencies. The first [II, A] is that if
        pleasure and pleasurable activity are not something; good it follows
        that the happy man may not live a pleasant life; for happiness not being
        a good in itself, the life of a happy man should not require pleasure if
        pleasure were not something good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1514. Next [II, B], at “But it would,” he says that if pleasure is not a
        good it is possible that living in pain is not an evil; for if pleasure
        is neither good nor evil the same would hold for pain which is the
        opposite. Thus pain would not be something to be avoided.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1515. Last [If, C], at “Nor would,” he concludes to the third
        inconsistency. It follows that the life of the virtuous man is not
        pleasurable, if his activities are not pleasurable-which would be the
        case if pleasure were not a good. But it is obvious that virtue is
        productive of good.

        or they are good up to a certain point. The reason would seem to be that
        if in such habits and activities there is not an excess of what is good,
        neither is such pleasure excessive. But if this excess is present in the
        habits or activities it will also be present in the pleasure. Now a
        superabundance of what is good can exist in bodily goods. Moreover, a
        man is described as evil for pursuing not necessary goods but an excess
        of them. Indeed everybody enjoys food, wine, and sex, but not always as
        they should. However, it is the opposite in regard to pain, for
        everybody shuns not merely its excess but absolutely all of it. In fact
        pain is not opposed to the excess of physical pleasures, except to the
        man who pursues this excess.

        The first reason is: they drive away pain; and since pleasure is a
        remedy against the excesses of pain, men seek abundant pleasures and in
        general bodily pleasures. These seem vehement inasmuch as they are
        remedies and for this reason are avidly sought because they appear

        Likewise it seems that pleasure is not something good for these two
        reasons, as has been said. First, some pleasures are naturally evil and
        follow from evil actions; these are desirable to certain beings either
        from birth—for example, dumb animals—or from habituation, like the
        pleasures of evil men. Second, other bodily pleasures are remedies for
        some defect. Now it is better to be perfect than in the process of
        becoming perfect. But pleasures of this kind are taken by those who are
        being perfected. Therefore they are good only incidentally.

        Moreover, because bodily pleasures are vehement they are sought by those
        incapable of enjoying others. Consequently such men stimulate for
        themselves a thirst for these pleasures. Since people of this sort do
        not have other pleasures for recreation, it is not blameworthy for them
        to enjoy those that are not harmful; but it is wrong if the pleasures
        are harmful.

        But the melancholic have a continual need of a restorative because of
        their nature, for their body incessantly undergoes a kind of corrosion
        due to their temperament. For this reason they are always urged by
        strong desire; for pleasure drives out both the opposite pain and any
        other when the pleasure is intense. As a result the melancholic

        On the other hand pleasures which are without an opposite pain do not
        have an excess, for they are concerned with things which are pleasurable
        naturally and not incidentally. And I call those things incidentally
        pleasurable that are curative. The reason is that when a cure is wrought
        by the action of the part that remains healthy, the activity then seems
        pleasurable. But those things naturally pleasurable produce an activity

        However, the same object is not always pleasurable to man because our

        But change is the most delightful of all things, as the poet says. (Yet
        this happens) because of some defect. just as a man readily changes

        completely good. We have discussed continence and incontinence, pleasure

        others bad. We must now go on to the discussion of friendship.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <b>COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1516. After this general consideration of pleasure and pain the
        Philosopher now treats in particular those pleasures with which
        continence and incontinence are concerned. He discusses this point in a
        threefold manner. First [I] he makes a statement of his intention. Next
        [II], at “Why then etc.,” he manifests some hesitancy. Last [III], at
        “However, the same etc.,” he gives his reason for some general
        observations on pleasures. He says first that, after our discussions on
        pleasure in general (1473-1515), we must turn our attention also to
        bodily pleasures to say that some pleasures are especially worthy of
        choice, those which are naturally good. But bodily pleasures, by reason
        of which a man becomes intemperate, are not of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1517. Then [II], at “Why then,” he raises a doubt about previous
        statements: first [II, A], stating the doubt; then [II, B], at “Either
        they are etc.,” resolving it. Finally [II, C], at “Not only etc.,” he
        gives the argument for his position. On the first point we should
        consider that, in order to prove that pleasure is a good the Philosopher
        previously (1498-1499) argued from the evil of pain. Now, because he has
        said that bodily pleasures are not good, he uses the same argument as an
        objection; for, if good is contrary to evil, a doubt remains-from the
        fact that bodily pleasures are said not to be good-why the opposite
        pains are evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1518. Next [II, B], at “Either they are,” he gives a twofold solution to
        the objection. First [B, 1 ] he says that bodily pleasures are good in
        some manner inasmuch as they are necessary to drive away the opposing
        pains. The reason is that at least in this way anything that is not evil
        by its nature can be called good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1519. He gives the second solution at “or they are” [B, 2], saying that
        bodily pleasures certainly are good, not absolutely but up to a certain
        point. His reason for this is that every pleasure follows some habit and
        movement or activity. Hence it is necessary that if in the habits and
        movements or activities there cannot be a superabundance of the better,
        i.e., an excess above the good, neither can there be an excess in the
        pleasure that follows. Thus there cannot be an excess of the good in
        that activity, which is contemplation of the truth, because the more a
        man contemplates the truth the better he is. Therefore the pleasure that
        follows is good absolutely, and not only to a degree. But if there is an
        excess of what is good in the habits or activities, so too will there be
        in the pleasure that follows. Now it is evident that there can be too
        much of a good thing in the physical area.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1520. Some indication of the fact is in this: a man is said to be bad
        because he wants these goods excessively though he may injure nobody.
        However, he is not evil by his desire and delight in bodily goods, for
        everyone enjoys food, wine, and sex to some degree; on the contrary,
        some people are blamed for not enjoying pleasures as they should. From
        this it is obvious that bodily pleasure is good up to a certain point,
        but its excess is bad.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1521. Pain works out in the opposite way, for the man of virtue flees
        not just its excess, but absolutely all pain. Pain then is not the
        contrary to excessive physical pleasure; if it were, no one would be
        grieved except for the maximum departure from excessive pleasure. If
        this were the case, pain would not be so much something to be shunned as
        to be somewhat tolerated. But the real situation is this: pain is
        connected with those pursuing excessive pleasure. And this happens
        precisely because by the least lack of pleasures such people are
        grieved. So it is that, as excessive physical pleasures are bad, so also
        is pain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1522. At “Not only” [II, C] he presents his argument for the preceding
        statements. First [C, 1] he states his position. Then [C, 2], at “The
        first reason etc.,” he gives the actual argument. First he says that not
        only must the solution to the difficulty be given, but the reason for
        the error in the objection must be found. This is a great help in
        establishing the credibility of the truth; for, when the reason why the
        untruth seems to be true is exposed, the student more readily accepts
        the truth. This is the reason we must discuss why bodily pleasures seem
        to the majority more desirable than other pleasures, when nevertheless
        these other pleasures are absolutely good while bodily pleasures are so
        only to a certain degree.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1523. Then [C, 2], at “The first reason,” he gives the actual argument.
        First [2, a] he tells us just why bodily pleasures seem more desirable.
        Next [2, b), at “On the other hand,” he presents an argument to show
        that other pleasures are in reality more desirable. For the first point
        he offers two arguments: (the first at [a, i]) while the second [a, ii]
        is presented at “Moreover, because etc.” On the first argument he
        performs two operations. First [i, x] he gives the reason why bodily
        pleasures seem more desirable. Then [i, y], at “Likewise it seems etc.,”
        he assigns the reason why bodily pleasures do not seem universally good.
        He says at the outset that the first reason why physical pleasures seem
        to be more desirable is that they drive out pain; and by their very
        intensity are a remedy for pain. Indeed pain is not eliminated by every
        kind of pleasure but by vehement pleasure. For this reason men seek
        abundant bodily pleasure to which pain is opposed. But there is no pain
        opposed to intellectual pleasure—like that found in
        contemplation—because it is not in an imperfect but a perfect state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1524. From the very fact that bodily pleasures are remedies for pain
        they seem to be vehement, measured as they are not only by their nature
        but even by the contrary which they banish. Consequently they are avidly
        sought because they look better when placed beside their contrary, for
        drinking seems much more important to the thirsty. This is why people
        who want the pleasure of drinking stimulate their thirst by eating salty
        foods, thus getting more pleasure in the drink.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1525. Next [i, y], at “Likewise it seems,” he points out why these
        pleasures may not seem universally good. He says that, on account of
        bodily pleasure—as was previously noted (1512)—it “seemed to some
        people” that pleasure was not a good. The explanation is that there are
        two kinds of bodily pleasures. Some are naturally evil, resulting from
        evil activities, and are desirable to certain beings as soon as they are
        born (for example, dumb animals and brutish men) but to others from
        habituation, like the pleasures of depraved men. Other bodily pleasures,
        however, are remedies for some defect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1526. An indication of this is that they belong only to someone in need.
        A man does not enjoy food when he is not hungry. Clearly then the
        pleasure of food is a remedy for the distress of hunger. Obviously it is
        better for someone to be already perfect than to be in the process of
        becoming perfect. But pleasures of this kind, which we call medicinal,
        are taken by those who are being perfected but not by those who are
        already perfect. They are indulged in because a need of nature is
        satisfied through what is taken. So then it is clear that they are not
        good intrinsically but incidentally inasmuch as they are necessary for
        something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1527. He has already touched on these two arguments in two previous
        solutions (1510-1511). Surely those pleasures that are involved in evil
        actions exceed the proper measure. Since then physical pleasures are not
        in themselves good, however more desirable they seem, some thought
        pleasures are universally not good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1528. At “Moreover, because” [a, ii] he gives the second reason. On this
        point he does two things. First [ii, x] he presents the reason. Then
        [ii, y], at “Certainly men etc.,” he explains something which he had
        taken for granted. He says first that, since bodily pleasures are
        vehement, they are sought by those who cannot enjoy other pleasures,
        i.e., by those who, since they know nothing of intellectual delights,
        incline only to physical pleasures. Consequently people artificially
        arouse in themselves a thirst for such pleasures, on their own volition
        stimulating themselves to their desires. Remember (1524) those who cat
        salty foods to induce thirst for drink. Therefore since such people do
        not have other pleasures for recreation, for them to enjoy such
        pleasures is not too bad, providing they do not hurt themselves or
        others. But if the pleasures are harmful they will be wrong and
        reprehensible; obviously so in adultery and poisonous food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1529. Next [ii, y], at “Certainly men,” he assigns the reason for
        something he had taken for granted, that all men need some pleasure for
        recreation. First [y, aa] he gives the kind of reason that applies to
        all in general; then [y, bb], at “In like manner etc.,” a reason
        applicable to young men; finally [y, cc], at “But the melancholic etc.,”
        a reason applicable to the melancholic. He says first that it is not to
        be considered a fault for some people to enjoy bodily pleasures, when
        they do not have others, because they need pleasures as a remedy for
        pain. Men encounter pain in many matters on account -of natural
        movements and activities. In fact sensitive nature is always under
        tension while at work, and work is wearisome as the statements of the
        natural scientists attest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1530. Some say that continual seeing and hearing cause pain inasmuch as
        they cause strain; because of this an animal needs the relaxation of
        sleep as is explained in <i>De Somno et Vigilia</i> (Ch. 1, 454 a 26-33;
        St. Th. Lect. 2). But we are unaware of this sort of hurt because we are
        accustomed to endure it continually. However, even though seeing and
        hearing naturally fatigue and strain the bodily organs, nevertheless
        they give physical pleasure by reason of sense knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1531. Then [y, bb], at “In like manner,” he tells why young men
        especially need pleasure: because of their growth young men have many
        disturbances of spirits and humors, such as occur in intoxicated
        persons. So, on account of activity of this sort young men especially
        seek pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1532. At “But the melancholic” [y, cc] he assigns the reason on the part
        of the depressed. He says that the melancholic, by reason of their
        natural disposition, have a continual need of a remedy for pain because
        their body undergoes a kind of corrosion due to dryness of temperament.
        Hence they have a vehement desire for pleasure as a means of dispelling
        this pain, for pleasure drives out not only the opposite pain—the
        pleasure of food banishes the pain of hunger—but, if the pleasure is
        intense, it sometimes drives out other pain. The reason is that it is
        contrary to all pain according to genus but not according to species.
        And because the melancholic vehemently desire pleasures, as a result
        they frequently become intemperate and depraved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1533. Next [2, b], at “On the other hand,” he gives the reason why
        intellectual pleasures are really better, stating that such pleasures
        lack an opposite pain, which they drive out; they have consequently no
        excess to render them vicious. These pleasures deal with things which
        are pleasurable naturally and not incidentally. Here he explains two
        things: first, the nature of what is incidentally pleasurable. He
        asserts that those things are pleasurable incidentally that give
        pleasure inasmuch as they are curative. The reason is that when a man
        obtains a cure it happens that a healthy condition is brought about and
        the activity seems pleasurable. Hence when pleasures of this kind are
        sought outside the need for a remedy they are immoderate. Subsequently
        he explains that those things are naturally pleasurable that produce an
        activity of this nature; for the activity proper to a nature, since it
        is its perfection, is pleasurable to every nature. For this reason the
        activity of the intellect is pleasurable to man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1534. Then [III], at “However, the same” he assigns the reason for two
        observations on human pleasures. The first observation [III, A] is that
        the same object is not always pleasurable to man. He says that the
        reason [A, i] is that our nature is not simple but composite, and is
        changeable from one thing to another inasmuch as it is subject to
        deterioration. For this reason if man performs an action pleasurable to
        him according to one element, this pleasure is unnatural to him
        according to a different element. Thus contemplation is natural to man
        by reason of his intellect but beyond the natural scope of the powers of
        imagination which try to take an active part in the work of
        contemplation. Therefore contemplation is not ‘ always delightful to
        man. It is the same with the taking of food, which is natural to man who
        needs it but not natural to a body already surfeited. But when a man
        approaches the opposite condition, then what was pleasurable in his
        previous condition seems to be neither distressing, because the opposite
        condition has not yet been reached, nor still pleasurable because the
        other condition has now almost been passed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1535. From this he concludes, at “Wherefore, if” [A, 2], that if the
        nature of any being that is capable of delight were simple and
        unchangeable the same action would be most delightful for it. Thus if
        man were only intellect, he would always take pleasure in contemplating.
        Hence, since God is simple and unchangeable he rejoices always in one
        simple pleasure that he takes in the contemplation of himself; for the
        activity that produces pleasure consists not in motion alone but even in
        immobility, as is evident in the activity of the intellect. That
        pleasure which is without motion is greater than pleasure with motion,
        because what is in motion is on the way to being but what is at rest has
        complete being, as is obvious from previous discussions (1523).

        1536. At “But change” [III, B] he gives the reason for the second
        observation on pleasure, that change is most delightful to men according
        to the saying of a certain poet. Aristotle adds that this happens
        because of some evil, or defect of nature, which is not capable of
        remaining in the same condition. just as it is with an evil man who is
        easily changed and does not have his mind fixed on one thing, so-with
        nature that needs change because it is neither simple nor completely
        good; for motion is the act of what is imperfect, as is stated in the
        third book of the Physics (Ch. 2., 201 b 27-202 a 2; St. Th. Lect. 3,
        296).

        1537. He concludes in summary: in the seventh book he has discussed
        continence and incontinence, pleasure and pain, the nature of each of
        these subjects, and how they may be good or bad. Therefore he must now
        go on to a discussion of friendship. Thus he completes the teaching of
        the seventh book.
