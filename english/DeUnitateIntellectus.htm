        [1] All men by nature desire to know the truth; they also have a natural
        desire to avoid error and to refute it when the opportunity arises.
        Since we have been given an intellect in order to know truth and avoid
        error, it seems singularly inappropriate to be mistaken about it. For a
        long time now there has been widespread an error concerning intellect
        which originates in the writings of Averroes. He seeks to maintain that
        what Aristotle calls the possible, but he infelicitously calls the
        material, intellect is a substance which, existing separately from the
        body, is in no way united to it as its form, and furthermore that this
        possible intellect is one for all men. We have already written much in
        refutation of this, but because those mistaken on this matter continue
        impudently to oppose the truth, it is our intention once more to write
        against this error and in such a way that it is decisively refuted.
      </p>
      <p>
        [2] There is no need now to show that the foregoing position is
        erroneous because repugnant to Christian faith: a moment’s reflection
        makes this clear to anyone. Take away from men diversity of intellect,
        which alone among the soul’s parts seems incorruptible and immortal, and
        it follows that nothing of the souls of men would remain after death
        except a unique intellectual substance, with the result that reward and
        punishment and their difference disappear. We intend to show that the
        foregoing position is opposed to the principles of philosophy every bit
        as much as it is to the teaching of faith. And, Latin writers on this
        matter not being to the taste of some, who tell us they prefer to follow
        the words of the Peripatetics, though of them they have seen only the
        works of Aristotle, the founder of the school, we will first show the
        foregoing position to be in every way repugnant to his words and
        judgments.
      </p>
      <p>
        [3] Let us then take up the first definition of soul Aristotle gives in
        Book Two of <i>On the Soul</i> (412b5): “the first act of a physically
        organized body.” And lest some should say this definition does not cover
        every soul, because of the earlier conditional remark, “If, then, we
        have to give a general formula applicable to all kinds of soul,”
        (412b4), which they take to mean that it cannot be done, the words which
        follow should be taken into account. For he writes, “We have now given a
        general answer to the question, What is soul? It is substance in the
        sense which corresponds to the account of a thing.” (412a8-12), that is,
        the substantial form of a physically organized body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [4] The sequel answers those who might say that the intellective part is
        excluded from the range of this definition. “From this it is clear that
        the soul is inseparable from its, or at any rate that certain parts of
        it are (if it has parts)—for the actuality of some of them is the
        actuality of the parts themselves,”(413a4-7), which can only be
        understood of those which belong to the intellective part, namely
        intellect and will. From this it is clear that some parts of the soul he
        has defined as being the act of the body are acts of some parts of the
        body, whereas others are not the acts of any body. It is one thing for
        the soul to be the act of body and another for some part of it to be the
        act of body, as will be argued below. In this same chapter he shows the
        soul to be the act of body because some of its parts are acts of body:
        “We must apply what has been said [of the whole] to the parts.”(412b17)
      </p>
      <p>
        [5] From the sequel it is even clearer that the intellect is covered by
        this general definition. The fact that the body no longer actually lives
        when soul is separated from it is taken to be sufficient proof that soul
        is the act of body. However, because something could be said to be in
        act thanks to the presence of something other than form, of a mover,
        say, as the combustible actually burns when fire is present, and the
        moveable actually moves when the mover is present, one might wonder
        whether the body actually lives thanks to the presence of soul in the
        same way that the mobile moves at the presence of the mover, rather than
        as matter is in act thanks to the presence of form. The doubt can feed
        on the fact that Plato said soul is united to body not as form but
        rather as mover and director. This is clear from Plotinus and Gregory of
        Nyssa—whom I mention because they were Greeks not Latins. The
        Philosopher invites this doubt when, to what has been quoted, he adds
        “Further, we have no light on the problem whether the soul may not be
        the actuality of its body in the sense in which the sailor is the
        actuality of the ship.”(413a8-10).
      </p>
      <p>
        [6] It was because this doubt remained after what he said that he
        concludes, “This must suffice as our sketch or outline of the nature of
        soul” (413a11-13), because he has not yet shown the truth with full
        clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in order to remove this doubt, he proceeds to make manifest
        that which is more certain both in itself and in definition through what
        is less certain in itself but more certain for us, that is, through
        effects of the soul which are its acts. Thus he immediately
        distinguishes the works of the soul, saying that “what has soul in it
        differs from what has not in that the former displays life,”(413a21-25)
        and that there are many levels of life, namely, “intellect, sense,
        motion and rest according to place,” the motion of nourishing and
        growth, such that anything in which one of these is found is said to
        live. Having shown how these [levels] are interrelated, that is, how one
        of them might be found without the other, he concludes that the soul is
        the principle of them all both because the soul “is specified (as by its
        parts) vegetative, sensitive, intellective and motor,” (413b11-13) and
        because all these happen to be found in one and the same thing, for
        example, in man.
      </p>
      <p>
        [7] Plato held that, insofar as these diverse operations pertain to man,
        there are diverse souls in him. Consequently he [Aristotle] asks
        “whether each of these is a soul” by itself or a part of soul, and, if
        they are parts of one soul, whether they differ in definition alone or
        also in place, that is, by organ. And, he adds, “of some it is not
        difficult” to see how it is, but there are others which give rise to
        doubt. (413b13-26) Consequently, he shows(413b16-21) that in this regard
        things are clear in vegetable and sensible soul because some plants and
        animals go on living when divided and all the operations that were in
        the whole appear in each part. When he adds that “We have no evidence as
        yet about mind and the power to think,” (413b24-25) he makes clear where
        the question arises. By saying this he doesn’t mean to show that
        intellect is not soul, as the Commentator and his followers perversely
        interpret him, for he clearly says this in response to what was said
        earlier, “but some present a difficulty” (413b16). This should be
        understood thus: It is not yet clear whether intellect is a soul or a
        part of soul, and if it is a part of the soul, whether it is separate in
        place or in definition only.
      </p>
      <p>
        [8] Although he says it is not yet clear, nonetheless he indicates what
        at first blush appears to be the case by adding “It seems to be a widely
        different kind of soul” (413b25-26). This should not be understood as it
        perversely is by the Commentator and his followers: namely, that the
        intellect is equivocally called soul or that the foregoing definition
        cannot be adapted to it. How it ought to be understood is clear from
        what he adds, “It alone is capable of existence in isolation from all
        other psychic powers.” (413b26-27) Therefore it is of another kind in
        the sense that intellect appears to be something perpetual, whereas the
        other parts of the soul are corruptible. And because the perpetual and
        corruptible do not seem to characterize the same substance, apparently
        only this part of the soul, namely intellect, can be separated, not
        indeed from body, as the Commentator perversely interprets, but from
        other parts of the soul, lest they characterize the same substance,
        soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        [9] That this is how it should be understood is clear from what he adds,
        “From these remarks it is clear that the other parts of the soul are not
        separable” (413b27-28), namely from the substance of the soul or by
        place. When this was asked earlier the question was resolved from what
        had just been said. That it is not to be understood as separability from
        body but as the separability of the powers from one another, is clear
        from what he adds: “that as understood they are distinguishable by
        definition,” namely from one another,”is clear,” for to sense and to
        have an opinion are different.”(413b29-30) Thus what is said here is
        manifestly in response to the question raised earlier when he asked
        whether one part of the soul is separated from another in understanding
        alone or in place. Having set aside this question about intellect,
        concerning which he determines nothing here, he says it is manifest with
        respect to the other parts of the soul that they are not separable, that
        is in place, but that they differ as understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        [10] It being established therefore that the soul is defined by the
        vegetative, sensitive, intellective and locomotive parts, he intends to
        show next that, with respect to each of these, the soul is united to
        body as form, not as a sailor to his boat. And thus what was previously
        established only in outline is made certain. He proves this through the
        operations of the soul in this way: It is manifest that that whereby
        something first operates is the act of the one operating. For example,
        we are said to know both through the soul and through science, but first
        of all through science rather than through the soul—we know through the
        soul only insofar as it has science; similarly we are said to be healed
        by the body and by health, but first of all by health. Thus it is clear
        that science is the form of soul and health of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [11] He continues thus: “The soul is that whereby we first live,”
        referring to the vegetative, “that whereby we sense” referring to the
        sensitive, “and move” referring to the locomotive, “and understand,”
        referring to the intellective. He concludes “It follows that the soul
        must be an account and essence, not matter or a subject.” (414a12-14)
        Manifestly therefore he applies here what he said above, that the soul
        is the act of a physical body, not only to the sensitive, vegetative and
        motive but also to the intellective. It was Aristotle’s judgment,
        therefore, that that whereby we understand is the form of the physical
        body. Should someone say that that with which we understand does not
        here mean the possible intellect but something else, this is clearly
        excluded by what Aristotle says in Book Three of
        <i>On the Soul</i> speaking of the possible intellect: “I call intellect
        that whereby the soul thinks and understands.” (429a23)
      </p>
      <p>
        [12] But before we turn to what Aristotle says in Book Three of
        <i>On the Soul</i>, let us linger on what he has said in Book Two so
        that his teaching on the soul may become apparent by comparing his
        statements. For, having defined the soul in general, he begins to
        distinguish its powers, and says that the powers of the soul are “the
        vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, locomotive, intellective.”
        (414a31-32) And that the intellective is the intellect is evident from
        what he afterwards adds in explanation of the division, “In others, the
        thinking faculty and intellect, as in men.” (414b18) He holds therefore
        that the intellect is a power of the soul which is the act of body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [13] And that he calls the intellect a power of this soul and moreover
        that the definition of soul given above is common to all the aforesaid
        parts, is clear from his conclusion: “It is now evident that a single
        definition can be given of soul in the same way that one can be given of
        figure. For, as in that case there is no figure apart from triangle and
        those that follow in order, so here there is no soul apart from the
        forms of soul just enumerated.” (414b19-22) One ought not then seek any
        soul apart from those mentioned, to which the definition of soul given
        above is common. Aristotle makes no further mention of intellect in this
        second book except when he says that “reasoning and intellect” are
        “ultimately and rarely” (415a7) because they are in fewer things, as the
        sequel makes clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        [14] Because there is a great difference between the ways intellect and
        imagination operate, he adds that “there is another account of
        speculative intellect” (415a11-12). This inquiry he reserves to the
        third book. And lest someone suggest, as Averroes perversely does, that
        Aristotle speaks of another account of speculative intellect because the
        intellect is “neither soul nor a part of soul”, this is immediately
        excluded at the beginning of Book Three where he takes up again the
        treatment of intellect. For he says, “Concerning the part of the soul
        whereby the soul knows and understands.” (429a10-11) Nor should anyone
        think that this is said only insofar as the possible intellect is
        divided against the agent intellect, as some imagine, for the remark
        occurs before Aristotle proves there is an agent and possible intellect.
        Hence he here means by intellect that part in general, insofar as it
        contains both agent and possible. In much the same way, early in the
        second book, he manifestly distinguished intellect from the other parts
        of the soul, as has already been pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        [15] Notice the marvelous care and order of Aristotle’s procedure,
        beginning Book Three with the treatment of the questions concerning
        intellect left undetermined in the second. There were two. First,
        whether intellect is separated from other parts of the soul only as
        understood or in place too, which indeed he left undetermined when he
        said, “We have no evidence as yet about thought or the power of
        reflexion.” (413b24-25) First he takes up this question again when he
        says “Whether this is separable from the others,” namely from the other
        parts of the soul, “in definition only, or spatially as well.”
        (429a11-12) `Spatially separable’ here means the same as `separable in
        place’ above.
      </p>
      <p>
        [16] Second, he left unanswered the question concerning intellect’s
        difference from the other parts of the soul when he said later,
        “Reflective thought presents a different problem.” (415a11-12) And he
        immediately begins to inquire into this when he says, “We have to
        inquire what differentiates this part...” (429a12) He intends to express
        this difference in such a way that it is compatible with both
        possibilities mentioned, that is, whether or not it is a soul separable
        in size or place from the other parts, as this way of speaking
        sufficiently indicates. For he says we ought to consider what the
        difference is between the intellect and the other parts of the soul,
        whether it is separable from them in size or place, that is in subject,
        or not, or only in understanding. Hence it is clear that he does not
        intend to give as the difference that it is a substance existing
        separately from the body, for this would not be compatible with the
        foregoing; rather, he intends to assign a difference according to the
        mode of operating. Hence he adds, “...and how thinking takes place.”
        (429a13) Therefore, from what we can learn from the words of Aristotle
        up to this point, he clearly held that intellect is a part of the soul
        which is the act of a physical body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [17] But because from some words following on these the Averroists wish
        to take Aristotle’s intention to be that the intellect is not the soul
        which is the act of the body, or a part of such a soul, we must even
        more carefully consider what he goes on to say. Immediately after he
        raised the question about the difference between intellect and sense, he
        asked in what intellect is like sense and how the two differ. Earlier he
        established two things about sense, namely that sense is in potency to
        sensible objects and that sense is affected and corrupted by excessive
        sensible objects. That is what Aristotle has in mind when he says, “If
        thinking is like perceiving, it must be either a process in which the
        soul is acted upon by what is capable of being thought” (429a13-15) in
        such a way that the intellect would be corrupted by something
        excessively intelligible as sense is by an excessive sensible object,
        “or a process different from but analogous to that.” That is,
        understanding is something similar to sensing, but different in this
        that it is not affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        [18] He responds to this question immediately, concluding—not from what
        went before but from what follows, which however is manifested from what
        went before—that this part of the soul “must be impassible,”(429a15) in
        order that it not be corrupted like the senses. There is however another
        way of being acted upon characteristic of understanding according to
        which it can be said to suffer in a general sense of the term. In this
        then it is different from the senses. He goes on to show in what it is
        like the senses, namely, that this part of the soul must be “capable of
        receiving the form of the object”(429a15-16) and that it be in potency
        to this kind of form, not actually being it in its own nature; so too
        earlier it was said of sense that it is potentially, not actually,
        sensibles. From this he concludes that “Thought must be related to what
        is thinkable, as sense is to what is sensible.” (429a16-18)
      </p>
      <p>
        [19] He brought this out to exclude the opinion of Empedocles (see
        404b8-405b30) and other ancients who held that the knower is of the
        nature of the known, as if we knew earth through earth and water through
        water. Aristotle showed earlier (417a2-9) that this is not true of
        sense, because the sensitive power is potentially not actually the
        things it senses, and he says the same here of intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is however this difference between sense and intellect that sense
        is not capable of knowing everything (sight is of colors alone, hearing
        of sounds, and thus with the others), whereas the intellect is capable
        of knowing all things whatsoever. Ancient philosophers,(see 405b10-17)
        thinking that the knower must have the nature of the known, said that in
        order for the soul to know all things it was necessary that the
        principles of all things be mingled in it. Aristotle, having proved by
        analogy with sense that intellect is not actually but potentially what
        it knows, concludes on the contrary that “intellect, because it knows
        all things, must be unmixed” (429a18); that is, not composed of all
        things, as Empedocles held.
      </p>
      <p>
        [20] In support of this he invokes the testimony of Anaxagoras, (429a19)
        who is not however speaking of the same intellect, but rather of the
        intellect that moves all things. It was in order that it might command
        by moving and separating that Anaxagoras said the latter intellect is
        unmixed. His subsequent proof of this is found in the Greek text: “For
        the co-presence of what is alien to its nature is a hindrance and a
        block” (429a20) This can be understood from what is similar in sight,
        for if there were some intrinsic color of the pupil, this interior color
        would prevent an outer color from being seen and in that way would
        prevent the eye from seeing others.
      </p>
      <p>
        [21] Similarly, if one of the natures of the things the intellect
        knows—earth or water, hot or cold, or some such thing—were intrinsic to
        intellect, that intrinsic nature would impede it and in a way obstruct
        it from knowing others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it knows all things, therefore, he concludes that “it can have
        no nature of its own, other than that of having a certain capacity”
        (429a21-22). That is, its own nature is to be potentially those things
        it understands; but it actually becomes them when it actually knows
        them, just as sense in act actually becomes the sensible, as was said
        above in the second book. Intellect before it actually understands, he
        therefore concludes, “is not actually any real thing” (429a24), which is
        the opposite of what the ancients said, namely, that it actually is all
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        [22] Because he mentioned what Anaxagoras said in speaking of the
        intellect which commands all things, lest he be taken to be saying this
        of that intellect, he uses this manner of speaking: “That in the soul
        which is called intellect (by intellect I mean that whereby the soul
        thinks and judges) is before it thinks, not actually any real thing...”
        (429a22-24) From which two things are clear: first, that he is not
        speaking here of an intellect which is a separated substance, but of the
        intellect he earlier called a power and part of the soul whereby the
        soul understands; second, that he proved from what was said above that
        the intellect actually has no a nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        [23] He has not yet proved, however, that it is not a power in the body,
        as Averroes says, but immediately concludes this from the foregoing:
        “For this reason it cannot reasonably be regarded as blended with the
        body.” (429a25) This second conclusion he derives from the first, which
        he proved above, namely, that intellect does not actually have any of
        the natures of sensible things. It follows from this that it is not
        mixed with body, because if it were mixed with body, it would have some
        corporeal nature. This is what he adds: “If so, it would acquire some
        quality, e.g. warmth or cold, or even have an organ like the sensitive
        faculty.” (429a25-27) Sense is proportioned to its organ and is in a way
        akin to it in nature, hence with the immutation of the organ the
        operation of sense too is changed. It is thus then that the phrase, “is
        not mixed with body,” should be understood: intellect does not have an
        organ as sense does.
      </p>
      <p>
        [24] And that the soul’s intellect has no organ he manifests through the
        saying of those who said that “soul is the place of the forms,”
        (429a27-29) understanding place broadly for any receiver, in the
        Platonist manner, except that being the place of forms is not true of
        the whole soul but only of intellect. For the sensitive part does not
        receive species in itself, but in the organ; whereas the intellective
        does not receive them in an organ, but in itself. Again it is not the
        place of the forms as having them actually, but only in potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since he has now shown what belongs to intellect from its similarity
        with sense, he returns to what he said first, that “the intellective
        part must be impassible,” (429a15) and thus with wonderful subtlety
        concludes from its very similarity to sense its dissimilarity, going on
        to show that “sense and intellect are not impassible in the same way”
        (429a29-b5) because sense is destroyed by an excessive sensible but
        intellect is not destroyed by the excessively intelligible. He gives as
        reason for this what was proved above: “the reason is that while the
        faculty of sensation is dependent upon the body, thought is separable
        from it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [25] This is the favorite prop of those who want to hold the error that
        intellect is neither soul nor part of the soul, but a separated
        substance. But they too quickly forget what Aristotle said only a little
        earlier: for just as here he says that “the sensitive is not without
        body and intellect is separate” so above he said that intellect would
        “acquire some quality, e.g. warmth or cold, or even have an organ like
        the senstivie faculty.” (429a25-26) This is the reason, therefore, that
        he here says that the sensitive is not without body but the intellect is
        separate: because sense has an organ but intellect does not. Quite
        obviously, therefore, and without any doubt so far as the text of
        Aristotle is concerned, it is clear that his view is that possible
        intellect belongs to the soul which is the act of body, such that the
        soul’s intellect has no bodily organ as the other powers of the soul
        certainly have.
      </p>
      <p>
        [27] It is not difficult to understand how the soul can be the form of a
        body yet some power of the soul not be a power of body if one takes into
        account other things as well. For in many things we see that a form is
        indeed the act of a body of mixed elements and yet has a power which is
        not the power of any element, but belongs to that form because of a
        higher principle, namely a celestial body, e.g. the magnet has the power
        to attract iron and jasper of coagulating blood. And presently we shall
        see that insofar as forms are nobler they have powers which more and
        more surpass matter. Hence the ultimate form, the human soul, has a
        power, namely intellect, which wholly surpasses corporeal matter. Thus
        the intellect is separate because it isn’t a power in the body but in
        the soul, and soul is the act of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [28] Nor do we say that the soul, in which the intellect is, so exceeds
        corporeal matter that it does not exist in the body, but rather that
        intellect, which Aristotle calls a power of the soul, is not the act of
        the body. For the soul is not the act of body through the mediation of
        its powers but is through itself (<i>per se</i>) the act of body, giving
        to body its specific existence. Some of its powers are acts of certain
        parts of body, perfecting them for definite operations, but the power
        which is intellect is not the act of any body, because its operation
        does not take place by means of a bodily organ.
      </p>
      <p>
        [29] And lest it seem to anyone that we give this as our own reading,
        not Aristotle’s meaning, the words of Aristotle expressly stating this
        must be cited. For in Book Two of the <i>Physics</i> he asks “to what
        degree it is necessary to know the species and quiddity”, for it is not
        the natural philosopher’s task to consider every form. And he solves
        this, adding, “to the degree that the doctor must know sinew and the
        smith bronze,” that is, up to a point. And up to what point he shows,
        adding, “until he understands the cause of each,” as if to say, the
        doctor considers the nerve insofar as it pertains to health, and so too
        the artisan bronze for the sake of the artifact. And because the natural
        philosopher considers form insofar as it is in matter, for such is the
        form of mobile body, so too it should be understood that the naturalist
        considers form insofar as it is in matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        [30] The term of the physicist’s consideration of form is of forms which
        are in some way in matter and in another way not in matter, for these
        forms are on the border of material and separated forms. Hence he adds,
        “and concerning these,” namely, those forms which terminate the natural
        philosopher’s consideration, “which are separable but which do not exist
        apart from matter...” What these forms are, he goes on to show: “For man
        is generated by man and by the sun as well.” Man’s form therefore is in
        matter and separate: in matter indeed insofar as it gives existence to
        body, for thus it is the term of generation, separate however because of
        the power which is proper to man, namely intellect. Therefore, It is not
        impossible for a form to be in matter yet its power be separate, as was
        shown concerning intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        [31] There is yet another way in which they go about showing that
        Aristotle taught that the intellect is not a soul nor a part of the soul
        united to body as its form. For Aristotle says in several places that
        the intellect is perpetual and incorruptible, as is clear in Book Two of
        the <i>On the Soul</i> (413b26-27), where he says, “...differing as what
        is eternal from what is perishable; it alone is capable of being
        separated.” And in Book One where he says that intellect seems to be a
        substance “incapable of being destroyed” (408b17-18). And in Book Three,
        he says, “This alone is truly separate and it alone is immortal and
        perpetual,”(430a22-23) although some do not understand this last to be
        about the possible intellect, but about the agent intellect. From all
        these texts it is clear that Aristotle means that intellect is something
        incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        [32] However, it seems that nothing incorruptible could be the form of a
        corruptible body. It is not accidental to form but belongs to it per se
        that it be in matter, otherwise what comes to be from matter and form
        would be accidentally one; but nothing can exist without that which
        belongs to it as such; therefore the form of body cannot be without
        body. If then the body is corruptible, it follows that the form of body
        is corruptible. Moreover, forms separate from matter and forms that
        exist in matter are not of the same kind, as is proved in Book Seven of
        the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Much less can numerically one form be now in
        body and now apart from body. With the destruction of the body,
        therefore, either the form of body is destroyed or it passes to another
        body. If then intellect is the form of body, it seems necessarily to
        follow that intellect is corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        [33] It should be known that this argument convinces many: thus Gregory
        of Nyssa, making the reverse point, understood Aristotle to teach that
        the soul is corruptible because he made the soul a form. Some maintain
        because of this that soul passes from body to body. Others held that
        soul has a certain incorruptible body from which it is never separate.
        It must be shown, therefore, from Aristotle’s words, that he held that
        the intellective soul is form and nonetheless held it to be
        incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        [34] In Book Eleven of the Metaphysics, after he had shown that forms do
        not exist before their matters, because “when man is healed then health
        exists, and the shape of the bronze sphere at the same time as the
        bronze sphere,” he then asks whether any form remains after matter. In
        Boethius’s translation, “It should be considered whether anything
        remains afterward” namely, after matter,”for nothing stands in the way
        of this in some things, as if the soul were of this kind, not all but
        intellect, or perhaps it is impossible for them all.” What he clearly
        says, therefore, is that nothing prevents the soul, which is a form,
        from remaining after the body thanks to its intellective part although
        it did not exist prior to body. For when he said absolutely that moving
        causes are prior but not formal causes, he did not ask whether any form
        were prior to matter, and he says that nothing prevents this in the case
        of the form which is soul with respect to its intellective part.
      </p>
      <p>
        [35] When then, in accordance with the foregoing words of Aristotle,
        this form which is the soul remains after the body, not the whole but
        intellect, we must yet ask why the soul remains after the body with
        respect to its intellective part rather than its other parts, and why
        other forms don’t remain after their matters. The reason is to be found
        in the text of Aristotle. He says “This alone is truly separate and this
        alone immortal and perpetual.”(430a22-23) Thus the reason he gives that
        it alone seems to be immortal and perpetual is that it alone is
        separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        [36] But a question arises as to what he is here speaking of, for some
        say he means possible intellect and others that he means the agent
        intellect. But both of these are seen to be false when Aristotle’s words
        are carefully considered, for Aristotle says both are separate. That it
        is the whole intellective part which is said to be separate because it
        has no organ is clear from the words of Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p>
        [37] In the beginning of <i>On the Soul</i>, Aristotle said that “If
        there is any way of acting or being acted upon proper to soul, soul will
        be capable of separate existence.” (403a10-12) The reason for the
        consequence is this: since anything acts according to the kind of being
        it is, activity will belong to anything in the same way in which it
        exists. Forms therefore which have no activity without the participation
        of their matter, do not themselves operate, but the composite acts
        through the form. Hence forms of this kind do not themselves exist, but
        something exists because of them. Heat does not warm, but rather the hot
        thing; so too heat does not exist properly speaking, but the thing is
        warm thanks to heat. Because of this Aristotle says in Book Eleven of
        the <i>Metaphysics</i> that one does not truly say of accidents that
        they are beings but that they are <i>of</i> beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        [38] The same reasoning applies to substantial forms having no operation
        in which matter does not take part, except that such forms are
        principles of being. Therefore a form which has an activity thanks to
        one of its powers or faculties in which its matter does not participate
        has existence of itself. It does not exist simply because its composite
        does, as is the case with other forms, but rather the composite exists
        thanks to it. Therefore, the composite being destroyed, a form which
        exists thanks to the existence of the composite is destroyed, whereas a
        form through whose existence the composite exists, not vice versa, need
        not be destroyed when the composite is destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        [39] Against this might be objected what Aristotle says in Book One of
        <i>On the Soul</i>,”Thinking, loving, and hating are affections not of
        thought, but of that which has thought, so far as it has it. That is
        why, when this vehicle decays, memory and love cease; they were
        activities not of thought, but of the composite which has perished.”
        (408b25-29) The answer is clear from Themistius who, in explaining this
        text, says that Aristotle “now is more in the mode of the doubter than
        the teacher.” For he has not yet destroyed the opinion of those saying
        that intellect and sense do not differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        [40] Hence in that whole chapter he speaks of intellect in the same way
        he does of sense. This is especially evident where he proves the
        intellect to be incorruptible using the example of sense, which is not
        corrupted by age. Hence throughout he speaks conditionally and
        problematically as one inquiring, always conflating intellect and sense.
        This is chiefly apparent from this that, in the beginning of the
        solution, he says “We may admit to the full that being pained or please,
        or thinking, are movements, etc.” (408b5-6) Were anyone adamantly to
        insist that Aristotle speaks decisively here, another response remains.
        Understanding is said to be the act of the composite, not essentially
        but accidentally, insofar as its object, the phantasm, is in a bodily
        organ and not because this activity is exercised through a bodily organ.
      </p>
      <p>
        [41] A further question might be asked: If intellect does not understand
        without the phantasm, how can the soul have an intellectual operation
        after it is separated from body? The questioner ought to know that it is
        not the natural philosopher’s task to solve this question. That is why
        Aristotle, speaking of soul in Book Two of the <i>Physics</i>, writes,
        “It is the business of First Philosophy to resolve how this is separable
        and what it is..” For it should be seen that the soul when separated has
        a different way of understanding than it does when conjoined, a way
        similar to that of separate substances. Hence it is not surprising that
        Aristotle should say, in Book Three of <i>On the Soul</i>, “Whether it
        is possible for it while not existing separate from spatial conditions
        to think anything that is separate, or not, we must consider later.”
        (431b17-19) This suggests that it can understand something in a
        separated state that it cannot when unseparated.
      </p>
      <p>
        [42] What is especially to be noticed in these words is that, while he
        said earlier that both intellects, namely the possible and agent, are
        separate, here he says intellect is not separate. For the separate is
        such insofar as it is not the act of an organ and the non-separate that
        which is a part or power of the soul which is the act of body, as has
        been said. Aristotle’s resolution of such questions can be more
        certainly gathered from what he wrote of separate substances at the
        beginning of Book Twelve of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, ten books of which I
        have seen though they are not yet translated into our language.
      </p>
      <p>
        [43] Given this, therefore, it is clear that there are no necessary
        arguments for the opposed position. For it is essential to the soul that
        it be united to body and this is accidentally impeded, not on its part,
        but on the part of the body which corrupts. In the same way it pertains
        as such to what is light that it be above. “This is the essence of what
        is light that it be above,” as Aristotle says in Book Eight of the
        <i>Physics</i>, “but it can come about through some impediment that it
        is not above.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The response to the second argument is clear from this. Although there
        is a specific difference between that whose nature it is to be above and
        that whose nature it is not to be above, yet the thing whose nature it
        is to be above, although it sometimes is and sometimes is not, due to an
        impediment, is specifically and numerically the same nature. In much the
        same way, a form whose nature it is to be united to body is specifically
        different from one whose nature it is not to be united to body, yet a
        form specifically and numerically the same can be such that its nature
        is to be united to body although sometimes it actually is and sometimes
        it is not because of an impediment.
      </p>
      <p>
        [44] They seek yet another basis for this error in what Aristotle says
        in the book <i>On the generation of Animals</i>, namely, “intellect
        comes only from without and it alone is divine.” But no form which is
        the act of matter comes to it from without, but is educed from the
        potency of matter. Therefore the intellect is not the form of body.
      </p>
      <p>
        They object too that every form of a mixed body is caused by the
        elements; hence if the intellect were the form of the human body, it
        would not be caused by something else, but would be caused by the
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        They further object on this score that it would follow that the
        vegetative and sensitive too would be from something else, which is
        contrary to Aristotle. This would be especially true when there is a
        soul one in substance whose powers are vegetative, sensitive and
        intellective. But, according to Aristotle, the intellective is from
        without.
      </p>
      <p>
        [45] The solution of these difficulties readily appears from the
        foregoing, for when it is said that every form is educed from the
        potency of matter, it seems that what this means ought to be understood.
        For if this is only matter’s first existing in potency to the form,
        nothing prevents our saying that corporeal matter first exists in
        potency to the intellective soul. Hence Aristotle says in the book
        <i>On the Generation of Animals</i>, “For at first all such embryos seem
        to live the life of a plant. And it is clear that we must be guided by
        this in speaking of the active and sensitive and rational soul. For all
        three kinds of soul must be possessed potentially before they are
        possessed actually.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [46] Because potency is a correlative of act, a thing must be in potency
        in the same respect that being actual belongs to it. It has already been
        shown that those forms which have no activities that do not involve
        matter are such that composites exist through them and they themselves
        as it were coexist with composites rather than exist themselves. Hence
        just as their whole existence is in concretion with matter, so they are
        said to be totally educed from the potency of matter. The intellective
        soul, however, since it has an operation without body, does not exist
        solely in concretion with matter, hence it cannot be said to be educed
        from matter, but it is rather from an extrinsic principle. And this is
        obvious from Aristotle’s words: “It remains, then, for the reason alone
        so to enter and alone to be divine,” and he gives the explanation when
        he adds, “for no bodily activity has any connexion with its activity.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [47] I wonder whence comes this second objection, namely, that if the
        intellective soul were the form of a mixed body it would be caused by
        the mingling of the elements. No soul is caused by the mingling of
        elements. Right after the words just quoted we read: “Now it is true
        that the faculty of all kinds of soul seems to have a connexion with a
        matter different from and more divine than the so-called elements; but
        as one soul differs from another in honor and utility, so differs also
        the nature of the corresponding matter. All have in their semen that
        which causes it to be productive; I mean what is called a vital heat.
        This is not fire nor any such force, but it is the breath included in
        the semen and the foam-like, and the natural principle in the breath,
        being analogous to the element of the stars.” Therefore not even the
        vegetable soul, let alone intellect, is produced from the mingling of
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        [48] The third objection, that it would follow that the sensitive and
        vegetative too would be from an extrinsic principle, is not relevant.
        For it is already evident from the words of Aristotle that he leaves
        indeterminate whether intellect differs from the other parts of the soul
        in subject and place, as Plato said, or by understanding alone. Even if
        it were given that they are the same in subject, as is truer, still
        nothing absurd would follow. For Aristotle says in Book Two of
        <i>On the Soul</i>, “The cases of figure and soul are exactly parallel;
        for the particulars subsumed under the common name in both cases—figures
        and living things—constitute a series, each successive term of which
        potentially contains its predecessor, e.g.the square the triangle, the
        sensory power the self-nutritive.” (414b28-32)
      </p>
      <p>
        [49] If however the intellective too is in the same subject, which he
        leaves in doubt, it would similarly have to be said that the vegetative
        and sensitive are in the intellective as triangle and square are in the
        pentagon. For the square is indeed a figure specifically different from
        the triangle, but not from the triangle potentially in it, no more than
        four is from the three which is its part, but only from the three
        existing apart. And if it should happen that different shapes are
        produced by different agents, the triangle considered as apart and
        differing from the square would have a different cause from the square,
        just as it has another species, but the triangle which is in the square
        has the same producing cause. Similarly the vegetative existing apart
        from the sensitive is another species of soul and has a different
        productive cause, but there is the same productive cause of the
        sensitive and of the vegetative within the sensitive. If then it is said
        of the vegetative and sensitive which are in the intellective that they
        are from the extrinsic cause which produces the intellective, nothing
        unacceptable follows. For there is nothing absurd about the effect of a
        higher agent having the power that the effect of a lesser agent has,
        even more so. Hence the intellective soul, although it is from an
        external agent, nonetheless has the powers had by the vegetative and
        sensitive souls which are produced by inferior agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        [50] So it is that those who carefully consider everything Aristotle has
        to say of the human intellect see clearly that his teaching was that the
        human soul is the act of the body and that its part or faculty is the
        possible intellect.

      </p>
      <p>
        [51] Now we should consider what the other peripatetics had to say about
        all this. We will first take up the words of Themistius in his
        <i>Commentary On the Soul</i>. When he says: “This intellect that we say
        is in potency is more connatural to the soul,”—he means, than the agent
        intellect—“I don’t mean to every soul, however, but only to the human.
        And just as light coming to potential seeing and to colors in potency
        makes them actual, so when this intellect is in act it not only makes
        intellect to be in act, but also constitutes potential intelligibles as
        actual intelligibles.” And a little later: “As art is to matter so is
        the factive intellect to that which is in potency. That is why we
        understand when we wish to. For it is not an art exterior to matter, but
        a power invested in the whole intellect which is making, just as, if the
        builder did not exist exterior to the wood or the brazier to the bronze,
        they would be able to penetrate through and through. Thus it is that the
        intellect in act supervenes on intellect in potency, becoming one with
        it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [52] And, a little later, he concludes, “Therefore we are either the
        intellect in potency or the intellect in act. And if in everything
        composed of what is in potency and what is in act, <i>it</i> is one
        thing and what it is for it to exist is another, then I too and what it
        is for me to exist differ. And I am an intellect composed of potency and
        act, but what it is for me to be comes from that which is in act.
        Wherefore what I think and write, an intellect composed of potency and
        act writes, but it writes not as in potency but as in act; from it
        derives its activity.” And a little further on yet more clearly: “Just
        as animal and what it is for animal to exist differ, the latter being
        due to the animal’s soul, so too I and what it is for me to exist
        differ. What it is for me to exist comes from soul but not from every
        part, not from the sensitive, which is matter to the imaginative, nor
        indeed from the imaginative, for it is matter to possible intellect, nor
        from that which is intellect potentially, for it is as matter to the
        agent intellect. From agent intellect alone, therefore, comes what it is
        for me to be.” And he adds a little later, “And having progressed to
        this nature stops, there being nothing more honorable which could serve
        as subject to it. We are therefore the agent intellect.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [53] And after rejecting the opinion of some others, he says, “Since
        Aristotle said that in every nature there is that which is matter and
        that which moves and perfects matter, he says that these differences
        must also exist in soul, and that there must be an intellect that
        becomes all things and another that makes it all things. For he says
        there is in the soul such an intellect and it is the most noble part of
        the human intellect.” A bit afterward adding, “This same text confirms
        that he, Aristotle, thinks that either we are the agent intellect or it
        is a part of us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        From the foregoing words of Themistius it is clear that he not only
        holds that the possible intellect is a part of the human soul, but the
        agent as well, and he says that Aristotle taught this; and further that
        man is what he is not because of the sensitive soul, as some falsely
        said, but from the principal part, the intellective.
      </p>
      <p>
        [54] I have not seen the books of Theophrastus, but Themistius cites him
        in his commentary, writing, “However it is better to set forth the
        sayings of Theophrastus concerning the intellect that is in potency and
        that which is in act. Of that which is in potency he asks: How could
        intellect exist from outside and as imposed and yet be connatural? And
        what is its nature? For it is actually nothing yet everything
        potentially, just like sense. Nor should this be taken to mean that it
        itself is not, which is carping, but it is as a kind of potential
        subject as is found in material things. But this ought not to said to be
        from without, therefore, or something conjoined, but is included from
        the first coming into being.” (p. 242, II, 54-62)
      </p>
      <p>
        [55] So Theophrastus asks two things: first, how is the possible
        intellect from an extrinsic principle yet connatural to us, and second,
        what is the nature of the possible intellect. He answers the second
        question first, saying that it is potentially all things, not indeed
        existing as nothing, but in the way sense is related to sensibles. His
        answer to the first question follows from this, that it ought not so to
        be understood to be from outside as if it were something accidentally
        conjoined or temporally prior, but is there in the first coming into
        being, as containing and comprehending human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        [56] That Alexander held the possible intellect to be the form of the
        body, Averroes himself admits, although, as I think, he perversely
        understands Alexander’s words just as he uses the words of Themistius
        beyond the meaning they bear. For he claims that Alexander said the
        possible intellect was precisely the preparation in human nature for
        agent intellect and intelligibles, he understands this preparation to be
        nothing other than the soul’s intellective potency to intelligible
        things. Therefore he said that it is not a power in body because such a
        power does not have a bodily organ. And not for the reason Averroes
        attributes to him, that no preparation is a power in body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [57] To turn from the Greeks to the Arabs, it is clear first of all that
        Avicenna held intellect to be a power of soul which is the form of body.
        For he says in his book <i>On the Soul</i>, “The active, that is,
        practical intellect, needs the body and bodily powers for its own
        actions, but the contemplative intellect does not always and completely
        need the body and its powers: for it is sufficient unto itself. None of
        these is the human soul, but the soul is what has these powers and, as
        we shall maintain later, is a solitary substance, that is, is in itself,
        and has aptitude for activities some of which are perfected only through
        instruments and some use of them, while others do not need instruments
        in any way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, in the first part he says that “the human soul is the first
        perfection of a natural body with organs, insofar as the ability to
        performs acts of deliberate choice, to discover by inquiry. and to grasp
        universals are attributed to it.” But it is true that later he says and
        proves that the human soul, because of that which is proper to it, that
        is, according to its intellective power, “is not related to body as form
        nor require that an organ be supplied it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [58] Next these words of Algazel should be added: “When the mingling of
        the elements will have been of a most beautiful and perfect equality,
        than which nothing more subtle and beautiful can be found, then it
        became apt to receive from the giver of forms a form more beautiful than
        other form, which is the soul of man. There are two virtues of this
        human soul: one operative, the other knowing,” which, as is clear from
        what follows, means intellect. Afterwards he proves with many arguments
        that the operation of the intellect does not take place through a bodily
        organ.
      </p>
      <p>
        [59] We have set forth these things, not wishing to refute the above
        mentioned error by the authority of philosophers, but in order to show
        that not only Latin writers, whose language some do not savor, but also
        Greeks and Arabs, thought that intellect is a part or power or faculty
        of the soul which is the form of body. So I wonder from what
        Peripatetics they boast to have derived this error, unless perhaps they
        have less desire to think correctly with other Peripatetics than to err
        with Averroes, who was not a Peripatetic but the perverter of
        Peripatetic philosophy.

      </p>
      <p>
        [60] Having shown from the words of Aristotle and those who followed him
        that the intellect is a potency of the soul which is the form of the
        body although that potency which is intellect is not the act of any
        organ, “because its operation is not shared by any bodily operation,” as
        Aristotle says, we must now inquire by way of arguments what ought to be
        made of all this. And since, according to the teaching of Aristotle, it
        is from acts that their principles are known, our consideration must
        begin with the proper act of intellect, namely, understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        [61] Concerning which there is no stronger argument than that given by
        Aristotle when he argues thus: “The soul is that whereby we first live
        and understand, therefore it is a certain form and species” of some
        body. (414a12-14) He relies on this argument, therefore, characterizing
        it as a demonstration, for in the beginning of the chapter he says, “For
        it is not enough for a definitive formula to express as most now do the
        mere fact; it must include and exhibit the ground also.” (413a13-20) By
        way of example, he says that what a tetragon or square is demonstrated
        through the discovery of the proportional mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        [62] The power and irrefutability of this demonstration is clear from
        the fact that whoever wishes to differ with it necessarily says what is
        absurd. That this singular man understands is manifest, for we would
        never ask about intellect unless we understood, nor when we ask about
        intellect are we asking about anything other than that whereby we
        understand. Thus Aristotle says, “”I mean the intellect whereby the soul
        understands,” (429a23) and concludes accordingly that if something is
        the first principle whereby we understand, it must be the form of the
        body, because he earlier showed that that whereby we first do anything
        is the form. And this is clear from argument: anything acts insofar as
        it is in act; anything is in act through its form; therefore that
        through which something first acts must be form.
      </p>
      <p>
        [66] If however you should say that the first principle of the act which
        is understanding, what we call intellect, is not form, then you must
        find a way in which the act of this principle can be an action of this
        man. There are those who have tried in various ways to do this. One of
        them, Averroes, held that the principle of understanding which is called
        the possible intellect is not a soul or a part of the soul, except
        equivocally; rather, it is a separated substance. He said that the
        separate substance’s understanding is mine or yours insofar as possible
        intellect is joined to me or you through the phantasms which are in me
        and you. He says that comes about in this way: the intelligible species
        which becomes one with the possible intellect as its form and act has
        two subjects, one those phantasms, the other the possible intellect.
        Therefore the possible intellect is continuous with us through its form
        by way of phantasms, and thus when the possible intellect understands,
        this man understands.
      </p>
      <p>
        [64] There are three ways of showing that this amounts to nothing.
        First, because then the union of intellect and man would not come into
        being when he does, as Theophrastus maintains and Aristotle indicates in
        Book Two of the <i>Physics</i> where he says that the goal of the
        naturalist’s consideration of forms is the form according to which man
        is generated by man and the sun. Intellect is obviously the goal of the
        naturalist’s consideration, yet, according to what Averroes says,
        intellect is not united with man from his generation, but through the
        operation of sense insofar as he is actually sensing: imagination is “a
        movement resulting from an actual exercise of a power of sense,” as is
        said in <i>On the Soul</i>. (429a1-2)
      </p>
      <p>
        [65] Second, because this union would have not one but diverse causes.
        For clearly the intelligible species as it exists in the phantasm is
        understood only potentially, but abstracted from phantasms, in the
        possible intellect, it is actually understood. If then the intelligible
        species is the form of possible intellect only insofar as it is
        abstracted from phantasms, it follows that [possible intellect] is not
        united with phantasms through the intelligible species but rather is
        separated from them. Unless perhaps it is said that the possible
        intellect is one with phantasms in the way in which the mirror is one
        with the man whose image is reflected in the mirror; but such a union
        manifestly does not suffice for the union of the act. For it is obvious
        that the act of the mirror, which is to represent, is not on this
        account attributed to the man. No more could the action of possible
        intellect on the basis of the foregoing conjunction be attributed to
        this man Socrates in order that this man might understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        [66] Third, even granted that numerically one and the same species were
        the form of the possible intellect and at the same time in phantasms,
        such a conjunction would not suffice to explain that this man
        understands. For it is obvious that just as something is sensed through
        a sensible species but one senses something through the sensitive power,
        so something is understood through the intelligible species, but one
        understands something through the intellective power. Hence the wall in
        which the color is, whose sensible species is actually in sight, is
        seen, and does not see; it is the animal having the power of sight, in
        which such a species is, that sees. The aforesaid union of the possible
        intellect with man, in whom exist the phantasms whose species are in the
        possible intellect, is like the union of the wall, in which the color
        is, with sight in which the species of its color is. The wall does not
        see, but its color is seen; thus it would follow that man does not
        understand, but his phantasms are understood, by the possible intellect.
        It is impossible, therefore, on the basis of Averroes’s position, to
        show that this man understands.
      </p>
      <p>
        [67] Some, seeing that, on Averroes’s position, it cannot be sustained
        that this man understands, take another path and say that intellect is
        united to body as its mover, and thus, insofar as body and intellect
        become one as mover and moved, the intellect is part of this man, and
        therefore the operation of intellect is attributed to this man in the
        same way that the operation of the eye, seeing, is attributed to this
        man. He who says this must be asked, first, what this singular thing
        Socrates is. Is he only intellect which is a mover? Or is he what is
        moved by it—a body animated by vegetative and sensitve soul? Or is he
        composed of both? So far as his position can be discerned, it appears
        that he adopts the third possibility, namely, that Socrates is composed
        of both.
      </p>
      <p>
        [68] Let us then proceed against them making use of Aristotle’s argument
        in Book Eight of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, “What then it is that makes man
        one?” (1045a14) “In the case of all things which have several parts and
        in which the whole is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the totality is
        something besides the parts, there is a cause of unity; for as regards
        material things contact is the cause in some cases, and in others
        viscocity or some other such quality.” (1045a8-12) “Clearly, then, if
        people proceed thus in their usual manner of definition and speech, they
        cannot explain and solve the difficulty. But if, as we say, one element
        is matter and another is form, and one potentially and the other
        actually, the question will no longer be thought a difficulty.”
        (1045a20-25)
      </p>
      <p>
        [69] But if you should say that Socrates is not some one thing
        absolutely, but one by the coming together of mover and moved, many
        incoherencies follow. First, indeed, that since anything is one in the
        manner in which it exists, it would follow that Socrates is not a being
        and does not belong in a species or genus; and further, that he would
        have no action, because only beings act. Hence we do not say that
        understanding the sailor is the grasp of the whole made up of sailor and
        boat, but of sailor alone; similarly, understanding would not be
        Socrates’s activity, but only that of the intellect using the body of
        Socrates. The action of a part is the action of the whole only when the
        whole is one being. Anyone who says otherwise speaks improperly.
      </p>
      <p>
        [70] And if you should say that in this way the heaven understands
        through its motor, this is to appeal to the more difficult case. We must
        go by way of the human intellect to grasp the higher intellects, not
        vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it be said that this individual, Socrates, is a body animated by the
        vegetative and sensitive soul—which seems to follow for those who hold
        that this man is not placed in a species because of intellect, but
        because of the sensitive soul ennobled by an illumination or conjunction
        with possible intellect—then intellect relates to Socrates as mover to
        moved. But then the action of intellect which is understanding can in no
        wise be attributed to Socrates. There are many ways in which this
        consequence is seen to be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        [71] First, because of what the Philosopher says in Book Nine of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>, “Where, then, the result is something apart from the
        exercise, the actuality is in the thing that is being made, e.g. the act
        of building is in the thing that is being built and that of weaving in
        the thing that is being woven, and similarly in all other cases, and in
        general the movement is in the thing that is being moved; but when there
        is no product apart from the actuality, the actuality is in the agents,
        e.g. the act of seeing is in the seeing subject and that of theorizing
        in the theorizing subject.” (1050a30-36) So then, although intellect is
        said to be united with Socrates as mover, this is of no help in locating
        understanding in Socrates nor in grounding the claim that Socrates
        understands, for understanding is an action which is in intellect alone.
        From this too it is clear that they speak falsely who say that
        understanding itself, not intellect, is the act of body: there can be no
        act of understanding that is not the act of intellect, because
        understanding is in intellect alone just as seeing is in sight alone.
        Seeing can only belong to that whose act is sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        [72] Second, because the proper act of the mover is attributed neither
        to the instrument nor to the moved. On the contrary, the action of the
        instrument is attributed to the principal mover. It cannot be said that
        the saw makes the artifact, although the artisan can be said to saw,
        which is the work of the saw. Understanding is the proper activity of
        intellect; hence even granting that understanding is an action passing
        on to another like moving, it does not follow that understanding belongs
        to Socrates if intellect us united to him only as a mover.
      </p>
      <p>
        [73] Third, because in those things whose activities are transitive,
        passing over into other things, actions are attributed in opposite ways
        to movers and moved. Thanks to building the builder is said to build and
        the building to be built. If then understanding were a transitive action
        like motion, it still ought not be said that Socrates understands
        because intellect is united to him as a mover, but rather that intellect
        understands and Socrates is understood. Or perhaps that intellect by
        understanding moves Socrates and Socrates is moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        [74] Sometimes it happens that the action of the mover passes into the
        thing moved, as when that which is moved moves because it is moved, e.g.
        when the heated heats. In this way someone might say that that which is
        moved by the intellect, which in understanding moves, understands by the
        very fact that it is moved. Aristotle, from whom we take the principle
        of this argument, resists this claim in Book Two of <i>On the Soul</i>.
        For when he said that that whereby we first know or are healed is a
        form, namely science and health, he adds, “For the activity of that
        which is capable of originating change seems to take place in that which
        is changed or altered.” (414a11-12) In explaining this Themistius says,
        “Although knowledge or health are sometimes from others, as from a a
        teacher or a physician, nonetheless we have shown that, in things that
        are from nature, the activity of that which is capable of originating
        change is in what is changed or altered.” It is Aristotle’s meaning,
        therefore, and evidently true as well, that when the moved moves and has
        the action of a mover, there must be in it some act from the mover
        whereby it performs an action of this kind; it is thanks to this that it
        primarly acts, and this is its act and form. For example, when something
        heated heats from the heat which is in it from the heater.
      </p>
      <p>
        [75] Given that the intellect moves Socrates, whether by illumining or
        in some other way, then the impression made on Socrates by the intellect
        is that whereby Socrates primarily understands. However, Aristotle has
        proved (429a9-b5) that that whereby Socrates primarily understands, as
        he senses by sense, is potentially all things and for this reason has no
        determinate nature other than to be possible. Consequently it is not
        mixed with body but separate. Granting then that there is some separate
        intellect moving Socrates, it would still be necessary that the possible
        intellect of which Aristotle speaks is in the soul of Socrates just as
        sense, which is that whereby Socrates senses and is potentially all
        sensible things, is.
      </p>
      <p>
        [76] Should it be said, however, that this individual, Socrates, is
        neither composed of intellect and an animated body, nor an animated body
        alone, but only intellect, well, this was the view of Plato who, as
        Gregory of Nyssa says, “because of this difficulty did not want man to
        be of body and soul, but to be a soul using and as it were clothed with
        a body.” But Plotinus, as Macrobius reports, claimed that the soul
        itself is man, saying, “Therefore the true man is not what is seen, but
        that which rules what is seen. Thus when at death animation departs from
        the animal, the body falls widowed from the ruler and it is this which
        is seen in man and is mortal. Every mark of mortality is alien to the
        soul which is truly man.” Yet Simplicius, in his commentary on the
        <i>Categories</i>, numbers Plotinus among the greatest commentators on
        Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p>
        [77] This doctrine does not seem far distant from the words of
        Aristotle, who says in Book Nine of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, “For
        it is characteristic of the good man to exert himself for the good, and
        he does so for his own sake, that is, for the sake of the intellectual
        element in him.” Of course, he says this, not because man is intellect
        alone, but because intellect is the chief thing in man. Hence in the
        sequel he says that “just as the state and every other organized whole
        seems to be that which is the chief thing in it, so too man,” and adds
        that “any man either is this, namely intellect, or it especially.” It is
        in this sense that I appraise Themistius’s words earlier and Plotinus’s
        now when they say that man is soul or intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        [78] That man is not intellect alone nor soul alone is proved in many
        ways. First, by Gregory of Nyssa who, having mentioned Plato’s view,
        adds, “This saying is puzzling and difficult: how can the soul be one
        with its garment? For a tunic and its wearer are not one thing.” Second,
        because Aristotle in Book Seven of the <i>Metaphysics</i> proves that
        “man and horse and the like” are not form alone, “but terms which are
        thus applied to individuals, but universally, are not substance but
        something composed of this particular formula and this particular matter
        treated as universal, but when we come to the individual, Socrates is
        composed of ultimate individual matter; and similarly in all other
        cases.” The proof of this is that no part of the body can be defined
        independently of some part of soul and, the soul being gone, flesh and
        eye are such only equivocally, which would not be the case if Socrates
        were intellect or soul alone. Third, it would follow that, since
        intellect moves only through the will, as is proved in Book Three of
        <i>On the Soul</i>, (433a22) this would be among the things subject to
        will that man could keep his body or shuffle it off when he wished,
        which is manifestly false.
      </p>
      <p>
        [79] It is therefore evident that the intellect is not joined to
        Socrates as a mover; but, even if it were, it would not advance the
        claim that Socrates understands. Those who wish to defend this position,
        therefore, must either admit that they themselves understand nothing and
        are unworthy participants in the debate, or admit what Aristotle
        concludes: that that with which we first understand is species and form.
      </p>
      <p>
        [80] This can also be concluded from the fact that this man is placed in
        some species. The species is derived from form; therefore that through
        which this man has a species is form. But each thing has its species
        from that which is the principle of the proper activity of the species;
        the proper operation of man as man is understanding: it is in this that
        he differs from the other animals and that is why Aristotle locates
        ultimate happiness in this activity. But the principle thanks to which
        we understand is the intellect, as Aristotle says; therefore it must be
        united to the body as form, not indeed in such a way that the
        intellective power is the act of some organ, but because it is a power
        of the soul which is the act of a physically organized body.
      </p>
      <p>
        [81] Moreover, the position under discussion would destroy the
        principles of moral philosophy, for it would take away what is in our
        power. Something is in our power thanks to will, which is why the
        voluntary is defined as that which is in our power. But will is in
        intellect, as is evident from Aristotle in Book Three of
        <i>On the Soul</i> (432b5) and from the fact that intellect and will are
        found in separate substances as well as from the fact that something is
        loved or hated universally. We hate the genus of robbers, as Aristotle
        says in the <i>Rhetoric</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [82] If then intellect is not something of this man such that it is
        truly one with him, but is united to him only through phantasms or as a
        mover, will would not be in man, but in the separated intellect. And
        thus a man would not have dominion over his acts, nor could anyone be
        praised or blamed for his acts, which is to destroy the principles of
        moral philosophy. And since that is absurd and out of keeping with human
        life—it would be unnecessary to take counsel or to pass laws —it follows
        that intellect is united to us in such a way that we are truly one with
        it, which can only be in the way suggested, namely, that it be a power
        of the soul which is united to us as our form. It follows then that this
        must be held without any doubt, not because of the revelation of faith,
        as our opponents say, but because to deny it is go against things
        manifestly obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        [83] It is an easy matter to refute the arguments put forward on behalf
        of the opposite view. For they say that it follows from their position
        that intellect is a material form, and is not free of every sensible
        nature, with the consequence that whatever is received in intellect is
        received as in matter, individually and not universally. And further
        that if it is a material form, that it is not understood in act, and
        thus intellect is incapable of understanding itself, which is manifestly
        false. No material form is understood in act, but only in potency: it
        becomes understood in act through abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is obvious from what has been said earlier. For we do not say
        that the human soul is the form of body according to the intellective
        power, which according to Aristotle’s teaching is not the act of any
        organ. (429a27-28) The soul, with respect to the intellective power, is
        immaterial and receives immaterially and understands itself. Hence
        Aristotle significantly says that soul is the place of forms “not the
        whole soul, but the intellect.” (429a28-29)
      </p>
      <p>
        [84] If it be objected to this that a power of the soul cannot be more
        immaterial or simpler than its essence—well, that would be a good
        argument if the essence of the human soul were the form of matter in
        such a way that it did not exist of itself but only in dependence on the
        existence of the composite. Other forms have no existence or operations
        of themselves without a sharing in matter, and are therefore said to be
        immersed in matter. The human soul exists in its own right and is to a
        degree united with a matter that does not wholly capture it—this form is
        greater in dignity than to be a capacity for matter. Nothing prevents
        its having some operation or power to which matter does not attain.
      </p>
      <p>
        [85] Let him who says this consider that if this intellective principle
        whereby we understand existed separate and distinct from the soul which
        is the form of our body, it would be of itself understanding and
        understood and not sometimes understanding, sometimes not. Nor would it
        need to understand itself by way of intelligibles and acts, but would do
        so through its own essence like other separated substances and it would
        not be fitting that it need our phantasms in order to understand. The
        order of things is not such that higher substances require lower
        substances for their own principal perfection, no more than celestial
        bodies are formed or perfected in their operations by lower bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The claim that the intellect is some principle separated in substance
        and yet is perfected and comes actually to understand through species
        taken from phantasms is, therefore, improbable in the extreme.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        [86] So much for the contention that intellect is not the soul which is
        the form of our body nor a part of it but some kind of separate
        substance. There remains to discuss the claim that there is one possible
        intellect for everybody. There would perhaps be some reason for saying
        this of agent intellect, and many philosophers do say it, for nothing
        absurd seems to follow from several things being perfected by one agent,
        as by one sun the visual powers of all animals are able to see. Although
        this is not Aristotle’s intention—he holds that the agent intellect is
        in the soul—he nonetheless compares it to a light, and Plato, holding
        that the intellect is one separate thing, likened it to the sun, as
        Themistius tells us, for there is one sun but many lights diffused from
        it for the sake of seeing. But, however it be with the agent intellect,
        to say that the possible intellect is one for all men appears impossible
        in many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        [87] First, because if the possible intellect is that whereby we
        understand, of an individual man who understands it must be said either
        that he is intellect itself or that intellect formally inheres in him,
        not indeed in such a way that it be the form of the body but rather a
        power of the soul which is the form of the body. Should anyone say that
        the singular man is intellect itself, it would follow that this singular
        man would not differ from another singular man and that all men are one
        man, not by sharing in the same species, but as one individual. But if
        intellect is in us formally, it would follow, as has already been said,
        that there are different forms of different bodies. For just as man is
        composed of body and soul, so this man, Callias or Socrates, is composed
        of this body and this soul. If souls differ, however, and the possible
        intellect is the power of the soul whereby the soul understands, they
        must differ numerically, for it is impossible to imagine numerically one
        power of different things. Should someone say that man understands
        through possible intellect as by something of his own, which however is
        not a part of him as a form but rather as a mover, it has already been
        shown above [79] that on this view it can in no wise be said that
        Socrates understands.
      </p>
      <p>
        [88] But let us grant that Socrates understands because the intellect
        understands although intellect is only a mover, as a man sees because
        the eye sees. And, to keep to the analogy, let us posit that there is
        numerically one eye for all men. Now we ask whether all men are one
        seeing entity or many. To discover the truth of the matter, it should be
        noted that the first mover differs from the instrument, for if many men
        use numerically one instrument we say there are many agents, for
        example, when many use one machine for the throwing of stones or for
        elevation. If however the chief agent is one, but uses many instruments,
        there is nonetheless one agent even though many instruments are needed
        for it, though perhaps a diversity of operations because of the
        diversity of instruments. Sometimes however there is one operation
        although many instruments are required for it. The unity of the one
        acting is read not from the instruments but from the chief agent who
        uses the instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus on the position described earlier, if the eye were what is
        principal in a man and it would uses all powers of the soul and parts of
        the body as instruments, many having one eye would be one seeing thing.
        But if the eye were not what is principal in man, but something higher
        that uses the eye and is diversified in diverse men, there would indeed
        be many seeing but with one eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        [89] But obviously it is intellect that is principal in man and uses all
        the powers of the soul and bodily members as organs. Hence Aristotle’s
        careful remark that man is intellect “or especially it.” If then there
        were one intellect for all, it would necessarily follow that there is
        only one who understands and consequently only one who wills and of his
        own free will uses all those things thanks to which men are diverse from
        one another. From which it follows further that there would be no
        difference between men as to the free choice of will but it would be the
        same for all, if indeed intellect, in which resides the principality and
        dominion of using all the others, is one and undivided in all. But this
        is clearly false, impossible and repugnant to what is obvious; it
        destroys the whole of moral science and all those things which pertain
        to civil interchange, which is natural to man, as Aristotle says.
      </p>
      <p>
        [90] Again, if all men understand by one intellect, however it be united
        to them, whether as form or as mover, it necessarily follows that of all
        men there would be numerically one act of understanding which is both
        simultaneous and of one intelligible object. For example, if I
        understand stone and you do likewise, it would be necessary that my
        intellectual activity and yours be one and the same. The operation of
        the same active principle, be it form or mover, with respect to the same
        object at the same time, must be numerically one, as is clear from what
        the Philosopher says in Book Five of the <i>Physics</i>. So, if there
        were many men having one eye, the seeing of all with respect to the same
        object at the same time could only be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        [91] So too if there were one intellect for all, it would follow that
        there is but one intellectual operation of all men understanding the
        same thing at the same time, especially since nothing in terms of which
        men differ from one another would share in the intellectual operation.
        For phantasms are preambles to the action of intellect, as colors are to
        the act of vision, hence the action of intellect would not be
        diversified because of their differences, especially with regard to one
        intelligible. They distinguish the knowledge of this one from the
        knowledge of that one because the one understands those things of which
        he has phantasms and the other those of which he has phantasms. But when
        two know and understand the same thing, intellectual activity itself can
        in no way be diversified by the diversity of phantasms.
      </p>
      <p>
        [92] Further, it should be pointed out that this position manifestly
        conflicts with the teaching of Aristotle. For when he says of possible
        intellect that it is separate and potentially all things, he adds that
        “When thought has become each thing in the way in which a man who
        actually knows is said to do so,” that is, in the way that knowledge is
        an act and the knower is said to be in act insofar as he has the habit,
        he adds, “this happens when he is now able to exercise the power on his
        own initiative; its condition is still one of potentiality, but in a
        different sense from the potentiality which preceded the acquisition of
        knowledge by learning or discovery.” (429b5-9) Later he asks, “If
        intellect is simple and impassible and has nothing in common with
        anything else, as Anaxagoras says, how can it come to think at all if
        thinking involves a kind of passivity?” (429b23-25) And in reply says,
        “intellect is in a sense potentially whatever is thinkable, though
        actually it is nothing until it has thought. What it thinks must be in
        it just as characters are said to be on a writing-table on which as yet
        nothing actually stands written: this is exactly what happens with
        intellect.” (429b30-430a2) It is the teaching of Aristotle, therefore,
        that the possible intellect is in potency prior to learning or
        discovery, like a table on which nothing is yet written, but after
        learning and discovery it is in act by the habit of science, thanks to
        which it can actuate itself even though it is then in potency to
        actually considering.
      </p>
      <p>
        [93] Three things should be noted here. First, that the habit of science
        is the first act of the possible intellect which, thanks to it, comes to
        be in act and can operate on its own. Science is not only according to
        illumined phantasms, as some say, or a faculty which we acquire by
        frequent meditation and exercise, in order that we might be linked with
        possible intellect by way of our phantasms. Second, it should be noted
        that before we learn or discover, the possible intellect itself is in
        potency as a table on which nothing is written. Third, that through our
        learning or discovering the possible intellect becomes actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        [94] None of these things could be if there were only one possible
        intellect for all who are, were or will be. It is obvious that species
        are conserved in the intellect, for it is the place of forms, as the
        Philosopher said above (<i>On the Soul</i>, III, 429127-28); moreover,
        science is a permanent habit. If then one of the foregoing men becomes
        actual with respect to some intelligible species and is perfected by the
        habit of science, that habit and those species remain in him. Since any
        recipient does not have what it receives, it will be impossible that
        through my learning or discovering those species be acquired by the
        possible intellect. For although someone might say that through my
        discovering the possible intellect can newly come to be in act with
        respect to something, for example if I should discover some knowable
        thing never before discovered, yet this could not come about through
        learning, for I can only learn what the teacher knew. It would therefore
        be pointless to say that the intellect was in potency prior to learning
        or discovering.
      </p>
      <p>
        [95] Were someone to add that, according to the opinion of Aristotle,
        there have always been men, it would follow that there was never a first
        man who understood and thus intelligible species are acquired by
        possible intellect through no one’s phantasms but are intelligible
        species of an eternal possible intellect. In vain therefore did
        Aristotle posit an agent intellect to make potentially intelligible
        things actually intelligible; in vain too did he posit that phantasms
        are to the possible intellect as colors are to sight, if the possible
        intellect receives nothing from phantasms. For this too seems irrational
        that a separated substance should receive from our phantasms and that it
        cannot understand itself save through our learning or understanding. But
        Aristotle added to the foregoing, “and it can then understand itself,”
        (429b9) namely, after learning or discovering.
      </p>
      <p>
        [96] Should they wish to evade these absurdities by claiming that
        Aristotle says all those things about the possible intellect insofar as
        it is made one with us and not as it is in itself, it must first be said
        that Aristotle’s words do not mean that. Indeed he speaks of the
        possible intellect in terms of what is proper to it and insofar as it is
        distinguished from the agent. Then, if no help is forthcoming from
        Aristotle’s words, let us posit, as they say, that the possible
        intellect eternally has intelligible species through which it is made
        one with us according to the phantasms which are in us. It is necessary
        that the intelligible species which are in the possible intellect and
        the phantasms that are in us be related in one of three ways. The first
        is that the intelligible species which are in the possible intellect are
        taken from the phantasms which are in us, as Aristotle’s words suggest.
        That this is ruled out by the position under consideration has been
        shown. The second way is that the species are not taken from phantasms
        but are shone upon our phantasms, for example, if there were species in
        the eye shining on the colors which are in the wall. The third way is
        that the intelligible species are neither received in the possible
        intellect from the phantasms nor imprint something on the phantasms.
      </p>
      <p>
        [98] If the second way is taken, namely that the intelligible species
        illumine the phantasms and in this way are understood, it would follow,
        first, that the phantasms come to be intelligible in act not through the
        agent intellect but through the possible intellect and its species.
        Second, that such an illumination of phantasms could not make phantasms
        intelligible in act: phantasms do not become intelligible in act except
        through abstraction; but this would be more like a receiving than an
        abstracting. Again, since any reception is according to the nature of
        the receiver, the illumining of the intelligible species which are in
        the possible intellect will not be of phantasms which are in us in an
        intelligible mode, but sensibly and materially. Thus we could not
        understand the universal thanks to this kind of illumination. But if the
        intelligible species of the possible intellect are neither taken from
        phantasms nor shone upon them, they will be wholly disparate, having no
        similarity, and phantasms would have nothing to do with understanding,
        which flies in the face of the obvious. Thus there is no possible way in
        which the possible intellect could be one and the same for all men.

        [99] Arguments intended to exclude a plurality of possible intellects
        remain to be dealt with. The first is this: Whatever is multiplied by a
        division of matter is a material form, which is why substances separate
        from matter cannot be many members of the same species. If then there
        were a plurality of intellects in many men who are numerically
        distinguished from one another by the division of matter, it would
        necessarily follow that intellect is a material form. But that goes
        against the words of Aristotle and the argument in which he proves the
        intellect is separate. If then it is separate it is not a material form
        and can in no way be multiplied according to the multiplication of
        bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        [100] So attached are they to this argument that they say God could not
        make many intellects of the same species in diverse men, because, they
        say, this would imply a contradiction: to have a nature that can be
        numerically multiplied is other than the nature of separated form. They
        go beyond this, however, and want to conclude from this that no separate
        form is numerically one nor an individuated thing. They say this is
        apparent from the word itself, for only that is numerically one which is
        one of a number of thingss, but form freed from matter is not one of a
        number because it does not have within it the cause of number, which is
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        [101] To begin at the end, they seem not to understand their own words
        in what was just said. For Aristotle, in Book Four of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>, says that “the essence of each thing is one in no
        merely accidental way” and that “similarly it is from its very nature
        something that <i>is</i>.” If separated substance is being, therefore,
        it must be one substance, especially since Aristotle says in Book Eight
        of the <i>Metaphysics</i> that things which have no matter have no cause
        of their being or of their being one. In Book Five of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>, four kinds of unity are distinguished, namely,
        numeric, specific, generic and proportional. It cannot be said that any
        separate substance is one only specifically or generically, since this
        is not to be one simply speaking. There remains that a separate
        substance is numerically one. Nor is it said to be numerically one
        because it is one among numbers—number is not the cause of the one but
        vice versa—but because in numbering it is not divided: one is that which
        is undivided.
      </p>
      <p>
        [102] Nor is it true to say that every number is caused by matter, for
        then Aristotle would have inquired in vain after the number of separated
        substances. For Aristotle says in Book Five of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> that “many” is said not only numerically but
        specifically and generically. Nor is it true that separate substance is
        not singular and individuated, otherwise it would have no operation,
        since acts belong only to singulars, as the Philosopher says; hence he
        argues against Plato in Book Seven of the <i>Metaphysics</i> that if the
        Idea is separate, it will not be predicated of many, nor will it be
        definable any more than other individuals which are unique in their
        species, like the sun and moon. Matter is the principle of individuation
        in material things insofar as matter is not shareable by many, since it
        is the first subject not existing in another. Hence Aristotle says that
        if the Idea were separate “it would be something, that is, an
        individual, which it would be impossible to predicate of many.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [103] Separate substances, therefore, are individual and singular, but
        they are individuated not by matter but by this that it is not their
        nature to exist in another and consequently to be participated in by
        many. From which it follows that if any form is of a nature to be
        participated in by something, such that it be the act of some matter, it
        can be individuated and multiplied by comparison with matter. It has
        already been shown above that the intellect is a power of the soul which
        is the act of the body. Therefore in many bodies there are many souls
        and in many souls there are many intellectual powers, that is,
        intellects. Nor does it follow from this that the intellect is a
        material power, as has been shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        [104] Should anyone object that, if the many souls are multiplied
        according to bodies, it follows that they will not remain when the
        bodies have been destroyed, the response is obvious from what has
        already been said. A thing is one in the way it is a being, as is said
        in Book Four of the <i>Metaphysics</i>; therefore, for the soul to be is
        to be in the body as its form, nor is it prior to body, nonetheless it
        remains in existence after the body is destroyed: thus each soul remains
        in its unity and consequently many souls in their manyness.
      </p>
      <p>
        [105] They argue most crudely to show that God cannot bring it about
        that there should be many intellects, believing this to involve a
        contradiction. For even granting that it is not of the nature of
        intellect that it be multiplied, it does not follow from this that the
        multiplying of intellect involves a contradiction. Nothing prevents a
        thing’s getting from another something that it is not of its nature to
        have: it is not of the nature of the heavy to be above, yet for the
        heavy to be above does not involve a contradiction although for the
        heavy to be above by its very nature would involve a contradiction. Thus
        if the intellect were naturally one for all because it had no natural
        cause of multiplication, multiplication could nonetheless come about
        through a supernatural cause without involving any contradiction. We say
        this not because of the present question but lest this form of arguing
        be extended to other cases, for in this way one could conclude that God
        cannot bring it about that the dead should rise and the blind have their
        sight restored to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        [106] To bolster their error they bring forth another argument. They ask
        whether what is understood in me and in you is completely one or
        numerically two but specifically one. If what is understood is one,
        there will be one intellect. If numerically two but specifically one, it
        follows that they will have as things understood the thing understood.
        Wherever there are numerically two but specifically one there is one
        thing understood, because there is one quiddity through which
        understanding takes place, and thus to infinity, which is impossible.
        Therefore it is impossible that there be numerically two things
        understood in me and you. There is one alone, then, and numerically only
        one intellect in all.
      </p>
      <p>
        [107] It ought to be asked by those who consider themselves to argue so
        subtly whether for things understood to be numerically two but
        specifically one is contrary to the notion of the understood insofar as
        it is understood, or insofar as it is understood by man. It is clear
        from the argument they formulate that it is contrary to the notion of
        the thing understood. For it is of the notion of the thing understood as
        such that nothing need be abstracted from it in order that it be
        understood. Therefore, on the basis of their argument, we can conclude,
        not just that there is only one thing understood by all men, but that
        there is simply one thing understood. And if there is but one thing
        understood, on their reasoning it follows that there is only one
        intellect in the whole world, not only for men. Therefore not only is
        our intellect a separate substance, it is also God Himself, and the
        plurality of separated substances is wholly swept away.
      </p>
      <p>
        [108] One who sought to respond that the thing understood by one
        separate substance and that understood by another are not specifically
        one because the intellects differ specifically, would deceive himself
        because that which is understood is related to understanding and to
        intellect as an object to act and potency. The object does not take its
        species from either the act or the power, but rather the other way
        around. Therefore it must simply be conceded that the understanding of
        one thing, say a stone, is one alone not only in all men but also in all
        intelligences.
      </p>
      <p>
        [109] But it remains to ask what is the understood itself. For if they
        say that the thing understood is one immaterial species existing in the
        intellect, in a way they unwittingly slide into the teaching of Plato
        who taught that there can be no science of sensible things, but every
        science is of one separated form. It is not relevant whether someone
        says that the knowledge of a rock is of one separated form of rock or of
        one form of rock that is in the intellect. In either case it follows
        that sciences are not of the things that are here, but only of separated
        things. Because Plato taught that immaterial forms of this kind are of
        themselves subsistent, he could maintain along with this that many
        intellects derive from one separate form knowledge of one truth. But
        those who posit immaterial forms of this kind—which they call the things
        understood—in the intellect, have to say that there is only one
        intellect, not only for all men, but absolutely speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        [110] In keeping with the teaching of Aristotle, therefore, it ought to
        be said that the understood thing which is one is the very nature or
        quiddity of the thing: natural science and the other sciences are of
        things, not of understood species. For if the thing understood were not
        the very nature of rock which is in things, but the species which is in
        the intellect, it would follow that I do not understand the thing that
        is a stone, but only the intention which is abstracted from the stone.
        It is true that the nature of stone as it is in singulars is only
        potentially understood, but it comes to be actually understood because
        the species come from sensible things, through the mediation of the
        senses, to imagination, from which the intelligible species which are in
        the possible intellect are abstracted by the power of the agent
        intellect. These species, however, do not relate to possible intellect
        as what is understood, but as species through which the intellect
        understands, just as the species which are in sight are not the things
        seen, but that whereby sight sees, save insofar as the intellect
        reflects upon itself, which cannot happen in the case of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        [111] If however understanding were a transitive action passing into
        exterior matter, like burning and moving, it would follow that
        understanding exists in the way the nature of things exists in singulars
        just as the combustion of fire exists according to the manner of the
        combustible. But because understanding is an action which remains in the
        one understanding, as Aristotle says in Book Nine of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>, it follows that understanding is according to the
        mode of the one understanding, that is, according to the demands of the
        species whereby the understander understands. But this, since it is
        abstracted from individual principles, does not represent the thing in
        its individual conditions but only according to the universal nature. If
        two are conjoined in a thing, nothing prevents one of them being
        represented in sense without the other: hence the color of honey or of
        the apple is seen by sight without its taste. Just so the intellect
        understands the universal nature by abstraction from individual
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        [112] Therefore there is one thing that is understood by me and you, but
        it is understood by means of one thing by me and by means of another by
        you, that is, by different intelligible species, and my understanding
        differs from yours and my intellect differs from yours. Hence Aristotle
        in the <i>Categories</i> says that knowledge is singular with respect to
        its subject, “the individual knowledge of grammar is in a subject, the
        soul, but is not said of any subject.” Hence when my intellect
        understands itself to understand, it understands some singular activity;
        when however it understands understanding simply, it understands
        something universal. It is not singularity that is repugnant to
        intelligibility, but materiality; thus, since they are immaterial
        singulars, as was said of separate substances above, nothing prevents
        such singulars from being understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        [113] Thus it is clear how there can be the same science in the learner
        and teacher. For it is the same with respect to the thing known, but not
        with respect to the intelligible species whereby each knows—in that
        respect, science is individuated in me and you. Nor is it necessary that
        the knowledge which is in the learner be caused by the knowledge that is
        in the teacher as the heat of water by the heat of fire, but as the
        health in matter is caused by the health that is in the mind of the
        physician. Just as in the patient there is a natural principle of health
        to which the physician supplies aids in order that health might be
        perfected, so in the learner there is a natural principle of knowledge,
        namely the agent intellect and the first self-evident principles. The
        teacher supplies certain aids, deducing conclusions from principles
        known in themselves. Thus the physician strives to heal in the way
        nature would heal, namely, by heating and chilling; similarly the master
        leads to science in the way in which one discovering it for himself
        would acquire it, proceeding, that is, from the known to the unknown.
        And just as health in the sick person does not come about by the power
        of the physician but by the capacity of nature, so too knowledge is not
        caused in the learner by the power of the master, but by the capacity of
        the learner.
      </p>
      <p>
        [114] As to the further objection that if, their bodies having been
        destroyed, many intellectual substances should remain, it would follow
        that they are otiose, since Aristotle in Book XI of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> argued that if there were separated substances which
        did not move bodies, they would be otiose. But if one carefully
        considers the text of Aristotle, the difficulty is easily solved. For
        Aristotle, before giving this argument, says, “the unmovable substances
        and principles may reasonably be taken to be just so many; the assertion
        of <i>necessity</i> must be left to more powerful thinkers.” It is clear
        from this that he is pursuing a kind of probability and not claiming
        necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        [115] Since that is otiose which does not attain the end for which it is
        designed, they cannot say even with probability that the separated
        substances are otiose if they do not move bodies, unless perhaps they
        mean that the motions of bodies are the ends of separated substances,
        which is completely impossible, since the end is higher than the things
        that are for the sake of the end. Nor does Aristotle here conclude that
        they would be otiose if they did not move bodies, but that “every being
        and every substance which is immune from change and in virtue of itself
        has attained to the best must be considered an end.” It is the most
        perfect state of any thing that it not only is good in itself, but also
        causes goodness in others. But it was not clear how separated substances
        would cause goodness in inferior bodies save by the motion of some
        bodies, hence Aristotle derived from this a probable argument to show
        that there are as many separate substances as are manifested by the
        heavenly bodies, although as he himself says this has no claim to
        necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        [116] We concede that the human soul separated from body does not have
        the ultimate perfection of its nature, since it is a part of human
        nature: no part has complete perfection if it is separated from its
        whole. But it is not for this reason frustrated, for the end of the
        human soul is not to move the body, but to understand, in which its
        happiness consists, as Aristotle proves in Book Ten of the
        <i>Ethics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [117] In advancing their error they also say that if there were many
        intellects for many men, since intellect is incorruptible, it would
        follow on Aristotle’s view, since he held the world to be eternal and
        men to have always existed, that there would be an actual infinity of
        intellects. Algazel responded to this in his <i>Metaphysics</i> saying
        that “in anything where there is one of these without the other,” that
        is, quantity or a multitude without order, “infinity will not be taken
        from it, as in the case of the movement of the heaven.” And later he
        adds, “Similarly we grant that human souls, which are separable from the
        body at death, are infinite in number, although they exist at the same
        time, since there is no natural ordering among them by the removal of
        which souls would cease to exist; none of them is the cause of the
        others, but in nature and position they are simultaneously without prior
        and posterior. There is no prior and posterior in them according to
        nature save according to the time of their creation. In their essences
        insofar as they are essences there is no ordering in any way, but they
        are equal in existence, unlike spaces and bodies and cause and effect.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [118] We cannot know what Aristotle’s solution to this might have been
        because we don’t possess that part of the <i>Metaphysics</i> in which he
        deals with separated substances. In Book Two of the <i>Physics</i> the
        Philosopher says that of the forms “the mode of existence of the
        separable” insofar as they are separable, “it is the business of first
        philosophy to define.” But it is obvious that whatever he says about
        this would cause no distress to Catholics, who hold that the world
        began.
      </p>
      <p>
        [119] They speak falsehood who say that it was a principle with all
        those who philosophize, both Arabs and Peripatetics, if not for the
        Latins, that the intellect is not multiplied numerically. Algazel was an
        Arab, not a Latin. And Avicenna too, who was an Arab, speaks thus in his
        book <i>On the Soul</i>, “Prudence, stupidity, opinion can only inhere
        in the essence of the soul. Therefore the soul is not numerically one
        but many though of one species.”
      </p>
      <p>
        [120] And lest we omit the Greeks, we should cite the words of
        Themistius in his commentary. For when he asked of the agent intellect
        whether it was one or many, he answered: “Or the first illuminator is
        one but the illumined and illumining many: for the sun is one, but you
        will say that light is in some way imparted to sight. For this reason
        Aristotle proposes light rather than the sun in the comparison, but
        Plato proposes the sun.” It is clear from these words of Themistius that
        neither the agent intellect, of which Aristotle speaks, is the one who
        is illuminator, nor the possible that which is illumined. There is
        indeed one principle of illumination, namely a certain separated
        substance which is either God, according to Catholics, or the ultimate
        intelligence according to Avicenna. Themistius proves the unity of this
        separate principle by the fact that the teacher and learner understand
        the same thing, which would not be the case if there were not the same
        illuminating principle. What he says later, that some doubt whether the
        possible intellect is one, is certainly true.
      </p>
      <p>
        [121] But he says no more of this because his intention was not to
        discuss the diverse opinions of philosophers, but to explicate the
        teachings of Aristotle, Plato and Theophrastus. Hence at the end he
        concludes, “What I said to express what seemed to philosophers to be the
        case is of singular difficulty and concern. From what I have said one
        can gather the views of Aristotle and Theophrastus, and especially of
        Plato, about them.” It is evident, therefore, that Aristotle and
        Theophrastus and Themisitius and Plato himself did not hold as a
        principle that the possible intellect is one for all. Averroes, it is
        clear, distorts in reporting it the thought of Themistius and
        Theophrastus concerning possible and agent intellects, so we rightly
        said above that he is the perverter of Peripatetic philosophy. How
        wonderful then that some, consulting only the commentary of Averroes,
        presume to pronounce that what he says is the common view of all
        philosophers, Greek and Arab, if not the Latins.
      </p>
      <p>
        [122] It is yet more wonderful, indeed worthy of indignation, that
        anyone professing himself to be a Christian should presume to speak so
        irreverently of the Christian faith as to say that, “The Latins do not
        accept this as a principle,” namely, that there is only one intellect,
        “perhaps because their law is contrary to it.” There are two evils in
        this. First, to doubt whether this is against the faith; second, to give
        the nod to what is alien to this law. Afterward he said, “This is the
        reason why Catholics seem to hold their position,” where the judgment of
        the faith is called a position! Nor is there less presumption in what he
        dares later to assert, namely that God cannot bring it about that there
        are many intellects, because this implies a contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        [123] Even more serious is this subsequent remark: “Through reason I
        conclude necessarily that intellect is numerically one, but I firmly
        hold the opposite by faith.” Therefore he thinks faith is of things
        whose contrary can be necessarily concluded; since the only thing that
        can be necessarily concluded is a necessary truth whose opposite is
        false and impossible, it follows from this statement that faith is of
        the false and impossible, which not even God can bring about and the
        ears of the faithful cannot bear. He does not lack the high temerity to
        presume to discuss what does not pertain to philosophy but is purely of
        faith, such that the soul suffers from the fire of hell, and to say that
        the teaching of the doctors concerning these things should be
        reprobated. By equal right one could dispute concerning the Trinity, the
        Incarnation and the like, concerning which he speaks only in ignorance.

        [124] This then is what we have written to destroy the error mentioned,
        using the arguments and teachings of the philosophers themselves, not
        the documents of faith. If anyone glorying in the name of false science
        wishes to say anything in reply to what we have written, let him not
        speak in corners nor to boys who cannot judge of such arduous matters,
        but reply to this in writing, if he dares. He will find that not only I,
        who am the least of men, but many others zealous for the truth, will
        resist his error and correct his ignorance.
