    <blockquote>
      <p>
        1 There was a certain Pharisee named Nicodemus, a member of the
        Sanhedrin. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know
        that you are a teacher come from God, for no one could perform the signs
        you perform, unless he had God with him.” 3 Jesus responded and said to
        him,
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
        “Amen, amen, I say to you,<br />
        unless one is born again,<br />
        he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
      </p>

      <p>
        4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born again when he is already
        an old man? Is it possible for him to return to his mother’s womb and be
        born all over again?” 5 Jesus replied,
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
        “Amen, amen, I say to you,<br />
        unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit,<br />
        he cannot enter the kingdom of God.<br />
        6 What is born of flesh is itself flesh;<br />
        and what is born of Spirit is itself spirit.”

    <p>
      423 Above, the Evangelist showed Christ’s power in relation to changes
      affecting nature; here he shows it in relation to our reformation by
      grace, which is his principal subject. Reformation by grace comes about
      through spiritual generation and by the conferring of benefits on those
      regenerated. First, then, he treats of spiritual generation. Secondly, of
      the spiritual benefits divinely conferred on the regenerated, and this in
      chapter five.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the first he does two things. First, he treats of spiritual
      regeneration in relation to the Jews. Secondly, of the spreading of the
      fruits of this regeneration even to foreign peoples, and this in chapter
      four. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he explains
      spiritual regeneration with words. Secondly, he completes it with deeds
      (3:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the first he does three things. First, he shows the need for a
      spiritual regeneration. Secondly, its quality (3:4). Thirdly, its mode and
      nature (3:9). As to the first he does two things. First, he mentions the
      occasion for showing this need. Secondly, the need itself for this
      regeneration (3:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was presented by Nicodemus; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >There was a certain Pharisee named Nicodemus.</span
      >
      And he describes him as to his person, from the time, and from his
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      424 he describes his person in three ways. First, as to his religion,
      because he was a Pharisee, hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">There was a certain Pharisee.</span> For
      there were two sects aniong the Jews: the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The
      Pharisees were closer to us in their beliefs, for they believed in the
      resurrection, and admitted the existence of spiritual creatures. The
      Sadducees, on the other hand, disagree more with us, for they believed
      neither in the resurrection to come nor in the existence of spirits. The
      former were called Pharisees, as being separated from the others. And
      because their opinion was the more credible and nearer to the truth, it
      was easier for Nicodemus to be converted to Christ. “I lived as a
      Pharisee, according to the strictest sect of our religion” (Acts 26:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      425 As to his name he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">named Nicodemus,</span> which means
      “victor,” or “the victory of the people.” This signifies those who
      overcame the world through faith by being converted to Christ from
      Judaism. “This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith” (1 Jn
      5:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      426 Thirdly, as to his rank he says, a
      <span style="font-weight: bold">member of the Sanhedrin.</span> For
      although our Lord did not choose the wise or powerful or those of high
      birth at the beginning, lest the power of the faith be attributed to human
      widsom and power—“Not many of you are learned in the worldly sense, not
      many powerful, not many of high birth. But God chose the simple ones of
      the world” (1 Cor 1:26)—still he willed to convert some of the wise and
      powerful to himself at the very beginning. And he did this so that his
      doctrine would not be held in contempt, as being accepted exclusively by
      the lowly and uneducated, and so that the number of believers would not be
      attributed to the rusticity and ignorance of the converts rather than to
      the power of the faith. However, he did not will that a large number of
      those converted to him be powerful and of high birth, lest, as has been
      said, it should be ascribed to human power and wisdom. And so it says,
      “many of those in authority believed in him” (below 12:42), among whom was
      this Nicodemus. “The rulers of the people have come together” (Ps 46:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      427 Then he describes him as to the time, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he came to Jesus at night.</span> In
      regard to this, it might be noted that in Scripture the quality of the
      time is mentioned as to certain persons in order to indicate their
      knowledge or the condition of their actions. Here an obscure time is
      mentioned, <span style="font-weight: bold">at night.</span> For the night
      is obscure and suited to the state of mind of Nicodemus, who did not come
      to Jesus free of care and anxiety, but in fear; for he was one of those of
      whom it is said that they “believed in him; but they did not admit it
      because of the Pharisees, so that they would not be expelled from the
      synagogue” (below 12:42). For their love was not perfect, so it continues,
      “For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of’ God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, night was appropriate to his ignorance and the imperfect
      understanding he had of Christ: “The night has passed, and day is at hand.
      So let us cast-off the works of darkness” (Rom 13:12); “They have not
      known or understood; they are walking in darkness” (Ps 81:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      428 Then he is described from his statements, when he says that Nicodemus
      said to Jesus:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God.</span
      >
      Here he affirms Christ’s office as teacher when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Rabbi,</span> and his power of acting,
      saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for no one could perform the signs you perform, unles he had God with
        him.</span
      >
      And in both remarks he says what is true, but he does not affirm enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is right is calling Jesus
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Rabbi,</span> i.e., Teacher, because, “You
      call me Teacher and Lord; and you do well, for so I am,” as we read below
      (13:13). For Nicodemus had read what was written in Joel (2:23): “Children
      of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God, because he has given
      you a teacher of justice.” But he says too little, because he says that
      Jesus came as a teacher from God, but is silent on whether he is God. For
      to come as a teacher from God is common to all good prelates: “I will give
      you shepherds after my own heart, and they will feed you with knowledge
      and doctrine,” as it says in Jeremiah (3:15). Therefore, this is not
      unique to Christ even though Christ taught in a manner unlike other men.
      For some teachers teach only from without, but Christ also instructs
      within, because “He was the true light, which enlightens every man” (above
      1:9); thus he alone gives wisdom: “I will give you an eloquence and a
      wisdom” (Lk 21:15), and this is something that no mere man can say.
    </p>
    <p>
      429 He affirms his power because of the signs he saw. As if to say: I
      believe that you have come as a teacher from God,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for no one could perform the signs you perform.</span
      >
      And he is speaking the truth, because the signs which Christ did cannot be
      worked except by God, and because God was with him: “He who sent me is
      with me” (below 8:29). But he says too little, because he believed that
      Christ did not perform these signs through his own power, but as relying
      on the power of another; as though God were not with him by a unity of
      essence but merely by an infusion of grace. But this is false, because
      Christ performed these signs not by an exterior power but by his own; for
      the power of God and of Christ is one and the same. It is similar to what
      the woman says to Elijah: “Because of this I know that you are a man of
      God” (1 Kgs 17:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      430 Then when he says that Jesus answered,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Amen, amen, I say to you</span>, he sets
      down the necessity for spiritual regeneration, because of the ignorance of
      Nicodemus. And so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Amen, amen</span>. Here we should note
      that this word, <span style="font-weight: bold">amen</span>, is a Hebrew
      word frequently employed by Christ; hence out of reverence for him no
      Greek or Latin translator wanted to translate it. Sometimes it means the
      same as “true” or “truly”; and sometimes the same as “so be it.” Thus is
      the Psalms 71 (v 19), 88 (v 53), and 106, where we have, “So be it, so be
      it,” the Hebrew has “Amen, amen.” But John is the only Evangelist who
      duplicates or makes a twin use of this word. The reason for this is that
      the other Evangelists are concerned mainly with matters pertaining to the
      humanity of Christ, which, since they are easier to believe, need less
      reinforcement; but John deals chiefly with things pertaining to the
      divinity of Christ, and these, since they are hidden and remote from men’s
      knowledge and experience, require greater formal declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      431 Next we should point out that at first glance this answer of Christ
      seems to be entirely foreign to Nicodemus’ statement. For what connection
      is there between Nicodemus’ statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God,</span
      >
      and the Lord’s reply,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      But we should note, as has already been stated, that Nicodemus, having an
      imperfect opinion about Christ, affirmed that he was a teacher and
      performed these signs as a mere man. And so the Lord wishes to show
      Nicodemus how he might arrive at a deeper understanding of him. And as a
      matter of fact, the Lord might have done so with an argument, but because
      this might have resulted in a quarrel—the opposite of which was prophesied
      about him: “He will not quarrel” (Is 42:2)—he wished to lead him to a true
      understanding with gentleness. As if to say: It is not strange that you
      regard me as a mere man, because one cannot know these secrets of the
      divinity unless he has achieved a spiritual regeneration. And this is what
      he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      432 Here we should point out that since vision is an act of life, then
      according to the diverse kinds of life there will be diversity of vision.
      For there is a sentient life which some living things share in common, and
      this life has a sentient vision or knowledge. And there is also a
      spiritual life, by which man is made like God and other holy spirits; and
      this life enjoys a spiritual vision. Now spiritual things cannot be seen
      by the sentient: “The sensual man does not perceive those things that
      pertain to the Spirit of God” (1 Cor 2:14), but they are perceived by the
      spiritual vision: “No one knows the things of God but the Spirit of God”
      (1 Cor 2:11). So the apostle says: “You did not receive the spirit of
      slavery, putting you in fear again, but the spirit of adoption” (Rom
      8:15). And we receive this spirit through a spiritual regenaration: “He
      saved us by the cleansing of regeneration in the Holy Spirit” (Ti 3:3).
      Therefore, if spiritual vision comes only through the Holy Spirit, and if
      the Holy Spirit is given through a cleansing of spiritual regeneration,
      then it is only by a cleansing of regeneration that we can see the kingdom
      of God. Thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter
        the kingdom of God.</span
      >
      As if to say: It is not surprising if you do not see the kingdom of God,
      because no one can see it unless he receives the Holy Spirit, through whom
      one is reborn a son of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      433 It is not only the royal throne that pertains to a kingdom, but also
      the things needed for governing the kingdom, such as the royal dignity,
      royal favors, and the way of justice by which the kingdom is consolidated.
      Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he cannot see the kingdom of God,</span>
      i.e., the glory and dignity of God, i.e., the mysteries of eternal
      salvation which are seen through the justice of faith: “The kingdom of God
      is not food and drink” (Rom 14:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the Old Law there was a spiritual regeneration; but it was
      imperfect and symbolic: “All were baptized into Moses, in the cloud and in
      the sea” (1 Cor 10:2), i.e., they received baptism in symbol. Accordingly,
      they did see the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but only symbolically:
      “seeing from afar” (Heb 11:13). But in the New Law there is an evident
      spiritual regeneration, although imperfect, because we are renewed only
      inwardly by grace, but not outwardly by incorruption: “Although our
      outward nature is wasting away, yet our inward nature is being renewed day
      by day” (2 Cor 4:16). And so we do see the kingdom of God and the
      mysteries of eternal salvation, but imperfectly, for as it says, “Now we
      see in a mirror, in an obscure manner” (1 Cor 13:12). But there is perfect
      regeneration in heaven, because we will be renewed both inwardly and
      outwardly. And therefore we shall see the kingdom of God in a most perfect
      way: “But then we will see face to face,” as is said in 1 Corinthians
      (13:12); and “When he appears we will be like him, because we will see him
      as he is” (1 Jn 3:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      434 It is clear, therefore, that just as one does not have bodily vision
      unless he is born, so one cannot have spiritual vision unless he is
      reborn. And according to the threefold regeneration, there is a threefold
      kind of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      435 Note that the Greek reading is not “again,” but <i>anothe,</i> i.e.,
      “from above,” which Jerome translated as “again,” in order to suggest
      addition. And this is the way Jerome understood the saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">unless one is born again.</span> It is as
      if he were saying: Unless one is reborn once more through a fraternal
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysostoin, however, says that to be “born from above” is peculiar to the
      Son of God, because he alone is born from above: “The one who came from
      above is above all things” (below 3:31). And Christ is said to be born
      from above both as to time (if we may speak thus), because he was begotten
      from eternity: “Before the daystar I begot you” (Ps 109:3), and as to the
      principle of his generation, because he proceeds from the heavenly Father:
      “I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him who
      sent me” (below 6:38). Therefore, because our regeneration is in the
      likeness of the Son of God, inasmuch as “Those whom he foreknew he
      predestined to become conformed to the image of his Son” (Rom 8:29), and
      because that generation is from above, our generation also is from above:
      both as to the time, because of our eternal predestination, “He chose us
      in him before the foundation of the world” (Eph 1:4), and as to its being
      a gift of God, as we read below (6:44), “No one can come to me unless the
      Father, who sent me, draws him”; and “You have been saved by the grace of
      God” (Eph 2:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      436 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Nicodemus said to him,</span> he gives the
      manner of and the reason for this spiritual regeneration. First, the doubt
      of Nicodemus is set forth. Secondly, Christ’s response (v 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      437 As to the first we should note that as stated in 1 Corinthians (2:14):
      “The sensual man does not perceive those things that pertain to the Spirit
      of God.” And so because Nicodemus was yet carnal and sensual, he was
      unable to grasp, except in a carnal manner, the things that were said to
      him. Consequently, what the Lord said,to him about spiritual regeneration,
      he understood of carnal generation. And this is what he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >How can a man be born again when he is already an old man?</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We should note here, according to Chrysostom, that Nicodemus wanted to
      object to what was said by the Savior. But his objection is foolish,
      because Christ was speaking of spiritual regeneration, and he is objecting
      in terms of carnal regeneration. In like manner, all the reasons brought
      forth to attack the things of faith are foolish, since they are not
      according to the meaning of Sacred Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      438 Nicodemus objected to the Lord’s statement that a man must be born
      again according to the two ways in which this seemed impossible. In one
      way, on account of the irreversibility of human life; for a man cannot
      return to infancy from old age. Hence we read, “I am walking on a path,”
      namely, this present life, “by which I will not return” (Jb 16:23). And it
      is from this point of view that he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >How can a man be born again when he is already an old man?</span
      >
      As if to say: Shall he become a child once more so that he can be reborn?
      “He will not return again to his home, and his place will not know him any
      more” (Jb 7:10). In the second way, regeneration seemed impossible because
      of the mode of carnal generation. Forin the beginning, when a man is
      generated, he is small in size, so that his mother’s womb can contain him;
      but later, after he is born, he continues to grow and reaches such a size
      that he cannot be contained within his mother’s womb. And so Nicodemus
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Is it possible for him to return to his mother’s womb and be born all
        over again?</span
      >
      As if to say: He cannot, because the womb cannot contain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      439 But this does not apply to spiritual generation. For no matter how
      spiritually old a man might become through sin, accordto the Psalm (31:3):
      “Because I kept silent, all my bones grew old,” he can, with the help of
      divine grace, become new, according to the Psalm (102:5): “Your youth will
      be renewed like the eagle’s.” And no matter how enormous he is, he can
      enter the spiritual womb of the Church by the sacrament of baptism. And it
      is clear what that spiritual womb is; otherwise it would never have been
      said: “From the womb, before the daystar, I begot you” (Ps 109:3). Yet
      there is a sense in which his objection applies. For just as a man, once
      he is born according to nature, cannot be reborn, so once he is born in a
      spiritual way through baptism, he cannot be reborn, because he cannot be
      baptized again: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism,” as we read in
      Ephesians (4:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      440 Then we have the answer of Christ. Concerning this he does three
      things. First, he answers the arguments of Nicodemus by showing the nature
      of regeneration. Secondly, he explains this answer with a reason (v 6).
      Thirdly, he explains it with an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      441 He answers the objections by showing that he is speaking of a
      spiritual regeneration, not a carnal one. And this is what he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter
        the kingdom of God.</span
      >
      As if to say: You are thinking of a carnal generation, but I am speaking
      of a spiritual generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that above he had said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he cannot see the kingdom of God,</span>
      while here he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he cannot enter the kingdom of God,</span>
      which is the same thing. For no one can see the things of the kingdom of
      God unless he enters it; and to the extent that he enters, he sees. “I
      will give him a white stone upon which is written a new name, which no one
      knows but he who receives it” (Rv 5:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      442 Now there is a reason why spiritual generation comes from the Spirit.
      It is necessary that the one generated be generated in the likeness of the
      one generating; but we are regenerated as sons of God, in the likeness of
      his true Son. Therefore, it is necessary that our spiritual regeneration
      come about through that by which we are made like the true Son. and this
      conies about by Our having his Spirit: “If any one does not have the
      Spirit of Christ, he is not his” (Rom 8:9); “By this we know that we abide
      in him, and he in us: because he has given us of his Spirit” (1 Jn 4:13).
      Thus spiritual regeneration must come from the Holy Spirit. “You did not
      receive the spirit of slavery, putting you in fear again, but the spirit
      of adoption” (Rom 8:15); “It is the Spirit that gives life” (below 6:63).
    </p>
    <p>
      443 Water, too, is necessary for this regeneration, and for three reasons.
      First, because of the condition of human nature. For man consists of soul
      and body, and if the Spirit alone were involved in his regeneration, this
      would indicate that only the spiritual part of man is regenerated. Hence
      in order that the flesh also be regenerated, it is necessary that, in
      addition to the Spirit through whom the soul is regenerated, something
      bodily be involved, through which the body is regenerated; and this,is
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, water is necessary for the sake of human knowledge. For, as
      Dionysius says, divine wisdom so disposes all things that it provides for
      each thing according to its nature. Now it is natural for man to know; and
      so it is fitting that spiritual things be conferred on men in such a way
      that he may know them: “so that we may know what God has given us” (1 Cor
      2:12). But the natural manner of this knowledge is that man know spiritual
      things by means of sensible things, since all our knowledge begins in
      sense knowledge. Therefore, in order that we might understand what is
      spiritual in our regeneration, it was fitting that there be in it
      something sensible and material, that is, water, through which we
      understand that just as water washes and cleanses the exterior in a bodily
      way, so through baptism a man is washed and cleansed inwardly in a
      spiritual way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, water was necessary so that there might be a correspondence of
      causes. For the cause of our regeneration is the incarnate Word: “He gave
      them power to become the sons of God,” as we saw above (1:12). Therefore
      it was fitting that in the sacraments, which have their efficacy from the
      power of the incarnate Word, there be something corresponding to the Word,
      and something corresponding to the flesh, or body. And spiritually
      speaking, this is water when the sacrament is baptism, so that through it
      we may be conformed to the death of Christ, since we are submerged in it
      during baptism as Christ was in the womb of the earth for three days: “We
      are buried with him by baptism” (Rom 6:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, this mystery was suggested in the first production of things,
      when the Spirit of God hovered over the waters (Gn 1:2). But a greater
      power was conferred on water by contact with the most pure flesh of
      Christ; because in the beginning water brought forth crawling creatures
      with living souls, but since Christ was baptized in the Jordan, water has
      yielded spiritual souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      444 It is clear that the Holy Spirit is God, since he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit</span
      >
      (<i>ex aqua et Spiritu Sancto</i>). For above (1:13) he says: “who are
      born not from blood, nor from the desires of the flesh, nor from man’s
      willing it, but from God (<i>ex Deo</i>).” From this we can form the
      following argument: He from whom men are spiritually reborn is God; but
      men are spiritually reborn through the Holy Spirit, as it is stated here;
      therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.
    </p>
    <p>
      445 Two questions arise here. First, if no one enters the kingdom of God
      unless he is born again of water, and if the fathers of old were not born
      again of water (for they were not baptized), then they have not entered
      the kingdom of God. Secondly, since baptism is of three kinds, that is, of
      water, of desire, and of blood, and many have been baptized in the latter
      two ways (who we say have entered the kingdom of God immediately, even
      though they were not born again of water), it does not seem to be true to
      say that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter
        the kingdom of God.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to the first is that rebirth or regeneration from water and the
      Holy Spirit takes place in two ways: in truth and in symbol. Now the
      fathers of old, although they were not reborn with a true rebirth, were
      nevertheless reborn with a symbolic rebirth, because they always had a
      sense perceptible sign in which true rebirth was prefigured. So according
      to this, thus reborn, they did enter the kingdom of God, after the ransom
      was paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to the second is that those who are reborn by a baptism of
      blood and fire, although they do not have regeneration in deed, they do
      have it in desire. Otherwise neither would the baptism of blood mean
      anything nor could there be a baptism of the Spirit. Consequently, in
      order that man may enter the kingdom of heaven, it is necessary that there
      be a baptism of water in deed, as in the case of all baptized persons, or
      in desire, as in the case of the martyrs and catechumens, who are
      prevented by death from fulfilling their desire, or in symbol, as in the
      case of the fathers of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      446 It might be remarked that it was from this statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit,</span
      >
      that the Pelagians derived their error that children are baptized not in
      order to be cleansed from sin, since they have none, but in order to be
      able to enter the kingdom of God. But this is false, because as Augustine
      says in his book, <i>The Baptism of Children,</i> it is not fitting for an
      image of God, namely, man, to be excluded from the kingdom of God except
      for some obstacle, which can be nothing but sin. Therefore, there must be
      some sin, namely, original sin, in children who are excluded from the
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      447 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >What is born of flesh is itself flesh,</span
      >
      he proves by reason that it is necessary to be born of water and the Holy
      Spirit. And the reasoning is this: No one can reach the kingdom unless he
      is made spiritual; but no one is made spiritual except by the Holy Spirit;
      therefore, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born again of
      the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he says, what is born of flesh (<i>ex carne</i>) is itself flesh, i.e.,
      birth according to the flesh makes one be born into the life of the flesh:
      “The first man was from the earth, earthly” (1 Cor 15:47);
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and what is born of Spirit</span> (<i
        >ex Spiritu</i
      >), i.e., from the power of the Holy Spirit,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is itself spirit,</span> i.e., spiritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      448 Note, however, that this preposition <i>ex</i> (from, of, by)
      sometines designates a material cause, as when I say: “A knife is made of
      (<i>ex</i>) iron”; sometimes it designates an efficient cause, as when I
      say: “The house was built by (<i>ex</i>) a carpenter.” Accordingly, the
      phrase, <span style="font-weight: bold">what is born of</span> (<i>ex</i>)
      flesh is itself flesh, can be understood according to either efficient or
      material causality. As efficient cause, indeed, because a power existing
      in flesh is productive of generation; and as material cause, because some
      camal element in animals makes up the animal generated. But nothing is
      said to be made out of spirit (<i>ex spiritu</i>) in a material sense,
      since spirit is unchangeable, whereas matter is the subject of change; but
      it is said in the sense of efficient causality.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this, we can discern a threefold generation. One is
      materially and effectively from (<i>ex</i>) the flesh, and is common to
      all who exist according to the flesh. Another is according to the Spirit
      effectively, and according to it we are reborn as sons of God through the
      grace of the Holy Spirit, and are made spiritual. The third is midway,
      that is, only materially from the flesh but effectively from the Holy
      Spirit. And this is true in the singular case of Christ: because he was
      born deriving his flesh materially from the flesh of his mother, but
      effectively from the Holy Spirit: “What she has conceived is of the Holy
      Spirit” (Mt 1:20). Therefore, he was born holy: “The Holy Spirit will come
      upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. And so the
      Holy One who will be born from you, will be called the Son of God” (Lk
      1:35).

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      449 Above, in his instruction on spiritual generation, the Lord presented
      a reason; here he gives an example. For we are led to see that Nicodemus
      was troubled when he heard that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >what is born of Spirit is itself spirit.</span
      >
      And so the Lord says to him,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Do not be surprised that I said to you, you must be born again.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we should note that there are two kinds of surprise or astonishment.
      One is the astonishment of devotion in the sense that someone, considering
      the great things of God, sees that they are incomprehensible to him; and
      so he is full of astonishment: “The Lord on high is wonderful” (Ps 92:4),
      “Your testimonies are wonderful” (Ps 118:129). Men are to be encouraged,
      not discouraged, to this kind of astonishment The other is the
      astonishment of disbelief, when someone does not believe what is said. So
      Matthew (13:54) says: “They were astonished,” and further on adds that
      “They did not accept him.” It is from this kind of astonishment that the
      Lord diverts Nicodeintis wheii he proposes an example and says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The wind</span> (<i>spiritus</i>, wind,
      spirit) <span style="font-weight: bold">blows where it wills.</span> In
      the literal sense, the same words can he explained in two ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      450 In the first way, according to Chrysostom, spiritus is taken for the
      wind, as in Psalm 148 (v 8): “The winds of the storm that fulfill his
      word.” According to this interpretation, he says four things about the
      wind. First, the power of the wind, when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the wind blows where it wills.</span> And
      if you say that the wind has no will, one may answer that “will” is taken
      for a natural appetite, which is nothing more than a natural inclination,
      about which it is said: “He created the weight of the wind” (Jb 28:25).
      Secondly, he tells the evidence for the wind, when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and you hear its sound,</span> where
      “sound” (<i>vox</i>, voice, sound) refers to the sound the wind makes when
      it strikes a body. Of this we read: “The sound (<i>vox</i>) of your
      thunder was in the whirlwind” (Ps 76:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he mentions the origin of the wind, which is unknown; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but you do not know where it comes from,</span
      >
      i.e., from where it starts: “He brings forth the winds out of his
      storehouse” (Ps 134:7). Fourthly, he mentions the wind’s destination,
      which is also unknown; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">or where it goes</span> you do not know,
      i.e., where it remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he applies this similarity to the subject under discussion, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</span
      >
      As if to say: If the wind, which is corporeal, has an origin which is
      hidden and a course that is unknown, why are you surprised if you cannot
      understand the course of spiritual regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      451 Augustine objects to this explanation and says that the Lord was not
      speaking here about the wind, for we know where each of the winds comes
      from and where it goes. For “Auster” comes from the south and goes to the
      north; “Boreas” comes from the north and goes to the south. Why, then,
      does the Lord say of this wind, you do not know where it comes from or
      where it goes?
    </p>
    <p>
      One may answer that there are two ways in which the source of the wind
      might be unknown. In one way, in general: and in this way it is possible
      to know where it comes from, i.e., from which direction of the world, for
      example, that Auster comes from the south, and where it goes, that is, to
      the north. In another way, in particular: and in this sense it is not
      known where the wind comes from, i.e., at which precise place it
      originated, or where it goes, i.e., exactly where it stops. And almost all
      the Greek doctors agree with this exposition of Chrysostom.
    </p>
    <p>
      452 In another way, <i>spiritus</i> is taken for the Holy Spirit. And
      according to this, he mentions four things about the Holy Spirit. First,
      his power, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Spirit blows where it wills,</span>
      because it is by the free use of his power that he breathes where he wills
      and when he wills, by instructing hearts: “One and the same Spirit does
      all these things, distributing to each as he wills” (1 Cor 12:11). This
      refutes the error of Macedonius who thought that the Holy Spirit was the
      minister of the Father and the Son. But then he would not be breathing
      where he willed, but where he was commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      453 Secondly, he mentions the evidence for the Holy Spirit, when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and you hear its voice:</span> “Today, if
      you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts” (Ps 94:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysostom objects to this and says that this cannot pertain to the Holy
      Spirit. For the Lord was speaking to Nicodemus, who was still an
      unbeliever, and thus not fit to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. We may
      answer to this, with Augustine, that there is a twofold voice of the Holy
      Spirit. One is that by which he speaks inwardly in man’s heart; and only
      believers and the saints hear this voice, about which the Psalm (84:9)
      says: “I will hear what the Lord God says within me.” The other voice is
      that by which the Holy Spirit speaks in the Scriptures or through those
      who preach, according to Matthew (10:20): “For it is not you who speak,
      but the Holy Splirit who is speaking through you.” And this voice is heard
      by unbelievers and sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      454 Thirdly, he refers to the origin of the Holy Spirit, which is hidden;
      thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but you do not know where it comes from,</span
      >
      although you may hear its voice. And this is because the Holy Spirit comes
      from the Father and the Son: “When the Paraclete comes, whom I will send
      you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father”
      (below 15:26). But the Father and the Son “dwell in inaccessible light,
      whom no man has seen or is able to see” (1 Tim 6:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      455 Fourthly, he gives the destination of the Holy Spirit, which is also
      hidden; and so he says, you do not know where it goes, because the Spirit
      leads one to a hidden end, that is, eternal happiness. Thus it says in
      Ephesians (1:14) that the Holy Spirit is “the pledge of our inheritance.”
      And again, “The eye has not seen, nor has the ear heard, nor has the heart
      of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Cor
      2:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you do not know where it comes from,</span
      >
      i.e., how the Spirit enters into a person,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">or where it goes,</span> i.e., to what
      perfection he may lead him: “If he comes toward me, I will not see him”
      (Jb 9:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      456
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit,</span
      >
      i.e., they are like the Holy Spirit. And no wonder: for as he had said
      before, “What is born of Spirit is itself spirit,” because the qualities
      of the Holy Spirit are present in the spiritual man, just as the qualities
      of fire are present in burning coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the above four qualities of the Holy Spirit are found in one
      who has been born of the Holy Spirit. First of all, he has freedom: “Where
      the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor 3:17), for the Holy
      Spirit leads us to what is right: “Your good Spirit will lead me to the
      right path” (Ps 142:10); and he frees us from the slavery of sin and of
      the law: “The law of the Spirit, of life in Christ, has set me free” (Rom
      8:2). Secondly, we get an indication of him through the sound of his
      words; and when we hear them we know his spirituality, for it is out of
      the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he has an origin and an end that are hidden, because no one can
      judge one who is spiritual: “The spiritual man judges all things, and he
      himself is judged by no one” (1 Cor 2:15). Or, we do not know where such a
      person comes from, i.e., the source of his spiritual birth, which is
      baptismal grace; or where he goes, i.e., of what he is made worthy, that
      is, of eternal life, which remains concealed from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      457 Then the cause and reason for spiritual regeneration are set forth.
      First, a question is asked by Nicodemus; secondly, the Lord’s answer is
      given (v 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      458 It is apparent from the first that Nicodemus, as yet dull, and
      remaining a Jew on the level of sense, was unable to understand the
      mysteries of Christ in spite of the examples and explanations that were
      given. And so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">How can all this happen?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two reasons why one may question about something. Some question
      because of disbelief, as did Zechariah, saying: “How will I know this? For
      I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in age” (Lk 1:18); “He confounds
      those who search into mysteries” (Is 40:23). Others, on the other hand,
      question because of a desire to know, as the Blessed Virgin did when she
      said to the angel: “How shall this be, since I do not know man?” (Lk
      1:34). It is the latter who are instructed. And so, because Nicodemus
      asked from a desire to learn, he deserved to be instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      459 And this is what follows:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesus replied.</span> First the Lord
      chides him for his slowness. Secondly, he answers his question (v 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      460 He chides him for his slowness, basing himself on three things. First,
      the condition of the person to whom he is speaking, when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">You are a teacher in Israel.</span> And
      here the Lord did not chide him to insult him. Rather, because Nicodemus,
      presuming on his own knowledge, was still relying on his status as a
      teacher, the Lord wished to make him a temple of the Holy Spirit by
      humbling him: “For whom will I have regard? For he who is humble and of
      contrite spirit” (Is 66:2). And he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">You are a teacher,</span> because it is
      tolerable if a simple person cannot grasp profound truths, but in a
      teacher, it deserves rebuke. And so he says, You are a teacher, i.e., of
      the letter that kills (2 Cor 3:6),
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and you do not know these things?</span>
      i.e., spiritual things. “For although you ought to be teachers by now, you
      yourselves need to be taught again” (Heb 5:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      461 You might say that the Lord would have rebuked Nicodemus justly if he
      had spoken to him about matters of the Old Law and he did not understand
      them; but he spoke to him about the New Law. I answer that the things
      which the Lord says of spiritual generation are contained in the Old Law,
      although under a figure, as is said in 1 Corinthians (10:2): “All were
      baptized into Moses, in the cloud and in the sea.” And the prophets also
      said this: “I will pour clean water upon you, and you will be cleansed
      from all your uncleanness” (Ez 36:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      462 Secondly, he rebukes him for his slowness on account of the character
      of the person who is speaking. For it is tolerable if one does not
      acquiesce to the statements of an ignorant person; but it is reprehensible
      to reject the statements of a man who is wise and who possesses great
      authority. And so he says, Amen, amen I say to you, that we
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >know of what we speak, and we bear witness of what we see.</span
      >
      For a qualified witness must base his testimony on hearing or sight: “What
      we have seen and heard” (1 Jn 1:3). And so the Lord mentions both:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >we know of what we speak, and we bear witness of what</span
      >
      we see. Indeed, the Lord as man knows all things: “Lord, you know all
      things” (below 21:17); “The Lord, whose knowledge is holy, knows clearly”
      (2 Mc 6:30). Further, he sees all things by his divine knowledge: “I speak
      of what I have seen with my Father,” as we read below (8:38).
    </p>
    <p>
      He speaks in the plural, we know, we see, in order to suggest the mystery
      of the Trinity: “The Father, who dwells in me, he does the works” (below
      14:10). Or, we know, i.e., I, and others who have been made spiritual,
      because “No one knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son
      wishes to reveal him” (Mt 11:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But you do not accept our testimony,</span
      >
      so approved, so solid. “And his testimony no one accepts (below 3:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      463 Thirdly, he rebukes him for his slowness because of the quality of the
      things under discussion. For it is not unusual when someone does not grasp
      difficult matters, but it is inexcusable not to grasp easy things. So he
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If I spoke of earthly things, and you did not believe, how will you
        believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</span
      >
      As if to say: If you do not grasp these easy things, how will you be able
      to understand the progress of the Holy Spirit? “What is on earth we find
      difficult, and who will search Out the things in heaven,” as is said in
      Wisdom (9:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      464 But one might object that the above does not show that the Lord spoke
      of earthly things to Nicodemus. I answer, according to Chrysostom, that
      the Lord’s statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">If I spoke of earthly things,</span>
      refers to the example of the wind. For the wind, being something which is
      generable and corruptible, is regarded as an earthly thing. Or one might
      say, again according to Chrysostom, that the spiritual generation which is
      given in baptism is heavenly as to its source, which sanctifies and
      regenerates; but it is earthly as to its subject, for the one regenerated,
      man, is of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or one might answer, according to Augustine, that we must understand this
      in reference to what Christ said earlier: “Destroy this temple,” which is
      earthly, because he said this about the temple of his body, which he had
      taken from the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If I spoke of earthly things, and you did not believe, how will you
        believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</span
      >
      As if to say: If you do not believe in a spiritual generation occurring in
      time, how will you believe in the eternal generation of the Son? Or, if
      you do not believe what I tell you about the power of my body, how will
      you believe what I tell you about the power of my divinity and about the
      power of the Holy Spirit?
    </p>
    <p>
      465 <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesus replied.</span> Here he answers
      the question. First, he lays down the causes of spiritual regeneration.
      Secondly, he explains what he says (3:16). Now there are two causes of
      spiritual regeneration, namely, the mystery of the incarnation of Christ,
      and his passion. So first, he treats of the incarnation; secondly, of the
      passion (3:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      466 Here we should consider, first of all, how this answer of Christ is an
      adequa~,e reply to the question of Nicodemus. For above, when the Lord was
      speaking of the Spirit, he said:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you do not know where it comes from or where it</span
      >
      goes. We understand by this that spiritual regeneration has a hidden
      source and a hidden end. Now the things in heaven are hidden from us: “Who
      will search out the things in heaven?” (Wis 9:16). Therefore, the sense of
      Nicodemus’ question,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">How can all this happen?</span> is this:
      How can something come from the secret things of heaven or go to the
      secret things of heaven? So before answering, the Lord expressed this
      interpretation of the question, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >how will you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      And immediately he begins to show whose prerogative it is to ascend into
      heaven, namely, anyone who came down from heaven, according to the
      statement of Ephesians (4:10): “He who descended is he who ascended.” This
      is verified even in natural things, namely, that each body tends to a
      place according to its origin or nature. And so in this way it can come
      about that someone, through the Spirit, may go to a place which carnal
      persons do not know, i.e., by ascending into heaven, if this is done
      through the power of one who descended from heaven: because he descended
      in order that, in ascending, he might open a way for us: “He ascends,
      opening the way before them” (Mi 2:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      467 Some have fallen into error because of his saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the One who came down from heaven, the Son of Man.</span
      >
      For since Son of Man designates human nature, which is composed of soul
      and body, then because he says that the Son descended from heaven,
      Valentinus wanted to maintain that he even took his body from heaven and
      thus passed through the Virgin without receiving anything from her, as
      water passes through a pipe; so that his body was neither of an earthly
      substance nor taken from the Virgin. But this is contrary to the statement
      of the Apostle, writing to the Romans (1:3): “who was made from the seed
      of David according to the flesh.”
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Origen said that he descended from heaven as to his
      soul, which, he says, had been created along with the angels from the very
      beginning, and that later this soul descended from heaven and took flesh
      from the Virgin. But this also conflicts with the Catholic faith, which
      teaches that souls do not exist before their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      468 Therefore, we should not understand that the Son of Man descended from
      heaven according to his human nature, but only according to his divine
      nature. For since in Christ there is one <i>suppositum</i>, or hypostasis,
      or person of the two natures, the divine and human natures, then no matter
      from which of these two natures this <i>suppositum</i> is named, divine
      and human things can be attributed to him. For we can say that the Son of
      Man created the stars and that the Son of God was crucified. But the Son
      of God was crucified, not according to his divine nature, but according to
      his human nature; and the Son of Man created the stars according to his
      divine nature. And so in things that are said of Christ, the distinction
      is not to be taken with respect to that about which they are said, because
      divine and human things are said of God and man indifferently; but a
      distinction must be made with respect to that according to which they are
      said, because divine things are said of Christ according to his divine
      nature, but human things according to his human nature. Thus, to descend
      from heaven is said of the Son of Man, not according to his human nature,
      but according to his divine nature, according to which it was appropriate
      to him to have been from heaven before the incarnation, as is said,
      “Heaven belongs to the Lord” (Ps 113:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      469 he is said to have come down, but not by local motion, becatise then
      he Would not have remained in heaven; for nothing which moves locally
      remains in the place from which it comes down. And so to exclude local
      motion, he adds,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">who lives in heaven.</span> As if to say:
      He descended from heaven in such a way as yet to be in heaven. For he came
      down from heaven without ceasing to be above, yet assuming a nature which
      is from below. And because he is not enclosed or held fast by his body
      which exists on earth, he was, according to his divinity, in heaven and
      everywhere. And therefore to indicate that he is said to have come down in
      this way, because he assumed a [human] nature, he said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the Son of Man</span> came down, i.e.,
      insofar as he became Son of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      470 Or it can be said, as Hilary does, that he came down from heaven as to
      his body: not that the material of Christ’s body came down from heaven,
      but that the power which formed it was from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      471 But why does he say,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >No one has gone up to heaven except the Son of Man, who lives in
        heaven?</span
      >
      For have not Paul and Peter and the other saints gone up, according to 2
      Corinthians (5:1): “We have a house in the heavens.” I answer that no one
      goes up into heaven except Christ and his members, i.e., those believers
      who are just. Accordingly, the Son of God came down from heaven in order
      that, by making us his members, he might prepare us to ascend into heaven:
      now, indeed, in hope, but later in reality. “He has raised us up, and has
      given us a place in heaven in Christ Jesus” (Eph 2:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      472 Here he mentions the mystery of the passion, in virtue of which
      baptism has its efficacy: “We who have been baptized into Christ Jesus,
      have been baptized into his death” (Rom 6:3). And with regard to this he
      does three things. First, he gives a symbol for the passion. Secondly, the
      manner of the passion. Thirdly, the fruit of the passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      473 He takes the symbol from the old law, in order to adapt to the
      understanding of Nicodemus; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert.</span
      >
      This refers to Numbers (21:5) when the Lord, faced with the Jewish people
      saying, “We are sick of this useless food,” sent serpents to punish them;
      and when the people came to Moses and he interceded with the Lord, the
      Lord commanded that for a remedy they make a serpent of bronze; and this
      was to serve both as a remedy against those serpents and as a symbol of
      the Lord’s passion. Hence it says that this bronze serpent was lifted up
      as a sign (Nm 21:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is characteristic of serpents that they are poisonous, but not so
      the serpent of bronze, although it was a symbol of a poisonous serpent.
      So, too, Christ did not have sin, which is also a poison: “Sin, when it is
      fully developed, brings forth death” (Jas 1:15); but he had the likeness
      of sin: “God sent his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh” (Rom 8:3).
      And thus Christ had the effect of the serpent against the insurgence of
      inflamed concupiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      474 He shows the manner of the passion when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >so must the Son of Man be lifted up:</span
      >
      and this refers to the lifting up of the cross. So below (12:34) when it
      says, “The Son of Man must be lifted up,” it also has, “He said this to
      indicate the manner of his death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He willed to die lifted up, first of all, to cleanse the heavens: for
      since he had cleansed the things on earth by the sanctity of his life, the
      things of the air were left to be cleansed by his death: “through him he
      should reconcile all things to himself, whether on earth or in the
      heavens, making peace through his blood” (Col 1:20). Secondly, to triumph
      over the demons who prepare for war in the air: “the prince of the power
      of the air” (Eph 2:2). Thirdly, he wished to die lifted up to draw our
      hearts to himself: “I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all to
      myself” (below 12:32). And fourthly, because in the death of the cross he
      was lifted up in the sense that there he triumphed over his enemies; so it
      is not called a death, but a lifting up: “He will drink from the stream on
      the way, therefore he will lift up his head” (Ps 109:7). Fifthly, he
      willed to die lifted up because the cross was the reason for his being
      lifted up, i.e., exalted: “He became obedient to the Father even to death,
      the death of the cross; on account of which God has exalted him” (Phil
      2:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      475 Now the fruit of Christ’s passion is eternal life; hence he says, so
      <span style="font-weight: bold">that everyone who believes in him,</span>
      performing good works,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >may not be lost, but have eternal life.</span
      >
      And this fruit corresponds to the fruit of the symbolic serpent. For
      whoever looked upon the serpent of bronze was freed from poison and his
      life was preserved. But he who looks upon the lifted up Son of Man, and
      believes in the crucified Christ, he is freed from poison and sin:
      “Whoever believes in me will never die” (below 11:26), and is preserved
      for eternal life. “These things are written that you may believe... and
      that believing you may have life in his name” (below 20:3 1).

    <p>
      476 Above, the Lord assigned as the cause of spiritual regeneration the
      coming down of the Son and the lifting up of the Son of Man; and he set
      forth its fruit, which is eternal life. But this fruit seemed unbelievable
      to men laboring under the necessity of dying. And so now the Lord explains
      this. First, he proves the greatness of the fruit from the greatness of
      God’s love. Secondly, he rejects a certain reply (v 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      477 Here we should note that the cause of all our good is the Lord and
      divine love. For to love is, properly speaking, to will good to someone.
      Therefore, since the will of God is the cause of things, good comes to us
      because God loves us. And God’s love is the cause of the good of nature:
      “You love everything which exists” (Wis 11:2 5). It is also the cause of
      the good which is grace: “I have loved you with an. everlasting love, and
      so I have drawn you” i.e., through grace (Jer 3 1:3). But it is because of
      his great love that he gives us the good of glory. So he shows us here,
      from four standpoints, that this love of God is the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, from the person of the one loving, because it is God who loves, and
      immeasurably. So he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">For God so loved:</span> “He has loved the
      people; all the holy ones are in his hand” (Dt 33:3). Secondly, from the
      condition of the one who is loved, because it is man, a bodily creature of
      the world, i.e., existing in sin: “God shows his love for us, because
      while we were still his enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of
      his Son” (Rom 5:8). Thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the world.</span> Thirdly, from the
      greatness of his gifts, for love is shown by a gift; as Gregory says: “The
      proof of love is given by action.” But God has given us the greatest of
      gifts, his Only Begotten Son, and so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">that he gave his Only Begotten Son.</span>
      “God did not spare his own Soil, but delivered him up for all of us” (Rom
      8:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says his Son, i.e., his natural Son, consubstantial, not an adopted
      son, i.e., not those sons of which the Psalmist says: “I said: You are
      gods” (Ps 81:6). This shows that the opinion of Arius is false: for if the
      Son of God were a creature, as he said, the immensity of God’s love
      through the taking on of infinite goodness, which no creature can receive,
      could not have been revealed in him. He further says
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Only Begotten,</span> to show that God
      does not have a love divided among many sons, but all of it is for that
      Son whom he gave to prove the immensity of his love: “For the Father loves
      the Son, and shows him everything that he does” (below 5:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, from the greatness of its fruit, because through him we have
      eternal life. Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >so that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal
        life,</span
      >
      which he obtained for us through the death of the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      478 But did God give his Son with the intention that he should die on the
      cross? He did indeed give him for the death of the cross inasmuch as he
      gave him the will to suffer on it. And he did this in two ways. First,
      because as the Son of God he willed from eternity to assume flesh and to
      suffer for us; and this will he had from the Father. Secondly, because the
      will to suffer was infused into the soul of Christ by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      479 Note that above, when the Lord was speaking about the coming down
      which belongs to Christ according to his divinity, he called him the Son
      of God; and this because of the one <i>suppositum</i> of the two natures,
      as was explained above. And so divine things can be said about the
      <i>suppositum</i> of the human nature, and human things can be said about
      the <i>suppositum</i> of the divine nature, but not with reference to the
      same nature. Rather, divine things are said with reference to the divine
      nature, and human things with reference to the human nature. Now the
      specific reason why he here calls him the Son of God is that he set forth
      that gift as a sign of the divine love, through which the fruit of eternal
      life comes to us. And so, he should have been called by that name which
      indicates the power that produces eternal life; and this power is not in
      Christ as Son of Man but as Son of God: “This is the true God and eternal
      life,” as we read in 1 John (5:20); “In him was life” (above 1:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      480 Note also that he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">should not perish.</span> Someone is said
      to be perishing when he is hindered from arriving at the end to which he
      is ordained. But the end to which man is ordained is eternal life, and as
      long as he sins, he turns himself from that end. And although while he is
      living he cannot entirely perish in the sense that he cannot be restored,
      yet when he dies in sin, then he entirely perishes: “The way of the wicked
      will perish” (Ps 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicates the immensity of God’s love in saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">have eternal life:</span> for by giving
      eternal life, he gives himself. For eternal life is nothing else than
      enjoying God. But to give oneself is a sign of great love: “But God, who
      is rich in mercy, has brought us to life in Christ” (Eph 2:5), i.e., he
      gave us eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      481 Here the Lord excludes an objection that might be made. For in the old
      law it was promised that the Lord would come to judge: “The Lord will come
      to judge” (Is 3:14). So someone might say that the Son of God had not come
      to give eternal life but in order to judge the world. The Lord rejects
      this. First, he shows that he has not come to judge. Secondly, he proves
      it (v 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      482 So he says: The Son of God has not come to judge, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold">God did not send his Son,</span> referring
      to his first coming,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved
        through him.</span
      >
      The same thing is found below (12:47): “I did not come to judge the world,
      but to save the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now man’s salvation is to attain to God: “My salvation is in God” (Ps
      61:8). And to attain to God is to obtain eternal life; hence to be saved
      is the same as to have eternal life. However, because the Lord says, “I
      did not come to judge the world,” men should not be lazy or abuse God’s
      mercy, or give themselves over to sin: because although in his first
      coming he did not come to judge but to forgive, yet in his second coming,
      as Chrysostom says, he will come to judge but not to forgive. “At the
      appointed time I will judge with rigor” (Ps 74:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      483 However, this seems to conflict with what is said below (9:39): “1
      came into this world to judge.” I answer that there are two kinds of
      judgment. One is the judgment of distinction, and the Son has come for
      this in his first coming; because with his coming men are distinguished,
      some by blindness and some by the light of grace. The other is the
      judgment of condemnation; and he did not come for this as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      484 Now he proves what he had said, as though by a process of elimination,
      in the following way: Whoever will be judged will be either a believer or
      an unbeliever. But I have not come to judge unbelievers, because they are
      already judged. Therefore, from the outset, God did not send his Son to
      judge the world. So first he shows that believers are not judged.
      Secondly, that unbelievers are notjudged (v 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      485 He says therefore: I have not come to judge the world: because he did
      not come to judge believers, for
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever believes in him is not judged,</span
      >
      with the judgment of condemnation, with which no one who believes in him
      with faith informed by love is judged: “Whoever believes... will not
      encounter judgment, but will pass from death to life” (below 5:24). But he
      is judged with the judgment of reward and approval, of which the Apostle
      says: “It is the Lord who judges me” (1 Cor 4:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      486 But will there be many believing sinners who will not be damned? I
      reply that some heretics [e.g., Origen] have said that no believer,
      however great a sinner he may be, will be damned, but he will be saved by
      reason of his foundation of salvation, namely, his faith, although he may
      suffer some [temporary] punishment. They take as the basis of their error
      the statement of the Apostle: “No one can lay a foundation other that the
      one that has been laid, that is, Jesus Christ” (1 Cor 3:11); and further
      on: “If a man’s building burns... he himself will be saved as one fleeing
      through fire” (3:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      But this view is clearly contrary to what the Apostle says in Galatians
      (5:1): “It is obvious what proceeds from the flesh: lewd conduct,
      impurity, licentiousness... Those who do such things will not inherit the
      kingdom of God.” Therefore we must say that the foundation of salvation is
      not faith without charity (unformed faith), but faith informed by charity.
      Significantly therefore the Lord did not say, “whoever believes him,” but
      <span style="font-weight: bold">whoever believes in him,</span> that is,
      whoever by believing tends toward him through love
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is not judged,</span> because he does not
      sin mortally, thereby removing the foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or one could say, following Chrysostom, that everyone who acts sinfully is
      not a believer: “They profess to know God, but they deny him by their
      actions” (Ti 1:16); but only one who acts worthily: “Show me your faith by
      your works” (Jas 2:18). It is only such a one who is not judged and not
      condemned for unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      487 Here [the Lord] shows that unbelievers are not judged. First he makes
      the statement; secondly, he explains it (v 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      488 Concerning the first we should note, according to Augustine, that
      Christ does not say, “whoever does not believe is judged,” but rather
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is not judged.</span> This can be
      explained in three ways. For, according to Augustine, whoever does not
      believe is not judged, because he is already judged, not in fact, but in
      God’s foreknowledge, that is, it is already known to God that he will be
      condemned: “The Lord knows who are his” (2 Tim 2:19). In another way:
      according to Chrysostom,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever does not believe is already judged,</span
      >
      that is, the very fact that he does not believe is for him a condemnation:
      for not to believe is not to adhere to the light—which is to live in
      darkness, and this is a momentous condemnation: “All were bound with one
      chain of darkness” (Wis 17:17). “What kind ofjoy can I have, I who sit in
      darkness and do not see the light of heaven?” (Tb 5:12). In a third way:
      also according to Chrysostom,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever does not believe is not judged,</span
      >
      that is, being already condemned, he displays the obvious reason for his
      condemnation. This is like saying that a person who is proven guilty of
      death is already dead, even before the sentence of death has been passed
      on him, because he is as good as dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence Gregory says that in passing judgments there is a twofold order.
      Some will be sentenced by a trial; such are the ones who have something
      not deserving of condemnation, namely, the good of faith, that is, sinners
      who believe. But unbelievers, Whose reason for condemnation is manifest,
      are sentenced without trial; and of these it is said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever does not believe is already judged.</span
      >
      “In judgment the wicked will not stand” (Ps 1:6), that is, stand in trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      489 It should be noted that to be judged is the same as to be condemned;
      and to be condemned is to be shut out from salvation, to which only one
      road leads, that is, the name of the Son of God: “There is no other name
      under heaven given to men, by which we are saved” (Acts 4:12); “O’God,
      save me by your name” (Ps 53:3). Therefore, those who do not believe in
      the Son of God are cut off from salvation, and the cause of their
      damnation is evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      490 Here the Lord explains his statement that unbelievers have an evident
      cause for their condemnation. First, he sets forth the sign which shows
      this. Secondly, the fittingness of this sign (v 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      491 In the sign he sets forth he does three things. First, he mentions the
      gift of God. Secondly, the perversity of mind in unbelievers. Thirdly, the
      cause of this perversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he says: It is abundantly clear that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever does not believe is already judged,</span
      >
      because
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the light came into the world.</span> For
      men were in the darkness of ignorance, and God destroyed this darkness by
      sending a light into the world so that men might know the truth: “I am the
      light of the world. He who follows me does not walk in darkness, but will
      have the light of life” (below 8:12); “To enlighten those who sit in
      darkness and in the shadow of death” (Lk 1:78). Now the light came into
      the world because men could not come to it: for “He dwells in inaccessible
      light, whom no man has seen or is able to see” (1 Tim 6:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also clear from the perversity of mind in unbelievers who
      <span style="font-weight: bold">loved darkness more than the light,</span>
      i.e., they preferred to remain in the darkness of ignorance rather than be
      instructed by Christ: “They have rebelled against the light” (Jb 24:13);
      “Woe to you who substitute darkness for light, and light for darkness” (Is
      5:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      And the cause of this perversity is that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">their deeds were evil:</span> and such
      deeds do not conform to the light but seek the darkness: “Let us cast off
      the works of darkness” (Rom 13:12), i.e., sins, which seek the darkness;
      “Those who sleep, sleep at night” (1 Thes 5:7); “The eye of the adulterer
      watches for the darkness,” as we read in Job (24:15). Now it is by
      withdrawing from the light,which is unpleasant to him, that one does not
      believe the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      492 But do all unbelievers produce evil works? It seems not: for many
      Gentiles have acted with virtue; for example, Cato, and many others. I
      answer, with Chrysostom, that is it one thing to work by reason of virtue,
      and another by reason of a natural aptitude or disposition. For some act
      well because of their natural disposition, because their temperament is
      not inclined in a contrary way. And even unbelievers can act well in this
      way. For example, one may live chastely because he is not assailed by
      concupiscence; and the same for the other virtues. But those who act well
      by reason of virtue do not depart from virute, in spite of inclinations to
      the contrary vice, because of the rightness of their reason and the
      goodness of their will; and this is proper to believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, one might answer that although unbelievers may have done good things,
      they do not do them for love of virute but out of vainglory. Further, they
      did not do all things well; for they failed to render to God the worship
      due him.
    </p>
    <p>
      493 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Everyone who practices evil hates the light,</span
      >
      he shows the appropriateness of the sign he used. First, with respect to
      those who are evil. Secondly, with respect to the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      494 So he says: The reason why they did not love the light is that their
      works were evil. And this is plain because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Everyone who practices evil hates the light.</span
      >
      He does not say, “practiced,” but rather practices: because if someone has
      acted in an evil way, but has repented and is sorry,seeing that he has
      done wrong, such a person does not hate the light but comes to the light.
      But Everyone who practices evil, i.e., persists in evil, is not sorry, nor
      does he come to the light, but he hates it; not because it reveals truth,
      but because it reveals a person’s sins. For an evil person still wants to
      know the light and the truth; but he hates to be unmasked by it. “If the
      dawn suddenly appears, they regard it as the shadow of death” Qb 24:17).
      And so he
      <span style="font-weight: bold">does not approach the light;</span> and
      this
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for fear that his deeds might be exposed.</span
      >
      For no one who is unwilling to desert evil wants to be rebuked; this is
      fled from and hated. “They hate the one who rebukes at the city gate” (Am
      5:10); “A corrupt man does not love the one who rebukes him” (Prv 15:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      495 Now he shows the same things with respect to the good, who practice
      the truth, i.e., perform good works. For truth is found not only in
      thought and words. but also in deeds. Everyone of these
      <span style="font-weight: bold">comes to the light.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But did anyone practice the truth before Christ? It seems not, for to
      practice the truth is not to sin; and “before Christ all have sinned” (Rom
      3:23). I answer, according to Augustine, that he practices the truth in
      himself who is displeased at the evil he has done; and after leaving the
      darkness, keeps himself from sin, and repenting of the past,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">comes to the light,</span> with the
      special intention of making his actions known.
    </p>
    <p>
      496 But this conflicts with the teaching that no one should make public
      the good he has done; and this was a reason why the Lord rebuked the
      Pharisees. I answer that it is lawful to want one’s works to be seen by
      God so that they may be approved: “It is not the one who commends himself
      who is approved, but the one whom God commends” (2 Cor 10:18); “My witness
      is in heaven,” as is said in Job (16:20). It is also lawful to want them
      to be seen by one’s own conscience, so that one may rejoice: “Our glory is
      this: the testimony of our conscience” (2 Cor 1:12). But it is
      reprehensible to want them to be seen by men in order to be praised or for
      one’s own glory. Yet, holy persons desire that their good works be known
      to men for the sake of God’s glory and for the good of the faith: “Let
      your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and
      glorify your Father in heaven” (Mt 5:16). Such a person
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >comes to the light to make clear that his deeds are done in God,</span
      >
      that is, according to God’s commandment or through the grace of God. For
      whatever good we do, whether it be avoiding sin, repenting of what has
      been done, or doing good works, it is all from God: “You have accomplished
      all our works” (Is 26:12).

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        22 After this Jesus and his disciples came to Judean territory; he
        stayed there with his disciples and was baptizing. 23 But John also was
        baptizing at Aenon near Salim, where the water was plentiful, and people
        kept coming and were baptized. 24 John, of course, had not yet been
        thrown into prison. 25 A controversy arose between the disciples of John
        and the Jews concerning purification. 26 They went to John and said to
        him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan, the one of whom
        you have given testimony, he is here baptizing, and all the people are
        flocking to him.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      497 Above, the Lord gave us his teaching on spiritual regeneration in
      words, here he completes his teaching through action, by baptizing. First,
      two kinds of baptism are mentioned. Secondly, a question about their
      relationship is raised (v 25). As to the first, two things are done.
      Mention is first made of the baptism of Christ. Secondly, of the baptism
      of John.
    </p>
    <p>
      498 He says first,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">After this,</span> i.e., the teaching on
      spiritual regeneration,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Jesus and his disciples came to Judean territory.</span
      >
      There is a question here about the literal meaning. For above, the
      Evangelist had said that the Lord had come from Galilee to Jerusalem,
      which is in Judean territory, where he taught Nicodemus. So how, after
      teaching Nicodemus, can he come into Judea, since he was already there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two answers are given to this. According to Bede, after his discussion
      with Nicodemus, Christ went to Galilee, and after remaining there for a
      time, returned to Judea. And so
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >After this Jesus and his disciples came to Judean territory,</span
      >
      should not be understood to mean that he came into Judea immediately after
      his talk with Nicodemus. Another explanation, given by Chrysostom, is that
      he did come into the territory of Judea immediately after this discussion:
      for Christ wanted to preach where the people gathered, so that many might
      be converted: “I have declared your justice in the great assembly” (Ps 3
      9:10); “1 have spoken openly to the world” (below 18:20). Now there were
      two places in Judea where the Jewish people gathered: Jerusalem, where
      they went for their feasts, and the Jordan, where they gathered on account
      of John’s preaching and his baptism. And so the Lord used to visit both
      places; and after the feast days were over in Jerusalem, which is in one
      part of Judea, he went to another part, to the Jordan, where John was
      baptizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      499 As for the moral sense, Judea means “confession,” to which Jesus came,
      for Christ visits those who confess their sins or speak in praise of God:
      “Judea became his sanctuary” (Ps 113:2). He stayed there, because he did
      not make a merely temporary visit: “We will come to him, and make our
      abode with him,” as it says below (14:23).
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And was baptizing,</span> i.e., cleansing
      from sin; because unless one confesses his sins he does not obtain
      forgiveness: “He who hides his sins will not prosper” (Prv 28:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      500 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">But John also was baptizing,</span> the
      Evangelist presents the baptism of John. And in regard to this he does
      four things. First, he presents the person who is baptizing. Secondly, the
      place of the baptism. Thirdly, its fruit. Fourthly, the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      501 John is the person who is baptizing-, so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">John also was baptizing.</span> There is a
      question about this: Since John’s baptism was ordained to the baptism of
      Christ, it seems that John should have stopped baptizing when Christ
      started to baptize, just as the symbol does not continue when the truth
      comes. Three reasons are given for this. The first is in relation to
      Christ, for John baptized in order that Christ might be baptized by him.
      But it was not fitting that John baptize just Christ; otherwise, on this
      point alone, it might seem that John’s baptism was superior to Christ’s.
      Accordingly, it was expedient that John baptize others before Christ,
      because before Christ’s teaching was to be made public it was necessary
      that men be prepared for Christ by John’s baptism. In this way, the
      baptism of John is related to the baptism of Christ as the catechesis or
      religious instruction given to prospects to teach and prepare them for
      baptism is related to the true baptism. It was likewise important that
      John baptize others after he had baptized Christ, so that John’s baptism
      would not seem to be worthless. For the same reason, the practice of the
      ceremonies of the old law was not abolished as soon as the truth came, but
      as Augustine says, the Jews could lawfully observe them for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason relates to John. For if John had stopped baptizing at
      once after Christ began baptizing, it might have been thought that he
      stopped out of envy or anger. And because, as the Apostle says, “We ought
      to look after what is good, not only before God, but also before all men”
      (Rom 12:17), this is the reason why John did not stop at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third reason relates to John’s disciples, who were already beginning
      to act like zealots toward Christ and his disciples, because they were
      baptizing. So if John had entirely stopped from baptizing, it would have
      provoked his disciples to an even greater zeal and opposition to Christ
      and his disciples. For even while John continued baptizing, they were
      hostile to Christ’s baptism, as later events showed. And so John did not
      stop at once: “Take care that your freedom does not become a hindrance to
      those who are weak,” as is said in 1 Corinthians (8:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      502 The place of his baptism was
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >at Aenon near Salim, where the water was plentiful.</span
      >
      Another name for Salim is Salem, which is the village from which the king
      Melchizedek came. It is called Salim here because among the Jews a reader
      may use any vowel he chooses in the middle of his words; hence it made no
      difference to the Jews whether it was pronounced Salim or Salem. He added,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">where the water was plentiful,</span> to
      explain the name of this place, i.e.,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Aenon,</span> which is the same as
      “water.”
    </p>
    <p>
      503 The fruit of his baptism is the remission of sins; thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >people kept coming and were baptized,</span
      >
      i.e., cleansed: for as is stated in Matthew (3:5) and in Luke (3:7), great
      crowds came to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      504 The time is indicated when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span
      >
      He says this so that we may know that he began his narrative of Christ’s
      life before the other Evangelists. For the others began their account only
      from the time of John’s imprisonment. So Matthew (4:12) says: “When Jesus
      heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.” And so,
      because they had passed over the things that Christ did before John’s
      imprisonment, John, who was the last to write a Gospel, supplied these
      omissions. He suggests this when he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      505 Note that by divine arrangement it came about that when Christ began
      to baptize, John did not continue his own baptizing and preaching for very
      long, in order not to create disunion among the people. But he was granted
      a little time so that it would not seem that he deserved to be repudiated,
      as was mentioned before. Again, by God’s arrangement, it came about that
      after the faith had been preached and the faithful converted, the temple
      was utterly destroyed, in order that all the devotion and hope of the
      faithful could be directed to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      506 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">A controversy arose</span>, he brings in
      the issue of the two baptisms. First, the issue is mentioned. Secondly, it
      is brought to John’s attention (v 26). Thirdly, the issue is resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      507 Because both John and Christ were baptizing, the disciples of John,
      out of zeal for their teacher, started a controversy over this. And this
      is what he says, A controversy arose, i.e., a dispute,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">between the disciples of John,</span> who
      were the first to raise the issue,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and the Jews,</span> whom the disciples of
      John had rebuked for preferring Christ, because of the miracles he did, to
      John, who did not do any miracles. The issue was
      <span style="font-weight: bold">concerning purification,</span> i.e.,
      baptizing. The cause of their envy and the reason why they started the
      controversy was the fact that John sent those he baptized to Christ, but
      Christ did not send those he baptized to John. It seemed from this, and
      perhaps the Jews even said so, that Christ was greater than John. Thus,
      the disciples of John, having not yet become spiritual, quarreled with the
      Jews over the baptisms. “While there is envy and fighting among you, are
      you not carnal?” (1 Cor 3:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      508 They referred this issue to John; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">They went to John.</span> If we examine
      this closely, we see that they were trying to incite John against Christ.
      Indeed, they are like the gossip and the double-tongued: “Those who gossip
      and are double-tongued are accursed, for they disturb many who are at
      peace” (Sir 28:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      So they bring up four things calculated to set John against Christ. First,
      they recall the previous unimportant status of Christ. Secondly, the good
      John did for him. Thirdly, the role which Christ took on. Fourthly, the
      loss to John because of Christ’s new role.
    </p>
    <p>
      509 They recall Christ’s unimportance when they say,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the man who was with you,</span> as one of
      your disciples; and not the one you were with as your teacher. For there
      is no good reason for envy if honor is shown to one who is greater;
      rather, envy is aroused when honor is given to an inferior: “I have seen
      slaves on horses, and princes walking like slaves” (Ecc 10:7); “I called
      my servant, and he did not answer me” (Jb 19:16). For a master is more
      disturbed at the rebellion of a servant and a subject than of anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      510 Secondly, they remind John of the good he did Christ. Thus they do not
      say, “the one whom you baptized,” because they would then be admitting the
      greatness of Christ which was shown during his baptism when the Holy
      Spirit came upon him in the form of a dove and in the voice of the Father
      speaking to him. So they say,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the one of whom you have given testimony,</span
      >
      i.e., we are very angry that the one you made famous and admired dares to
      repay you in this way: “The one who ate my bread has lifted his heel
      against me” (Ps 40:10). They said this because those who seek their own
      glory and personal profit from their office become dejected if their
      office is taken over by someone else
    </p>
    <p>
      511 And so thirdly, they even add that Christ took over John’s office for
      himself, when they say,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he is here baptizing,</span> i.e., he is
      exercising your office; and this also distrubed them very much. For we
      generally see that men of the same craft are envious and underhanded with
      respect to one another; a potter envies another potter, but does not envy
      a carpenter. So, even teachers, who are seeking their own honor, become
      sad if another teaches the truth. In opposition to them, Gregory says:
      “The mind of a holy pastor wishes that others teach the truth which he
      cannot teach all by himself.” So also Moses: “Would that all the people
      might prophesy,” as we read in Numbers (11:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      512 Yet they were not satisfied with merely disturbing John, rather they
      report something that should really excite him, that is, the loss that
      John seemed to be having because of the office Christ took over. They give
      this when they say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >and all the people are flocking to him,</span
      >
      i.e., the ones who used to come to you. In other words, they have rejected
      and disowned you, and now are all going to his baptism. It is clear from
      Matthew (11:7) that they used to go to John: “What did you go into the
      desert to see?” The same envy affected the Pharisees against Christ; so
      they said: “Look, the whole world has gone after him” (below 12:19).
      However, all this did not set John againt Christ, for he was not a reed
      swaying in the wind, and this is clear from John’s answer to their
      question.

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      513 Here we have John’s answer to the question presented to him by his
      disciples. Their question contained two points: a complaint about the
      office Christ took on, and so they said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he is here baptizing;</span> and about
      Christ’s increasing fame and reputation among the people, and so they
      said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">all the people are flocking to him.</span>
      Accordingly, John directs his answer to these two complaints. First he
      answers the complaint about the office Christ took on. Secondly, the
      complaint about Christ’s increasing reputation (v 30). As to the first he
      does two things. First, he shows the source of Christ’s office and of his
      own. Secondly, their difference (v 28). Thirdly, how Christ and he are
      related to these offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      514 As to the first, note that although John’s disciples broach their
      question maliciously, and so deserve to be rebuked, John nevertheless does
      not sharply reprove them; and this because of their imperfection. For he
      feared that they might be provoked by a rebuke, leave him, and, joining
      forces with the Pharisees, publicly harass Christ. In acting this way he
      was putting into practice what is said of the Lord: “The burised reed he
      will not break” (Is 42:3). Again, we should also note that he begins his
      answer not by telling them what is great and wonderful about Christ, but
      what is common and obvious; and he did this on account oftheir envy. For
      since the excellence of a person provokes others to envy, if John had
      stressed Christ’s excellence at once, he would have fed the fire of their
      envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      515 Thus he states something unpretentious, and says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >No one can lay hold of anything unless it is given to him from
        heaven;</span
      >
      and he said this to them in order to inspire them with reverence. As if to
      say: If all men are going to him, it is God’s doing, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold">no one can lay hold of anything,</span> in
      the order of perfection and goodness, unless it is given to him from
      heaven. Therefore, if you oppose him, you oppose God. “If this plan or
      work is from men, it will fail,” as is said in Acts (5:38). This is the
      way Chrysostom explains it, applying these words to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine, on the other hand, does much better when he refers them to
      John.
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >No one can lay hold of anything unless it is given to him from
        heaven:</span
      >
      as if to say: You are zealous on my behalf and you want me to be greater
      than Christ; but that has not been given to me, and I do not wish to usurp
      it: “No one takes this honor on himself” (Heb 5:4). This is the origin of
      their offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      516 Then follows the difference of their offices, when he says, You
      yourselves are witnesses. As if to say: From the testimony which I bore to
      him, you can know the office committed to me by Christ: for You yourselves
      are witnesses, i.e., you can testify,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >to the fact that I said: I am not the Christ</span
      >
      —“He declared openly and did not deny” (above 1:20)—
      <span style="font-weight: bold">but the one sent before him,</span> as a
      herald before a judge. And so from my own testimony you can know my
      office, which is to go before Christ and prepare the way for him: “There
      was a man sent by God, whose name was John” (above 1:6). But the office of
      Christ is to judge and to preside. If we look at this closely we can see
      that John, like a skilful disputant, answers them with their own
      arguments: “I judge you out of your own mouth,” as said in Luke (19:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      517 He shows how John is related to his own office when he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">It is the groom who has the bride.</span>
      First, he gives a simile. Secondly, he applies it to his own situation.
      With respect to the first he does two things. First, he gives a simile
      which applies to Christ; and secondly, to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      518 As to the first, we should note that on the human level it is the
      groom who regulates, governs and has the bride. Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">It is the groom who has the bride.</span>
      Now the groom is Christ: “Like a bridegroom coming out of his bridal
      chamber” (Ps 18:6). His bride is the Church, which is joined to him by
      faith: “I will espouse you to myself in faith” Mos 2:20). In keeping with
      this figure, Zipporah said to Moses: “You are a spouse of blood to me” (Ex
      4:25). We read of the marriage: “The marriage of the Lamb has come” (Rv
      19:7). So, because Christ is the groom, he has the bride, that is, the
      Church; but my part is only to rejoice in the fact that he has the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      519 Consequently he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The groom’s friend waits there and listens to him, rejoicing at hearing
        his voice.</span
      >
      Although John had said earlier that he was not worthy to unfasten the
      strap of Jesus’ sandal, he here calls himself the friend of Jesus in order
      to bring out the faithfulness of his love for Christ. For a servant does
      not act in the spirit of love in regard to the things that pertain to his
      master, but in a spirit of servitude; while a friend, on the other hand,
      seeks his friend’s interests out of love and faithfulness. Hence a
      faithful servant is like a friend to his master: “If you have a faithful
      servant, treat him like yourself” (Sir 33:31). Indeed, it is proof of a
      servant’s faithfulness when he rejoices in the prosperity of his master,
      and when he obtains various goods, not for himself, but for his master.
      And so because John did not keep the bride entrusted to his care for
      himself, but for the groom, we can see that he was a faithful servant and
      a friend of the groom. It is to suggest this that he calls himself
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the groom’s friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who are friends of the truth should act in the same way, not turning
      the bride entrusted to their care to their own advantage and glory, but
      treating her honorably for the honor and glory of the groom; otherwise
      they would not be friends of the groom but adulterers. This is why Gregory
      says that a servant who is sent by the groom with gifts for the bride is
      guilty of adulterous thoughts if he himself desires to please the bride.
      This is not what the Apostle did: “I espoused you to one husband in order
      to present you to Christ as a chaste virgin” (2 Cor 11:2). And John did
      the same, because he did not keep the bride, i.e., the faithful, for
      himself, but brought them to the groom, that is, to Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      520 And so by saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the groom’s friend,</span> he suggests the
      faithfulness of his love. Further, he suggests his constancy when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">waits,</span> firm in friendship and
      faithfulness, not extolling himself above what he really is: “I will stand
      my watch” (Hb 2:1); “Be steadfast and unchanging” (1 Cor 15:58); “A
      faithful friend, if he is constant, is like another self” (Sir 6:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      He suggests his attention when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and listens to him,</span> i.e.,
      attentively considers the way in which the groom is united to the bride.
      For according to Chrysostom, these words explain the manner of this
      marriage, for it is accomplished through faith, and “faith comes through
      hearing” (Rom 10:17). Or, he
      <span style="font-weight: bold">listens to him,</span> i.e., reverently
      obeys him, by caring for the bride according to the commands of the groom:
      “I will listen to him as my master,” as is said in Isaiah (50:4). This is
      in opposition to those evil prelates who do not follow Christ’s command in
      governing the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, he hints at his spiritual joy when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">rejoicing at hearing his voice,</span>
      that is, when the groom talks to his bride. And he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">rejoicing</span> (literally, “rejoicing
      with joy”), to show the truth and perfection of his joy. For one whose
      rejoicing is not over the good, does not rejoice with true joy. And so, if
      it made me sad that Christ, who is the true groom, preaches to the bride,
      i.e., the Church, I would not be a friend of the groom; but I am not sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      521 Therefore in this case my joy is complete, namely, in seeing what I
      have so long desired, that is, the groom speaking to his bride. Or, my joy
      is complete, i.e., brought to its perfect and due measure, when the bride.
      is united to the groom, because I now have my grace and I have completed
      my work: “I will rejoice in the Lord, and I will take joy in God, my
      Jesus” (Hb 3:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      522 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >He must increase, and I must decrease,</span
      >
      he answers their question as to their complaint about the increasing
      esteem given to Christ. First, he notes that such an increase is fitting.
      Secondly, he gives the reason for it (v 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      523 So he says: You say that all the people are flocking to him, i.e., to
      Christ, and therefore that he is growing in honor and esteem among the
      people. But I say that this is not unbecoming, because He must increase,
      not in himself, but in relation to others, in the sense that his power
      becoipe more and more known.
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And I must decrease,</span> in the
      reverence and esteem of the people: for esteem and reverence are not due
      to me as if I were a principal; but they are due to Christ. And therefore
      since he has come, the signs of honor are diminishing in my regard, but
      increasing in regard to Christ, just as with the coming of the prince, the
      office of the ambassador ceases: “When the perfect comes, what is
      imperfect will pass away” (1 Cor 13:10). And just as in the heavens the
      morning star appears and gives light before the sun, only to cease giving
      light when the sun appears, so John went before Christ and is compared to
      the morning star: “Can you bring out the morning star?” (Jb 38:32).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also signified in John’s birth and in his death. In his birth,
      because John was born at a time when the days are getting shorter; Christ,
      however, was born when the days are growing longer, on the twenty-fifth of
      December. In his death, because John dies shortened by decapitation; but
      Christ died raised up by the lifting up of the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      524 In the moral sense, this should take place in each one of us. Christ
      must increase in you, i.e., you should grow in the knowledge and love of
      Christ, because the more you are able to grasp him by knowledge and love,
      the more Christ increases in you; just as the more one improves in seeing
      one and the same light, the more that light seems to increase.
      Consequently, as men advance in this way, their self-esteem decreases;
      because the more one knows of the divine greatness, the less he thinks of
      his human smallness. As we read in Proverbs (30:1): “The revelation spoken
      by the man close to God”; and then there follows: “I am the most foolish
      of men, and the wisdom of men is not in me.” “I have heard you, but now I
      see you, and so I reprove myself, and do penance in dust and ashes,” as we
      read in Job (42:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      525 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The One who came from above is above all things,</span
      >
      he gives the reason for what he has just said. And he does this in two
      ways. First, on the basis of Christ’s origin. And secondly, by considering
      Christ’s teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      526 Regarding the first, we should note that in order for a thing to be
      perfect, it must reach the goal fixed for it by its origin; for example,
      if one is born from a king, he should continue to progress until he
      becomes a king. Now Christ has an origin that is most excellent and
      eternal; therefore he must increase by the manifestation of his power, in
      relation to others, until it is recognized that he is above all things.
      Thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The One who came from above,</span> that
      is, Christ, according to his divinity. “No one has gone up to heaven
      except the One who came down from heaven” (above 3:13); “You are from
      below, I am from above” (below 8:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      527 Or, he <span style="font-weight: bold">came from above,</span> as to
      his human nature, i.e., from the “highest” condition of human nature, by
      assuming it according to what was predominant in it in each of its states.
      For human nature is considered in three states. First, is the state of
      human nature before sin; and from this state he took his purity by
      assuming a flesh unmarked by the stain of original sin: “A lamb without
      blemish” (Ex 12:5). The second state is after sin; and from this he took
      his capability to suffer and die by assuming the likeness of sinful flesh
      as regards its punishment, but not in its guilt: “God sent his own Son in
      the likeness of sinful flesh” (Rom 8:3). The third state is that of
      resurrection and glory; and from this he took his impossibility of sinning
      and his joy of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      528 Here we must be on guard against the error of those who say that there
      was left in Adam something materially unmarked by the original stain, and
      this was passed on to his descendants; for example, to the Blessed Virgin,
      and that Christ’s body was formed from this. This is heretical, because
      whatever existed in Adam in a material way was marked by the stain of
      original sin. Further, the matter from which the body of Christ was formed
      was purified by the power of the Holy Spirit when he sanctified the
      Blessed Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
      529
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The One who came from above,</span>
      according to his divinity as well as his human nature,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is above all things,</span> both by
      eminence of rank: “The Lord is high above all nations” (Ps 112:4), and by
      his authority and power: “He has made him the head of the Church,” as is
      said in Ephesians (1:22).
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
    <p>
      530 Now he gives the reason for what he had said above (v 30), by
      considering the teaching of Christ. First, he describes the doctrine of
      Christ and its grandeur. Secondly, the difference in those who receive or
      reject this doctrine (v 32b). He does two things with respect to the
      first. First, he describes John’s doctrine. Secondly, he describes the
      doctrine of Christ (v 32).
    </p>
    <p>
      531 As to the first we should note that a man is known mainly by what he
      says: “Your accent gives you away” (Mt 26:73); “Out of the abundance of
      the heart the mouth speaks” (Mt 12:34). This is why the quality of a
      teaching or doctrine is considered according to the quality of its origin.
      Accordingly, in order to understand the quality of John’s doctrine, we
      should first consider his origin. So he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">He who is of earth,</span> that is John,
      not only as to the matter from. which he was made, but also in his
      efficient cause: because the body of John was formed by a created power:
      “They dwell in houses of clay, and have a foundation of earth” (Jb 4:19).
      Secondly, we should consider the quality of John himself, which is
      earthly; and so he says, is earthly. Thirdly, the quality of his teaching
      is described: he
      <span style="font-weight: bold">speaks of earthly things.</span> “You will
      speak of the earth” (Is 29:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      532 But since John was full of the Holy Spirit while still in his mother’s
      womb, how can he be said to speak of earthly things? I answer that,
      according to Chrysostom, John says he speaks of earthly things by
      comparison with the teaching of Christ. As if to say: The things I speak
      of are slight and inferior as becomes one of an earthly nature, in
      comparison to him “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
      knowledge” (Col 2:3); “As the heavens are high above the earth, so my ways
      are high above your ways” (Is 55:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or we could say according to Augustine, and this is a better explanation,
      that we can consider what any person has of himself and what he has
      received from another. Now John and every mere human of himself is of the
      earth. Therefore, from this standpoint, he has nothing to speak of except
      earthly things. And it’ he does speak of divine things, it is due to a
      divine enlightenment: “Your heart has visions, but unless they come from
      the Almighty, ignore them” (Sir 34:6). So the Apostle says, “It is not 1,
      but the grace of God which is with me” (1 Cor 15:10); “For it is not you
      who speak, but the Holy Spirit who is speaking through you” (Mt 10:20).
      Accordingly, as regards John, he
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >is earthly and speaks of earthly things.</span
      >
      And if there was anything divine in him, it did not come from him, as he
      was the recipient, but from the one enlightening him.
    </p>
    <p>
      533 Now he describes the doctrine of Christ. And he does three things.
      First, he shows its origin, which is heavenly; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The One who comes from heaven is above all things.</span
      >
      For although the body of Christ was of the earth as regards the matter of
      which it was made, yet it came from heaven as to its efficient cause,
      inasmuch as his body was formed by divine power. It also came from heaven
      because the eternal and uncreated person of the Son came from heaven by
      assuming a body. “No one has gone up to heaven except the One who came
      down from heaven, the Son of Man, who lives in heaven” (above 3:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, he shows the dignity of Christ, which is very great; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is above all things.</span> This was
      explained above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he infers the dignity of Christ’s doctrine, which is most
      certain, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >he testifies to what he sees and to what he hears.</span
      >
      For Christ, as God, is truth itself; but as man, he is its witness: “For
      this was I born, and for this I came into the world: to testify to the
      truth” (below 18:37). Therefore, he gives testimony to himself: “You
      testify to yourself” (below 8:13). And he testifies to what is certain,
      because his testimony is about what he has heard with the Father: “I speak
      to the world what I have heard from my Father” (below 8:26); “What we have
      seen and heard” (1 Jn 1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      534 Note that knowledge of a thing is acquired in through sight and in one
      way another way through hearing. For by sight, a knowledge of a thing in
      acquired by means of the very thing seen; but by hearing, a thing is not
      made known by the very voice that is heard, but by means of the
      understanding of the one speaking. And so, because the Lord has knowledge
      which he has received from the Father, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">to what he sees,</span> insofar as he
      proceeds from the essence of the Father;
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and to what he hears, insofar</span> as he
      proceeds as the Word of the Father’s intellect. Now because among
      intellectual beings, their act of being is other than their act of
      understanding, their knowledge through sight is other than their knowledge
      through hearing. But in God the Father, the act of being (<i>esse</i>) and
      the act of understanding (<i>intelligere</i>) are the same. Thus in the
      Son, to see and hear are the same thing. Moreover, since even in one who
      sees there is not the essence of the thing seen in itself but only its
      similitude, as also in the hearer there is not the actual thought of the
      speaker but only an indication of it, so the one who sees is not the
      essence of the thing in itself, nor is the listener the very thought
      expressed. In the Son, however, the very essence of the Father is received
      by generation, and he himself is the Word; and so in him to see and to
      hear are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so John concludes that since the doctrine of Christ has more grandeur
      and is more certain than his, one must listen to Christ rather than to
      him.

    <p>
      535 Above, John the Baptist commended the teaching of Christ; here,
      however, he considers the difference in those who receive it. Thus, he
      treats of the faith that must be given to this teaching. And he does three
      things. First, he shows the scarcity of those who believe. Secondly, the
      obligation to believe (v 33). Lastly, the reward for belief (v 36).
    </p>
    <p>
      536 He says therefore: I say that Christ has certain knowledge and that he
      speaks the truth. Yet although few accept his testimony, that is no
      reflection on his teaching, because it is not the fault of the teaching
      but of those who do not accept it: namely, the disciples of John, who did
      not yet believe, and the Pharisees, who slandered his teaching. Thus he
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And his testimony no one accepts.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      537 <span style="font-weight: bold">No one</span> can be explained in two
      ways. First, so that it implies a few; and so some did accept his
      testimony. He shows that some did accept it when he adds, “But whoever
      accepts his testimony.” The Evangelist used this way of speaking before
      when he said: “He came unto his own, and his own did not receive him”
      (above 1:11): because a few did receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another way, to accept his testimony is understood as to believe in
      God. But no one can believe of himself, but only due to God: “You are
      saved by grace” (Eph 2:8). And so he says, his testimony no one accepts,
      i.e., of himself, but it is given to him by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be explained in another way by realizing that Scripture refers to
      people in two ways. As long as we are in this world the wicked are mingled
      with the good; and so Scripture sometimes speaks of “the people,” or
      “they,” meaning those who are good; while at other times, the same words
      can refer to the wicked. We can see this in Jeremiah (26): for first it
      says that all the people and the priests sought to kill Jeremiah, and this
      referred to those who were evil; then at once it says that all the people
      sought to free him, and this referred to those who were good. In the same
      way, John the Baptist says, looking to the left, i.e., toward those who
      are evil,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And his testimony no one accepts;</span>
      and later, referring to those on the right, i.e., to the good, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">But whoever accepts his testimony.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      538
      <span style="font-weight: bold">But whoever accepts his testimony.</span>
      Here he speaks of the obligation to believe, i.e., to submit oneself to
      divine truth. As to this he does four things. First, he presents the
      divine truth. Secondly, he speaks of the proclamation of the divine truth
      (v 34). Thirdly, of the ability to proclaim it (v 34b). Fourthly, he gives
      the reason for this ability (v 35).
    </p>
    <p>
      539 Man’s obligation to the faith is to submit himself to divine truth,
      and so he says that if few accept his testimony that means that some do.
      Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">whoever accepts his testimony,</span>
      i.e., whoever he may be,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">has given a sign,</span> i.e., he ought to
      affix a certain sign or has in fact placed a seal in his own heart, that
      Christ is God. And he [Christ] is true, because he said that he is God. If
      he were not, he would not be true, but it is written: “God is true” (Rom
      3:4). Concerning this seal it is said: “Set me as a seal on your heart”
      (Sg 8:6), and “The foundation of God stands firm, bearing a seal, etc.” as
      we read in 2 Timothy (2:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, following Chrysostom, he has given a sign, i.e., he has shown
      <span style="font-weight: bold">that God,</span> that is, the Father,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">is true,</span> because he sent his Son
      whom he promised to send. The Fvangelist says this to show that those who
      do not believe Christ deny the truthfulness of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      540 Then immediately he adds a commendation of divine truth, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For the One whom God sends speaks the words of God.</span
      >
      As if to say: He has given this as a sign, namely, that Christ, whose
      testimony he accepts,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the One whom God sends speaks the words of God.</span
      >
      Consequently, one who believes Christ believes the Father: “I speak to the
      world what I have heard from the Father” (below 8:26). So he expressed
      verbally nothing but the Father and the words of the Father, because he
      has been sent by the Father, and because he is the Word of the Father.
      Hence, he says that he even bespeaks the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, if the statement
      <span style="font-weight: bold">God is true</span> refers to Christ, we
      understand the distinction of persons; for since the Father is true God,
      and Christ is true God, it follows that the true God sent the true God,
      who is distinct from him in person, but not in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      541 The ability to proclaim divine truth is present in Christ in the
      highest degree, because he does not receive the Spirit in a partial way;
      and so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for God does not bestow the Spirit in fractions.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      You might say that although God sent Christ, yet not all that Christ says
      is from God, but only some of the things; for even the prophets spoke at
      times from their own spirit, and at other times from the Spirit of God.
      For example, we read that the prophet Nathan (2 Sm 7:3), speaking out of
      his own spirit, advised David to build a temple, but that later, under the
      influence of the Spirit of God, he retracted this. However, the Baptist
      shows that such is not the case with Christ. For the prophets receive the
      Spirit of God only fractionally, i.e., in reference to some things, but
      not as to all things. Consequently, not all they say are the words of God.
      But Christ, who received the Spirit fully and in regards to all things,
      speaks the words of God as to all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      542 But how can the Holy Spirit be given in fractions, since he is immense
      or infinite, according to the Creed of Athanasius: “Immense is the Father,
      immense the Son, immense the Holy Spirit”? I answer that the Holy Spirit
      is given in fractions, not in respect to his essence or power, according
      to which he is infinite, but as to his gifts, which are given
      fractionally: “Grace has been given to each of us according to degree”
      (Eph 4:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      543 We should note that we can understand in two ways what is said here,
      namely, that God the Father did not give the Spirit to Christ in a partial
      way. We can understand it as applying to Christ as God, and, in another
      way, as applying to Christ as man. Something is given to someone in order
      that he may have it: and it is appropriate to Christ to have the Spirit,
      both as God and as man. And so he has the Holy Spirit with respect to
      both. As man, Christ has the Holy Spirit as Sanctifier: “The Spirit of the
      Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me” (Is 6 1:1), namely, as
      man. But as God, he has the Holy Spirit only as manifesting himself,
      inasmuch as the Spirit proceeds from him: “He will give glory to me,” that
      is, make known, “because he will have received from me,” as is said below
      (16:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, both as God and as man, Christ has the Holy Spirit beyond
      measure. For God the Father is said to give the Holy Spirit without
      measure to Christ as God, because he gives to Christ the power and might
      to bring forth (<i>spirandi</i>) the Holy Spirit, who, since he is
      infinite, was infinitely given to him by the Father: for the Father gives
      it just as he himself has it, so that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him as
      much as from the Son. And he gave him this by an everlasting generation.
      Similarly, Christ as man has the Holy Spirit without measure, for the Holy
      Spirit is given to different men in differing degrees, because grace is
      given to each “by measure” [cf., e.g., Mk 4:24; Mt 7:2]. But Christ as man
      did not receive a certain amount of grace; and so he did not receive the
      Holy Spirit in any limited degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      544 It should be noted, however, that there are three kinds of grace in
      Christ: the grace of [the hypostatic] union, the grace of a singular
      person, which is habitual, and the grace of headship, which animates all
      the members. And Christ received each of these graces without measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grace of union, which is not habitual grace, but a certain gratuitous
      gift, is given to Christ in order that in his human nature he be the true
      Son of God, not by participation, but by nature, insofar as the human
      nature of Christ is united to the Son of God in person. This union is
      called a grace because he had it without any preceding merits. Now the
      divine nature is infinite; hence from that union he received an infinite
      gift. Thus it was not by degree or measure that he received the Holy
      Spirit, i.e., the gift and grace of union which, as gratuitous, is
      attributed to the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grace is termed habitual insofar as the soul of Christ was full of
      grace and wisdom: “the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and
      truth” (above 1:14). We might wonder if Christ did receive this grace
      without measure. For since such grace is a created gift, we must admit
      that it has a finite essence. Therefore, as far as its essence is
      concerned, since it is something created, this habitual grace was finite.
      Yet Christ is not said to have received this in a limited degree for three
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, becatise of the one who is receiving the grace. For it is plain
      that each thing’s nature has a finite capacity, because even though one
      might receive an infinite good by knowing, loving and enjoying it,
      nevertheless one receives it by enjoying it in a finite way. Further, each
      creature has, according to its species and nature, a finite amount of
      capacity. But this does not make it impossible for the divine power to
      make another creature possessing a greater capacity; but then such a
      creature would not be of a nature which is specifically the same, just as
      when one is added to three, there is another species of number. Therefore,
      when some nature is not given as much of the divine goodness as its
      natural capacity is able to contain, then it is seen to be given to it by
      measure; but when its total natural capacity is filled, it is not given to
      it by measure, because even though there is a measure on the part of the
      one receiving, there is none on the part of the one giving, who is
      prepared to give all. Thus, if someone takes a pail to a river, he sees
      water present without measure, although he takes the water by measure on
      account of the limited dimensions of the pail. Thus, the habitual grace of
      Christ is indeed finite according to its essence, but it is said to be
      given in an infinite way and not by measure or partially, because as much
      was given to him as created nature was able to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Christ did not receive habitual grace in a limited way by
      considering the gift which is received. For every form or act, considered
      in its very nature, is not finite in the way in which it is made finite by
      the subject in which it is received. Nevertheless, there is nothing to
      prevent it from being finite in its essence, insofar as its existence
      (<i>esse</i>) is received in some subject. For that is infinite according
      to its essence which has the entire fulness of being (<i>essendi</i>): and
      this is true of God alone, who is the supreme <i>esse.</i> But if we
      consider some “spiritual” form as not existing in a subject, for example,
      whiteness or color, it would not be infinite in essence, because its
      essence would be confined to some genus or species; nevertheless it would
      still possess the entire fulness of that species. Thus, considering the
      nature of the species, it would be without limit or measure, since it
      would have everything that can pertain to that species. But if whiteness
      or color should be received into some subject, it does not always have
      everything that pertains necessarily and always to the nature of this
      form, but only when the subject has it as perfectly as it is capable of
      being possessed, i.e., when the way the subject possesses it is equivalent
      to the power of the thing possessed. Thus, Christ’s habitual grace was
      finite according to its essence; yet it is said to have been in him
      without a limit or measure because he received everything that could
      pertain to the nature of grace. Others, however, do not receive all this,
      but one receives in one way, and another in another way: “There are
      different graces”
    </p>
    <p>
      The third reason for saying that the habitual grace of Christ was not
      received in a limited way is based on its cause. For an effect is in some
      way present in its cause. Therefore, if someone has an infinite power to
      produce something, he is said to have what can be produced without measure
      and, in a way, infinitely. For example, if someone has a fountain which
      could produce an infinite amount of water, he would be said to have water
      in an infinite way and without measure. Thus, the soul of Christ has
      infinite grace and grace without measure from the fact that he has united
      to himself the Word, which is the infinite and unfailing source of the
      entire emanation of all created things.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been said, it is clear that the grace of Christ which is
      called capital grace, insofar as he is head of the Church, is infinite in
      its influence. For from the fact that he possessed that from which the
      gifts of the Spirit could flow out without measure, he received the power
      to pour them out without measure, so that the grace of Christ is
      sufficient not merely for the salvation of some men, but for all the
      people of the entire world: “He is the offering for our sins; and not for
      ours only, but also for those of the entire world” (1 Jn 2:2), and even
      for many worlds, if they exsited.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
    <p>
      545 Christ also had the ability appropriate for declaring divine truth,
      because all things are in his power; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The Father loves the Son, and has put everything into his hands.</span
      >
      This can refer to Christ both as man and as God, but in different ways. If
      it refers to Christ according to his divine nature, then
      <span style="font-weight: bold">loves</span> does not indicate a principle
      but a sign: for we cannot say that the Father gives all things to the Son
      because he loves him. There are two reasons for this. First, because to
      love is an act of the will; but to give a nature to the Son is to generate
      him. Therefore, if the Father gave a nature to the Son by his will, the
      will of the Father would be the principle of the generation of the Son;
      and then it would follow that the Father generated the Son by will, and
      not by nature; and this is the Arian heresy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, because the love of the Father for the Son is the Holy Spirit.
      So, if the love of the Father for the Son were the reason why the Father
      put everything into his hands, it would follow that the Holy Spirit would
      be the principle of the generation of the Son; and this is not acceptable.
      Therefore, we should say that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">loves</span> implies only a sign. As if to
      say: The perfect love with which
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the Father loves the Son,</span> is a sign
      that the Father
      <span style="font-weight: bold">has put everything into his hands,</span>
      i.e., everything which the Father has: “All things have been given to me
      by my Father- (Mt 11:27); “Jesus, knowing that the Fallier had given all
      things into his hands” (below 13:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      But if loves refers to Christ as man, then it implies the notion of a
      principle, so that the Father is said to have put everything into the
      hands of the Son, everything, that is, that is in heaven and on earth:
      “All authority has been given to me, in heaven and on earth,” as he says
      in Matthew (28:18); “He has appointed him [the Son] the heir of all
      things” (Heb 1:2). And the reason why the Father gives to the Son is
      because he loves the Son; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father loves the Son,</span> for the
      Father’s love is the reason for creating each creature: “You love
      everything which exists, and hate nothing which you have made” (Wis
      11:25). Concerning his love for the Son we read in Matthew (3:17): “This
      is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”; “He has brought us into the
      kingdom of the Son of his love,” that is, i.e., of his beloved Son (Col
      1:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      546 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life,</span
      >
      he shows the fruit of faith. First, he sets forth the reward for faith.
      Secondly, the penalty for unbelief (v 36b).
    </p>
    <p>
      547 The reward for faith is beyond our comprehension, because it is
      eternal life. Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.</span
      >
      And this is shown from what has already been said. For if the Father has
      given everything he has to the Son, and the Father has eternal life, then
      he has given to the Son to be eternal life: “Just as the Father possesses
      life in himself, so he has given it to the Son to have life in himself”
      (below 5:26): and this belongs to Christ insofar as he is the true and
      natural Son of God. “That you may be in his true Son, Christ. This is the
      true God and eternal life” (1 Jn 5:20).
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Whoever believes in the Son</span> has
      that toward which he tends, that is, the Son, in whom he believes. But the
      Son is eternal life; therefore, whoever believes in him has eternal life.
      As it says below (10:27): “My sheep hear my voice... and I give them
      eternal life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      548 The penalty for unbelief is unendurable, both as to the punishment of
      loss and as to the punishment of sense. As to the punishment of loss,
      because it deprives one of life; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever is unbelieving in the Son will not see life.</span
      >
      He does not say, “will not have,” but will not see, because eternal life
      consists in the vision of the true life: “This is eternal life: that they
      may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent”
      (below 17:3): and unbelievers will not have this vision and this
      knowledge: “Let him not see the brooks of honey” (Jb 4:19), that is, the
      sweetness of eternal life. And he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">will not see,</span> because to see life
      itself is the proper reward for faith united with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punishment of sense is unendurable because one is severely punished;
      so he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the anger of God rests on him.</span> For
      in the Scriptures anger indicates the pain with which God punishes those
      who are evil. So when he says, the anger of God, the Father, rests on him,
      it is the same as saying: They will feel punishment from God the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Father “has given all judgment to the Son,” as we read below
      (5:22), the Baptist refers this to the Father in order to lead the Jews to
      believe in the Son. It is written about this judgment: “It is a terrible
      thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Heb 10:31). He says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">rests on him</span>, because this
      punishment will never be absent from the unbelieving, and because all who
      are born into this mortal life are the objects of God’s anger, which was
      first felt by Adam: “We were by nature,” that is, through birth, “children
      of anger” (Eph 2:3). And we are freed from this anger only by faith in
      Christ; and so the anger of God rests on those who do not believe in
      Christ, the Son of God.
