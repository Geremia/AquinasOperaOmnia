            Thus, when one time is more appropriate than another for fasting,

            the needs of others. Thus, a time for almsgiving cannot be
            determined, as if one should not come to the aid of those in need
            (in times outside of this determined time). But fasting is
            instituted to restrain the concupiscence of the flesh and to make
            reparation for sins already committed. And since fasting restrains
            concupiscence even after the deed has been done (inasmuch as its
            effect remains in the one fasting), therefore a time can be fixed
            with respect to fasting.</font

            >Response to the third objection: Christ did not fast as if He
            Himself stood in need of fasting, but so that He might offer to us
            by His fasting an example to be taken up for the sake of grace. Thus
            after His baptism in which the fullness of His own grace was
            declared in the testimony of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, and
            even of John, it was fitting that an example of His fasting be put
            before us. Fasting is suitable to us so that we might prepare to
            receive His own grace. Hence since the sacraments of His grace
            especially are established around the feast of Easter, thus
            immediately before the solemnity of Easter, the 40 day fast is
            implemented; and also since the time of one's youth is most prone to
            concupiscence does fasting then begin; and because it is indicated
            that we arrive at the glory of the resurrection through the
            tribulations of the present life, just as Christ did through his
            Passion.</font

            >Response to the fourth objection: According to Jerome, the Jews
            used to have particular reasons why they used to observe that fast.
            They used to fast in July, which is the 4th month from April which
            they themselves placed first. For in that month on the 7th day,
            Moses, coming down from the mountain, broke the tablets of the law
            because of the sin of the molten calf, and in the same month the
            walls of Jerusalem were destroyed by Nabuchodonosor. In the 5th
            month, that is, in August, (they fasted) because of the sin of
            murmuring by reason of the speech born of having been tried (in the
            desert); also in that month, the temple was burned by
            Nabuchodonosor, and after by Titus as well. In the 7th month, (they
            fasted) because of the slaying of Godolias, under whom the rest of
            the people were preserved, as is clear from Jeremiah 41. In the 10th
            month, (they fasted) in memory of the dead whom the Lord had struck
            down in the desert. In addition to the 40 day fast, in which of all
            days we exempt nearly ten, three days of fast are instituted in
            specific quarters of the year, which are counted among the first
            fruits, as it were, and to atone for the sins of each quarter.</font

            this. However, there is also the fasting of exultation which belongs
            to those who have received the Holy Spirit. For the affliction of
            the body suffers together with the joy of spiritual things. Hence

            >I respond to the 2nd question (sub-article 2) saying that fasting,
            as far as it concerns itself, is prohibited at no time. Hence, as
            Isidore says, the holy fathers used to fast in the desert during the
            time of Easter, with the exception of the day of the Lord's
            resurrection, on which it did not seem suitable to fast, and on
            which the whole of the Church conducts a feast of joy. Hence it is
            not suitable that some intend on that day the work of affliction,
            since "Base is every part which is not congruent with its whole," as
            Augustine states in the 3rd book of his
            <i>Confessions.</i>
            However, accidentally, somebody's fast on a feast day can be
            illicit, if he holds the fast to be so pertinent that he would not
            believe through devotion to the feast to be able to be compensated
            for the goodness of the fast.

            >I respond to the 3rd question (sub-article 3) saying that the
            fitting hour for eating during the days of fasting is at the ninth
            hour. This has been instituted by the Church and is generally
            observed. Now, according to the common way of eating, it is the
            sixth hour (at which people usually take their main meal), for food
            ought not to be taken until such time as nature has used up food
            previously taken. One uses up food already taken in two ways. First,
            by digesting it. And since digestion is accomplished by heat, the
            time of digestion is fitting in which the natural heat is recalled
            into the interior (regions of the body), namely because of the
            withdrawal of the sun's rays, and on account of sleep during which
            the natural powers become stronger. Second, by leading food already
            prepared through one's members by which it should be assimilated.
            For this, it is required that heat calls forth nutrition, leading it
            to the extreme parts of the body. But the heat of the sun calls
            forth natural heat to the exterior members. Thus, when the sun has
            completed its ascent (which comes about at the 6th hour, at which
            time it is at its zenith), its work has been completed. This, then,
            is the time commonly to take food. And since the fast of the Church
            ought to be penal and reparative, something beyond this is thus
            added. However not to such an extent that the humor is wholly dried
            up by the food taken, nor the natural power weakened. Hence having
            divided the remaining time, the 9th hour is established in which
            food is to be taken according to the statutes of the Church on
            fasting days.</font

            to the new man (i.e., Christ), who through His passion has recalled
            us from old times and shadows. Thus, at that time, we are first
            released from fasting when Christ finished His passion, namely at
            the 9th hour. But before this restoration, the evening time of
            fasting was appropriate to taking food, so as to signify that
            through the food of the old man (i.e., Adam) they were cast down
            into the shadows of sin and death, by which they were not
            embarrassed, even after the tribulations of the present life; for
            they were descending in death to Limbo which was the place of
            shadows.</font
