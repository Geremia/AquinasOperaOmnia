        THE MATTER AND THE SUBJECT OF NATURAL SCIENCE AND OF THIS BOOK. WE MUST
        PROCEED FROM THE MORE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE BETTER KNOWN TO
        US</span
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      1. Because this book, <i>The Physics</i>, upon which we intend to comment
      here, is the first book of natural science, it is necessary in the
      beginning to decide what is the matter and the subject of natural science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since every science is in the intellect, it should be understood that
      something is rendered intelligible in act insofar as it is in some way
      abstracted from matter. And inasmuch as things are differently related to
      matter they pertain to different sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, since every science is established through demonstration, and
      since the definition is the middle term in a demonstration, it is
      necessary that sciences be distinguished according to the diverse modes of
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. It must be understood, therefore, that there are some things whose
      existence depends upon matter, and which cannot be defined without matter.
      Further there are other things which, even though they cannot exist except
      in sensible matter, have no sensible matter in their definitions. And
      these differ from each other as the curved differs from the snub. For the
      snub exists in sensible matter, and it is necessary that sensible matter
      fall in its definition, for the snub is a curved nose. And the same is
      true of all natural things, such as man and stone. But sensible matter
      does not fall in the definition of the curved, even though the curved
      cannot exist except in sensible matter. And this is true of all the
      mathematicals, such as numbers, magnitudes and figures. Then, there are
      still other things which do not depend upon matter either according to
      their existence or according to their definitions. And this is either
      because they never exist in matter, such as God and the other separated
      substances, or because they do not universally exist in matter, such as
      substance, potency and act, and being itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Now metaphysics deals with things of this latter sort. Whereas
      mathematics deals with those things which depend upon sensible matter for
      their existence but not for their definitions. And natural science, which
      is called physics, deals with those things which depend upon matter not
      only for their existence, but also for their definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because everything which has matter is mobile, it follows that mobile
      being is the subject of natural philosophy. For natural philosophy is
      about natural things, and natural things are those whose principle is
      nature. But nature is a principle of motion and rest in that in which it
      is. Therefore natural science deals with those things which have in them a
      principle of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Furthermore those things which are consequent upon something common
      must be treated first and separately. Otherwise it becomes necessary to
      repeat such things many times while discussing each instance of that which
      is common. Therefore it was necessary that one book in natural science be
      set forth in which those things which are consequent upon mobile being in
      common are treated; just as first philosophy, in which those things which
      are common to being insofar as it is being, is set forth for all the
      sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is the book, <i>The Physics</i>, which is also called
      <i>On Physics</i>, or <i>Of the Natural to be Heard</i>, because it was
      handed down to hearers by way of instruction. And its subject is mobile
      being simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not, however, say mobile body, because the fact that every mobile
      being is a body is proven in this book, and no science proves its own
      subject. And thus in the very beginning of the <i>De Caelo</i>, which
      follows this book, we begin with the notion of body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, after <i>The Physics</i> there are other books of natural
      science in which the species of motion are treated. Thus in the
      <i>De Caelo</i> we treat the mobile according to local motion, which is
      the first species of motion. In the <i>De Generatione</i>, we treat of
      motion to form and of the first mobile things, i.e., the elements, with
      respect to the common aspects of their changes. Their special changes are
      considered in the book <i>Meteororum</i>. In the book,
      <i>De Mineralibus</i>, we consider the mobile mixed bodies which are
      non-living. Living bodies are considered in the book, <i>De Anima</i> and
      the books which follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. To this book, then, the Philosopher writes a preface in which he shows
      the order of procedure in natural science.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this preface he does two things. First he shows that it is necessary to
      begin with a consideration of principles. Secondly, where he says, ‘The
      natural way of doing this...’ (184 a 16), he shows that among principles,
      it is necessary to begin with the more universal principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      First he gives the following argument. In all sciences of which there are
      principles or causes or elements, understanding and science proceed from a
      knowledge of the principles, causes and elements. But the science which is
      about nature has principles, elements and causes. Therefore it is
      necessary in it to begin with a determination of principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he says ‘to understand’he has reference to definitions, and when he
      says ‘to have science’ he has reference to demonstrations. For as
      demonstrations are from causes, so also are definitions, since a complete
      definition is a demonstration differing only by position, as is said in
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, I:8.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, he speaks of principles or causes or elements, he does not
      intend to signify the same thing by each. For cause is wider in meaning
      than element. An element is a first component of a thing and is in it
      [i.e., in the composed], as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i>,V:3. Thus the
      letters, but not the syllables, are the elements of speech. But those
      things are called causes upon which things depend for their existence or
      their coming to be. Whence even that which is outside the thing, or that
      which is in it, though the thing is not first composed of it, can be
      called a cause. But it cannot be called an element. And thirdly principle
      implies a certain order in any progression. Whence something can be a
      principle which is not a cause, as that from which motion begins is a
      principle of motion, butis not a cause, and a point is a principle of a
      line but not a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, by principle he seems to mean moving causes and agents in
      which, more than in others, there is found an order of some progression.
      By causes he seems to mean formal and final causes upon which things most
      of all depend for their existence and their coming to be. By elements he
      means properly the first material causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover he uses these terms disjunctively and not copulatively in order
      to point out that not every science demonstrates through. all the causes.
      For mathematics demonstrates only through the formal cause. Metaphysics
      demonstrates through the formal and final causes principally but also
      through the agent. Natural science, however, demonstrates through all the
      causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then proves from common opinion the first proposition of his argument.
      This is also proven in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> I:2. For a man
      thinks that he knows something when he knows all its causes from the first
      to the last. The meaning here of causes, principles, and elements is
      exactly the same as we have explained above, even though the Commentator
      disagrees. Furthermore Aristotle says, ‘...as far as its simplest
      elements’ (184 a 14), because that which is last in knowledge is matter.
      For matter is for the sake of form, and form is from the agent for the
      sake of the end, unless it itself is the end. For example, we say that a
      saw has teeth in order to cut, and these teeth ought to be made of iron so
      they will be apt for cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Next where he says, ‘The natural way of doing this...’(184 a 16), he
      shows that among principles it is necessary to treat the more universal
      ones first, And he shows this first by means of an argument, and secondly,
      by an “ample, where he says, for it is a whole (184 a 25 #9).
    </p>
    <p>
      First he gives the following argument. It is natural for us to proceed in
      knowing from those things which are better known to us to those which are
      better known by nature. But the things which are better known to us are
      confused, such as the universals. Therefore it is necessary for us to
      proceed from universals to singulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. For purposes of clarifying the first proposition he makes the point
      that things which are better known to us and things which are better known
      according to nature are not the same. Rather those things which are better
      known according to nature are less known to us. And because the natural
      way or order of learning is that we should come to that which is unknown
      by us from that which is known by us, it is necessary for us to arrive at
      the better known in nature from the better known to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be noted, however, that that which is known by nature and that
      which is known simply mean the same. Those things are better known simply
      which are in themselves better known. But those things are better known in
      themselves which have more being, because each thing is knowable insofar
      as it is being. However, those beings are greater which are greater in
      act. Whence these are the most knowable by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      For us, however, the converse is true because we proceed in understanding
      from potency to act. Our knowledge begins from sensible things which are
      material and intelligible in potency. Whence these t ngs are known by us
      before the separated substances, which are better known according to
      nature, as is clear in <i>Metaphysics</i>, II:2.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not, therefore, say known by nature as if nature knew these
      things, but because they are better known in themselves and according to
      their proper natures. And he says better known and more certain, because
      in the sciences not just any kind of knowledge is sought, but a certain
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next in order to understand the second proposition, it must be known that
      those things are here called ‘confused’ which contain in themselves
      something potential and indistinct. And because to know something
      indistinctly is a mean between pure potency and perfect act, so it is that
      while our intellect proceeds from potency to act, it knows the confused
      before it knows the distinct. But it has complete science in act when it
      arrives, through resolution, at a distinct knowledge of the principles and
      elements. And this is the reason why the confused is known by us before
      the distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      That universals are confused is clear. For universals contain in
      themselves their species in potency. And whoever knows something in the
      universal knows it indistinctly. The knowledge, however, becomes distinct
      when each of the things which are contained in potency in the universal is
      known in act. For he who knows animal does not know the rational except in
      potency. Thus knowing something in potency is prior to knowing it in act.
      Therefore, according to this order of learning, in which we proceed from
      potency to act, we know animal before we know man.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It would seem, however, that this is contrary to what the Philosopher
      says in <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, I:2, namely, that singulars are better
      known to us, whereas the universals are better known by nature or simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must be understood that there he takes as singulars the individual
      sensible things themselves, which are better known to us because the
      knowledge of sense, which is of singulars, does precede in us the
      knowledge of the intellect, which is of universals. And because
      intellectual knowledge is more perfect, and because the universals are
      intelligible in act, whereas the singulars are not (since they are
      material), the universals are better known simply and according to nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, by singulars he means not the individuals themselves, but
      the species. And these are better known by nature, existing more
      perfectly, as it were, and being known with a distinct knowledge. But the
      genera are known by us first, being known, as it were, confusedly and in
      potency.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be known, however, that the Commentator explains this passage in
      another way. He says that in the passage beginning, ‘The natural way of
      doing this...’ (184 a 16), the Philosopher wishes to explain the method of
      demonstration of this science, namely, that this science demonstrates
      through the effect and what is posterior according to nature. Hence what
      is said here is to be understood of the progression in demonstration and
      not of the progression in determination. Then in the passage where
      Aristotle says, ‘Now what is plain to us...’(184 a 22), he intends to make
      clear (according to the Commentator) what things are better known to us
      and what is better known by nature, i.e., things which are composed of the
      simple, understanding ‘confused’ to mean ‘composed’. Finally, then, he
      concludes, as if to a corollary, that we must proceed from the more
      universal to the less universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that his explanation is not suitable, because he does not join
      the whole passage to one intention. Moreover the Philosopher does not
      intend to set forth the mode of demonstration of this science here,
      because he will do this in Book II according to his order of treatment.
      Furthermore, the confused should not be taken to mean composed, but rather
      to mean indistinct. For nothing could be concluded from such universals
      because genera are not composed of species.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Next, where he says, ‘... for it is a whole...’ (184 a 25), he
      clarifies his position with three examples. The first of these is taken
      from the integral sensible whole. He says that since the sensible whole is
      better known to the sense, then, the intelligible whole is also better
      known to the intellect. But the universal is a sort of intelligible whole,
      because it comprehends many as parts, namely, its inferiors. Therefore the
      universal is better known to us intellectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would seem that this proof is not effective, because he uses whole
      and part and comprehension equivocally.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it must be said that the integral whole and the universal agree in
      that each is confused and indistinct. For just as he who apprehends a
      genus does not apprehend the species distinctly, but in potency only, so
      also he who apprehends a house does not yet distinguish its parts. Whence
      it is that a whole is first known to us as confused. This applies to both
      of these wholes. However, to be composed is not common to each whole.
      Whence it is clear that Aristotle significantly said ‘confused’ above and
      not ‘composed’.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Next where he says, ‘Much the same thing...’ (184 b 9), he gives
      another example taken from the integral intelligible whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that which is defined is related to the things defining it as a kind
      of integral whole, insofar as the things defining it are in act in that
      which is defined. But he who apprehends a name, for example, man or
      circle, does not at once distinguish the defining principles. Whence it is
      that the name is, as it were, a sort of whole and is indistinct, whereas
      the definition divides into singulars, i.e., distinctly sets forth the
      principles of that which is defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, seems to be contrary to what he said above. For the things
      which define would seem to be more universal, and these, he said, were
      first known by us. Furthermore, if that which is defined were better known
      to us than the things which define, we would not grasp that which is
      defined through the definition, for we grasp nothing except through that
      which is better known to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must be said that the things which define are in themselves known
      to us before that which is defined, but we know the thing which is defined
      before we know that these are the things which define it. Thus we know
      animal and rational before we know man. But man is known confusedly before
      we know that animal and rational are the things which define man.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Next where he says, ‘Similarly a child...’ (184 b 11), he gives the
      third example taken from the more universal sensible. For as the more
      universal intelligible is first known to us intellectually, for example,
      animal is known before man, so the more common sensible is first known to
      us according to sense, for example, we know this animal before we know
      this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I say first according to sense both with reference to place and with
      reference to time. This is true according to place because, when someone
      is seen at a distance, we perceive him to be a body before we perceive
      that he is an animal, and animal before we perceive him to be a man, and
      finally we perceive that he is Socrates. And in the same way with
      reference to time, a boy apprehends this individual as some man before he
      apprehends this man, Plato, who is his father. And this is what he says:
      children at first call all men fathers and all women mothers, but later
      they determine, that is, they know each determinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this it is clearly shown that we know a thing confusedly before we
      know it distinctly.<br />

            THE OPINIONS OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF
            NATURE AND OF BEINGS. IT DOES NOT PERTAIN TO NATURAL SCIENCE TO
            DISPROVE SOME OF THESE OPINIONS</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          12. Having completed the preface in which it was shown that natural
          science ought to begin with the more universal principles, here,
          according to the order already stated, he begins to pursue those
          matters which pertain to natural science.
        </p>
        <p>
          This discussion is divided into two parts. In the first part he treats
          the universal principles of natural science. In the second part he
          treats mobile being in common (which is what he intends to treat in
          this book).’ This is taken up in Book III, where he says, ‘Nature has
          been defined...’ (200 b 12; L1).
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part is divided into two parts. First he treats the
          principles of the subject of this science, that is, the principles of
          mobile being as such. Secondly he treats the principles of the
          doctrine. This he does in Book II, where he says, ‘Of things that
          exist...’ (192 b 8; L1).
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part is divided into two parts. First he considers the
          opinions others have had concerning the common principles of mobile
          being. Secondly he seeks the truth concerning them, where he says,
          ‘All thinkers, then, agree...’ (188 a 18; L10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes three points. First he sets forth
          the different opinions of the ancient philosophers concerning the
          common principles of nature. Secondly, where he says, ‘Now to
          investigate...’ (184 b 25 #15), he shows that it does not pertain to
          natural science to pursue some of these opinions. Thirdly, where he
          says, ‘The most pertinent question...’ (185 a 20; L3), he considers
          these opinions, showing their falsity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he sets forth the
          different opinions of the philosophers concerning the principles of
          nature. Secondly, where he says, ‘A similar inquiry is made...’ (184 b
          23 #14), he shows that this same diversity exists with reference to
          the opinions of the philosophers concerning beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. He says, therefore, first of all, that it is necessary that there
          be one principle of nature or many. And each position has claimed the
          opinions of the philosophers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of them, indeed, held that there is one principle, others held
          that there are many. And of those who held that there is one
          principle, some hbld that it was immobile, as did Parmenides and
          Melissus, whose opinion he will examine below. Some, however, held
          that it was mobile, as did. the natural philosophers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these, some held that air was the principle of all natural things,
          as Diogenes; others that it was water, as Thales; others that it was
          fire, as Heraclitus; and still others some mean between air and water,
          such as vapour.
        </p>
        <p>
          But none of those who held that there was only one principle said that
          it was earth because of its density. For they held that principles of
          this sort were mobile, because they said that other things come to be
          through the rarefication and condensation of certain of these
          principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of those who held the principles to be many, some held them to be
          finite, others held that they were infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of those who held that they were finite (although more than one) some
          held that there were two, i.e., fire and earth, as Parmenides will say
          below [L 10]. Others held that there were three, i.e., fire, air and
          water (for ‘they thought earth to be in some way composed because of
          its density). Others, however, held that there were four, as
          Empedocles did, or even some other number, because even Empedocles
          himself along with the four elements posited two other principles,
          namely, friendship and strife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who held that there was an infinite plurality of principles had
          a diversity of opinions. For Democritus held that indivisible bodies
          which are called atoms are the principles of all things. And he held
          that bodies of this sort were all of one genus according to nature,
          but that they differed according to figure and form, and that they not
          only differed but even had contrariety among themselves. For he held
          three contrarieties: one according to figure, which is between the
          curved and the straight, another according to order, which is the
          prior and the posterior, and another according to position, namely,
          before and behind, above and below, to the right and to the left. And
          so he held that from these bodies existing of one nature different
          things come to be according to the diversity of the figure, position
          and order of the atoms. In this opinion, then, he gives us some basis
          for understanding the opposing opinion, namely that of Anaxagoras who
          held that the principles were infinite, but not of one genus according
          to nature. For he held that the principles of nature were the
          infinite, smallest parts of flesh and bone and other such things, as
          will be made clear below.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be noted, however, that he did not divide these many
          principles into mobile and immobile. For none of these who held that
          the first principles were many held that they were immobile. For since
          an place contrariety in the principles, and since it is natural for
          contraries to change, immobility could not stand with a plurality of
          principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. Secondly, at the point where he says, ‘A similar inquiry is
          made...’ (184 b 23; L9), he shows that there is the same diversity of
          opinions concerning beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that in like manner the physicists, when inquiring about those
          things which are, i.e., about beings, wondered how many there are,
          i.e., whether there is one or many; and if many, whether finite or
          infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the reason for this is that the ancient physicists did not know
          any cause but the material cause (although they touched lightly upon
          the other causes). Rather they held that the natural forms were
          accidents, as the forms of artificial things are. Since, therefore,
          the whole substance of artificial things is their matter, so it
          followed, according to them, that the whole substance of natural
          things would be their matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence those who held one principle only, for example, air, thought
          that other beings were air according to their substance. And the same
          is true of the other opinions. Hence Aristotle says that the
          physicists seek what is in thatfrom which things are, i.e., in
          inquiring about principles they sought the material causes from which
          beings are said to be. Whence it is clear that when they inquire about
          beings, whether they are one or many, their inquiry concerns the
          material principles which are called elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Next where he says, ‘Now to investigate...’ (184 b 25), he shows
          that it does not pertain to natural science to disprove some of these
          opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And concerning this he makes two points. First he shows that it does
          not pertain’to natural science to disprove the opinion of Parmenides
          and Melissus. Secondly, where he says, ‘At the same time the holders
          of the theory...’ (185 a 18),2 he gives a reason why it is useful to
          the present work to disprove this opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he shows that it
          does not pertain to natural science to disprove the aforesaid opinion.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘... or like refuting...’ (185 a 8 #17), he
          shows that it does not pertain to natural science to resolve the
          arguments which are brought forth to prove this opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          He establishes his first point with two arguments, the second, of
          which begins where he says, ‘To inquire therefore...’ (185 a 5 #16).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, that it does not pertain to natural science to
          undertake a thorough consideration of the opinion whether being is one
          and immobile. For it has already been shown that there is no
          difference, according to the intention of the ancient philosophers,
          whether we hold one immobile principle or one immobile being.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that it should not pertain to natural science to disprove this
          opinion he shows as follows. It does not pertain to geometry to bring
          forth reasons against an argument which destroys its principles.
          Rather, this either pertains to some other particular science (if,
          indeed, geometry is subalternated to some particular science, such as
          music is subalternated to arithmetic, to which it pertains to dispute
          against any position denying the principles of music), or it pertains
          to a common science such as logic or metaphysics. But the aforesaid
          position destroys the principles of nature. For if there is only one
          being, and if this being is immobile, such that from it others cannot
          come to be, then the very nature of a principle is taken away. For
          every principle is either a principle of some thing or of some things.
          Therefore, if we posit a principle, a multiplicity follows, because
          one is the principle and the other is that of which it is the
          principle. Whoever, therefore, denies multiplicity removes principles.
          Therefore natural science ought not to argue against this position.
        </p>
        <p>
          16. Next where he says, ‘To inquire therefore...’(185 a 5), he shows
          the sar
        </p>
        <p>
          gp point with another argument. It is not required of any science that
          it bring forth arguments against manifestly false and improbable
          opinions. For to worry about one who offers positions contrary to the
          opinions of the wise is stupid, as is said in Topics, I:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, that to undertake a thorough consideration of the
          question whether being is one, and hence immobile, is like arguing
          against any other improbable position. For example, it is like arguing
          against the position of Heraclitus, who said that all things are
          always moved and that nothing is true; or against the position of one
          who would say that the whole of being is one man, which position,
          indeed, would be altogether improbable. And indeed whoever holds being
          to be only one immobile thing is forced to hold that the whole of
          being is some one thing. It is clear, therefore, that it does not
          belong to natural science to argue against this position.
        </p>
        <p>
          17. Next when he says, ‘... or like refuting...’ (185 a 8), he shows
          that it does not belong to natural science even to resolve the
          arguments of the aforementioned philosophers. And this for two
          reasons, the second of which begins where he says, ‘We physicists...’
          (185 a 13 #18).
        </p>
        <p>
          First he proves his position by pointing out that it is not incumbent
          upon any science to resolve sophistic arguments which have an obvious
          defect of form or matter. He says that to deal with improbable
          arguments is like solving a contentious or sophistic argument. But
          each argument of both Melissus and Parmenides is sophistic, for they
          err in matter, whence he says that they have accepted what is false,
          i.e., they assume false propositions, and they err in form, whence he
          says that they are not syllogizing. But the position of Melissus is
          much worse, i.e., more vain and foolish and does not cause any
          difficulty. This will be shown below [L 5]. Moreover, it is not
          inconsistent that given one inconsistency another should follow.
          Therefore it can be concluded that it is not required of the
          philosopher of nature that he resolve the arguments of this man.
        </p>
        <p>
          18. He sets forth the second argument for this where he says, ‘We
          physicists...’ (185 a 13). The argument is as follows. In natural
          science it is supposed that natural things are moved, either all or
          some of them. He says this because there is doubt whether some things
          are moved and how they are moved, for example, about the soul and the
          centre of the earth, and the pole of heaven, and about natural forms
          and other such things. But the fact that natural things are moved can
          be made clear from induction, for it is apparent to the sense that
          natural things are moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is as necessary that motion be supposed in natural science as it is
          necessary that nature be supposed. For motion is placed in the
          definition of nature, for nature is a principle of motion, as will be
          said below [II, L1].
        </p>
        <p>
          Having established this point, that motion is supposed in natural
          science, he proceeds further to prove his position as follows. Not A
          arguments must be resolved in any science, but only those which
          conclude to something false from the principles of that science. Any
          arguments which do not reach their conclusions from the principles of
          the science, but from the contraries of these principles, are not
          resolved in that science. He proves this by an example taken from
          geometry saying that it pertains to geometry to resolve the problem of
          squaring, i.e., the squaring of a circle by dissecting the
          circumference, because this method supposes nothing contrary to the
          principles of the science of geometry. For somebody wished to find a
          square equal to a circle by dividing the circumference of the circle
          into many parts and placing straight lines in each part. And so by
          finding some figure, which was rectilinear, equal to some of the
          figures which were contained by the dissections of the circumference
          and the cords (either many or all), he thought he had found a
          rectilinear figure equal to the whole circle, to which it was easy to
          find an equal square through the principles of geometry. And thus he
          thought that he was able to find a square equal to a circle. But he
          did not argue well enough, for although these dissections used up the
          whole circumference of the circle, the figures contained by the
          dissections of the circumference and the straight lines did not
          encompass the whole circular surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to resolve the square of Antiphon does not pertain to geometry,
          because he used principles contrary to those of geometry. For he
          described in a circle a certain rectilinear figure, for example, a
          square. And he divided in half the arcs by which the sides of the
          square were subtended. And from the points of dissection he led
          straight lines to all the angles of the square. And then there
          resulted in the circle a figure of eight angles, which more closely
          approached equality with the circle than the square. Then he again
          divided in half the arcs by which the sides of the octagon were
          subtended, and thus by leading straight lines from the points of
          dissection to the angles of this figure there resulted a figure of
          sixteen angles, which still further approached equality with the
          circle. Therefore, by always dividing the arcs and leading straight
          lines to the angles of the figure already existing there will arise a
          figure very near to equality with the circle. He said, then, that it
          was impossible to proceed to infinity in the dissection of arcs.
          Therefore, it was necessary to arrive at some rectilinear figure equal
          to the circle to which some square could be equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, because he supposed that an arc is not always divisible in half,
          which is contrary to the principles of geometry, it does not pertain
          to geometry to resolve an argument of this sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, because the arguments of Parmenides and Melissus suppose
          being to be immobile (as will be shown below [L5]), and since this is
          contrary to the principles supposed in natural science, it follows
          that it does not pertain to the natural philosopher to resolve
          arguments of this sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. Next where he says, ‘At the same time...’ (185 a 18), he states
          why he will argue against the aforementioned position. He says that
          because the philosophers mentioned above did speak of natural things,
          even though they did not create a problem (that is, in the sphere of
          natural science), it is useful for his present purpose to argue
          against opinions of this sort. For even though it does not pertain to
          natural science to argue against such positions, it does pertain to
          first philosophy.<br /></p

        <p>
          20. After he has set forth the opinions of the philosophers concerning
          principles, here Aristotle argues against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          First he argues against those who spoke unnaturally about nature.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘The physicists, on the other hand...’ (187 a
          11; L8 #53), he argues against those who spoke of nature in a natural
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he argues against
          the position of Melissus and Parmenides, and secondly against their
          arguments, where he says,’Further the arguments they use...’ (186 a 5;
          L5 #29). Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he
          argues against the position that ‘being is one’ by using an argument
          dealing with the ‘being’which is the subject in this proposition.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘Again, “one” itself...’(185 b 5 #22), he
          uses an argument dealing with the ‘one’ which is the predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. He says first that that which should be taken primarily as a
          principle in arguing against the aforesaid position is the fact that
          that which is, i.e., being, is said in many ways. For we must ask of
          those who say that being is one how they are using ‘being’: whether
          they take it for substance, or for quality, or for one of the other
          genera. And because substance is divided into the universal and the
          particular, i.e., into first and second substance, and further into
          many species, we must ask the following questions. Do they say that
          being is one as one man or as one horse, or as one soul, or as one
          quality, such as white or hot or some other such thing? For it makes a
          great difference which of these is said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, if being is one, it must either be substance and accident
          together, or it must be accident alone, or substance alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, however, it is substance and accident together, then being will
          not be one only, but two. Nor does it differ with reference to this
          whether substance and accident are together in one thing as one or as
          different.
        </p>
        <p>
          For even though they are together in one thing, they are not one
          simply, but one in subject. And so by positing substance with accident
          it follows that they are not one simply, but many.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, however, it is said that being is accident only and not substance,
          this is altogether impossible. For accident can in no way be without
          substance. For every accident is said of substance as of its subject,
          and the very definition of accident involves this.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, however, it is said that being is substance only without accident,
          then it follows that it would not be a quantity, for quantity is an
          accident. And this is contrary to the position of Melissus. For he
          held that being was infinite, whence it follows that it is quantity,
          because the infinite, properly speaking, does not exist except in
          quantity. And substance and quality and the like are not said to be
          infinite except accidentally insofar as they are, for instance,
          together with quantity. Since, then, Melissus held being to be
          infinite, he cannot hold that it is substance without quantity. If,
          therefore, being is substance and quantity together, it follows that
          being is not one only, but two. If, however, it is substance alone, it
          is not infinite, because it will not have magnitude or quantity. Hence
          what Melissus says, namely, that being is one, can in no way be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          22. Then where he says, ‘Again “one” itself...’ (185 b 5) he sets
          forth his second argument which deals with the ‘one’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he gives the argument.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘Even the more recent...’ (185 b 25; L4 #25),
          he shows how some have erred in the solution of this question.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says first that just as being is said in many ways, so also is one.
          And so we must consider in what way they say that all things are one.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ‘one’is used in three ways: either as the continuous is one, such
          as a line or a body, or as the indivisible is one, such as a point, or
          as those things are said to be one whose nature [ratio] or definition
          is one, as drink and wine are said to be one.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, therefore, he shows that we cannot say that all are one by
          continuity, because a continuum is in a certain respect many. For
          every continuum is divisible to infinity, and so contains many in
          itself as parts. Hence whoever holds that being is a continuum must
          hold that it is in a certain respect many.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is true, not only because of the number of the parts, but
          also because of the difference which seems to exist between the whole
          and the parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For there is a question whether the whole and the parts are one or
          many. And although this question, perhaps, does not pertain to the
          matter at hand, it is, nevertheless, worthy of consideration for its
          own sake. And here we consider not only the continuous whole, but also
          the contiguous whole whose parts are not continuous, such as the parts
          of a house which are one by contact and composition. It is clear that
          that which is a whole accidentally is the same as its parts. But this
          is not true of that which is a whole simply. For if that which is a
          whole simply the same as one of the parts, then for the same reason it
          would be the same as another of the parts. But things which are
          identical with the same thing are identical with each other. And thus
          it would follow that both parts, if they are held simply to be the
          same as the whole, would be identical with each other. Hence it would
          follow that the whole would be indivisible having no diversity of
          parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          23. Next where he says, ‘But to proceed...’ (185 b 18), he shows that
          it is impossible for all to be one as the indivisible is one. For that
          which is indivisible cannot be a quantity, since every quantity is
          divisible. As a’result of this it cannot be a quality, if it is
          understood that we are speaking of a quality which is founded upon
          quantity. And if it is not a quantity, it cannot be finite as
          Parmenides has said, nor can it be infinite as Melissus has said. For
          an indivisible terminus, such as a point, is an end and is not finite.
          For the finite and the infinite are found in quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          24. Next where he says, ‘But if all things...’ (185 b 19), he shows
          how it cannot be said that all things are one in definition [ratio].
          For if this were true, three absurdities would follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is that contraries would be one according to definition
          [ratio), so that the definitions of good and evil would be the same,
          just as Heraclitus held the definitions of contraries to be the same,.
          as is made clear in <i>Metaphysics</i>, IV:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second absurdity is that the definitions [ <i>ratio</i> ] of the
          good and the non-good would be the same, because non-good follows upon
          evil. And thus it would follow that the definitions of being and
          non-being would be the same. And it would also follow that all beings
          would not only be one being, as they hold, but also they would be
          non-being or nothing. For things which are one in definition are so
          related that they may be used interchangeably as predicates. Whence if
          being and nothing are one according to definition, then it follows,
          that if all are one being, all are nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third absurdity is that the different genera, such as quantity and
          quality, would be the same according to definition [ <i>ratio</i> ].
          He sets forth this absurdity where he says ‘... “to be of
          such-and-such a quality” is the same as “to be of such-and-such a
          size”’ (185 b 24).
        </p>
        <p>
          We must note however, that, as the Philosopher says in
          <i>Metaphysics</i>, IV:4, against those who deny principles there can
          be no unqualified demonstration which proceeds from what is more known
          simply. But we may use a demonstration to contradiction which proceeds
          from those things which are supposed by our adversary, which things
          are, for the time being, less known simply. And so the Philosopher, in
          this argument, uses many things which are less known than the fact
          that beings are many and not only one—the point about which he
          argues.<br /></p

            THE LATER PHILOSOPHERS ALSO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS SAME ERROR,
            NAMELY, THAT THE ONE AND THE MANY COULD NOT IN ANY WAY CONCUR</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          25. Having disproven the opinion of Parmenides and Melissus that being
          is one, the Philosopher here shows that certain later philosophers
          fell into difficulty on this very same problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parmenides and Melissus erred because they did not know how to
          distinguish the uses of the term ‘one’. Thus, what is one in a certain
          respect, they said was one simply. But the later philosophers, also
          not knowing how to distinguish the uses of the term ‘one’, thought it
          absurd that one and the same thing should be in some way one and many.
          Yet, being convinced by the arguments, they were forced to believe it.
          And so Aristotle says that the later philosophers were ‘disturbed’
          (that is, fell into a difficulty similar to that of the ancients,
          i.e., Parmenides and Melissus) lest they be forced to say that one and
          the same thing is one and many. Now this seemed absurd to both groups
          of philosophers. So the earlier philosophers, holding that all is one,
          rejected all multiplicity. The later philosophers, on the other hand,
          tried to remove multiplicity from anything they held to be one.
        </p>
        <p>
          26. Thus some, such as Lycophron, removed the verb is from
          propositions. They said that we must not say ‘man is white’ but rather
          ‘white man’. For they thought that man and. white were in some way
          one, otherwise white would not be predicated of man. And it seemed to
          them that the word ‘is’, since it is a verbal copula, must serve as a
          copula between two. And so, wishing to remove all multiplicity from
          that which is one, they said the verb ‘is’ must not be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because such speech seemed to be imperfect, and because an
          imperfect understanding was produced in the soul of him who heard if
          names were spoken without the addition of any verb, some, wishing to
          correct this, changed the mode of speech. They did not say ‘white man’
          because of the imperfection of this mode of speech. Nor did they say
          ‘man is white’ lest they give the impression that there is
          multiplicity. Rather they said ‘man whitened’,’ because by this
          expression ‘whitened’ [ <i>albari</i> ] a thing is not understood (as
          it seemed to them), but rather a certain change in the subject. And in
          like manner they said that we must not say ‘man is walking’ but ‘man
          walks’, lest by the addition of the verbal copula ‘is’ they make that
          which they thought to be one (i.e., white man) to be many, as if one
          and being were used in only one way and not in many.
        </p>
        <p>
          27. But this is false, For that which is one in one respect can be
          many in some other respect, as what is one in subject can be many in
          definition [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Thus the white and the musical are the
          same in subject but many in definition [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Hence it can
          be concluded that the one may be many.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may happen also in another way. That which is actually one as a
          whole may be many according to a division of parts. Whence the whole
          is one in its totality, but it has multiplicity of parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And although those who wished to remove the verb ‘is’ or alter it, as
          was said above [#26], found some solution to the objection that things
          could be one in subject and many in definition [ <i>ratio</i> ], they
          failed altogether to answer the objection that a thing may be one as a
          whole but many in its parts. They still believed it to be something of
          an absurdity that the one should be many.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not absurd if the one and the many are not taken as
          opposites. For the one in act and the many in act are opposed, but the
          one in act and the many in potency are not opposed. And because of
          this he adds that ‘one’ is said in many ways, i.e., one in potency and
          one in act. And so nothing prohibits the same thing from being one in
          act and many in potency, as is clear with regard to the whole and the
          parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          28. Finally he draws the conclusion which he had uppermost in mind,
          namely, that it is clear from the foregoing arguments that it is
          impossible for all beings to be one.<br /></p

            THE ARGUMENT OF MELISSUS IS ANSWERED</b
          >
        </center>
        <p>
          29. Having disproved the position of Parmenides and Melissus, here the
          Philosopher begins to answer their arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes three points. First he shows how their
          arguments are to be answered. Secondly, where he says, ‘The fallacy of
          Melissus...’ (186 a 10 #31), he answers the argument of Melissus.
          Thirdly, where he says,’The same kind of argument...’ (186 a 23; L6
          #36), he answers the argument of Parmenides.
        </p>
        <p>
          30. He says that it is not difficult to answer the arguments with
          which Parmenides and Melissus reasoned. For each syllogized
          sophistically both in that, they assumed false propositions and in
          that they did not observe the proper form of the syllogism. But the
          argument of Melissus is the more gross, that is, more vain and
          foolish, and does not cause any difficulty. For he assumed what is
          contrary to natural principles and what is manifestly false, namely,
          that being is not generated. And it is not a serious matter, granting
          one absurdity, if another should follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          31. Next when he says, ‘The fallacy of Melissus...’ (186 a 10), he
          answers the argument of Melissus, which argument is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is made has a beginning. Therefore what is not made has no
          beginning. But being is not made. Therefore it has no beginning, and
          as a result has no end. But what has neither beginning nor end is
          infinite. Therefore being is infinite. But what is infinite is
          immobile, for it would not have outside itself that by which it would
          be moved. Furthermore what is infinite is one, because if there were
          many there must necessarily be something outside the infinite.
          Therefore being is one and infinite and immobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, in order to show that being is not generated, Melissus
          used a certain argument which some natural philosophers also used.
          Aristotle gives this argument below, near the end of Book I [L14
          #120].
        </p>
        <p>32. Aristotle disproves this argument of Melissus on four counts.</p>
        <p>
          He argues first against the statement of Melissus that if what is made
          has a beginning, then what is not made has no beginning. This does not
          follow. Rather it is a fallacy of consequent. For he argues from the
          destruction of the antecedent to the destruction of the consequent,
          whereas the correct form of argumentation would be the converse.
          Whence it does not follow that if a thing which is made has a
          beginning, then that which is not made does not have a beginning. The
          correct conclusion would be that if a thing does not have a beginning,
          then it is not made.
        </p>
        <p>
          33. Secondly, where he says, ‘Then this also is absurd...’ (186 a 13),
          he disproves the argument under discussion with reference to the
          inference that if something has no beginning, then it is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ‘beginning’ may be taken in two ways. In one way we speak of a
          beginning,.of time and of generation. And this meaning of beginning is
          taken when it is said that what is made has a beginning or what is not
          made has no beginning. In another sense, beginning is the beginning of
          a thing or a magnitude. And in this sense it would follow that if a
          thing has no beginning, then it is infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence it is clear that Melissus uses the term ‘beginning’ as if it
          had one meaning only. Hence Aristotle says that it is absurd to say
          that every case of beginning is the beginning of a thing, that is, of
          a magnitude, so that the beginning of time and of generation is not
          another meaning of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
          However a simple and instantaneous generation (which is the induction
          of a form in matter) does not have a beginning. For of a simple
          generation there is no beginning. But there is a beginning for a whole
          alteration whose terminus is a generation, since this would not be an
          instantaneous change. And because of this terminus this is sometimes
          called a generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          34. Thirdly, where he says, ‘Again does it follow...’ (186 a 15), he
          disproves the above position with reference to its third inference,
          namely, that because being is infinite, it is immobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows in two ways that this does not follow. First it does not
          follow in regard to local motion. For a part of water could be moved
          with in water so that it is not moved to any extrinsic place. In this
          case it would be moved by a joining and separation of the parts. And
          likewise, if the whole infinite body were water, it would be possible
          for the parts of it to be moved within the whole and not proceed
          outside the place of the whole. Again he disproves this with reference
          to the motion of alteration. For nothing prevents the infinite from
          being altered either as a whole or in its parts, for it would not be
          necessary to posit something outside the infinite to account for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          35. Fourthly, where he says,’But further...’(186 a 19), he disproves
          the given argument with reference to its fourth inference by which it
          is concluded that, if being is infinite, it is one. For it does not
          follow that it is one according to species, but rather that it is one
          according to matter, just as some of the philosophers of nature have
          held that all things are one according to matter, but not according to
          species. For it is obvious that man and horse differ in species, and
          in like manner contraries differ from each other in species.<br /></p

            THE ARGUMENT OF PARMENIDES IS ANSWERED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          36. Having disproved the argument of Melissus, here the Philosopher
          disproves the argument of Parmenides.
        </p>
        <p>
          First he disproves the argument. Secondly, where he says, ‘Some
          thinkers did...’(187 a 1; L7 #47ff.), he rejects what has been said by
          some who have argued badly against Parmenides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he sets forth the
          ways in which the argument of Parmenides is to be refuted. Secondly,
          where he says,’His assumption...’(186 a 24 #39), he resolves the
          argument in these ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          37. Concerning the first part it must be known that the argument of
          Parmenides was as follows, as is clear from <i>Metaphysics</i>, I:5.
          Whatever is other than being is non-being. But what is non-being is
          nothing. Therefore whatever is other than being is nothing. But being
          is one, therefore whatever is other than one is nothing. Therefore
          there is only one being. And from this he concluded that it would be
          immobile, because it would not have anything by which it would be
          moved, nor would there be anything outside of it by which it would be
          moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear, moreover, from their very arguments that Parmenides
          considered being under the aspect [ <i>secundum rationem</i> ] of
          being, and so held it to be one and finite; whereas Melissus
          considered being from the point of view of matter. For Melissus
          considered being insofar as it is made or not made. And so he held
          being to be one and infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          38. Aristotle says, therefore, that the same approach must be used
          against the argument of Parmenides that was used against the argument
          of Melissus. For as the argument of Melissus was answerdd on the basis
          that he assumed false propositions and did not draw his conclusions
          according to the correct form of the syllogism, so also the argument
          of Parmenides is answered partly because he assumed false propositions
          and partly because he did not draw his conclusions correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, however, that there are also other appropriate ways of
          arguing against Parmenides. For it is possible to argue against
          Parmenides from the propositions which he assumed and which are in a
          certain respect true and probable. But Melissus proceeded from what
          was false and improbable, for example, that being is not generated.
          Because of this, Aristotle did not argue against Melissus from the
          propositions which he assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          39. Next where he says, ‘His assumption...’ (186 a 24), he follows the
          procedures just mentioned. First according to the first way, and
          secondly according to the second way, where he says, ‘His conclusion
          does not follow...’ (186 a 25 #40).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that Parmenides assumed false propositions
          because he held that what is, i.e., being, is used simply, i.e., in
          one way. Whereas in fact it is used in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          For being is used in one way for substance, in another way for
          accident; and the latter is used in many ways according to the
          different genera. Being also can be used commonly for substance and
          accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it is clear that the propositions assumed by Parmenides are true
          in one sense and false in another. For when it is said that whatever
          is other than being is non-being, this is true if being is taken, as
          it were, commonly for substance and accident. If, however, being is
          taken for accident alone or for substance alone, this is false, as
          will be shown below [#42-43].
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise when he says that being is one, this is true if being is
          taken for some one substance or for some one accident. But this will
          not be true in the sense that whatever is other than that being is
          non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          40. Next where he says, ‘His conclusion does not follow...’ (186 a
          25), he follows the second method of answering the argument, i.e.,
          that the argument of Parmenides does not draw its conclusion according
          to proper form.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows this first in an example. And secondly, where he says, ‘It is
          necessary for him...’ (186 a 33 #41), he adapts this example to the
          problem at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that it can be seen that the argument of
          Parmenides does not draw its conclusion properly because of the fact
          that the form of argumentation used is not efficacious in every
          matter. And this could not be true if a proper form of argumentation
          were used. For if we take ‘white’ in the place of ‘being’, and if we
          say that ‘white’ signifies one thing only and is not used equivocally,
          and if we say that whatever is other than white is non-white, and
          whatever is non-white is nothing, then it will not follow that white
          would be one only. For it will not be necessary that all white things
          are one continuum. Or, to put it differently, white will not
          necessarily be one by continuity, i.e., from the fact that white is a
          continuum, it will not be one simply. For a continuum is in a certain
          respect many, as was said above [L3 #22].
        </p>
        <p>
          And in like manner white will not be one in definition [
          <i>ratio</i> ], for the white and that which is receptive of the white
          are different in definition [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Furthermore there will
          not be something other than white, as it were, separated from it. For
          the white is not other than that which is receptive of it because the
          white is separable from that which is receptive of it, but because the
          definitions [ <i>ratio</i> ] of the white and of that which is
          receptive of it are different. But. it was not yet known at the time
          of Parmenides that something could be one in subject and many in
          definition [ <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          41. Next where he says, ‘It is necessary for him...’ (186 a 33), he
          adapts this example to the matter at hand in order to show how what he
          has said of the white also applies to being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he shows that it does not
          follow that being is one simply. For subject and accident are
          different according to definition [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Secondly, where he
          says, ‘In particular then...’ (186 b 13 #44), he shows that this does
          not follow because of the multiplicity of parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he shows that
          when it is said that ‘whatever is other than being is non-being’, this
          ‘being’ cannot be taken to mean accident alone. Secondly, where he
          says, ‘If, then, substance...’ (186 b 4 #43), he shows that this
          ‘being’ cannot be taken to mean substance alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          42. He says, therefore, first that when it is said that ‘whatever is
          other than being is non-being’, if ‘being’ is said to signify one
          thing, then it will be necessary that it signify not some one being or
          what is predicated of some one thing. Rather it will signify what
          truly is, i.e., substance, and it will signify what is truly one,
          i.e., the indivisible. For if being were to signify accident, then,
          since accident would be predicated of a subject, the subject could not
          be that to which the accident, which is called being, occurs. For if
          whatever is other than being is non-being (i.e., other than accident),
          and if the subject is other than the accident, which is here said to
          be being, then it follows that the subject is nonbeing. And so when
          accident, which is being, is predicated of the subject which is
          non-being, it follows that being is predicated of non-being. Hence,
          Aristotle concludes, ‘Something, therefore, which is not win be’ (186
          b 1), that is, it will follow that non-being is being. This, however,
          is impossible.. For what is first of all assumed in the sciences is
          that contradictories are not to be predicated of each other, as is
          said in <i>Metaphysics</i>, IV:7. Whence he concludes that if anything
          is truly being, as is supposed in the proposition ‘whatever is other
          than being is nonbeing’, it follows that it is not an accident
          inhering in something else. For in this case its subject would not be
          a being. That is, this subject would not have the nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ] of being, unless being should signify many, so that
          each of the many would be a being. But it was assumed by Parmenides
          that being signifies one only.
        </p>
        <p>
          43. Next where he says, ‘If, then, substance...’(186 b 4), after he
          has concluded that ‘being’ cannot refer to accident when it is said
          that ‘whatever is other than being is non-being’, he shows further
          that ‘being’ cannot refer to substance either. Whence he says that if
          what truly is does not happen to something, but other things happen to
          it, then in the proposition ‘whatever is other than being is
          non-being’, it is necesstuy that ‘what truly is’, i.e., substance, be
          signified by being rather than by non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this cannot stand. For let it be held that that which truly is,
          i.e., substance, is white. But white is not that which truly is. For
          it has already been said that that which truly is cannot happen to
          something. And this is so because what is not truly, i.e., what is not
          substance, is not that which is, i.e., is not being. But what is other
          than being, i.e., other than substance, is non-being. Hence it follows
          that white is non-being, not only in the sense that it is not this
          being, as a man is not this being which is an ass, but also in the
          sense that it is not in any way. For he says that whatever is other
          than being is non-being, and what is nonbeing is nothing. From this,
          therefore, it follows that non-being would be predicated of that which
          truly is, because white is predicated of substance, which truly is.
          And white does not signify being, as was said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence it follows that being is non-being. And this indeed is
          impossible, because one contradictory is not predicated of another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence, if in order to avoid this inconsistency, we say that true
          being signifies not only the subject, but also the white itself, it
          follows that being will signify many. And thus there will not be only
          one being, for subject and accident are many according to nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          44. Next where he says, ‘In particular then...’ (189 b 13), he shows,
          because of the multiplicity of parts, that it does not follow from the
          argument of Parmenides that there is only one being. He shows this
          first with reference to quantitative parts and secondly with reference
          to the parts of definition [ <i>ratio</i> ], where he says, ‘Substance
          is plainly divisible...’ (186 b 14).1
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that if being signifies only one thing, not
          only will it not be accident with subject, but neither will it be a,
          magnitude. For every magnitude is divisible into parts. But the
          natures [ <i>ratio</i> ] of each of the parts are not the same, but
          different. Whence it follows that this one being is not a corporeal
          substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          45. Secondly, where he says, ‘Substance is plainly divisible...’ (186
          b 14), he shows that this being cannot be a definable substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For in a definition it is clear that that which truly is, i.e., the
          substance, is divided into many, each one of which is what truly is,
          i.e. substance, and each one of which has a different nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ]. Let us suppose that man is one thing which truly is.
          Since man is a two-footed animal, it is necessary that animal be and
          that two-footed be. And each of these will be what truly is, i.e.,
          substance. And if they are not substances, they are accidents, either
          of man or of some other thing. But it is impossible that they be
          accidents of man.
        </p>
        <p>And to make this clear he assumes two things.</p>
        <p>
          First he assumes that ‘accident’ is used in two ways. One type of
          accident is separable, and as such can be in something or not in it,
          for example, to sit. Another type of accident is inseparable and
          <i>per se</i>. And this latter is the accident in whose definition is
          placed the subject in which it is. For example, the snub is a
          <i>per se</i> accident of nose, because nose is placed in the
          definition of the snub. For the snub is a curved nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second thing which he assumes is that if certain things are placed
          in the definition of that which is defined, or in the definition of
          the things on which the definition depends, then it is impossible that
          the whole definition of that which is defined be placed in the
          definition of these certain things. Thus two-footed is placed in the
          definition of man, and certain other things are placed in the
          definition of two-footed or animal, from which [i.e., from two-footed
          and animal] man is defined. Hence it is impossible that man be placed
          in the definition of two-footed or in the definition of any of the
          things which fall in the definition of two-footed or of animal.
          Otherwise we would have a circular definition, and one and the same
          thing would be both prior and posterior, better known and less known.
          For every definition is from the prior and the better known, as is
          said in <i>Topics</i>, VI:4. And for the same reason, when white is
          placed in the definition of white man, it is impossible for white man
          to be placed in the definition of white.
        </p>
        <p>
          These things having been assumed, the argument is as follows. If
          twofooted is an accident of man, it must be either a separable
          accident (and thus it could happen that man is not two-footed, which
          is impossible) or an inseparable accident (and thus it will be
          necessary that man be placed in the definition of two-footed). But
          this also is impossible, because twofooted is placed in the definition
          of man. It is impossible, therefore, that two-footed be an accident of
          man. For the same reason animal cannot be an accident. If, however, it
          is said that both are accidents of something else, it would follow
          that man also would be an accident of something else. But this is
          impossible, for it has already been said above that that which truly
          is is an accident of nothing. But man was assumed to be that which
          truly is, as is clear from what was said above.
        </p>
        <p>
          That it would follow that man would be an accident of another if
          animal and two-footed were accidents of another, he shows as follows.
          What is said of both animal and two-footed taken separately may be
          said of them taken together, i.e., two-footed animal. And what is said
          of two-footed animal may be said of that which is from them, i.e.,
          man, ecause man is nothing other than a two-footed animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it is clear that if being is held to be one only, we cannot
          hold that there are quantitative parts, or parts of a magnitude, or
          parts of a definition. Therefore it follows that every being is
          numerically indivisible. Otherwise, while holding being to be one, we
          would be forced to posit a multiplicity because of the parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          46. the Commentator, however, says that in the passage beginning, ‘But
          we must assume...’ (186 b 33), Aristotle sets forth the second
          argument of Parmenides to show that being is one. And this argument is
          as follows. A being which is one is substance and not accident (and by
          substance he means body). If, however, that body is divided into two
          halves, it will follow that being is predicated of each half and of
          the union of the two. And this either proceeds to infinity, which is
          impossible in itself, or else the being is divided into points. But
          this also is impossible. Hence it follows that being is an indivisible
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this exposition is fabricated and contrary to the intention of
          Aristotle, as is sufficiently clear from an examination of the letter
          of the text according to the first explanation.<br /></p

            HE DISPROVES THE POSITION OF THOSE WHO SAID THAT NON-BEING IS
            SOMETHING</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          47. After the Philosopher has disproved the argument of Parmenides by
          bringing forth certain inconsistencies found in it, he here disproves
          the position of those who have conceded these inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he sets forth their
          position. Secondly, he disproves it where he says, ‘But obviously it
          is not...’ (187 a 3 #50).
        </p>
        <p>
          48. It must be noted first that the Philosopher used two arguments
          above [L6 #36ff.] against the argument of Parmenides. He used one to
          show that, because of the diversity of subject and accident, it does
          not follow from the argument of Parmenides that all is one. This
          argument led to the absurdity that non-being is being, as is clear
          from what was said above. The other argument proceeded to show that
          the conclusion that an is one does not follow because, if it were a
          magnitude, it would follow that this magnitude is indivisible. For if
          it were divisible, there would be some sort of multiplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          49. The Platonists, however, gave in to each argument, conceding the
          impossibilities to which they led.
        </p>
        <p>
          They accepted the first argument which led to the conclusion that
          non-being would be being. Suppose that someone were to say that being
          signifies one thing, either substance alone or accident alone, and
          because of this he might also wish to say that all things are one-in
          regard to this argument, I say, they accepted [the conclusion] that
          non-being would be being.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Plato said that accident is non-being. And because of this it is
          said in <i>Metaphysics</i>, VI:2 that Plato held that sophistry dealt
          with nonbeing, because it treated most of all those things which are
          predicated per accidens. Therefore Plato, understanding being to be
          substance, conceded the first proposition of Parmenides who said that
          whatever is other than being is non-being. For Plato held that
          accident, which is other than substance, was non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not, however, concede the second proposition, namely, that
          whatever is non-being is nothing. For although he would say that
          accident is non-being, he did not say that accident is nothing, but
          rather that it is something. And because of this, according to Plato,
          it does not follow that being is one only.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Plato, when he made magnitudes to be indivisible by dissection,
          that is, when he said that a magnitude is terminated in indivisibles
          by division, did assent to the other argument which led to the
          conclusion that a magnitude would be indivisible. For he held that
          bodies are resolved into surfaces, and surfaces into lines, and lines
          into indivisibles, as is clear in <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>, III:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          50. Next where he says, ‘But obviously...’ (187 a 3), he disproves the
          above position in regard to the point that Plato conceded, namely,
          that non-being is something. In regard to the other point, namely,
          that Plato held that there are indivisible magnitudes, this is
          disproved in its proper place in the following books of natural
          science [VI L1].
        </p>
        <p>
          He disproves the first point in two ways. First he shows that it does
          not follow from the argument of Plato that non-being is something.
          Secondly, he disproves Plato’s remark that unless we hold this (i.e.,
          that the non-being which is accident is something), it will follow
          that all is one. He does this where he says, ‘To say that all
          things...’ (187 a 7 #52).
        </p>
        <p>
          51. He says, therefore, first that the argument by which Plato
          concluded that being signifies one clearly does not follow. For he
          held that being is a genus and is predicated univocally of all things
          by a participation in the first being. And further he held that
          contradictories cannot be true at the same time. From these two points
          he thought that it followed that non-being is not nothing, but
          something. For if being signifies the one, which is substance, it will
          be necessary that whatever is not substance is non-being. For if it
          were being, then since being does not signify anything but substance,
          it would follow that it would be substance. And so it would at once be
          substance and non-substance, in which case contradictories would be
          true at the same time. If, therefore, it is impossible for
          contradictories to be true at the same time, and if being signifies
          the one, which is substance, it would follow that whatever is not
          substance is non-being. But there is something which is not substance,
          namely, accident. Therefore something is non-being. And so it is not
          true that non-being is nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Aristotle shows that this does not follow. For if being signifies
          principally the one, which is substance, there is nothing to prevent
          one from saying that accident, which is not substance, is not being
          simply. But because of this it is not necessary to say that that which
          is not something, i.e., not substance, is absolute non-being. Hence,
          although accident is not being simply, it cannot, indeed, be called
          absolute nonbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          52. Next where he says, ‘To say that all things...’ (187 a 7), he
          shows further that, if the non-being which is accident is not
          something, it does not follow that all is one. For if being can mean
          only substance, which truly is, then he says that it is absurd to hold
          that it would follow that all things are one unless there is something
          outside of being. For if there is substance, there is nothing to
          prevent there being a multiplicity of substances, as has already been
          said [L6 #45], even if magnitude and accident are removed. For the
          definition of substance is divided into the many things which are in
          the genus of substance, as man is divided into animal and two-footed.
          And further it follows that according to the diverse differentiae of a
          genus there are many substances in act. And finally he draws the
          conclusion which he had uppermost in mind, namely, that all things are
          not one, as Parmenides and Melissus said.<br /></p

            THE OPINIONS OF THE PHYSICISTS WHO SPOKE OF THE PRINCIPLES AS
            NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          53. After the Philosopher has disproved the opinion concerning
          principles of those who did not speak of nature as natural
          philosophers, he here pursues the opinions of those who, not
          disregarding motion, spoke of the principles of nature as natural
          philosophers. And he calls these men physicists, i.e., natural
          philosophers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he sets forth the diversity
          of their opinions. Secondly he examines one of these opinions, where
          he says, ‘The theory of Anaxagoras...’ (187 a 28; L9 #58).
        </p>
        <p>
          54. He says first that according to the opinion of the natural
          philosophers there are two ways in which things are generated from
          principles. One of the opinions was advanced by the natural
          philosophers who held that there is only one material principle. This
          principle would be either one of three elements, i.e., fire, air, and
          water (for no one made earth alone the principle, as was said above
          [L2 #13]) or else some intermediate between them, for example, that
          which would be more dense than fire and more subtle than air. Theythen
          said that all other things were generated from this one principle by
          rarity and density. For example, those who made air to be the
          principle said that fire was generated from air by rarefaction, and
          water by condensation. However, the dense and the rare are contraries
          and are reduced to excess and defect as to something more universal.
          For the dense is what has much matter, whereas the rare has little.
        </p>
        <p>
          55. And thus they agreed in a certain respect with Plato who held that
          the great and the small are principles which also pertain to excess
          and defect. But they differed from Plato as follows. Plato held that
          the great and the small are on the side of matter, because he posited
          one formal principle which is a certain idea participated in by
          different things according to a diversity of matter; the ancient
          natural philosophers, on the other hand, maintained a contrariety on
          the part of form, because they held that the first principle is one
          matter from which many things were constituted in being according to
          different forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          56. Other natural philosophers, however, held that things come to be
          from principles in such a way that contraries themselves and different
          things are drawn forth from one thing in which they already existed,
          as it were, mixed and confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they differed as follows. Anaximander held that the principle is
          one confused state in which there are not many things mixed together.
          Thus he held one principle only. But Empedocles and Anaxagoras held
          rather that the principles are the very things which are mixed
          together in that one confused state. And so they held many principles,
          although they also held that this one confused state is in some way a
          principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          57. But Anaxagoras and Empedocles differed on two points. First,
          Empedocles held that there is a certain cycle of mixing and
          separating. For he held that the world has been made and corrupted
          many times; that is to say, when the world has been corrupted by
          friendship gathering all into one, the world is then generated again
          by strife separating and distinguishing. And thus the distinction of
          things follows upon their being confused, and vice versa. But
          Anaxagoras held that the world was made only once, such that from the
          beginning all things were mixed into one. But mind, which began to
          draw out and to distinguish, will never cease to do this, so that all
          things never will be mixed into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also differed in another way. Anaxagoras held that the principles
          are infinite parts which are alike and contrary. Thus there are
          infinite parts of flesh which are like each other and infinite parts
          of bone and other things which have similar parts, yet each has a
          contrariety to the others. Thus the contrariety of the parts of bone
          to the parts of blood is that of the dry to the moist. But Empedocles
          held as principles only those four things which are commonly called
          elements, i.e., fire, air, water, and earth.<br /></p

            THE OPINION OF ANAXAGORAS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE INFINITE IS
            REFUTED</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          58. Having set forth the opinions of the natural philosophers
          concerning the principles, he here pursues one of these opinions,
          namely, that of Anaxagoras. For this opinion seemed to assign a common
          cause for all the species of motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discussion is divided into two parts. In the first part he sets
          forth Anaxagoras’ argument; in the second part he raises objections
          against it, where he says, ‘Now the infinite...’ (187 b 7 #64).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes three points. First he sets forth
          those things which Anaxagoras supposed and from which he argues.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘The one, they reasoned...’ (187 a 33 #62)2
          he sets forth the order of his argument. Thirdly, where he says, ‘But
          things, as they say...’ (187 b 2 #63), he sets forth Anaxagoras’
          response to a certain tacit objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          59. Anaxagoras assumed two things from which he argued. The first of
          these is a point which is assumed by all of the natural philosophers,
          namely, that nothing comes to be from nothing. And Aristotle says
          that, because of this, Anaxagoras seemed to have held the opinion that
          the principles are infinite. For he accepted as true the common
          opinion of all philosophers of nature, namely, that what simply is not
          in no way comes to be. For they assumed this as a principle and then
          developed their different opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          60. Lest they would be forced to hold that something new comes to be
          which previously was in no way at all, some held that all things from
          the beginning existed together, either in some one confused state, as
          Anaxagoras and Empedocles held, or in some natural principle, such as
          water, fire, and air, or some intermediate between these.
        </p>
        <p>And in accordance with this they posited two modes of production.</p>
        <p>
          Those who held that all things pre-existed together as in one material
          principle said that to come to be is nothing other than to be altered.
          For they said that all things come to be from that one material
          principle through its condensation and rarefaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, however, who held that all things pre-existed together in some
          one confused state and mixture of many, said that the coming to be of
          things is only a joining together and a separation.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these philosophers were deceived because they did not know how
          to distinguish between potency and act. For being in potency is, as it
          were, a mean between pure non-being and being in act. Therefore, those
          things which come to be naturally do not come to be from nonbeing
          simply, but from being in potency, and not, indeed, from being in act,
          as they thought. Hence things which come to be did not necessarily
          pre-exist in act, as they said, but only in potency.
        </p>
        <p>
          61. Next where he says, ‘Moreover the fact that...’ (187 a 32), he
          mentions the second thing which Anaxagoras assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anaxagorai said that contraries come to be from each other. For we see
          the cold come to be from the hot, and vice versa. And from this he
          concluded that, since nothing comes to be from nothing, one of the
          contraries pre-exists in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is true, of course, in respect to potency. For the cold is in
          the hot in potency, but not in act, as Anaxagoras thought. For he was
          not aware of being in potency, which is a mean between pure non-being
          and being in act.
        </p>
        <p>
          62. Next where he says, ‘The one, they reasoned...’ (187 a 33), he
          sets forth the deductive order of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anaxagoras proceeded as follows. If something comes to be, it is
          necessary that it should come to be either from being or from
          nonbeing. But he excluded one of these alternatives-namely, that
          something should come to be from non-being. He does this because of
          the common opinion of the philosophers mentioned above [#59]. Whence
          he concluded that the remaining member was correct, namely, that a
          thing comes to be from being. For example, if air comes to be from
          water, then air pre-existed. For it cannot be said that air comes to
          be from water unless air pre-existed in water. Hence he wished to say
          that everything which comes to be from something pre-existed in that
          from which it comes to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because this seemed to be contrary to what appears to the senses
          (for it is not apparent to the senses that that which is generated
          from something pre-exists in it), he forestalled this objection by
          holding that that which comes to be from something pre-exists in it as
          certain most minute parts which are not sensible to us because of
          their smallness. For example, if air comes to be from water, certain
          minute parts of air are in the water, but not in that quantity in
          which it is generated. And so he said that by the gathering together
          of these parts of air by themselves, and by their separation from the
          parts of water, air comes to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having accepted, therefore, that everything which comes to be from
          something pre-exists in it, he further assumed that everything comes
          to be from everything. Whence he concluded that everything would be
          mixed in everything else as minute, non-sensible parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because an infinite variety of things can come to be from another,
          he said that infinite minute parts were in each thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          63. Next where he says, ‘But things, as they say...’ (187 b 2), he
          excludes a certain tacit objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible for someone to object as follows. If infinite parts of
          everything are in everything, it would follow that things neither
          differ from each other nor appear to differ from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, as if he were answering this objection, Anaxagoras says
          that things appear to differ from each other and ‘are diversely named
          because of that which is dominant in them, even though there,is an
          infinite number of minute parts contained in’any mixture. And so
          nothing is purely and totally white or black or bone. Rather, that
          which abounds in each thing seems to be the nature of that thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          64. Next where he says, ‘Now the infinite...’ (187 b 7), Aristotle
          refutes the above mentioned position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he disproves the position
          absolutely. Secondly, where he says, ‘... and it is better...’ (188 a
          17), he compares it to the opinion of Empedocles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he sets forth
          arguments to disprove the opinion of Anaxagoras. Secondly, where he
          says, ‘The statement that...’ (188 a 5 #72), he disagrees with
          Anaxagoras’ way of understanding his own position.
        </p>
        <p>Concerning the first part he gives five arguments.</p>
        <p>
          The first of these is as follows. Every infinite thing, in that
          respect in which it is infinite, is unknown. He explains why he says
          ‘in that respect in which it is infinite’. If it is infinite in
          respect to multitude or magnitude, it will be unknown in respect to
          quantity. If, however, it is infinite in respect to species (for
          example, if it is composed of an infinite variety of species), then it
          will be unknown according to quality. And the reason for this is that
          what is known by the intellect is grasped by the intellect with
          respect to all that belongs to that thing. But this cannot happen with
          regard to something infinite. If, therefore, the principles of a thing
          are infinite, they must be unknown either in respect to quantity or in
          respect to species.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the principles are unknown, those things which are from the
          principles must be unknown. He proves this as follows. We think that
          we know any composite when we know from what and from how many
          [principles] it is composed, i.e., when we know both the species and
          the quantity of the principles. It follows, therefore, from first to
          last that, if the principles of natural things are infinite, then
          natural things are unknown either in respect to quantity or in respect
          to species.
        </p>
        <p>
          65. At the point where he says, ‘Further if the parts...’ (187 b 14),
          he gives the second argument, which is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the parts of a whole do not have a determinate quantity, either
          great or small, but can be any size, either great or small, it is not
          necessarythat the whole have a determinate greatness or smallness.
          Rather the whole could have any size. This is so because the quantity
          of the whole comes from the parts. (But this must be understood of the
          parts existing in act in the whole, as flesh and nerve and bone exist
          in an animal. Hence he says, ‘... by parts I mean components into
          which a whole can be divided and which are actually present in it’
          (187 b 15). And by this he excludes the parts of a continuous whole
          which are in the whole in potency.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is impossible that an animal or a plant or some such thing be
          related indeterminately to any size, whether great or small. For there
          is some quantity so large that no animal exceeds it in size. So also
          there is some quantity so small that no animal is found to be smaller.
          And the same must be said of plants. Therefore by denying the
          consequent it follows that the parts are not of indeterminate
          quantity. For what is true of the whole is true of the parts. But
          flesh and bone and things of this sort are parts of an animal, and
          fruits are parts of plants. Therefore it is impossible that flesh and
          bone and such things should have an indeterminate quantity, either
          greater or smaller. Therefore it is not possible that there should be
          certain parts of flesh or bone which are non-sensible because of
          smallness.
        </p>
        <p>
          66. It seems, however, that what is said here is contrary to the
          statement that a continuum is divisible to infinity. For if the
          continuous is divisible to infinity, and flesh is, indeed, a kind of
          continuum, it seems that flesh is divisible to infinity. Therefore,
          some part of flesh, according to a division to infinity, goes beyond
          every determinate smallness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must be pointed out that although a body, considered
          mathematically, is divisible to infinity, the natural body is not
          divisible to infinity. For in a mathematical body nothing but quantity
          is considered. And in this there is nothing repugnant to division to
          infinity. But in a natural body the form also is considered, which
          form requires a determin.ate quantity and also other accidents. Whence
          it is not possible for quantity to be found in the species of flesh
          except as determined within some termini.
        </p>
        <p>
          67. He gives the third argument where he says, ‘Again according to the
          theory...’ (187 b 23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he sets forth certain
          things which are the basis of the argument. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘For let flesh...’ (187 b 28 #68), he sets forth the deductive order
          of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>Concerning the first part he proposes three things.</p>
        <p>
          The first is that according to the position of Anaxagoras, as was said
          above [#62], all things are together. And from this Aristotle wishes
          to reduce Anaxigoras’ argument to absurdity. For Anaxagoras said, as
          was pointed out [#62ff], that all things which are of a certain kind,
          i.e., all things which are of like parts, such as flesh and bone and
          the like, are in each other, and do not come to be from nothing, but
          are separated from that in which they pre-exist. And each thing is
          named from that which abounds in it, i.e., from the largest number of
          parts existing in the thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second point is that everything comes to be from everything, as
          water comes to be by separation from flesh, and in the same way flesh
          comes to be from water.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the third point is that every finite body is reduced by a finite
          body. That is, if from some finite body, however large, a finite body,
          however small, is taken away, the smaller can be taken away from the
          larger until eventually the greater whole is consumed by the smaller
          through division.
        </p>
        <p>
          And from these three points Aristotle concludes what he primiarily
          intended, namely, that each thing is not in each thing. And this is
          contrary to the first of these three points. For in arguments which
          lead to absurdity the denial of one of the premises is the final
          conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          68. Next where he says, ‘For let flesh...’(187 b 28), he develops his
          argument and assumes what was concluded in the preceding argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that if flesh is removed from water (since flesh is generated
          from water), and if again another separation of flesh is made from the
          remaining water, then although there will always remain a smaller
          quantity of flesh in the water, still the size of that flesh is not
          less than a certain smallness, i.e., there happens to be a certain
          small measure of flesh than which there will not be any smaller flesh,
          as is clear from the argument given above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, having established that there is some small particle of
          flesh than which there is no smaller, he proceeds as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          If from water flesh is separated, and again other flesh, the process
          of separation will either stop or it will not. If it stops, then there
          is no flesh in the remaining water, and everything will not be in
          everything. If it does not stop, then some part of flesh will always
          remain in the water. Thus in the second separation the remaining flesh
          is smaller than in the first, and in the third it is smaller than in
          the second. And since we cannot proceed to infinity in smallness of
          parts, as was said, then the smallest parts of flesh are equal and
          infinite in number in some finite body of water. Otherwise separation
          could not proceed to infinity. It follows, therefore, that if the
          separation does not stop, but flesh is always removed from water to
          infinity, then in some finite magnitude, e.g., water, there are
          certain things which are finite in respect to quantity, and equal to
          each other, and infinite in respect to number, namely, the infinite
          smallest parts of flesh. But this is impossible and contrary to what
          was said above, namely, that every finite body is reduced by some
          finite body. Therefore the first point, namely, that everything is in
          everything, as Anaxagoras held, is also impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          69. We must note that it is not without reason that the Philosopher
          used the term ‘equal’ in stating the last absurdity to which this
          position leads. For if the nature of quantity is considered, it is not
          absurd that an infinity of unequal parts be in a finite body. For if a
          continuum is divided according to the same proportion, it will be
          possible to proceed to infinity, for example, if we take a third of a
          whole, and then a third of the third, and so on. In this case,
          however, the parts were not taken as equal in quantity. But if the
          division is made according to equal parts, we will not be able to
          proceed to infinity even if we consider only the nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ] of quantity which is found in a mathematical body.
        </p>
        <p>
          70. He gives his fourth argument where he says, ‘Another proof may be
          added...’ (187 b 35). The argument is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every body becomes a smaller one when something is taken from it,
          because every whole is greater than its parts. Since then the quantity
          of flesh is determinately great or small, as is clear from what was
          said above, there must be some smallest bit of flesh. Therefore from
          this nothing can be separated, because the remainingfiesh would be
          smaller than this smallest piece of flesh. Therefore it is impossible
          that everything comes to be from everything by separation.
        </p>
        <p>
          71. At the point where he says, ‘Lastly in each...’ (188 a 3), he
          gives his fifth argument, which is as follows. If infinite parts of
          each thing are in each thing, and everything is in everything, it
          follows that infinite parts of flesh and infinite parts of blood and
          brain are in an infinite number of bodies. And regardless of how much
          is separated, the same amount would always remain. Therefore it would
          follow that the infinite is in the infinite infinitely. But this is
          unthinkable.
        </p>
        <p>
          72. Next where he says, ‘The statement that...’ (188 a 5), he
          disproves the position of Anaxagoras according to Anaxagoras’ own
          understanding of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does this in two ways. First he shows that Anaxagoras did not
          understand his own position. Secondly, where he says, ‘Nor is
          Anaxagoras...’(188 a 13),1 he shows that Anaxagoras did not have
          sufficient evidence for holding this position.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that although Anaxagoras has in a certain
          respect spoken the truth, he himself did not understand what he said
          when he held that the process of separation would never end. For
          accidents can never be separated from substance; yet he held that
          there was a mixture not only of bodies but also of accidents. When
          something becomes white, he said that this happened by an abstraction
          of white froin the previously existing mixture. If then colours and
          other accidents of this sort are mixed together, as he said, and if
          someone on this supposition says all things that are mixed can be
          separated, it would follow that there would be white and healthy, and
          yet there would be no subject of which these are predicated and in
          which they are. But this is impossible. Therefore the truth is that if
          accidents are in the mixture it is impossible that all mixed things
          can be separated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another absurdity results from the following. Anaxagoras held that all
          things were mixed from the very beginning, but intellect began to
          separate them. Now any intellect which attempts to do what cannot be
          done is not worthy of the name intellect. Hence that intellect will be
          inconsistent, intending the impossible, if it truly wishes this, i.e.,
          wishes to separate things completely. For this is impossible both from
          the point of view of quantity, because there is no smallest magnitude,
          as Anaxagoras said, for from any small quantity something can be
          subtracted, and from the point of view of quality, because accidents
          are not separable from their subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          73. Next where he says, ‘Nor is Anaxagoras...’ (188 a 13), he
          disproves this position by reason of the fact that Anaxagoras did not
          have sufficient evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Anaxagoras saw that a thing is made large by the coming together
          of many small parts which are similar, as a stream is made from many
          brooks, he believed this to be the case for all things. And thus
          Aristotle says that Anaxagoras did not correctly understand the
          generation of things of the same species, i.e., he did not understand
          that a thing is not always generated by things which are similar in
          respect to species. For some things are both generated from and are
          resolved into things like unto themselves, as clay is divided into
          bricks; in other instances, however, this is not so. For some things
          are generated from that which is dissimilar. And in these instances
          there is not merely one mode of production. For some things are made
          by alteration from that which is unlike, as the sides of a house are
          made from clay and not from sides; whereas other things are made by
          composition, as the house is not made of houses, but of sides. It is
          in this way that air and water come to be from each other, i.e., as
          from the unlike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reading here is ‘as the sides are from the house’. And thus he
          sets forth a twofold way in which things come to be from the unlike,
          i.e., through composition, as the house is made of sides, and by
          resolution, as the sides come to be from the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          74. Next where he says, ‘... and it is better...’ (188 a 17), he
          disproves the position of Anaxagoras by comparing it with the opinion
          of Empedocles. He says that it is better to make the principles
          smaller in number and finite, as Empedocles does, than to make them
          many and infinite, as does Anaxagoras.<br /></p

            THE OPINIONS OF THE ANCIENTS CONCERNING THE CONTRARIETY OF THE FIRST
            PRINCIPLES</span

        </p>

        <p>
          75. Having set forth the opinions of the ancient philosophers
          concerning the principles of nature, Aristotle here begins to seek the
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He seeks it first by way of disputation, proceeding from probable
          opinions. Secondly, where he says, ‘We will now give...’ (189 b 30;
          L12 #98), he determines the truth demonstratively. The Oxford English
          translation seems to be based upon this variant reading. Lecture 12,
          98.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he investigates
          the contrariety of the principles, secondly, where he says, ‘The next
          question is...’ (189 a 11; L11 #82), he inquires about their number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes three points. First he sets forth
          the opinion of the ancients about the contrariety of the principles.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘And with good reason...’ (188 a 27 #77) he
          gives an argument in favour of this position. Thirdly he shows how the
          philosophers are related to each other in saying that the principles
          are contraries. He does this where he says, ‘Up to this point...’ (188
          b 27 #79).
        </p>
        <p>
          76. He says, therefore, first that all of the ancient philosophers
          posited contrariety in the principles. And he makes this clear by
          citing three opinions of the philosophers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some philosophers have said that the whole universe is one
          immobile being. Of these, Parmenides said that all things are one
          according to reason, but many according to sense. And to the extent
          that there are many, he posited in them contrary principles, e.g., the
          hot and the cold. He attributed the hot to fire and the cold to earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly there was the opinion of the natural philosophers who posited
          one material and mobile principle. They said that other things come to
          be from this principle according to rarity and density. Thus they held
          that the rare and the dense are principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third opinion was advanced by those who posited many principles.
          Among them, Democritus held that all things come to be from
          indivisible bodies which are joined together. And in this contact with
          each other they left a sort of void. Such voids he called pores, as is
          clear in <i>De Generatione</i>, I:8. Therefore he held that all bodies
          are composed of the fixed and the empty, that is, composed of the
          plenum and the void. Hence he said that the plenum and the void are
          principles of nature. But he assdeiated the plenum with being and the
          void with non-being. And although all of these indivisible bodies are
          one in nature, he said that different things are composed of them
          according to a diversity of figure, position, and order. Thus he held
          that the principles are contraries in the genus of position, i.e.,
          above and below, before and behind, and also contraries in the genus
          of figure, i.e., the straight, the angular, and the circular. The
          principles also are contraries in the genus of order, i.e., prior and
          posterior. (These last contraries are not mentioned in the text
          because they are obvious.) And thus Aristotle concludes, by a sort of
          induction, that all of the philosophers held that the principles are
          contraries in some way. He makes no mention of the opinion of
          Anaxagoras and Empedocles because he has already explained their
          position at length above [L8 #56-57]. However, they also placed a
          certain contrariety in the principles when they said that all things
          come to be through joining and separating, which agree in genus with
          the rare and the dense.
        </p>
        <p>
          77. Next where he says, ‘And with good reason’ (188 a 27), he gives a
          probable argument to show that the first principles are contraries.
          The argument is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three things seem to belong to the very nature of principles. First,
          they are not from other things. Secondly, they are not from each
          other. Thirdly, all other things are from them. But these three notes
          are found in the primary contraries. Therefore the primary contraries
          are principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in order to understand what he means when he speaks of primary
          contraries, we must realize that some contraries are caused by other
          contraries, e.g., the sweet and the bitter are caused by the wet and
          the dry and the hot and the cold. Since, however, it is impossible to
          proceed to infinity, but one must come to certain contraries, which
          are not caused by other contraries, he calls these last contraries the
          primary contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the three conditions proper to principles mentioned above are
          found in these primary contraries. For things which are first are
          manifestly not from others. Moreover things which are contraries are
          manifestly not from each other. For even though the cold comes to be
          from the hot, insofar as that which was previously hot is later cold,
          nevertheless coldness itself never comes to be from heat, as will be
          pointed out later [L11 #90]. The third point—precisely how all things
          come to be from the contraries -we must investigate more carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          78. Now in order to clarify this latter point he states first that
          neither action nor passion can occur between things which are
          contingent in the sense of merely happening to be together, or between
          things which are contingent in the sense of being indeterminate. Nor
          does everything come to be from everything, as Anaxagoras said, except
          perhaps accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is first of all seen clearly in simple things. For white does not
          come to be from musical except accidentally insofar as white or black
          happen to be in the musical. But white comes to be <i>per se</i> from
          the non-white, and not from just any non-white, but from that
          non-white which is black or some mean colour. And in like manner, the
          musical comes to be from the non-musical, and again not from just any
          nonmusical, but from its opposite, which is called the unmusical,
          i.e., from that which is disposed to be musical but is not, or from
          some mean between these two. And for the same reason, a thing is not
          corrupted primarily and <i>per se</i> into just any contingent thing
          (e.g., the white into the musical) except accidentally. Rather white
          is corrupted <i>per se</i> into the non-white, and not into just any
          non-white, but into black or some mean colour. And he says the same of
          the corruption of the musical and of other similar things. The reason
          for this is as follows. Whatever comes to be or is corrupted does not
          exist before it comes to be and does not exist after it is corrupted.
          Whence it is necessary that that which a thing comes to be
          <i>per se</i> and that intowhich a thing is corrupted <i>per se</i> be
          such that it includes in its nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] the non-being of
          that which comes to be or is corrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he shows that the same is true of composite things. He says that
          the situation is the same with composite things as with simple things,
          but is more hidden in composite things because the opposites of
          composite things have no names, as do the opposites of simple things.
          For the opposite of house has no name, although we give a name to the
          opposite of white. Hence if the composite is reduced to something with
          a name, it will be clear. For every composite consists of a certain
          harmony. Now the harmonious comes to be from the inharmonious, and the
          inharmonious from the harmonious. And in like manner, the harmonious
          is corrupted into the inharmonious (not any inharmonious, but the
          opposite). However, we can speak of the harmonious according to order
          alone, or according to composition. For some wholes consist of a
          harmony of order, e.g., an army; and other wholes consist of a harmony
          of composition, e.g., a house. And the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of each
          of these is the same. It is also clear that all composites come to be
          from the noncomposed, for example, a house comes to be from
          non-composed things, and the figured from the non-figured. And in all
          such things nothing is involved except order and composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is clear by induction, as it were, that everything which comes
          to be or is corrupted comes to be from contraries or from some
          intermediate between them, or is corrupted into them. Moreover,
          intermediates between contraries come to be from the contraries, as
          the intermediate colours come to be from black and white. Hence he
          concludes that whatever comes to be according to nature is either a
          contrary, such as white and black, or comes to be from the contraries,
          such as the intermediates between the contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is th e principal conclusion which he intended to draw,
          namely, thafall things come to be from contraries, w hich was the
          third characteristic of principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          79. Next where he says, ‘Up to this point...’ (188 b 27), Aristotle
          shows how the philosophers are related in holding that the principles
          are contraries. First he shows how they are related with reference to
          being moved toward this position. Secondly, where he says, ‘They
          differ, however...’(188 b 30 #80), he shows howthey are related
          itirespect to the position itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, as was pointed out above [#76] that many of the
          philosophers followed the truth to the point where they held that the
          principles are contraries. Although they indeed held this position,
          they did not hold it as though moved by reason, but rather as forced
          to it by the truth itself. For truth is the good of the intellect,
          toward which the intellect is naturally ordered. Hence as things which
          lack knowledge are moved to their ends without reason [
          <i>ratio</i> ], so, at times, the intellect of man, by a sort of
          natural inclination, tends toward the truth, though it does not
          perceive the reason [ <i>ratio</i> ] for the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          80. Next where he says, ‘They differ, however,...’ (188 b 30), he
          shows how the aforesaid philosophers are related in respect to the
          position itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he shows how they differ in
          holding that the principles are contraries. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘Hence their principles...’ (188 b 37 #81), he shows how they both
          differ and agree.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that the philosophers who held that the
          principles are contraries differed in two ways. First, those who
          argued reasonably held that the principles are the primary contraries.
          Others, however, considering the matter less well, held that the
          principles are posterior [derived] contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          And of those who appealed to the primary contraries, some considered
          those contraries which were better known to reason, others those
          contraries which were better known to sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or it could be said that this second difference explains the first.
          For those things which are better known to reason are prior simply,
          whereas those things which are better known to sense are posterior
          simply, and
        </p>
        <p>
          are prior relative to us. However, it is clear that the principles
          must be prior. Thus, those who judged ‘prior’ according to what is
          better known to reason held that the principles are those contraries
          which are prior simply. On the other hand, those who judged ‘prior’
          according to what is better known to sense held that the principles
          are those contraries which are posterior simply. Hence some held that
          the hot and the cold are first principles; others, the wet and the
          dry. And both of these are better known to sense. However the hot and
          the cold, which are active qualities, are prior to the wet and the
          dry, which are passive qualities, because the active is naturally
          prior to the passive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, however, held principles which are better known to reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these, some held that the equal and the unequal are the
          principles. For example, the Pythagoreans, thinking that the substance
          of all things is numbers, held that all things are composed of the
          equal and the unequal as of form and matter. For they attributed
          infinity and otherness to the equal because of its divisibility.
          Whereas to the unequal they attributed finiteness and identity because
          of its indivisibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others, however, held that the cause of generation and corruption is
          strife and friendship, that is, the cycles of Empedocles, which are
          also better known to reason. Whence it is clear that the diversity
          mentioned above appears in these positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          81. Next where he says, ‘Hence their principles...’ (188 b 37), he
          shows how there is also a certain agreement within the differences of
          the aforementioned positions. He concludes from what he has said above
          that the ancient philosophers in a way called the same things
          principles and in a way called different things principles. For they
          differed insofar as different philosophers assumed different
          contraries (as was said above #80); yet they are the same insofar as
          their principles were alike according to analogy, i.e., proportion.
          For the principles taken by an of them have the same proportion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is true in three respects. First, all the principles which
          they assumed are related as contraries. And thus Aristotle says that
          they all took their principles from the same columns, i.e., columns of
          contraries. For they all took contraries as their principles, even
          though the contraries differed. Nor is it remarkable that they took
          different principles from the columns of contraries. For among the
          contraries, some are containers, as the prior and more common; and
          others axe contained, as the posterior and less common. Hence one way
          in which they spoke alike is that all of them took their principles
          from the order of contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way, in which they agree according to analogy is as follows.
          No matter what principles they accepted, one of these principles is
          better, and the other is worse. For example, friendship, or the
          plenum, or the hot, are better; but strife, or the void, or the cold,
          are worse. And the same thing is true of the other pairs of
          contraries. This is so because one of the contraries always has
          privation joined to it. For the source of contrariety is the
          opposition of privation and habit, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i>,
          X:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thixdly they agree according to analogy by reason of the fact that
          they all took principles which are better known. But some took
          principles which are better known to reason, others those which are
          better known to sense. Since reason treats the universal and sense
          treats the particular, universals (such as the great and the small)
          are better known to reason, whereas singulars (such as the rare and
          the dense, which are less common) are better known to sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then as a final summary, he concludes with that which he had uppermost
          in mind, namely, the principles are contraries.<br /></p

        </p>

        <p>
          82. After the philosopher has investigated the contrariety of the
          principles, he here begins to inquire about their number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes three points. First, he raises the question.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘One they cannot be...’ (189 a 12 #83), he
          excludes certain things which are not pertinent to this question.
          Thirdly, he takes up the question, where he says, ‘Granted, then,
          that...’ (189 a 21 #89).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that after an investigation into the
          contrariety of the principles, an inquiry about their number should
          follow, i.e., whether they are two, or three, or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          83. Next where he says, ‘One they cannot be...’ (189 a 12), he
          excludes those things which are not pertinent to this question. He
          shows first that there is not just one principle, and secondly, where
          he says, ‘Nor can they be...’ (189 a 12 #84), he shows that the
          principles are not infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says first that it is impossible for there to be only one
          principle. For it has been shown [L 10] that the principles are
          contraries. But contraries are not just one, for nothing is the
          contrary of itself; therefore, there is not just one principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          84. Next where he says, ‘Nor can they be...’ (189 a 12), he gives four
          arguments to show that the principles are not infinite. The first of
          these is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The infinite as such is unknown. If, therefore, the principles are
          infinite, they must be unknown. But if the principles are unknown,
          then those things which are from the principles are unknown. It
          follows, therefore, that nothing in the world could be known.
        </p>
        <p>
          85. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘... and in any one
          genus...’ (189 a 13). The argument is as follows. The principles must
          be primary contraries, as was shown above [L10 #77]. But the primary
          contraries belong to the primary genus, which is substance. But
          substance, since it is one genus, has one primary contrariety. For the
          first contrariety of any genus is that of the primary differentiae by
          which the genus is divided. Therefore, the principles are not
          infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          86. He gives the third argument where he says, also a finite
          number...’ (189 a 15). The argument is as follows. It is better to say
          that what can come to be from finite principles comes from finite
          principles rather than from infinite principles. But all things which
          come to be according to nature are explained by Empedocles through
          finite principles,just as they are explained byAnaxagoras through
          infinite principles. Hence an infinite number of principles should not
          be posited.
        </p>
        <p>
          87. He gives the fourth argument where he says, ‘Lastly, some con
          traries...’ (189 a 17). The argument is as follows. Principles are
          contraries. If, therefore, the principles are infinite, it is
          necessary that all the contraries be principles. But all of the
          contraries are not principles. This is clear for two reasons. First,
          the principles must be primary contraries, but not all contraries are
          primary, since some are prior to others. Secondly, the principles
          ought not to be from each other, as was said above [L10 #77]. But some
          contraries are from each other, as the sweet and the bitter, and the
          white and the black. Therefore, the principles are not infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus he finally concludes that the principles are neither one nor
          infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          88. However, we must note that the Philosopher proceeds here by way of
          disputation from probable arguments. Hence he assumes certain things
          which are seen in many instances, and which cannot be false taken as a
          whole, but are true in particular instances. Therefore, it is true
          that in a certain respect contraries do come to be from each other, as
          was said above [L10 #78], if the subject is taken along with the
          contraries. For that which is white later becomes black. However,
          whiteness itself is never changed into blackness. But some of the
          ancients, without including the subject, held that the primary
          contraries come to be from each other. Hence, Empedocles denied that
          the elements come to be from each other. And thus Aristotle
          significantly does not say in this place that the hot comes to be from
          the cold, but the sweet from the bitter and the white from the black.
        </p>
        <p>
          89. Next where he says,’Granted then...’(189 a 21), he takes up the
          question under discussion, namely, what is the number of the
          principles. ‘Concerning this he makes two points. First he shows that
          there are not just two principles, but three. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘On the other hand...’ (189 b 18 #95), he shows that there are no more
          than three principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First, he shows through
          arguments that there are not just two principles, but that a third
          must be added. Secondly, where he says, ‘If, then, we accept...’ (189
          a 34 #93), he shows that even the ancient philosophers agreed on this
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          90. Concerning the first part he gives three arguments. He says first
          that since it was shown that the principles are contraries, and so
          could not be just one, but are at least two, and further since the
          principles are not infinite, then it remains for us to consider
          whether there are only two principles or more than two. Since it was
          shown abovei that the principles are contraries, it seems that there
          are only two principles, because contrariety exists between two
          extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one might question this. For it is necessary that other things
          come to befrom the principles, as was said above [L10 #77]. If,
          however, there are only two contrary principles, it is not apparent
          how all things can come to be from these two. For it cannot be said
          that one of them makes something from the other one. For density is
          not by nature such that it can convert rarity into something, nor can
          rarity convert density into something. And the same is true of any
          other contrariety. For friendship does not move strife and make
          something out of it, nor does the converse happen. Rather each of the
          contraries changes some third thing which is the subject of both of
          the contraries. For heat does not make coldness itself to be hot, but
          makes the subject of coldness to be hot. And conversely, coldness does
          not make heat itself to be cold, but makes the subject of heat to be
          cold. Therefore, in order that other things can come to be from the
          contraries, it seems that it is necessary to posit some third thing
          which will be the subject of the contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not matter for the present whether that subject is one or
          many. For some have posited many material principles from which they
          prepare the nature of beings. For they said that the nature of things
          is matter, as will be said later in Book II [L2].
        </p>
        <p>
          91. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘Other
          objections...’(189 a 28). He says that, unless there is something
          other than the contraries which are given as principles, then there
          arises an even greater difficulty. For a first principle cannot be an
          accident which is predicated of a subject. For since a subject is a
          principle of the accident which is predicated of it and is naturally
          prior to the accident, then if the first principle were an accident
          predicated of a subject, it would follow that what is ‘of’ a principle
          would be a principle, and there would be something prior to the first.
          But if we hold that only the contraries are principles, it is
          necessary that the principles be an accident predicated of a subject.
          For no substance is the contrary of something else. Rather contrariety
          is found only between accidents. It follows, therefore, that the
          contraries cannot be the only principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it must be noted that in this argument he uses ‘predicate’
          for ‘accident’, since a predicate designates a form of the subject.
          The ancients, however, believed that all forms are accidents. Hence he
          proceeds here by way of disputation from probable propositions which
          were well known among the ancients.
        </p>
        <p>
          92. He gives the third argument where he says, ‘Again we hold...’ (189
          a 33). The argument is as follows. Everything which is not a principle
          must be from principles. If, therefore, only the contraries are
          principles, then since substance is not the contrary of substance, it
          follows that substance would be from non-substance. And thus what is
          not substance is prior to substance, because what is from certain
          things is posterior to them. But this is impossible. For substance
          which is being <i>per se</i> is the first genus of being. Therefore,
          it cannot be that only the contraries are principles; rather it is
          necessary to posit some other third thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          93. Next where he says, ‘If, then, we accept...’ (189 a 34), he shows
          how the position of the philosophers also agrees with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First, he shows how they posited
          one material principle. Secondly, where he says, ‘All, however
          agree...’ (189 b 9 #94), he shows how they posited two contrary
          principles besides this one material principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we must first note that the Philosopher in the preceding
          arguments seemed to be opposed, in the manner of those who dispute, to
          both sides of the question. For first he proved that the principles
          are contraries, and now he brings forth arguments to prove that the
          contraries are not sufficient for the generation of things. And since
          disputatious arguments do come to some kind of true conclusion, though
          it is not the whole [truth], he concludes one truth from each
          argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that if someone thinks that the first argument (which proves
          that the principles are contraries) is true, and that the argument
          just given (which proves that contrary principles are not sufficient)
          is also true, then to maintain both conclusions he must say that some
          third thing lies beneath the contraries, as was said by those who held
          that the whole universe is some one nature, understanding nature to
          mean matter, such as water, or fire or air, or some intermediate state
          between these, such as vapour, or some other thing of this sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seems especially true in regard to an intermediate. For this
          third thing ietaken as the subject of the contraries, and as distinct
          from them in some way. Hence, that which has less of the nature of a
          contrary about it is more conveniently posited as the third principle
          beyond the contraries. For fire and earth and air and water have
          contrariety attached to them, e.g., the hot and the cold, the wet and
          the dry. Hence, it is not unreasonable that they make the subject
          something other than these and something in which the contraries are
          less prominent. After these philosophers, however, those who held that
          air was the principle spoke more wisely, for the contrary qualities
          found in air are less sensible. After these philosophers are those who
          held that water was the principle. But those who held that fire was
          the principle spoke most poorly, because fire has a contrary quality
          which is most sensible and which is very active. For in fire there is
          an excellence of heat. If, however, the elements are compared with
          reference to their subtlety, those who made fire the principle seem to
          have spoken better, as is said elsewhere,’ for what is more subtle
          seems to be more simple and prior. Hence no one held that earth was
          the principle because of its density.
        </p>
        <p>
          94. Next where he says, ‘All, however, agree...’ (189 b 9), he shows
          how they posited contrary principles with the one material principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that all who posited one material principle said that it is
          figured or formed by certain contraries, such as rarity and density,
          which are reducible to the great and the small and to excess and
          defect. And thus the position of Plato that the one and the great and
          the small are the principles of things was also the opinion of the
          ancient natural philosophers, but in a different way. For the ancient
          philosophers, thinking that one matter was differentiated by diverse
          forms, held two principles on the part of form, which is the principle
          of action, and one on the part of matter, which is the principle of
          passion. But the Platonists, thinking that many individuals in one
          species are distinguished by a division of matter, posited one
          principle on the part of the form, which is the active principle, and
          two on the part of the matter, which is the passive principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus he draws the conclusion which he had uppermost in mind,
          namely, that by considering the above and similar positions, it seems
          reasonable that there are three principles of nature. And he points
          out that he has proceeded from probable arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          95. Next where he says, ‘On the other hand...’ (189 b 18), he shows
          that there are no more than three principles. He uses two arguments,
          the first of which is as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is superfluous for that which can come to be through fewer
          principles to come to be through many. But the whole generation of
          natural things can be achieved by positing one material principle and
          two formal principles. For one material principle is sufficient to
          account for passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if there were four contrary principles, and two primary
          contrarieties, it would be necessary that each contrariety have a
          different subject. For it seems that there is one primary subject for
          any one contrariety. And so, if, by positing two contraries and one
          subject, things can come to be from each other, it seems superfluous
          to posit another contrariety. Therefore, we must not posit more than
          three principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          96. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘Moreover it is
          impossible...’ (189 b 23). If there are more than three principles, it
          is necessary that there be many primary contrarieties. But this is
          impossible because the first contrariety seems to belong to the first
          genus, which is one, namely, substance. Hence all contraries which are
          in the genus of substance do not differ in genus, but are related as
          prior and posterior. For in one genus there is only one contrariety,
          namely, the first, because all other contrarieties seem to be reduced
          to the first one. For there are certain first contrary differentiae by
          which a genus is divided. Therefore it seems that there are no more
          than three principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must be noted, however, that each of the following statements is
          probable: namely, that there is no contrariety in substances, and that
          in substances there is only one primary contrariety. For if we take
          substance to mean ‘that which is’, it has no contrary. If, however, we
          take substance to mean formal differentiae in the genus of substance,
          then contrariety is found in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          97. Finally by way of summary he concludes that there is not just one
          principle, nor are there more than two or three. But deciding which of
          these is true, that is, whether there are only two principles or
          three, involves much difficulty, as is clear from the foregoing.<br /></p

            IN EVERY COMING TO BE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE TO BE FOUND: THE SUBJECT,
            THE TERMINUS OF THE PRODUCTION, AND ITS OPPOSITE</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          98. After the Philosopher has investigated the number of principles by
          means of disputation, he here begins to determine the truth. This
          section is divided into two parts. First he determines the truth.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘We will not proceed...’ (191 a 23; L14
          #120ff), he excludes from the truth already deterrained certain
          difficulties and errors of the ancients.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part is divided into two parts. First he shows that in any
          natural coming-to-be three things are found. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘Plainly, then...’ (190 b 16; L13 #110), he shows from this that these
          three things are principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he states his
          intention, and secondly he pursues his intention, where he says, ‘We
          say that...’ (189 b 33 #100).
        </p>
        <p>
          99. Because he had said above [L11 #97] that the question of whether
          there are only two principles of nature or three involves much
          difficulty, he concludes that he must first speak of generation and
          production as common to all the species of mutation. For in any
          mutation there is found a certain coming-to-be. For example, when
          something is altered from white to black, the non-white comes to be
          from the white, and the black comes to be from the non-black. And the
          same is true of other mutations. He also points out the reason for
          this order of procedure. It is necessary to speak first of those
          things which are common, and afterwards to think of those things which
          are proper to each thing, as was said in the beginning of the Book [L1
          #6].
        </p>
        <p>
          100. Next where he says, ‘We say that one thing...’ (189 b 33), he
          develops his position. Concerning this he makes two points. First he
          sets forth certain things which are necessary to prove his position.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘These distinctions drawn...’ (190 a 13
          #103),he proves his point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he sets up a cerr
          tain division, secondly, where he says, ‘As regards one...’ (190 a 5
          #102), he points out the differences among the parts of the division.
        </p>
        <p>
          101. He says, therefore, first that in any coming-to-be one thing is
          said to come to be from another thing with reference to coming to be
          in regard to substantial being [ <i>esse</i> ], or one comes to be
          from another with reference to coming to be in regard to accidental
          being [ <i>esse</i> ]. Hence every change has two termini. The word
          ‘termini’, however, is used in two ways, for the termini of a
          production or mutation can be taken as either simple or composite.
        </p>
        <p>
          He explains this as follows. Sometimes we say man becomes musical, and
          then the two termini of the production are simple. It is the same when
          we say that the non-musical becomes musical. But when we say that the
          non-musical man becomes a musical man, each of the termini is a
          composite. Yet when coming to be is attributed to man or to the
          nonmusical, each is simple. And thus, that which becomes, i.e., that
          to which coming to be is attributed, is said to come to be simply.
          Moreover, that in which the very coming to be is terminated, which is
          also said to come to be simply, is musical. Thus we say man becomes
          musical, or the non-musical becomes musical. But when each is
          signified as coming to be as composed (i.e., both what becomes, i.e.,
          that to which the coming to be is attributed, and what is made, i.e.,
          that in which the coming to be is terminated), then we say that the
          non-musical man becomes musical. For then there is composition on the
          part of the subject only and simplicity on the part of the predicate.
          But when I say that the nonmusical man becomes a musical man, then
          there is composition on the part of each.
        </p>
        <p>
          102. Next where he says, ‘As regards one...’ (190 a 5), he points out
          two differences in what was said above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is that in some of the cases mentioned above we use a
          twofold mode of speech, i.e., we say ‘this becomes this’ and ‘from
          this, this comes to be’. For we say ‘the non-musical becomes musical’,
          and ‘from the non-musical, the musical comes to be’. But we do not
          speak this way in all cases. For we do not say’the musical comes to be
          from man’, but ‘man becomes musical’.
        </p>
        <p>
          He points out the second difference where he says, ‘When a
          “simple”...’ (190 a 8). He says that when coming to be is attributed
          to two simple things, i.e., the subject and the opposite, one of these
          is permanent, but the other is not. For when someone has already been
          made musical, ‘man’ remains. But the opposite does not remain, whether
          it be the negative opposite, as the non-musical, or the privation or
          contrary, as the unmusical. Nor is the composite of subject and the
          opposite permanent, for the non-musical man does not remain after man
          has been made musical. And so coming to be is attributed to these
          three things: for it was said that man becomes musical, and the
          non-musical becomes musical, and the non-musical man becomes musical.
          Of these three, only the first remains complete in a production, the
          other two do not remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          103. Next where he says, ‘These distinctions drawn...’ (190 a 13),
          having assumed the foregoing, he proves his position, namely that
          three t. ngs are found in any natural production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes three points. First he enumerates two things
          which are found in any natural production. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘One part survives...’ (190 a 17 #105), he proves what he had
          supposed. Thirdly, where he says, ‘Thus, clearly,...’ (190 b 10 #109),
          he draws his conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          104. He says, therefore, first that, if anyone, taking for granted
          what was said above, wishes to consider [coming-to-be] in all the
          things which come to be naturally, he will agree that there must
          always be some subject to which the coming to be is attributed, and
          that that subject, although one in number and subject, is not the same
          in species or nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. For when it is said of a man
          that he becomes musical, the man is indeed one in subject, but two in
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. For man and the non-musical are not the same
          according to nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Aristotle does not, however,
          mention here the third point, namely, that in every generation there
          must be something generated, for this is obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
          105. Next where he says, ‘One part survives...’ (190 a 17), he proves
          the two things which he had assumed. He shows first that the subject
          to which the coming to be is attributed is two in nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ]. Secondly, where he says, ‘But there are different...’
          (190 a 32 #107), he shows that it is necessary to assume a subject in
          every coming to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows the first point in two ways. First he points out that in the
          subject to which the coming to be is attributed there is something
          which is permanent and something which is not permanent. For that
          which is not an opposite of the terminus of the production is
          permanent, for man remains when he becomes musical, but the
          non-musical does not remain. And from this it is clear that man and
          the non-musical are not the same in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ], since the
          one remains, whereas the other does not.
        </p>
        <p>
          106. Secondly, where he says, ‘We speak of...’(190 a 2 1), he shows
          the same thing in another way. With reference to the non-permanent
          things, it is much better to say ‘this comes to be from this’ than to
          say ‘this becomes this’ (although this latter also may be said, but
          not as properly). For we say that the musical comes to be from the
          nonmusical. We also say that the non-musical becomes musical, but this
          is accidental, insofar as that which happens to be non-musical becomes
          musical. But in permanent things this is not said. For we do not say
          that the musical comes to be from man, rather we say that the man
          becomes musical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in reference to permanent things we sometimes say ‘this comes to
          be from this’, as we say that a statue comes to be from bronze. But
          this happens because by the name ‘bronze’ we understand the
          ‘unshaped’, and so this is said by reason of the privation which is
          understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this very fact, then, that we use different modes of speech with
          reference to the subject and the opposite, it is clear that the
          subject and the opposite, such as man and the non-musical, are two in
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          107. Next where he says, ‘But there are different...’ (190 a 32), he
          proves the other point which he had assumed, namely, that in every
          natural production there must be a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proof of this point by argumentation belongs to metaphysics. Hence
          this is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i>, VII:7. He proves it here only by
          induction. He does this first in regard to the things which come to
          be; secondly in regard to the modes of coming to be, where he says,
          ‘Generally things...’ (190 b 5 #108).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that since ‘to come to be’ is used in many
          ways, ‘to come to be simply’ is said only of the coming to be of
          substances, whereas other things are said to come to be accidentally.
          This is so because ‘to come to be’ implies the beginning of existing.
          Therefore, in order for something to come to be simply, it is required
          that it previously will not have been simply, which happens in those
          things which comer to be substantially. For when a man comes to be, he
          not only previously was not a man, but it is true to say that he
          simply was not. When, however, a man becomes white, it is not true to
          say that he previously was not, but that he previously was not such.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things, however, which come to be accidentally clearly depend
          upon a subject. For quantity and quality and the other accidents,
          whose coming to be is accidental, cannot be without a subject. For
          only substance does not exist in a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, it is clear, if one considers the point, that even substances
          come to be from a subject. For we see that plants and animals come to
          be from seed.
        </p>
        <p>
          108. Next where he says, ‘Generally things...’ (190 b 5), he shows the
          same thing by induction from the modes of coming to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that of things which come to be, some come to be by change of
          figure, as the statue comes to be from the bronze, others come to be
          by addition, as is clear in all instances of increase, as the river
          comes to be from many streams, others come to be by subtraction, as
          the image of Mercury comes to be from stone by sculpture. Still other
          things come to be by composition, e.g., a house; and other things come
          to be by alteration, as those things whose matter is changed, either
          by nature or by art. And in all of these cases it is apparent that
          they come to be from some subject. Whence it is clear that everything
          which comes to be comes to be from a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must be noted that artificial things are here enumerated along
          with those things which come to be simply (even though artificial
          forms are accidents) because artificial things are in some way in the
          genus of substance by reason of their matter. Or else perhaps he lists
          them because of the opinion of the ancients, who thought of natural
          things and artificial things in the same way, as will be said in Book
          II [L2 #149].
        </p>
        <p>
          109. Next where he says, ‘Thus clearly...’ (190 b 10), he draws his
          conclusion. He says that it has been shown from what was said above
          that that to which coming to be is attributed is always composed. And
          since in any production there is that at which the coming to be is
          terminated and that to which the coming to be is attributed, the
          latter of which is twofold, i.e., the subject and the opposite, it is
          then clear that there are three things in any coming to be, namely,
          the subject, the terminus of the production, and the opposite of this
          terminus. Thus when a man becomes musical, the opposite is the
          non-musical, the subject is the man, and musical is the terminus of
          the production. And in like manner, shapelessness and lack of figure
          and lack of order are opposites, while bronze and gold and stone are
          subjects in artificial productions.<br /></p

            THERE ARE TWO <i>per se</i> PRINCIPLES OF THE BEING AND OF THE
            BECOMING OF NATURAL THINGS, NAMELY, MATTER AND FORM, AND ONE

          >
        </p>

        <p>
          110. After the Philosopher has shown that three things are found in
          every natural coming to be, he intends here to show from the foregoing
          how many principles of nature there are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he explains his position.
          Secondly, where he says, ‘Briefly, we explained...’ (191 a 15 #119),
          in recapitulation he explains what has already been said and what
          remains to be said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he shows that
          there are three principles of nature. Secondly he names them, where he
          says, ‘The underlying nature...’ (191 a 8 #118).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes three points. First he explains the
          truth about the first principles of nature. Secondly, where he says,
          ‘There is a sense...’ (190 b 28 #114) from this disclosure of the
          truth he answers the problems about the principles which were raised
          above. Thirdly, since the ancients had said that the principles are
          contraries, he shows whether or not contraries are always required,
          where he says, ‘We have now stated...’ (191 a 3 #115).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he shows that
          there are two <i>per se</i> principles of nature. Secondly, where he
          says, ‘Now the subject...’ (190 b 23 #112), he shows that the third
          principle is a <i>per accidens</i> principle of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          111. With reference to the first point he uses the following argument.
          Those things from which natural things are and come to be
          <i>per se</i>, and not <i>per accidens</i>, are said to be the
          principles and causes of natural things. Whatever comes to be exists
          and comes to be both from subject and from form. Therefore the subject
          and the form are <i>per se</i> causes and principles of everything
          which comes to be according to nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          That that which comes to be according to nature comes to be from
          subject and form he proves as follows. Those things into which the
          definition of a thing is resolved are the components of that thing,
          because each thing is resolved into the things of which it is
          composed. But the definition [ <i>ratio</i> ] of that which comes to
          be according to nature is resolved into subject and form. For the
          definition [ <i>ratio</i> ] of musical man is resolved into the
          definition [ <i>ratio</i> ] of man and the definition [ <i>ratio</i> ]
          of musical. For if anyone wishes to define musical man, he will have
          to give the definitions of man and musical. Therefore, that which
          comes to be according to nature both is and comes to be from subject
          and form.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it must be noted that he intends here to inquire not only into the
          principles of the coming to be but also into the principles of the
          being. Hence he says significantly that things both are and come to be
          from these first principles. And by ‘first principles’ he means
          <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i> principles. Therefore, the
          <i>per se</i> principles of everything which comes to be according to
          nature are subject and form.
        </p>
        <p>
          112. Next where he says, ‘Now the subject...’ (190 b 23), he adds the
          third <i>per accidens</i> principle. He says that although the subject
          is one in number, it is nevertheless two in species and nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ], as was said above [L12 #104]. For man and gold and any
          matter has some sort of number. This is a consideration of the subject
          itself, such as man or gold, which is something positive, and from
          which something comes to be <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i>.
          It is another thing, however, to consider that which happens to the
          subject, i.e., contrariety and privation, such as to be unmusical and
          unshaped. The third principle, then, is a species or form, as order is
          the form of a house, or musical is the form of a musical man, or as
          any of the other things which are predicated in this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the subject and the form are <i>per se</i> principles of
          that which comes to be according to nature, but privation or the
          contrary is a <i>per accidens</i> principle, insofar as it happens to
          the subject. Thus we say that the builder is the <i>per se</i> active
          cause of the house, but the musician is a <i>per accidens</i> active
          cause of the house insofar as the builder also happens to be musical.
          Hence the man is the <i>per se</i> cause as subject of musical man,
          but the non-musical is a <i>per accidens</i> cause and principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          113. However someone may object that privation does not belong to a
          subject while it is under some form, and thus privation is not a
          <i>per accidens</i> principle of being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it must be said that matter is never without privation. For when
          nagter has one form, it is in privation of some other form. And so
          while it is coming to be that which it becomes (e.g., musical man),
          there is in the subject, which does not yet have the form, the
          privation of the musical itself. And so the
          <i>per accidens</i> principle of a musical man, while he is coming to
          be musical, is the non-musical. For he is a non-musical man while he
          is coming to be musical. But when this latter form has already come to
          him, then there is joined to him the privation of the other form. And
          thus the privation of the opposite form is a
          <i>per accidens</i> principle of being.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear, therefore, according to the opinion of Aristotle that
          privation, which is posited as a <i>per accidens</i> principle of
          nature, is not a capacity for a form, nor an inchoate form, nor some
          imperfect active principle, as some say. Rather it is the very absence
          of form, or the contrary of form, which occurs in the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          114. Next where he says, ‘There is a sense...’ (190 b 28), he
          resolves, in the light of the truth already determined, all the
          preceding difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          He concludes from the foregoing that in a certain respect it must be
          said that there are two principles, namely, the
          <i>per se</i> principles, and in another respect that there are three,
          if we accept along with the <i>per se</i> principles the
          <i>per accidens</i> principle. And in a certain respect the principles
          are contraries, if one takes the musical and the non-musical, the hot
          and the cold, the harmonious and the inharmonious. Yet in another
          respect the principles, if they are taken without the subject, are not
          contraries, for contraries cannot be acted upon by each other, unless
          it be held that some subject is supposed for the contraries by reason
          of which they are acted upon by one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus he concludes that the principles are not more than the
          contraries, for there are only two <i>per se</i> principles. But there
          are not just two principles, for one of them according to its being
          [esse] is other, for the subject according to nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]
          is two, as was said [L12 #104ff]. And thus there are three principles,
          because man and the non-musical, and bronze and the unshaped, differ
          according to nature [ <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore it is clear that the early opinions which argued for a part
          of the truth were in a certain respect true, but not altogether true.
        </p>
        <p>
          115. Next where he says, ‘We have now stated...’ (191 a 3), he shows
          in what way two contraries are necessary, and in what way they are not
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that from what has been said it is clear how many principles
          of the generation of natural things there are, and how it happens that
          there are this number. For it was shown that it is necessary that two
          of the principles be contraries, of which one is a
          <i>per se</i> principle and the other a <i>per accidens</i> principle,
          and that something be the subject of the contraries, which is also a
          <i>per se</i> principle. But in a certain respect one of the
          contraries is not necessary for generation, for at times it is
          sufficient if one of the contraries bring about the change by its
          absence and its presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          116. As evidence of this we must note that, as will be said in Book V
          [L2 #649ff], there are three species of mutation, namely, generation
          and corruption and motion. The difference among these is as follows.
          Motion is from one positive state to another positive state, as from
          white to black. Generation, however, is from the negative to the
          positive, as from the non-white to the white, or from non-man to man.
          Corruption, on the other hand, is from the positive to the negative,
          as from the white to the non-white, or from man to non-man. Therefore,
          it is clear that in motion two contraries and one subject are
          required. But in generation and corruption there is required the
          presence of one contrary and its absence, which is privation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generation and corruption, however, are found in motion. For when
          something is moved from white to black, white is corrupted and black
          comes to be. Therefore in every natural mutation subject and form and
          privation are required. However, the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of motion
          is not found in every generation and corruption, as is clear in the
          generation and corruption of substances. Hence subject and form and
          priv ‘ ation are found in every mutation, but not a subject and two
          contraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          117. This opposition is also found in substances, which are the first
          genus. This, however, is not the opposition of contrariety. For
          substantial forms are not contraries, even though differentiae in the
          genus of substance are contrary insofar as one is received along with
          the privation of the other, as is clear in the animate and the
          inanimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          118. Next where he says, ‘The underlying nature...’ (191 a 8), he
          clarifies the above-mentioned principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that the nature which is first subject to mutation, i.e.,
          primary matter, cannot be known of itself, since everything which is
          known is known through its form. Primary matter is, moreover,
          considered to be the subject of every form. But it is known by
          analogy, that is, according to proportion. For we know that wood is
          other than the form of a bench and a bed, for sometimes it underlies
          the one form, at other times the other. When, therefore, we see that
          air at times becomes water, it is necessary to say that there is
          something which sometimes exists under the form of air, and at other
          times under the form of water. And thus this something is other than
          the form of water and other than the form of air, as wood is something
          other than the form of a bench and other than the form of bed. This
          ‘something’, then, is related to these natural substances as bronze is
          related to the statue, and wood to the bed, and anything material and
          unformed to form. And this is called primary matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is one principle of nature. It is not one as a ‘this
          something’, that is, as some determinate individual, as though it had
          form and unity in act, but is rather called being and one insofar as
          it is in potency to form. The other principle, then, is the nature
          [ratio) or form, and the third is privation, which is contrary to the
          form. And how these principles are two and how they are three was
          explained above.’
        </p>
        <p>
          119. Next where he says, ‘Briefly, we explained...’ (191 a 15), he
          gives a r6sum6 of what has been said, and points out what remains to
          be said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, that it was said first that the contraries are
          principles, and afterwards that something is subjected to them, and
          thus there are three principles. And from what was said just now it is
          clear what the difference is between the contraries: one of them is a
          <i>per se</i> principle, and the other a
          <i>per accidens</i> principle. And then it was pointed out how the
          principles are related to each other, since the subject and the
          contrary are one in number yet two in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Then it
          was pointed out what the subject is insofar as this could be made
          clear. But it has n ‘ ot yet been decided which is the greater
          substance, form or matter, for this will be explained at the beginning
          of Book II [L2 #153]. But it has been explained that the principles
          are three in number, how they are principles, and in what way. And he
          finally draws the conclusion he had uppermost in mind, namely, that it
          is clear how many principles there are and what they are.<br /></p

            >LECTURE 14 (191 a 23-b 34)<br />
            THE PROBLEMS AND THE ERRORS OF THE ANCIENTS WHICH SPRING FROM AN
            IGNORANCE OF MATTER ARE RESOLVED BY THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES
            ALREADY DETERMINED</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          120. Having determined the truth about the principles of nature, the
          Philosopher here excludes certain difficulties of the ancients by
          means of what has been determined about the principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          He considers first the problems or errors which stem from an ignorance
          of matter, and secondly, where he says, ‘Others indeed...’ (191 b 35;
          L15 #129), the problems or errors which stem from an ignorance of
          privation. Thirdly, where he says, ‘The accurate determination...’
          (192 a 34; L15 #140), he reserves for another science the problems
          which arise with reference to form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first part he makes two points. First he states the
          problem and the error into which the ancients fell through their
          ignorance of matter. Secondly, where he says, ‘Our explanation...’
          (191 a 33 #122) he answers their difficulty by means of those things
          which have already been determined.
        </p>
        <p>
          121. He says, therefore, first that, after determining the truth about
          the principles, it must be pointed out that only in this way is every
          difficulty of the ancients solved. And this is an indication that what
          has been said about the principles is true. For truth excludes every
          falsehood and difficulty. But given a position which is in some way
          false, some difficulty must remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the problem and error of the ancient philosophers was this. The
          first ones who philosophically sought the truth and the nature of
          things were diverted into a path other than the way of truth and the
          way of nature. This happened to them because of the weakness of their
          understanding. For they said that nothing is either generated or
          corrupted. This is contrary to truth and contrary to nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weakness of their understanding forced them to hold this position
          because they did not know how to resolve the following argument,
          according to which it seemed to be proven that being is not generated.
          If being comes to be, it comes to be either from being or from
          non-being. And each of these seems to be impossible, i.e., that being
          comes to be from being or that it comes to be from non-being. It is
          clearly impossible for something to come to be from being, because
          that which is does not come to be, for nothing is before it comes to
          be. And being already is, hence it does not come to be. It is also
          clearly impossible for something to come to be from non-being. For it
          is always necessary that there be a subject for that which comes to
          be, as was shown above [L12 #107]. From nothing, nothing comes to be.
          And from this it was concluded that there is neither generation nor
          corruption of being.
        </p>
        <p>
          And those who argued in this fashion exaggerated their position to the
          point where they said that there are not many beings, but only one
          being. And they said this for the reason already given. Since they
          held that there is only one material principle, and since they said
          that nothing is caused from that one principle by way of generation
          and corruption, but only by way of alteration, then it follows that it
          would always be one according to substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          122. Next where he says, ‘Our explanation...’ (191 a 33), he answers
          the objection just mentioned. Concerning this he makes two points.
          First, he answers the aforesaid objection in two ways. Secondly, where
          he says,’So as we said...’ (191 b 30 #128), he draws the conclusion
          which he has uppermost in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first point is divided into two parts according to the two
          solutions given, the second of which is found where he says, ‘Another
          consists in...’ (191 b 28 #127).
        </p>
        <p>
          123. He says, therefore, first that as far as the mode of speaking is
          concerned, it makes no difference whether we say that something comes
          to be from being or from non-being, or that being or non-being does
          something or is acted upon, or anything else, or whether we say this
          same sort of thing about a doctor; namely, that the doctor does
          something or is acted upon, or that something is or comes to be from
          the doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to say that the doctor does something or is acted upon, or that
          something comes to be from the doctor, has two meanings. Therefore, to
          say that something comes to be from being or from non-being, or that
          being or non-being makes something, or is acted upon, has two
          meanings. And the same is true regardless of the terms which are used;
          e.g., it might be said that something comes to be from white, or that
          the white does something or is acted upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          That there is a twofold meaning when we use expressions such as the
          doctor does something or is acted upon, or that something comes to be
          from the doctor, he shows as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that a doctor builds. But he does not do this insofar as he is
          a doctor, but insofar as he is a builder. And in like manner we say
          that the doctor becomes white, but not insofar as he is a doctor, but
          insofar as he is black. However in another sense we say that the
          doctor heals insofar as he is doctor, and in like manner that the
          doctor becomes a nondoctor insofar as he is a doctor. Thus we say
          properly and <i>per se</i> that the doctor does something or is acted
          upon, or that something comes to be from the doctor, when we attribute
          this to the doctor insofar as he is a doctor. But when something is
          attributed to him <i>per accidens</i>, it is not insofar as he is a
          doctor, but insofar as he is something else. Therefore, it is clear
          that when it is said that the doctor does something or is acted upon,
          or that something comes to be from doctor, this has two meanings,
          i.e., <i>per se</i> and <i>per accidens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence it is clear that when it is said that a thing comes to be from
          non-being, this is to be understood properly and <i>per se</i> if that
          thing should come to be from non-being insofar as it is non-being. And
          same argument applies to being.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the ancients, failing to perceive this distinction, effed insofar
          as they thought that nothing comes to be. And they did not think that
          anything other than their first material principle had substantial
          existence. For example, those who said that air is the first material
          principle held that all other things signify a certain accidental
          existence. Thus they excluded every substantial generation, retaining
          only alteration. Because of the fact that nothing comes to be
          <i>per se</i> either from non-being or from being, they thought that
          it would not be possible for anything to come to be from being or
          non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          124. And we also say that nothing comes to be from non-being simply
          and <i>per se</i>, but only <i>per accidens</i>. For that which
          is,i.e., being, is not from privation <i>per se</i>. And this is so
          because privation does not enter into the essence of the thing made.
          Rather a thing comes to be <i>per se</i> from that which is in the
          thing after it has already been made. Thus the shaped comes to be
          from. the unshaped, not <i>per se</i>, but <i>per accidens</i>,
          because once it already has been shaped, the unshaped is not in it.
          But this is a remarkable way for a thing to come to be from non-being,
          and seemed impossible to the ancient philosophers. Therefore, it is
          clear that a thing comes to be from non-being not <i>per se</i> but
          <i>per accidens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          125. In like manner, if it is asked whether a thing comes to be from
          being, we must say that a thing comes to be from being
          <i>per accidens</i>, but not <i>per se</i>. He shows this by the
          following example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us suppose that a dog is generated from a horse. Granting this, it
          is clear that a certain animal comes to be from a certain animal, and
          thus animal would come to be from animal. However, animal would not
          come to be from animal <i>per se</i>, but <i>per accidens</i>. For it
          does not come to be insofar as it is animal, but insofar as it is this
          animal. For animal already is before the dog comes to be. For the
          horse already is, but is not a dog. Hence the dog comes to be
          <i>per se</i> from that which is not a dog. And if animal were to come
          to be <i>per se</i>, and not <i>per accidens</i>, it would be
          necessary for it to come to be from non-animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the same is true of being. For a being comes to be from that
          non-being which is not that which the being comes to be. Hence a thing
          does not come to be <i>per se</i> from being or <i>per se</i> from
          non-being. For this expression <i>per se</i> signifies that a thing
          comes to be from non-being in the sense that it comes to be from
          non-being insofar as it is non-b,eing, as was said [#123]. And thus
          when this animal comes to be from this animal, or when this body comes
          to be from this body, not all animal or nonanimal, nor all body or
          non-body, is removed from that from which the thing comes to be. And
          likewise not all being [esse] nor all non-being [non-esse] is removed
          from that from which this being comes to be. For,that from which fire
          comes to be has some being, because it is air, and, also has some
          non-being, because it is not fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          126. This, then, is one way of resolving the problem raised above. But
          this approach is not sufficient. For if being comes to be
          <i>per accidens</i> both from being and from non-being, it is
          necessary to posit something from which being comes to be
          <i>per se</i>. For every thing which is <i>per accidens</i> is reduced
          to that which is <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          127. In order to designate that from which a thing comes to be
          <i>per se</i>, he adds a second approach where he says, ‘Another
          consists...’ (191 b 28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that the same thing can be explained in terms of potency and
          act, as is clearly indicated in another place, i.e., in
          <i>Metaphysics</i>, IX:1. Thus a thing comes to be <i>per se</i> from
          being in potency; but a thing comes to be <i>per accidens</i> from
          being in act or from non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says this because matter, which is being in potency, is that from
          which a thing comes to be <i>per se</i>. For matter enters into the
          substance of the thing which is made. But from privation or from the
          preceding form, a thing comes to be <i>per accidens</i> insofar as the
          matter, from which the thing comes to be <i>per se</i>, happened to be
          under such a form or under such a privation. Thus a statue comes to be
          <i>per se</i> from bronze; but the statue comes to be
          <i>per accidens</i> both from that which does not have such a shape
          and from that which has another shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          128. Finally, where he says, ‘So as we said...’ (191 b 30), he draws
          the conclusion which he had uppermost in mind. He says that we can
          truly say that all the difficulties are answered by what has been said
          above. Driven on by certain difficulties, some of the ancients denied
          some of the things mentioned above, i.e., generation and corruption,
          and a plurality of substantially different things. But once matter is
          understood, all of their ignorance is removed.<br /></p

            MATTER IS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRIVATION. MATTER IS NEITHER GENERABLE
            NOR CORRUPTIBLE <i>PER SE</i></span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          129. Having excluded the problems and errors of the ancient
          philosophers which stem from their ignorance of matter, the
          Philosopher here excludes the errors which stem from their ignorance
          of privation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes three points. First, he sets forth the errors
          of those who wandered from the truth. Secondly, where he says, ‘Now we
          distinguish...’ (192 a 2 #132), he shows how this position differs
          from the truth determined by him above. Thirdly, where he says, ‘For
          the one which persists...’ (192 a 13 #134), he proves that his own
          opinion is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          130. He says, therefore, first that some philosophers touched upon
          matter, but did not understand it sufficiently. For they did not
          distinguish between matter and privation. Hence, they attributed to
          matter what belongs to privation. And because privation, considered in
          itself, is non-being, they said that matter, considered in itself, is
          non-being. And so just as a thing comes to be simply and
          <i>per se</i> from matter, so they believed that a thing comes to be
          simply and <i>per se</i> from non-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they were led to hold this position for two reasons. First they
          were influenced by the argument of Parmenides, who said that whatever
          is other than being is non-being. Since, then, matter is other than
          being, because it is not being in act, they said that it is non-being
          simply. Secondly, it seemed to them that that which is one in number
          or subject is also one in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. And Aristotle calls
          this a state of being one in potency, because things which are one in
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] are such that each has the same power. But
          things which are one in subject but not one in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]
          do not have the same potency or power, as is clear in the white and
          the musical. But subject and privation are one in number, as for
          example, the bronze and the unshaped. Hence it seemed to them that
          they would be the same in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] or in power. Hence
          this position accepts the unity of potency.
        </p>
        <p>
          131. But lest anyone, because of these words, be in doubt about what
          the potency of matter is and whether it is one or many, it must be
          pointed out that act and potency divide every genus of beings, as is
          clear in <i>Metaphysics</i>, IX:1, and in Book III [L3] of this work.
          Hence, just as the potency for quality is not something outside the
          genus of quality, so the potency for substantial being is not outside
          the genus of substance. Therefore, the potency of matter is not some
          property added to its essence. Rather, matter in its very substance is
          potency for substantial being. Moreover, the potency of matter is one
          in subject with respect to many forms. But in its nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ] there are many potencies according to its relation to
          different forms. Hence in Book Ills it will be said that to be able to
          be healed and to be able to be ill differ according to nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          132. Next where he says, ‘Now we distinguish...’ (192 a 2), he
          explains the difference between his own opinion and the opinion just
          given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning this he makes two points. First he widens our understanding
          of his own opinion. Secondly, where he says, ‘They, on the other
          hand...’ (192 a 6 #133), he shows what the other opinion holds.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, first that there is a great difference between a
          thing’s being one in number or subject and its being one in potency or
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. For we say, as is clear from the above [L12
          #104], that matter and privation although one in subject, are other in
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. And this is clear for two reasons. First,
          matter is non-being accidentally, whereas privation is non-being
          <i>per se</i>. For ‘unshaped’ signifies non-being, but ‘bronze’does
          not signify non-being except insofar as ‘unshaped’ happens to be in
          it. Secondly, matter is ‘near to the thing’ and exists in some
          respect, because it is in potency to the thing and is in some respect
          the substance of the thing, since it enters into the constitution of
          the substance. But this cannot be said of privation.
        </p>
        <p>
          133. Next where he says, ‘They, on the other hand...’(192 a 6), he
          clarifies his understanding of the opinion of the Platonists.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says that the Platonists also held a certain duality on the part of
          matter, namely, the great and the small. But this duality is different
          from that of Aristotle. For Aristotle held that the duality was matter
          and privation, which are one in subject but different in nature [
          <i>ratio</i> ]. But the Platonists did not hold that one of these is
          privation and the other matter, but theyjoined privation to both,
          i.e., to the great and the small. They either took both of them
          together, not distinguishing in their speech between the great and the
          small, or else they took each separately. Whence it is clear that the
          Platonists, who posited form and the great and the small, held three
          completely different principles than Aristotle, who posited matter and
          privation and form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Platonists realized more than the other ancient philosophers that
          it is necessary to suppose some one nature for an natural forms, which
          nature is primary matter. But they made it one both in subject and in
          nature [ <i>ratio</i> ], not distinguishing between it and privation.
          For although they held a duality on the part of matter, namely, the
          great and the small, they made no distinction at all between matter
          and privation. Rather they spoke only of matter under which they
          included the great and the small. And they ignored privation, making
          no mention of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          134. Next where he says, ‘For the one which persists...’ (192 a 13),
          he proves that his opinion is true. Concerning this he makes two
          points. First he states his position, i.e., that it is necessary to
          distinguish privation from matter. Secondly, where he says, ‘The
          matter comes to be...’ (192 a 25),1 he shows how matter is corrupted
          or generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          He treats the first point in two ways, first by explanation, and
          secondly by reducing [the opposite opinion] to the impossible, where
          he says, ‘...the other such...’ (192 a 18).
        </p>
        <p>
          135. He says, therefore, first that this nature which is the subject,
          i.e., matter, together with form is a cause of the things which come
          to be according to nature after the manner of a mother. For just as a
          mother is a cause of generation by receiving, so also is matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if one takes the other part of the contrariety, namely, the
          privation, we can imagine, by stretching our understanding, that it
          does not pertain to the constitution of the thing, but rather to some
          sort of evil for the thing. For privation is altogether non-being,
          since it is nothing other than the negation of a form in a subject,
          and is outside the whole being. Thus the argument of Parmenides that
          whatever is other than being is non-being, has a place in regard to
          privation, but not in regard to matter, as the Platonists said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows that privation would pertain to evil as follows. Form is
          something divine and very good and desirable. It is divine because
          every form is a certain participation in the likeness of the divine
          being, which is pure act. For each thing, insofar as it is in act, has
          form. Form is very good because act is the perfection of potency and
          is its good; and it follows as a consequence of this that form is
          desirable, because every thing desires its own perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privation, on the other hand, is opposed to form, since it is nothing
          other than the removal of form. Hence, since that which is opposed to
          the good and removes it is evil, it is clear that privation pertains
          to evil. Whence it follows that privation is not the same as matter,
          which is the cause of a thing as a mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          136. Next where he says, the other such...’ (192 a 18), he proves the
          same thing by an argument which reduces [the opposite position] to the
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since form is a sort of good and is desirable, matter, which is other
          than privation and other than form, naturally seeks and desires form
          according to its nature. But for those who do not distinguish matter
          from privation, this involves the absurdity that a contrary seeks its
          own corruption, which is absurd. That this is so he shows as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          If matter seeks form, it does not seek a form insofar as it is under
          this form. For in this latter case the matter does not stand in need
          of being through this form. (Every appetite exists because of a need,
          for an appetite is a desire for what is not possessed.) In like manner
          matter does not seek form insofar as it is under the contrary or
          privation, for one of the contraries is corruptive of the other, and
          thus something would seek its own corruption. It is clear, therefore,
          that matter, which seeks form, is other in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]
          from both form and privation. For if matter seeks form according to
          its proper nature, as was said, and if it is held that matter and
          privation are the same in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ], it follows that
          privation seeks form, and thus seeks its own corruption, which is
          impossible. Hence it is also impossible that matter and privation be
          the same in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, matter is ‘a this’, i.e., something having privation.
          Hence, if the feminine seeks the masculine, and if the base seeks the
          good, this is not because baseness itself seeks the good, which is its
          contrary; rather it seeks it accidentally, because that in which
          baseness happens to be seeks to be good. And likewise femininity does
          not seek masculinity; rather that in which the feminine happens to be
          seeks the masculine. And in like manner, privation does not seek to be
          form; rather that in which privation happens to be, namely, matter,
          seeks to be form.
        </p>
        <p>
          137. But Avicenna opposes this position of the Philosopher in three
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, matter has neither animal appetite (as is obvious in itself)
          nor natural appetite, whereby it would seek form. For matter does not
          have any form or power inclining it to anything, as for example, the
          heavy naturally seeks the lowest place insofar as it is inclined by
          its heaviness to such a place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he objects that, if matter seeks form, this is so because it
          lacks every form, or because it seeks to possess many forms at once,
          both which are impossible, or because it dislikes the form which it
          has and seeks to have another form, and this also is meaningless.
          Hence it seems that we must say that matter in no way seeks form.
        </p>
        <p>
          His third objection is as follows. To say that matter seeks form as
          the feminine seeks the masculine is to speak figuratively, i.e., as a
          poet, not as a philosopher.
        </p>
        <p>
          138. But it is easy to resolve objections of this sort. For we must
          note that everything which seeks something either knows that which it
          seeks and orders itself to it, or else it tends toward it by the
          ordination and direction of someone who knows, as the arrow tends
          toward a determinate mark by the direction and ordination of the
          archer. Therefore, natural appetite is nothing but the ordination of
          things to their end in accordance with their proper natures. However a
          being in act is not only ordered to its end by an active power, but
          also by its matter insofar as it is potency. For form is the end of
          matter. Therefore for matter to seek form is nothing other than matter
          being ordered to form as potency to act.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because matter still remains in potency to another form while it
          is under some form, there is always in it an appetite for form. This
          is not because of a dislike for the form which it has, nor because it
          seeks to be the contrary at the same time, but because it is in
          potency to other forms while it has some form in act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does he use a figure of speech here; rather, he uses an example.
          For it was said above [L13 #118] that primary matter is knowable by
          way of proportion, insofar as it is related to substantial forms as
          sensible matters are related to accidental forms. And thus in order to
          explain primary matter, it is necessary to use an example taken from
          sensible substances. Therefore, just as he used the example of
          unshaped bronze and the example of the non-musical man to explain
          matter, so now to explain matter he uses the example of the appetite
          of the woman for the man and the example of appetite of the base for
          the good. For this happens to these things insofar as they have
          something which is of the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of matter. However,
          it must be noted that Aristotle is here arguing against Plato, who
          used such metaphorical expressions, likening matter to a mother and
          the feminine, and form to the masculine. And so Aristotle uses Plato’s
          own metaphors against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          139. Next where he says, ‘The matter comes to be... (192 a 25), he
          shows how matter is corrupted. He says that in a certain respect
          matter is corrupted and in a certain respect it is not. For insofar as
          privation is in it, it is corrupted when the privation ceases to be in
          it, as if we should say that unshaped bronze is corrupted when it
          ceases to be unshaped. But in itself, insofar as it is a certain being
          in potency, it is neither generated nor corruptible. This is clear
          from the following. If matter should come to be, there would have to
          be something which is the subject from which it comes to be, as is
          clear from what was said above [L12 #7,10ff]. But that which is the
          first subject in generation is matter. For we say that matter is the
          first subject from which a thing comes to be <i>per se</i>, and not
          <i>per accidens</i>, and is in the thing after it has come to be. (And
          privation differs from matter on both of these points. For privation
          is that from which a thing comes to be <i>per accidens</i>, and is
          that which is not in the thing after it has come to be.) It follows,
          therefore, that matter would be before it would come to be, which is
          impossible. And in like manner, everything which is corrupted is
          resolved into primary matter.. Therefore, at the very time when
          primary matter already is, it would be corrupted; and thus if primary
          matter is corrupted, it will have been corrupted before it is
          corrupted, which is impossible. Therefore, it is impossible for
          primary matter to be generated and corrupted. But by this we do not
          deny that it comes into existence through creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          140. Next where he says, ‘The accurate determination...’ (192 a 34),
          he indicates that since the errors about matter and privation have
          been eliminated, then the errors and problems about form should also
          be eliminated. For some have posited separated forms, i.e., ideas,
          which they reduced to one first idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so he says that first philosophy treats such questions as whether
          the formal principle is one or many, and how many there are, and what
          kind there are. Hence these questions will be reserved for first
          philosophy. For form is a principle of existing, and being as such is
          the subject of first philosophy. But matter and privation are.
          principles of mutable being, which is considered by the natural
          philosopher. Nevertheless we shall treat of natural and corruptible
          forms in the following books on this discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally he summarizes what has been said. It has been determined that
          there are principles, what the principles are, and how many there are.
          But it is necessary to make a new start in our study of natural
          science, inquiring, that is, into the principles of the science.
