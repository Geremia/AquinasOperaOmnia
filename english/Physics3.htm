    275. Having settled the question of the principles of natural things (Book
    I), and that of the principles of this science (Book II), the Philosopher
    here begins to pursue his original plan, which is to arrive at conclusions
    concerning the subject of this science, mobile being taken absolutely.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The treatment, then, is divided into two parts:
  </p>

    [things moving others] and things movable [things which others move] (Book
    VII).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first part is divided into two:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    He concludes in regard to motion itself (Books III-IV);

    He concludes in regard to its parts (Book V).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As to the first, he does two things:

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    He states what is under investigation;

    He follows it out, at 279.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    With reference to the first of these, he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    He states that concerning which he intends to treat principally;
  </p>
  <p
    style="

  >
    He sets down certain things which adjoin thereto, with which he will be
    subsequently concerned, at 277.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    276. As to the first [189] he uses the following argument: Nature is the
    principle of motion and change, as is evident from the definition set down
    in Book II. (But how motion and change differ, will be shown in Book V.) And
    thus it is evident that if one does not know motion, one does not know
    nature, since the former [motion] is placed in the definition of the latter
    [nature]. Since, therefore, we intend to present the science of nature, we
    must make motion understood.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    277. Then [196] he adds certain things which accompany motion. And he
    employs two sets of reasons [for including them], the first of which is as
    follows [the second at no. 2778, below]:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Whoever determines something, must determine those things which follow upon
    it—for the subject and its accidents [Properties] are considered in a single
    science.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But the infinite follows upon motion intrinsically, as the following makes
    plain:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Motion is of the number of continuous things, as will be evident below in
    Book VI (l.6). But “infinite” enters into the definition of “
    <span style="font-weight: bold">continuum.</span> ”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    And he [Aristotle] adds “first of all,” because the infinite which is found
    in the addition of number, is caused from the infinite which is in the
    division of the continuum. And that the infinite enters [first of all] into
    the definition of the continuum, he shows from the fact that those defining
    the continuum often use “infinite”—as, for example, when they say that the
    “continuum” is that which is”divisible to infinity.”
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    And he [Aristotle] says “often,” since there is also found another
    definition of the continuum, which is given in the <i>Predicaments</i> [or
    <i>Categories</i> ]: the “continuum” is that “whose parts are joined at a
    common boundary.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now these two definitions differ. For the continuum, since it is a certain
    whole, is properly defined through its parts. But parts are compared to the
    whole in a twofold way, namely, as its components, i.e., according to
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">composition</span>, insofar as the
    whole is composed out of the parts; and as its resolutes, i.e., according to
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">resolution</span>, insofar as the
    whole is divided into the parts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The present definition, therefore, of the contintium, is given according to
    the mode of resolution [division into parts]; while that which is set down
    in the <i>Predicaments</i> is according to the mode of composition
    [composition out of parts].
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Hence it is clear that the infinite follows upon motion intrinsically.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But there are some things which follow upon motion extrinsically, as certain
    external measures: such as place, and the void, and time.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For time is the measure of motion itself; while the measure of the mobile
    thing is indeed place according to truth, but the void according to the
    opinion of some. And therefore he adds that motion cannot be without place,
    the void, and time.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nor does the fact that not all motion is local affect this; since nothing is
    moved which is not in place. For every sensible body is in place, and to it
    [sensible body] alone does it belong to be moved.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Likewise, local motion is the first of motions, which, when it is removed,
    the other motions are removed, as will be evident below in Book VIII (l.14).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It is thus clear that the four above-mentioned properties are consequent
    upon motion; whence they pertain to the consideration of the natural
    philosopher for the aforesaid reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    278. This is also true for yet another reason which he [Aristotle] adds
    subsequently: namely, because the aforesaid are common to all natural
    things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, since it is the task of natural science to reach conclusions
    concerning all natural things, one must therefore first determine concerning
    each of these [four]. For the speculation which is directed toward proper
    things, comes after that which is of common things, as was stated in the
    beginning [Book I, l.1, no. 6]. But among all these common things, one must
    first reach conclusions concerning motion itself, because the other things
    follow upon it as was stated [in the preceding no].
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    279. Then [191] he puts his plan into execution:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    He reaches conclusions concerning motion, and the infinite, which follows
    motion intrinsically;

    He does the same for the other three, which follow moti§n extrinsically, and
    this he does in Book IV.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first treatment is divided into two parts:

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As to the first of these, he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    He sets down in advance certain divisions, since the most suitable path
    towards finding definitions is through division, as is clear from the
    Philosopher in <i>Posterior Analytics</i> II (l.14 ff.), and in
    <i>Metaphysics</i> VII (l.12);
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    He shows that motion falls within the aforesaid divisions, at 281.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    280. With respect to the first of these, he sets down three divisions:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first of these is that being is divided by potency and act. Now this
    division does not distinguish beings into genera—for potency and act are
    found in every genus.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The second division is of being as divided according to the ten genera: the
    first of these is “this something,” i.e., substance; others are: how much
    [i.e., quantity ], or how [quality], or some other of the Predicaments.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The third division is of one genus of beings, namely, of the one which is
    “to something” [relation]. For motion seems in a certain way to pertain to
    this genus, insofar as the mover is referred to the movable thing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In order to understand this third division, one must consider that, since
    relation has the weakest existence—consisting alone, as it does, in the fact
    of being something referred to something else—it is necessary that it be
    grounded on some other accident. For the more perfect accidents are closer
    to the substance, and it is through them as intermediates that the other
    accidents inhere in the substance.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now relation is founded chiefly upon two accidents which have an order to
    something else, namely, upon quantity and action. [or quantity may be a
    measure even of something external to it; while the agent transfuses its
    action into something other than itself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, certain relations are founded upon quantity; and especially
    upon that species of quantity which is number, to which the basic notion of
    measure pertains, as—is evident in “double and half,” “multiple and
    submultiple [fraction]” and other such. Similarly, “same,” “like,” and
    “equal” are founded upon unity, which is the principle of number.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Still other relations are founded upon action and passion: either according
    to existing act [in the present], as something is said to be “heating” in
    relation to that which is heated; or according to “having acted” [in the
    past], as a father is referred to a son because he because he engendered
    him; or else according to the possibility of acting [in the future], as
    master is related to a servant because he is able to make him do something.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now the Philosopher clearly explains this division in <i>Metaphysics</i> V
    (l.17); but he here touches on it briefly, saying that one sort of “to
    something” [relation] is that according to “excess and defect,” which sort,
    indeed, is founded on quantity, as in the case of “double and half”; while
    the other is according to “active and passive,” and “mover and movable,”
    which are referred to each other, as is self-evident.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    281. Then [192] he shows how motion is reduced to the aforesaid [three]
    divisions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    And as to this he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    He shows that motion is not outside the genera of things in which motion
    occurs;
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    He shows that motion is divided as the genera of things are divided, at 282.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As to the first of these, it should be observed that since motion, as will
    be evident below (lesson following, nos. 285, 287; l.3, no. 296), is an
    imperfect act, and since everything which is imperfect falls under the same
    genus with that which is perfect in respect to it—not, indeed, as a species,
    but by reduction (as prime matter is by reduction in the genus of
    “substance”) necessarily motion is not outside the genera of things in which
    motion occurs. And this is what he [Aristotle] states, namely, that motion
    is not “outside of things,” i.e., outside the genera of things in which
    motion is found, in such a way as to be something extraneous to, or
    something common to, these genera.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    And he makes this plain by the fact that whatever is changed, is changed
    either according to substance, or quantity, or quality, or place, as will be
    shown in Book V.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now there is not to be found in these genera some common univocal element
    which would not be found under some predicament but would be their genus;
    but being is common to them according to analogy, as will be shown in
    <i>Metaphysics</i> IV (l.1). Whence it is also plain that neither motion nor
    change is outside the aforesaid genera, since nothing is outside the latter
    and they sufficiently divide being. But, as to the question of how motion is
    related to the predicament of action or passion, this will be explained
    below (l.5).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    282. Then [193] he shows that motion is divided as the genera of things are
    divided,
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For it is plain that in all the genera a thing may be present in two ways,
    either as something perfect, or as something imperfect. The reason for this
    is that privation and possession is the prime contrariety, which is found in
    all the contraries, as is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> X (l.6). Whence,
    since all the genera are divided through contrary differences, it is
    necessary that in all there be the perfect and the imperfect: as in
    “substance” something is as form and something is as privation; and in
    “quality” there is something such as white, which is perfect, and something
    such as black, which is, as it were, imperfect; and in “quantity” one thing
    is perfect quantity, another imperfect; and in “place” something is above,
    which is, as it were, perfect, and something is below, which is, so to
    speak, imperfect; or else there is light and heavy, which are placed in
    “where” [place] by virtue of the inclination [to a certain place] which is
    in them. Hence it is plain that according to the divisions of being, there
    are corresponding divisions of motion.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For the species of motion differ according to the different genera of
    being—as “increase,” which is motion in
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">quantity</span>, differs from
    “generation,” which is motion in
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">substance</span>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The species of motion likewise differ according to perfect and imperfect in
    the same genus: for “generation” is motion in substance toward form, while
    “corruption” is motion toward privation; and in quantity, “increase” is
    toward perfect quantity, “diminution” toward imperfect. But as to the
    question of why there are not assigned two kinds in quality and where
    [place], this will be explained in Book V (l.4).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        284. As to the first, one must understand that some have defined motion
        by saying that motion is “a going-out from potency to act which is not
        sudden.” But they are found to be in error, because they have placed in
        the definition certain elements that are posterior to motion: for a
        “going-out” is a species of motion; “sudden,” likewise, involves time in
        its definition—the “sudden” is that which occurs in the indivisible of
        time [i.e., the instant]; time, however, is defined in terms of motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        285. Consequently it is entirely impossible to define motion in terms of
        what is prior and better known otherwise than the Philosopher here does.
        For it has been pointed out already that every genus is divided by
        potency and act. Now potency and act, since they are among the first
        differences of being, are naturally prior to motion, and it is these
        that the Philosopher uses to define motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consider, therefore, that something is in act only, something is in
        potency only, something else is midway between potency and act. What is
        in potency only is not yet being moved; what is already in perfect act
        is not being moved but has already been moved. Consequently, that is
        being moved which is midway between pure potency and act, which is
        partly in potency and partly in act—as is evident in alteration. [or
        when water is only potentially hot, it is not being moved; when it has
        now been heated, the motion of heating is finished; but when it
        possesses “ some heat, through imperfectly, then it is being moved—for
        whatever is being heated gradually acquires heat step by step. Therefore
        this imperfect act of heat existing in a heatable object is motion—not,
        indeed, by reason of what the heatable object has already become, but
        inasmuch as, being already in act, it has an order to a further act. For
        should this order to a further act be taken away, the act already
        present, however, imperfect, would be the term of motion and not motion
        itself—as happens when something becomes half-heated. This order to a
        further act belongs to the thing that is in potency to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, if the imperfect act were considered solely as ordered to a
        further act, under its aspect of potency, it would not have the nature
        of motion but of a principle of motion—for heating can begin from either
        a cold or a lukewarm object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The imperfect act, therefore, has the character of motion both insofar
        as is compared, as potency, to a further act, and insofar as it is
        compared, as act, to something more imperfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, motion is neither the potency of a thing existing in potency, nor
        the act of a thing in act, but it is the act of a thing in potency;
        where the word “act” designates its relation to a prior potency, and the
        words “of a thing in potency” designates its relation to a further act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Whence the Philosopher most aptly defines motion as the
        <i>entelechy</i>, i.e., the act, of a thing existing in potency insofar
        as it is in potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        286. Then [195] he gives examples from all the species of motion—as, for
        example, alteration is the act of the alterable insofar as it is
        alterable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And because motion in quantity and in substance does not have a single
        name in the same way as motion in quality is called “alteration,” he
        gives two different names for the motions in quantity, and says that the
        act of the increasable, and of its opposite, i.e., the decreasable, for
        which two there is no common name, is “increase” and “decrease.”
        Similarly, the acts of the generable and of the corruptible are
        “generation” and “corruption”; and the act of what is mutable in regard
        to place is called “change of place.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this section the Philosopher uses the word “motion” for any kind of
        change and avoids the strict usage in which “motion” is distinct from
        “generation” and “corruption,” as will be said in Book V.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        287. Then [196] he explains the several words of the definition:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        He explains the use of the word “act”;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        He explains “of a thing existing in potency,” at 288.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;

        "
      >
        He explains “insofar as it is such,” at 289.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As to the first he uses this reasoning. That by which something
        previously existing in potency becomes actual is an act. But something
        becomes actual when it is being moved, although previously it was in
        potency. Therefore motion is an act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore that it is plain that motion is an act from the fact
        that the “buildable” implies a potency to something, but when the
        “buildable” according to this potency which it implies, is being reduced
        to act, we then say it is “being built”—and this act is “building” taken
        passively. And the same thing is true in all other motions such as
        indoctrination, healing, rolling, jumping, youth (i.e., increase),old
        age (i.e., decrease).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For it must be remembered that before something is being moved it is in
        potency to two acts: to a perfect act which is the term of the motion,
        and to an imperfect act which is motion itself. Thus water, before it
        begins to be heated, is in potency to being heated and to having been
        heated: when it is being heated it is being reduced to the imperfect act
        which is motion but not yet to perfect act which is the term of the
        motion—rather, in respect to this it still remains in potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        288. Then [1977 he shows that motion is the act “of a thing existing in
        potency.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For every act is strictly the act of that in which it is always found—as
        light is never found but in the transparent, for which reason it is the
        act of the transparent. But motion is found always in a thing existing
        in potency. Therefore, motion is the act of a thing existing in potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To explain the second proposition he says that, since certain same
        things are both in potency and in act, although not at the same time,
        nor in the same respect—as, for example, something is hot actually and
        cold potentially it follows that many things mutually act and are acted
        upon insofar, namely, as both are in potency and in act with respect to
        the other under different aspects. And because all lower natural bodies
        share the same matter, there is therefore in each of them a potency to
        what is actual in another. Hence, in all such bodies something
        simultaneously acts and is acted upon, both moves and is moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This fact had led some to say absolutely that every mover is likewise
        being moved. This point will be cleared up in a later place. For it will
        be shown in <i>Physics</i> VIII (l.9 ff.) and in <i>Metaphysics</i> XII
        (l.7) that there exists an immobile mover, since it is not in potency
        but in act only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But when that which is in potency, yet existing in a certain way in act,
        either acts itself or is acted upon by another so far as it is movable,
        i.e., is reduced to the act of motion, whether moved by itself or by
        another, at such time motion is its act. That is why things in potency,
        whether they act or are acted upon, are moved, since when acting they
        are acted upon and when moving they are being moved—just as fire, when
        it acts on logs, it acted upon, insofar as it becomes more dense through
        smoke, flame being nothing more than smoke afire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        289. Then [198] he explains this part of the definition, “insofar as it
        is such”:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">By an example;</p>

        style="

        By giving a reason, at 290.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first that the phrase, “insofar as it is such,” had to
        be added, because what is in potency is at the same time something in
        act. And although the subject which is both in potency and in act may be
        the same, nevertheless to be in potency and to be in act is not
        contained under the same notion. Thus, although brass is a statue in
        potency but is brass actually, nevertheless the notion of the brass as
        brass is not the same as the notion of the brass as it is in potency to
        a statue. Now motion is not an act of the brass insofar as it is brass
        but insofar as it is in potency to a statue; otherwise. during the whole
        time that it was brass it would be undergoing motion, which is clearly
        false. That is why it is necessary to add “insofar as it is such.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        290. Then [199] he explains the same thing by using an argument based on
        the nature of contraries. For it is clear that a given subject is in
        potency to contraries—as a humor or the blood is in potency to health
        and to sickness. But to be in potency to health is one thing and to be
        in potency to sickness is another, if one considers their objects.
        Otherwise, if to be able to be sick and to be able to be well were the
        same thing, it then would follow that being sick and being well would be
        the same. Hence to be able to be sick and to be able to be healthy are
        different notions, although their actual subject is one and the same
        thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is plain, therefore, that there is not one and the same notion of the
        subject as it is a certain being, and as it is in potency to something
        else. Otherwise, potency to contrary things would fall under one and the
        same notion. In like manner, the notion of that which is “color” and
        that which is “visible” are not one and the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus it was necessary to say that motion is the act of the possible
        “insofar as it is possible”—to prevent supposing that it is the act of
        what is in potency insofar as it is merely some subject.

        291. Having given the definition of motion and an explanation of each of
        the words in the definition, the Philosopher now shows it to be a good
        definition:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Directly;</p>
      <p
        style="

        Indirectly, at 293.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        292. In regard to the first [200] he uses the following argument:
        Everything which is in potency may at some time be in act; butt he
        “buildable” is in potency. Therefore, there may. at some time be an act
        of the “buildable” insofar as it is buildable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this act is either the house itself or the building of it. But
        “house” is not the act of the “buildable” insofar as it is “buildable.”
        Since the “buildable” as such is being reduced into act when the
        building is taking place, but when the house now exists, it is no longer
        being built. Hence, building is an act of the buildable as such.
        Building, however, is a certain motion. Motion, therefore, is the act of
        a thing existing in potency as such. The same is true of other motions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear, therefore, that motion is the type of act above-described,
        and that something is being moved only when it is in such an act, and
        neither before nor after—not before, since if it is only in potency the
        motion has not begun; nor after, since it has now completely ceased to
        be in potency, by virtue of being in perfect act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        293. Then [201] he shows indirectly that it is a good definition by
        showing that motion cannot be defined in any other way. In regard to
        this he does three things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        He proposes what he intends;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        He presents definitions given by others and rejects them, at 294.
      </p>
      <p
        style="

        "
      >
        He explains why others defined motion as they did, at 295.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore that two things show why the definition given of
        motion is a good one:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, because the definitions that others have given are unsuitable;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, because it is impossible to define motion otherwise than as
        Aristotle has defined it, the reason being that motion cannot be placed
        in any other genus but that of “act of a thing existing in potency.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        294. Then [202] he excludes the definitions of motion given by others.
        These followed a three-fold course in their definitions. For they said
        that motion is “otherness,” because the thing being moved constantly
        changes from one state to another. Similarly, they said motion is
        “unequalness,” because the thing being moved approaches its term always
        more and more. They also said that motion is “non-being,” because the
        thing being moved does not yet have that to which it is being moved as
        long as it is being moved—as that which is being moved toward whiteness
        is not yet white.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These definitions the Philosopher destroys in three ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He does so first by looking at the subject of motion. For if motion were
        “otherness” or “unequalness” or”non-being,” then whatever would possess
        any one of these three characteristics would of necessity be undergoing
        motion—in whatever this motion is, that thing is being moved. But things
        that are other are not necessarily being moved by the fact that they are
        “other,” nor by the fact that they are “unequal,” nor by the fact that
        they “do not exist.” It follows, therefore, that otherness and
        unequalness and non-being are not motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, he shows the same thing by looking at the term to which the
        motion is tending for motion and change do not tend more to “otherness”
        than to “likeness,” or to “unequalness” more than to “equality,” or to
        “non-being” more than to “being.” For generation is a change to “being”,
        and corruption to “non-being.” Hence motion is not “otherness” any more
        than “a likeness,” “unequalness” any more than “equalness,”
        “non-being”any more than “being.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, he shows the same thing by looking at the term from which the
        motion begins since just as some motions start from otherness and from
        unequalness and from non-being, so others start from their opposites.
        Hence there is no reason to place motion in the afore-mentioned genera
        any more than in their opposites.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        295. Then [203] he points out why some defined motion in the aforesaid
        ways. In regard to this he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First he assigns the reason of what has already been stated.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he explains a supposition he had made, at 296.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore that the reason why the older philosophers placed
        motion in the above-mentioned genera (namely, “otherness,” “unequalness”
        and “non-being”) is that motion seems to be something indeterminate,
        i.e., something incomplete and imperfect as though possessing no
        determinate nature. And because it is indeterminate, its proper place
        seemed to be in the genus of privation. For when Pythagoras laid down
        two ordinations of reality, in each of which he placed ten principles,
        the principles in the second group were said by him to be indeterminate
        because they were privative. They were not, indeed, determined by a form
        in the genus of substance, nor by the form of quality, or by any special
        form in either of these genera or by the form of any of the other
        predicaments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In one of these groups the Pythagoreans placed ten things: finite,
        unequal, one, right, male, rest, straight, light, good, equilateral
        triangle; in the other they placed: infinite, equal, many, left, female,
        motion, oblique, dark, evil and scalene triangle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        296. Then [204] he gives the reason why motion is placed among the
        indeterminates. And he says that the reason for this is that motion
        cannot be placed either in potency or in act. For if it were placed
        under potency, whatever would be in potency, for example, to quantity,
        would be being moved according to quantity. If, on the other hand, it
        were included under act, then whatever things were actually quantified
        would be being moved according to quantity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now it is indeed true that motion is act, yet it is imperfect act, a
        medium between potency and act. And that it is imperfect act is clear
        from the fact that that of which it is an act is a being in potency as
        stated above (l.2, no.285). And that is why it is difficult to grasp
        what motion is. For at first sight It seems to be either entirely act or
        entirely potency or else to be contained under privation as it seemed to
        the ancients who called it “non-being” or “unequalness.” But none of
        these is possible, as we have shown above (no.294). Hence it follows
        that there is just one way to define motion; namely, that it is the kind
        of act we have said, i.e., that of a thing existing in potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is difficult to dwell on such an act on account of the commingling of
        act and potency; yet that there should be such an act is not
        impossible,.but contingent.

        297. After defining motion, the Philosopher now shows whose act motion
        is, i.e., whether it is the act of the mobile or of the mover. Also it
        may be said that he gives another definition of notion which is related
        to the previous one as material to formal and as a conclusion to its
        principle. And this is the definition: motion is “the act of the mobile
        inasmuch as it is mobile.” This definition is a conclusion from the
        previous one. For since motion is “the act of a thing existing in
        potency inasmuch as it is in potence,” and since that which exists in
        potency as such is the mobile and not the mover (for the mover as such
        is in act), it follows that motion is an act of the mobile as such.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        298. In regard to the main question he does three things:

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In investigating the definition he shows that “to be moved” even occurs
        to the mover. In regard to this he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        He shows that every mover is being moved;
      </p>

        "
      >
        He shows why that happens, at 301.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        299. He shows in two ways that the mover is moved. This is so first of
        all because anything that is previously in potency and then in act is
        somehow being moved. But movers are found that are previously movers in
        potency and afterwards movers in act; therefore they are moved. He
        states, therefore, that every mover, since it is such that it is in
        potency to being a mover, is likewise moved. This is clear from what has
        been already said, for it was said that motion is an act of a thing
        existing in potency and this occurs in every natural mover; that is why
        it was said above that every physical mover is moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        300. Secondly [206] he brings out the same point in another way:
        Whatsoever’s immobility is its rest is capable of motion; for rest and
        motion, since they are opposites, happen to the same. But the immobility
        of a mover, i.e., its ceasing from moving, is called rest; for there are
        things which said to rest when they cease to act. Therefore every such
        mover, i.e., one whose immobility is rest, is moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        301. Then [207] he shows why it happens that a mover is moved. For it
        does not happen precisely because it is a mover but because it is such
        by touching; because to move is to act in order to cause something to be
        moved and what is so acted upon by the mover is moved. But whatever acts
        does so by touching, for bodies act by touching; hence it follows that
        what acts is at the same time acted upon, because that which touches is
        acted upon. However, this must be understood of those cases where there
        is mutual touching; namely, when the thing touching is also touched, as
        happens in things which are material, where both of the things are acted
        upon when they touch one another. But heavenly bodies, because they do
        not have material like the lower bodies, so act on them that they are
        not acted upon in return and they touch without being touched as is
        stated in <i>De Generatione</i> I (l.18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        302. Then [208] he posits a definition of motion concluding from the
        aforesaid that although the mover is moved, motion nevertheless is not
        an act of the mover but of the mobile inasmuch as it is mobile. He shows
        this subsequently by the fact that “to be moved” is accidental to the
        mover and does not belong essentially to it. Whence, if something is
        moved precisely inasmuch as its act is motion it follows that motion is
        an act not of the mover but of the mobile, not, indeed, insofar as it is
        a mover but insofar as it is a mobile.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That “to be moved” is accidental to the mover is clear from what was
        pointed out in the earlier part of this lecture; for the act of the
        mobile which is motion happens from its contact with the mover; from
        which it follows that at the same time that it is acting it is acted
        upon and thus “to be moved” is accidental to the mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That “to be moved” does not belong essentially to the mover is clear
        from the fact that some form is always seen to be the mover—as the form
        which is in the genus of substance is the mover in substantial change,
        and a form in the genus of quality is the mover in alteration, and a
        form in the genus of quantity in growth and decrease. Forms of this type
        are the causes and principles of motions, since every agent moves
        according to its form. For every agent acts inasmuch it is actual—as an
        actual man makes an actual man of man in potency. Hence, since it is
        through its form that a thing is actual it follows that form is the
        moving principle. Thus “to move” belongs to a thing inasmuch as it has a
        form through which it is actual. Wherefore, since motion. is the act of
        a thing existing in potency, as said above (l.2, no.285), it follows
        that motion belongs to a thing not insofar as it is a mover but insofar
        as it is mobile. For that reason the definition says that motion is an
        act of the mobile inasmuch as it is mobile.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        303. Then [209] he shows a difficulty that arises from the aforesaid.
        For some wonder whether motion is in the mover or in the mobile. But
        this doubt is solved from what went before. For it is clear that an act
        of anything is in that thing of which it is the act. Thus, it is plain
        that the act of motion is in the mobile, since it is an act of the
        mobile, although caused in it by the mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        304. Then [2167 he shows how motion and mover are related. And first of
        all he proposes his intention, saying that the act of the mover is not
        distinct from the act of the mobile. Hence since motion is an act of the
        mobile it is somehow also an act of the mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        305. Secondly [211] he explains this. And in regard to this he does
        three things. First he shows that there is an act of the mover as well
        as of the mobile. For whatever is described according to potency and act
        has some act competent to it. Now just as that which is moved is called
        “mobile” in potency since it is capable of being moved, and is called
        “moved” according to act inasmuch it is actually being moved, so on the
        part of the mover, a mover is described “potential mover” inasmuch as it
        is able to move, and “moves” in the act inasmuch as it actually acts.
        Therefore some act is competent to both, i.e., to mover and to mobile.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        306. Secondly [212] he shows that the act of the mover and of the mobile
        is the same act. For something is called “mover” inasmuch as it acts and
        “moved” inasmuch as it is being acted upon. But what the mover causes by
        acting and what the moved receives is being acted upon are one and the
        same. thing. And this is what he means when he says that the mover
        actualizes the mobile, i.e., causes the act of the mobile. Wherefore,
        they must both, namely, mover and moved, have the same act; for what is
        from the mover as agent cause is the same as what is in the moved as
        patient and receiver.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        307. Thirdly [213] he illustrates this by an example. For the distance
        from one to two is the same as that from two to one, but they differ
        according to conception; for in relating two to one we have “double,”
        but in relating one to two we have “one-half.” The same thing is true of
        the distance covered by one ascending and by one descending, but by
        reason of the diversity of starting point and term, one is called
        “ascent” and one “descent.” A parallel case is true of the mover and of
        the thing moved. For motion, inasmuch as it proceeds from the mover into
        the mobile, is an act of the mover, but inasmuch as it is in the mobile
        from the mover, it is an act of the mobile.

        308. After showing that motion is the act both of the mobile and of the
        mover, the Philosopher now raises a difficulty on this point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he raises the difficulty:
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;

        "
      >
        Secondly, he solves it, at 314.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Regarding the first, he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he prefaces certain things to the difficulty;
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he builds up the difficulty, at 310.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        309. He says therefore [214] that what has been said above now causes a
        “rational”, i.e., logical, “defect,” i.e., doubt—by virtue of there
        being probable reasons for both sides. In introducing the difficulty he
        says that there is an act in that which is active and there is an act in
        that which is passive, just as above (no. 305) there was stated to be an
        act of the mover and of the moved. As a matter of fact, the act of the
        active is called “action” and the act of the passive is called
        “passion”. This he proves by saying that the work and end of anything is
        its act and perfection; hence, since the work and end of the agent is
        action and that of the patient is passion (or undergoing), it follows
        that action is the act of the agent and passion that of the patient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        310. Then [215] he develops this doubt. For it is clear that both action
        and passion are motion; for each is the same as motion. Therefore,
        action and passion are either the same motion or diverse motions. If
        they are diverse, then each of them must be in some subject. Either both
        will be in the patient, i.e., the thing moved, or one of them (action)
        is in the agent and the other (passion) is in the patient. To say the
        opposite, i.e., that what is in the agent is passion and what is in the
        patient is action is to speak equivocally, or it would be calling
        passion action and vice vers.& The fourth possibility, namely, that both
        are in the agent is left out, but this is because it has already been
        shown (nos. 302-303) that motion is in the mobile, which excludes the
        fourth possibility that neither be in the patient but both in the agent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        311. Of the two possibilities listed, he develops the second one first
        [216]. For if anyone says that action is in the agent and passion in the
        patient, then since action is a certain motion, as was stated (no. 310),
        it follows that motion is in the mover. For the same thing should be
        true both of the mover and of the moved, namely, that if motion is in
        either one it is being moved. Or else, that is true of the mover and of
        the moved which is true of the patient and of the agent. Now, if motion
        is in something, that thing is being moved; wherefore, it follows that
        either every mover is being moved or that something has motion but is
        not being moved; each of these seems unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        312. Then [217] he develops the second possibility given in 310. He says
        that if anyone should say that both of them, namely, action and passion,
        since they are two motions, are in the patient, which is equivalent to
        saying that teaching which is on the part of the teacher and learning
        which is on the part of the learner are both in the learner, then two
        conflicts arise. The first is that if what we said previously is true,
        namely, that action is an act of the agent, then if action is not in the
        agent but in the patient, it will follow that the proper act of each
        thing is not in the thing of which it is the act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Then another conflict follows, namely, that one and the same thing is
        being moved according to two motions. For action and passion are now
        supposed to be two motions. Now in whatever thing there is a motion that
        thing is being moved according to that motion; if then action and
        passion are in the mobile, it follows that the mobile is being moved
        according to two motions. This would be tantamount to having two
        alterations in one subject both of them specifically the same; for
        example, one subject being moved to two whitenings, which is impossible.
        This does not mean that one subject could not be moved by two
        alterations tending toward two specifically different terms, for
        example, whitening and heating. Nevertheless, it is clear that action
        and passion terminate at the same specific term; for what the agent does
        and what the patient receives are one and the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        313. Then [218] he develops the other possibility. For it could be said
        that action and passion are not two motions but one. But this leads to
        four difficulties. The first is that the act of things of different
        species would be the same. For it has been already pointed out (no. 309)
        that action is an act of the agent and passion ant act of the patient
        and that these are specifically diverse; but if action and passion are
        the same motion then the act of specifically different things will be
        the same. The second difficulty is that if action and passion are one
        motion, then action is the same as passion, so that teaching which is
        laid to the teacher is the same as learning which is in the learner. The
        third difficulty is that acting would be the same as being acted upon
        and teaching would be the same as learning. The fourth difficulty that
        follows from this is that every teacher would be learning and every
        agent would be being acted upon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        314. Then [2197] he solves the difficulty. From what was settled
        previously, (nos. 304,306) it is clear that action and passion are not
        two motions but one and the same motion; for insofar as motion is from
        the agent it is called “action,” and insofar as it is in the patient it
        is called “passion.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        315. Hence not all the conflicts which follow from the first case, in
        which it was supposed that action and passion are two motions, have to
        be solved. But one remains to be solved even on the supposition that
        action and passion are one motion: because since action is an act of the
        agent, then if action and passion are one motion, it follows that the
        act of the agent is somehow in the patient and thus the act of one thing
        will be in something else. This remaining difficulty together with the
        four listed in 313 leave five to be solved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        316. He says in the first place that there is nothing wrong with an act
        of one thing being in something else, for teaching is an act of the
        teacher, an act continuously tending from him into someone else without
        interruption; hence, this act which is the agent’s as being “from which”
        is the very one which is in the patient as received in him. But it would
        be wrong if the act of the one were the act of the other in precisely
        the same way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        317. Then [220] he solves another difficulty; namely, that there would
        be one and the same act for two diverse things. And he says that there
        is nothing to prevent one act belonging to two things so long as it is
        not one and the same in aspect but only in reality, as was already
        explained above (no. 307) when it was pointed out that the distance from
        one to two and from two to one are the same; and of that which is in
        potency looking toward the agent and conversely. For in these cases the
        same one reality is assigned to two things according to different
        aspects: it is assigned to the agent inasmuch as it is from it and to
        the patient inasmuch as it is in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        318. The three remaining difficulties of which one followed logically
        from the other he takes care of in reverse order. He disposes first of
        the last difficulty deduced, because it is so evidently improper. Thus
        he is now, thirdly, settling the fifth difficulty. He says that it is
        not necessary to say that one who is teaching is learning or that an
        agent is being acted upon just because to act and to be acted upon are
        the same, as long as we understand that they are not the same in the way
        that dress and clothing are the same (for these are the same in motion)
        but in the way, as said above (nos. 307,318), that the road from Thebes
        to Athens and from Athens to Thebes are the same, i.e., as being the
        same as to subject but differing as to notion. For it is not necessary
        that things which are somehow the same should be the same in all ways;
        that is true only of things that are the same in subject or reality and
        also in motion. And therefore even granting that to act and to be acted
        upon are the same, yet since they are not the same in notion, it will
        not follow that it is the same for an object to act and to be acted
        upon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        319. Then [221] he answers the fourth difficulty. And he says that even
        though teaching and the doctrine of the learner were the same, it does
        not follow that to teach and to learn are the same; because teaching and
        doctrine are abstract terms, whereas to teach and to learn are concrete.
        Hence they are being applied to ends or to terms which serve as the
        basis for the difference in notion between action and passion. For just
        as the distance between two points is one and the same space in the
        abstract, yet if we apply it to two concrete places it is not one and
        the same, as when we say that there is a distance between here and there
        and between there and here.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        320. Then [222] he answers the third difficulty by destroying the
        inference that if action and passion are one motion, they are the same.
        And he says it necessary to say finally that it does not follow that
        action and passion are the same or that teaching and learning are, but
        rather that the motion in which both are is the same. This motion as a
        matter of fact is action from one viewpoint and passion from another.
        For it is one thing as to notion to be an act of a thing as being in it
        and another to be the act of a thing as being from it. Now motion is
        called “action” inasmuch as it is an act of the agent as from the agent;
        it is called “passion” inasmuch as it is an act of the patient as in the
        patient. Thus it is clear that although the motion of the mover and of
        the moved is the same thing due to the fact that motion as such
        abstracts from these aspects, yet action and passion differ due to the
        fact that these aspects are included in their signification. From this
        it is also apparent that since motion abstracts from the notion of
        action and passion, it belongs neither in the predicament “action” nor
        in the predicament “passion,” as some supposed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        321. But two difficulties still remain with respect to this. The first
        is this: if action and passion are one motion, and they differ merely in
        thought, as said above (no. 317), it seems that they should not be
        listed as two distinct predicaments, since the predicaments are genera
        of things. Secondly, if motion is either action or passion, motion will
        not be found in substance, quality, quantity, and place, as said above
        (no. 286), but only in action and passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        322. To settle this matter it must be remembered that being is divided
        into the ten predicaments not univocally, as a genus into its species,
        but according to the diverse manner of existing. Now the modes of
        existing are parallel to the modes of predicating. For in predicating
        something of something, we say that this is that; that is why the ten
        genera of being are called “predicaments.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now every predication takes place in one of three ways. One way is to
        predicate of a subject that which pertains to its essence, as when I say
        “Socrates is man” or “Man is animal.” According to this the predicament
        of “substance” is taken.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another way is to predicate of a subject something that is not of its
        essence but yet inheres in the subject, This inherent thing may be
        traceable to the matter in the subject, in which case one has the
        predicament of “quantity” (for quantity is properly a result of matter;
        for which reason Plato traced the “large” to matter); or it is traceable
        to the form and in this case, there is the predicament of “quality” (for
        which reason qualities are founded on quality, as color in a surface,
        and figure in lines or in a plane); or the predication may be due to a
        relation existing between subject and something else and thus we have
        the predicament of “relation”, (for when I say, “The man is a father,”
        it is not something absolute that is predicated of the man but a
        relation in him to something without).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third mode of predicating is when something outside the subject is
        predicated after the manner of denomination; this allows even extrinsic
        accidents to be predicated of substance; but yet we do not say that man
        is whiteness but that man is white. To be denominated by something
        extrinsic can occur, generally speaking, to all things in one way or
        another, and in a special way in those matters that refer only to man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Speaking generally, a thing can be denominated by something extrinsic
        either according to the notion of cause or according to that of measure.
        For something is denominated “caused” or “measured” on account of its
        relationship to something extrinsic. Now there are four genera of
        causes, two of which are parts of the essence, namely, matter and form;
        hence any predication based on these two pertains to the predicament of
        “substance,” as when I say that man is rational and man is corporeal. In
        regard to the other two causes, the final cause does not cause
        separately from the agent; for the end is a cause only insofar as it
        influences the agent. Therefore, the only cause according to which a
        thing can be denominated something as based on something extrinsic is
        the agent cause. Consequently, when something is denominated from the
        agent cause, it is the predicament of “passion,” for to undergo
        (<i>pati</i>) is nothing but the undergoing of something from an agent;
        on the other hand, if the agent cause is denominated something on
        account of its effect, one has the predicament of “action,” for action
        is an act from the agent into something else, as stated above (no, 316).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to measures, it will be either intrinsic or extrinsic. An
        intrinsic measure would be a thing’s own length and width and depth: in
        these cases a subject is being denominated something by reason of what
        inheres intrinsically; hence this Pertains to the predicament quantity.
        The extrinsic measures are time and place. It is the predicament “when”,
        whenever something is denominated by time; when it is denominated by
        place, it is the predicament “where” or the predicament “situs”, which
        adds to “where” the order of the parts in place. Such an order of parts
        is not considered in regard to the measure which is time, for the order
        of parts in time in time is already implied in the notion of time; for
        time is the number of motion according to the order of the “before” and
        the “after” [its parts]. Thus it is through denomination from time or
        place that something is said to be “when” or “where”.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is a special predicament for men. For in other animals nature
        provided the requirements for preserving life, such as horns for
        defense, a tough and wooly hide as a covering, claws or the like for
        proceeding without harm. Hence, when by reason of this equipment animals
        are said to be “armed” or “covered” or “shod,” they are somehow so
        called not by reason of something; extrinsic but of something intrinsic,
        which is part of them. Hence, such are referred to the predicament of
        “substance,” as the same would be if man were said to be “endowed with
        hands” or “feet.” But the other things could not be endowed upon man by
        nature, both because they would be out of keeping with the subtlety of
        his complexion and because reason makes man capable of an enormous
        number of works for the performance of which nature could not have
        endowed him with specific instruments. In the place of all these
        instruments man has reason, which he can use to make for himself the
        things that are intrinsic to other animals. So when a man is said to be
        armed or clothed or shod, he is denominated thus by reason of something
        extrinsic to him that is neither a cause nor a measure; hence it is
        located in a special predicament called “habitus.” But we should not
        fail to note that this predicament is in certain matters used also for
        other animals not inasmuch as they are considered in their nature but
        insofar as they are put at the service of man: thus we that a horse is
        caparisoned or saddled or armed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        323. This makes it clear that although motion is one, yet there are two
        predicaments which are based on motion depending on the different
        external things according to which the predicamental denominations are
        made. For an agent is one thing from which as from something external
        the predicament of “passion” is taken; and the patient is some other
        thing from which something in denominated an agent. This solves the
        first difficulty (mentioned in 321).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        324. The second doubt is easy to solve. For the idea of motion depends
        not only on that which pertains to motion in reality but also on that
        which reason apprehends. In reality, motion is nothing more than an
        imperfect act which is a sort of beginning of a perfect act in that
        which is being moved; thus, in that which is becoming white, some
        whiteness has begun to be. But in order that what is imperfect have the
        aspect of motion it is further required that we understand it as a
        medium between two: the preceding one of them is compared to motion as
        potency to act (whence motion is called act); the consequent one is
        compared to motion as the perfect to the imperfect or as act to potency,
        wherefore motion is called “the act of a being that exists in potency,”
        as we said above (no. 285). But anything imperfect, if it is not
        considered to be tending on to something other as perfect, is called the
        terminus of motion and one will not have a motion according to which
        something is being moved; as, for example, if something should start to
        become white and then the alteration was immediately stopped.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, in regard to what there is of motion in external reality,
        motion is placed reductively in that genus which terminates the motion,
        as the imperfect is reduced to the perfect, as stated above (no. 281).
        But in regard to what reason apprehends about motion, namely, that it is
        midway between two-terms, here the notion of cause and effect are
        brought in; because for something to be reduced from potency to act an
        agent cause is required. From this aspect, motion pertains to the
        predicaments of “action” and “passion”; for these two predicaments are
        based on the notions of acting cause and of effect, as was said above
        (no. 322).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        325. Then [223] he defines motion more particularly. He says that we
        have pointed out what motion is both in general and in
        particular—because from what was said about the definition of motion in
        general is clear how it can be defined in particular. For if motion is
        the act of the mobile as such, it follows that alteration is the act of
        the, alterable as alterable, and so on for other particular kinds of
        motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And because there was a doubt whether motion is an act of the mover or
        of the mobile and we showed(no. 320) that it is an act of the active as
        from it and of the passive as in it, then to remove any further doubts
        we can say somewhat more explicitly that motion is an act of the potency
        of that which is active and of that which is passive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this way we could have said that building is an act of the “builder”
        and. of the “buildable as buildable”; the same is true of healing and of
        other motions.

        327. He proves the first point with an argument and a sign.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument is as follows: Natural science studies magnitudes and time
        and motion. But in such things the finite and infinite are necessarily
        found for every magnitude or motion or time is contained under one or
        the other, i.e., either the finite or the infinite. Therefore, it
        pertains ta natural science to consider the infinite, namely, as to
        whether it exists and as to what it is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But because it could be objected that consideration of the infinite
        pertains to first philosophy, on account of its general character, he
        counters this by saying that not every being has to be either finite or
        infinite; for a point and a passion, i.e., passible [sensible] quality,
        are not contained under either, whereas the objects of consideration in
        first philosophy are things that follow upon being inasmuch as it is
        being and not upon some definite genus of being.

        tho. practice of the natural philosophers. For all who have treated
        this, namely, natural philosophy, according to reason, have mentioned
        the infinite. This fact is a probable argument, based on the authority

        330. He says therefore that while all the philosophers posited the
        infinite as a certain principle of things, only the Pythagoreans and
        Platonists asserted that the infinite is not something accidental to
        some nature but something existing of itself. This is not surprising,
        because it is in keeping with their claim that numbers and quantities
        are the substances of things. Now the infinite is found in quantity;
        hence they posited that the infinite exists of itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        331. Then [227] he shows the difference between Plato and the
        Pythagorean, first, as to the laying down of the infinite; secondly, as
        to the basis thereof (no. 332).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Regarding the laying down of the infinite, Plato differed in two
        respects from the Pythagoreans. For the Pythagoreans did not lay down an
        infinite except in sensible things. Since the infinite belongs to
        quantity, and the first quantity is number, the Pythagoreans, not laying
        down number to be separated from sensible things, but stating number to
        be, rather, the substance of sensible things, consequently did not lay
        down any infinite except in sensible things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Likewise Pythagoras considered that the sensible beings which are within
        the confines of the heavens are circumscribed by the heavens—whence the
        infinite cannot be in them—hence he laid down that the infinite was in
        the sensible things outside the heavens,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But Plato by contrast laid down that nothing is outside the heavens. For
        neither did he say that there was outside the heavens any sensible body,
        since he maintained that the heavens contained all sensible things; nor
        did he say that the ideas and species of things, which he laid down as
        being separated, were outside the heavens, since “inside of” and
        “outside of” signify place, while the ideas, according to him, are not
        in any place, place being of corporeal things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Plato likewise said that the infinite is not only in sensible things,
        but also in “them”, i.e., the separated ideas, there being, even in the
        separated numbers something formal, such as unity, and something
        material, such as duality, out of which all numbers are composed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        332. Then [228] he shows the difference between them as to the basis of
        the infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And he says that the Pythagoreans attributed the infinite to a basis
        which was “even number.” And they demonstrated this in two ways. The
        first was an argument. That which is enclosed by another, and is
        terminated by another has the nature of the infinite; whereas that which
        encloses and terminated has the nature of a term. Now even number is
        comprehended and included under odd number. For if some even number is
        proposed, it is seen as in every way divisible. But when by the addition
        of unity it is reduced to an odd number, it now takes on a certain
        indivisibility, as though even was compressed under odd. Hence it seems
        as though “even” is infinite in itself, and causes infinity in others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, the same is shown by an example. To follow it one must know
        that in geometry a “gnomon” is the name for a square on the diameter
        with two supplements [i.e., three squares put together to form the shape
        of an “L”]. If a square is added to this gnomon, a square is
        constituted. From this likeness those numbers may be called “gnomons”
        which are added to certain numbers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Here one should notice that if one takes the odd numbers according to
        the order of natural progression, and to unity, which is a square as to
        power (since one times one is one), one adds the first odd number,
        namely, three, there will be constituted four, which is a squared number
        since twice two is four. If now to this second square there is added the
        second odd number, namely, five, one obtains nine, which is the square
        of three, since three times three is nine. Then if to this third square
        there is added the third odd number, namely, seven, one obtains sixteen,
        which is the square of four. And thus, following the ordered addition of
        odd numbers, there always arises the same form in those numbers, namely,
        a square.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        By the addition of even numbers, however, there is always produced a
        different shape. For if the first even number, namely, two, be added to
        unity, there arises three, which has a triangular figure; if then to
        this there be added the second even number, namely, four, one has seven,
        which is in the shape of a heptagon. And thus, in this wise the figure
        of the resulting numbers constantly varies with the addition of even
        numbers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And this appears to be a sign that uniformity belongs to odd number,
        while difformity and variation and the infinite belong to even number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence he says, namely, that a sign of this, i.e., that infinity follows
        even number, is what occurs in numbers. For by the addition of gnomons,
        i.e., numbers, to one, i.e., to unity, and outside, i.e., to other
        numbers, sometimes there occurs another species, i.e., another natural
        form, namely, when one adds an even number; sometimes there occurs a
        single species, namely, when one adds an odd number. [rom this it is
        evident why Pythagoras attributed infinity to even number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But Plato attributed it to two roots, namely, to the “large” and the
        “small.” Tor these two, according to him, belong to matter, to which in
        turn the infinite belongs.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        333. Then [229] he gives the opinions of the natural philosophers about
        the infinite. He says that all the natural philosophers, those, namely,
        who gave natural [i.e., sensible principles for things, taught that the
        infinite does not subsist by itself, as said above (no. 330), but is an
        accident of some nature. Hence those who posited just one material
        principle (some member of the list of things called elements, i.e., air
        or water or something intermediate) said it was infinite. But of those
        who posited a finite number of principles, none supposed them to be
        infinite in quantity: for the very distinction of the elements seemed to
        conflict with the notion that they could be infinite. But those who
        posited. an infinitude of principles said that from all those infinites
        was formed one infinite through contact.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        334. Those who taught this were Anaxagoraa and Democritus, who differed
        in two respects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They differed first as to the nature of the infinite principles: for
        Anaxagoras taught that the infinite principles were infinite similar
        parts of flesh and of bone and so on; but Democritus taught that-they
        were indivisible bodies differing in figure. He said these bodies were
        the seeds of all of nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another difference was as in the relation of these principles one to the
        other. For Anaxagoras said that each of these parts was a mixture of all
        the others, so that in each part of flesh there was bone and vice versa
        and the same for the other parts. He came to this opinion because he saw
        that anything came from anything; and, hence, since he believed that
        whatever comes to be from something is in it, he concluded that
        everything is in everything. And from this he seems to assert that at
        some time all things were commingled and nothing was distinct from
        anything else. Just as this flesh and this bone are commingled (which is
        proved by the generation of one from the other) so is everything else
        commingled. Therefore at one time all things were together. For it is
        necessary to posit a principle of separation not only in one single
        thing but in all things simultaneously. He proved this thus: Whatever
        comes to be from something other was previously commingled with it and
        is produced by being separated from it; but all things are produced,
        though not all at the same time; therefore, there must be some one
        principle generating not only each thing but all things. This one
        principle he called “intellect,” which alone has the capacity to
        separate and bring together because it is itself uncommingled.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now whatever comes to be through intellect seems to have a principle;
        because intellect acts by starting from a definite principle. Therefore,
        if separation is brought about by intellect, separation must have a
        principle; hence, he concluded, at some time all things were together
        and the motion by which things were separated one from the other began
        in time, and did not previously exist. Thus Anaxagoras laid down one
        principle as producing another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But Democritus said that one principle is not derived from another, but
        that the nature of body which is common to all indivisible bodies,
        though different in parts and figure, is the principle of all things
        according to magnitude, for he posited that all divisible magnitudes are
        composed of indivisibles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And thus does Aristotle conclude that to consider the infinite pertains
        to the natural philosopher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        335. Then [230] he outlines four points of agreement among the early
        philosophers in regard to the infinite. The first of which is that all
        posited the infinite as a principle, and this “reasonably” i.e., for the
        following reason: If the infinite exists, it is impossible for It to be
        in vain, i.e., that it lack some definite standing among the beings of
        reality. But it can have no power other than that of a principle. For
        all things in the world are either principles, or derived from
        principles. But it is not fitting for the infinite to have a principle,
        because what has a principle has an end. Hence it follows that the
        infinite is a principle. Note, however, that in ths reasoning,
        “principle” and “end” are both used equivocally; for that which is
        derived from a principle has a principle of
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">origin</span> whereas it is to
        have a principle and end of its
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">quantity</span> or size which
        is incompatible with infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second point of agreement is that they denied coming into existence
        and ceasing to exist to the infinite. This follows from the fact that it
        is a principle. For whatever is produced must have an ending just as it
        has a principle; and likewise any process of corruption has an end. But
        “end” and “infinite” are incompatible; hence the infinite can neither be
        generated nror corrupted. Hence it is clear that the infinite has no
        principle, but that the infinite is the principle of everything else.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This argument, too, uses “principle” and “end” equivocally, as above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third point of agreement is that they attributed to the infinite the
        prerogative of containing and governing all things, for this seems to
        belong to a first principle. And this was the opinion of those who did
        not grant in addition to matter, which they said was infinite, other
        causes, namely, agent causes, as Anaxagoras posited an intellect and
        Empedocles concord. For to contain and to govern pertain more to an
        active principle than to matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fourth point of agreement was to attribute divinity to the infinite;
        for whatever is immortal or incorruptible they called divine. This was
        the doctrine of Anaximander and a number of the ancient natural
        philosophers.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        About the first he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First he gives reasons to show that the infinite exists;

        style="

        Secondly, to show that it does not exist, at 342.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        337. In regard to the first he gives five reasons to show that the
        infinite exists. The first of these is based on time, which according to
        the common opinion of the earlier philosophers was infinite [i.e.,
        always was and always will be]. For Plato alone supposed that time was
        generated, as will be shown in Book VIII (l.2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first of these is taken from time, which, according to the common
        opinion of the ancients, was infinite. Indeed, Plato alone generated
        time, as will be said in Book VIII (l.2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first that tha infinite is shown to exist by five
        arguments. Abe first of these is taken from time, which is infinite
        according to those who held that time always was and always will be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        338. The second reason is taken from the infinite divisibility of
        magnitude. For even mathematicians use the infinite in their
        demonstrations. This, however, would not happen, if there were no
        infinite at all; hence the infinite exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        339. The third reason is based on the perpetual processes of generation
        and. corruption according to the opinion of many; for if the infinite
        were denied, generation and corruption could not endure indefinitely;
        hence, it would have to te admitted that generation would sometime
        cease, which is against the opinion of many. Therefore, it is necessary
        to posit the infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        340. The fourth reason is based on the apparent nature of the infinite,
        to many seems to consist in this that it is something always included by
        something else, because we observe that every finite reaches into
        something else. Let a body be pointed out; if it be infinite, then the
        infinite exists; if it be finite, it must be terminated at something
        else, and this latter, if it in turn be finite, at something else. We
        must either proceed thus to infinity or come to a body that is infinite.
        In either case, the infinite exists. Hence there can be no end to
        bodies, if every finite body is always included by some other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        341. The fifth reason is taken from the apprehension of the intellect or
        of the imagination. Hence, he says that that which chiefly constitutes
        the common difficulty which induces men to posit the infinite is that
        the intellect never is exhausted but can always add something to any
        given finite amount. Now the earlier philosophers supposed that things
        corresponded to the intellect’s or senses’ apprehension of them; hence
        because they said that whatever appeared to be is true, as stated in
        <i>Metaphysics</i> IV (l.11), they believed that even in reality there
        exists an infinite. Hence number seems to be infinite, because the
        intellect can always create a new number, simply by adding unity to a
        given number. For the same reason mathematical magnitudes, which exist
        in the imagination, seem to be infinite, because, given any definite
        magnitude, we can imagine a greater. And for the same reason there seems
        to be an infinite space beyond the heavens, because we can imagine
        certain dimensions existing beyond the heavens to infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now if there be infinite space beyond the heavens, it seems that there
        is an infinite body and even infinite worlds. This for two reasons. The
        first is that if the totality of space be considered infinite, that
        totality will be uniform; hence, there is no reason why that space
        should be devoid of body in one part rather than in another, Therefore,
        if there is found in one part of that space the bodily magnitude of this
        world, then there should be found in each part of that space some bodily
        magnitude comparable to that of this world. Thus body must be infinite
        in the same way as space or there must even exist infinite worlds, as
        Democritus supposed. Another reason proving the same point is that if
        there be infinite space, it is either empty or full. If it is full, we
        have our point that there is infinite body; but if it is empty, then
        since the empty is a place not filled with a body but capable of being
        so filled, it follows that if space is infinite, there is infinite place
        capable of being filled with body. Thus there must be infinite body,
        because in perpetual matters, there is no difference between what can be
        and what is. Hence, if infinite place can be filled with body, it must
        be admitted that it is fillee with infinite body. Therefore, it seems
        necessary to say that there is infinite body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        342. Then [232] he takes the opposite position. And in regard to this he
        does three things:
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;

        "
      >
        First, he shows that the matter is debatable, lest anyone suppose that
        the afore -mentioned reasons are unassailable;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, he gives the various meanings of the word “infinite,” at 344;
      </p>
      <p
        style="

        "
      >
        Thirdly, he gives reasons showing that the infinite.,does not exist, at
        345.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        343. He says therefore [232] that there is a question about whether the
        infinite exists or not. For, on the one hand, many impossibilities
        follow upon holding that it does not; those, for example, listed in 337
        ff. On the other hand, there are also difficulties attendant upon
        holding that the infinite does exist, as will be clear subsequently (no.
        345 ff). There is doubt also as to its manner of existence. Does it
        exist as a substance does, or as an accident belonging essentially to
        some nature? Of if neither as a substance nor as an essential accident,
        but as an accident nevertheless, is there some infinite continuum and
        are there things infinite in number? Now it very much pertains to the
        philosopher of nature to discuss whether there exists such a thing as an
        infinite sensible magnitude, for a sensible magnitude is a natural
        magnitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        344. Then [233] he shows in how many ways “infinite” is said, and lists
        two divisions of the infinite. The first division is con on to the
        infinite and to all things said privatively.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For “invisible” is said in three ways: either as denoting 1) what of its
        very nature 13 not apt to be seen, for example, a sound which is not in
        the genus of visible things; or 2) what is difficult to see, as what is
        seen in the dark or from a distance; 3) what is apt to be seen but is
        not, as something in total darkness. Correspondingly, what of its very
        nature is not apt to be passed over is called “infinite” (for the
        infinite is the same as that which cannot be passed over)—and this is
        because it belongs to the genus of intraversable things, as are
        indivisibles, such as a point and a form; this is the way that a sound
        was called invisible. In a second way, infinity is ascribed to what
        could be passed over but its passage is impossible for us; thus, we say
        that the depth of the sea is infinite; or if it could be passed through,
        it would be with difficulty, as if we should say that a trip to India is
        infinite. Both of these belong to that which is “difficultly
        traversable.” In a third way, infinity is ascribed to what is passable
        but there is no passage to its terminus; for example, a line without an
        end or any other such quantity without limits; this is the proper cense
        of the word “infinite.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He then gives the other division of infinite, [233 bis], saying that
        infinity is spoken either by addition, as in numbers, or according to
        division, ai in magnitudes, or both ways, as in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        345. Then [234] he lays down the arguments leading to an exclusion of
        the infinite:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First those excluding a separated infinite, such as laid down by the
        Platonists;

        style="

        "
      >
        Secondly, those excluding the infinite from sensible things, at no. 349.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        With respect to the first he lays down three reasons. As to the first of
        these he says that it is impossible for the infinite to be separated
        from sensible things, in such a way that the infinite should be
        something existing of itself, as the Platonists laid down. For if the
        infinite is laid down as something separated, either it has a certain
        quantity (namely, continuous, which is size, or discrete, which is
        number), or not. If it is a substance without either the accident of
        size or that of number, then the infinite must be indivisible—since
        whatever is divisible is either number or size. But if something is
        indivisible, it will not be infinite except in the first way, namely, as
        something is called “infinite” which is not by nature susceptible to
        being passed through, in the same way that a sound is said to be
        “invisible” [as not being by nature susceptible to being seen], but this
        is not what is intended in the present inquiry concerning the infinite,
        nor by those who laid down the infinite. For they did not intend to lay
        down the infinite as something indivisible, but as something that could
        not be passed through, i.e., as being susceptible to such, but with the
        passage having no completion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If, however, the infinite should not only be a substance, but also
        should have an accident which is size or number to which the infinite
        belongs, in such a way that the infinite would be inherent in the
        substance in the manner of that accident, then the principle of existing
        things will not be infinite as such the ancients laid down, just as we
        do not say that the principle of speech is invisible, although such a
        thing is an accident of sound, which is the principle of speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        346. The second reason [235] is as follows. A passion is less separable
        and able to exist of itself than a subject. But the infinite is a
        passion of size and number—which cannot be separated and exist of
        themselves, as is proved in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [XI, l.10]. Therefore
        neither can this be so of the infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        347. The third argument [236] is as follows. He [Aristotle] states that
        it is clear that the infinite cannot be laid down as being in act, and
        as being a certain substance, and as being the principle of things. For
        the infinite is either divisible, or indivisible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If indeed it is divisible, every one of its parts will have to be
        infinite, on the supposition that the infinite is a substance. For if it
        is a substance, and is not predicated of any subject as an accident,
        then that which is infinite and the nature of the infinite, i.e., the
        essence and notion of the infinite, will have to be the same. For that
        which is white and the nature of white are not the same, but that which
        is man, and the nature of man, are. Whence it will be necessary that the
        infinite, if it be a substance, be either indivisible, or divided into
        parts which are infinite—which is impossible, since it is impossible to
        compose some same thing out of many infinities, as this would involve
        one infinite’s being terminated by another infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It likewise appears not only from argument but also from an analogy that
        if the infinite is a substance and is divided, it is necessary that each
        and every part of it be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For just as every part of air is air, so too every part of the infinite
        will be infinite, if the infinite is a substance and a principle. For if
        it is a principle, the infinite has to be a simple substance, not
        composed out of differing parts, as in the case of man whose every part
        is not man. Since, therefore, it is impossible for every part of some
        infinite to be infinite, the infinite must then be unable to be reduced
        to parts, and indivisible. But what is indivisible cannot be infinite in
        act—since whatever is infinite in act is quantitified, and everything
        quantified is divisible. It follows, therefore, that if there be any
        infinite in act, it is not after the manner of substance, but has the
        reason of the accident which is quantity. And if this be infinite, it
        will not be a principle, but that to which the infinite occurs, whether
        it be some sensible substance, such as air; or some intelligible
        substance, such as “even,” as the Pythagoreans laid down.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Whence it is plain that the Pythagoreans did not speak sensibly,
        positing the infinite as a substance, and the same time holding it as
        divisible—since it follows that every part of it would be infinite,
        which is impossible, as said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        348. Finally, he says that this question “whether there be an infinite
        in mathematical quantities and in intelligible things not having
        magnitude” is a more general one than the present question. For our
        question concerns sensible things about which natural science treats:
        “Whether among natural things there be a body infinite in size, such as
        the early philosophers posited.

        349. After rejecting the opinion of the earlier philosophers who spoke
        non-naturally of the infinite, separating it from sensible things, the
        Philosopher now shows there is no infinite even in the sense in which
        the natural philosophers laid it down.

        Secondly by natural reasons in 353.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first set of reasons are called “logical,”not because they proceed
        logically from logical terms, but because they proceed in a logical
        manner, i.e., from common and probable propositions, which is the
        characteristic of the dialectical syllogism.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        350. He gives therefore [237] two logical reasons. In the first of
        theseit is shown that there is no infinite body. For the definition of
        body is that it is determined by a surface, just as the definition of a
        line is that its terms are points. But no body determined by a surface
        is infinite. Therefore, no body is infinite, whether it be sensible,
        i.e., a natural body, or intelligible, i.e., a mathematical body. (The
        word “rational” [or dialectical] should be here expounded as “logical”
        indeed, logic is called “rational philosophy.”)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        351. The second reason shows that there is no infinite multitude. For
        everything countable can be numbered and consequently passed through by
        counting. But every number and whatever has a number is countable.
        Therefore, every such thing can be passed over. If, therefore any
        number, whether separated or existing in sensible things, be infinite,
        it follows that the infinite can be passed through, which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        352. Notice that these reasons are probable and proceed from common
        premisses. For they do not conclude of necessity: in effect, whoever
        posits an infinite body would not concede that it would of its very
        nature be terminated by a surface, except perhaps potentially; although
        this is probable and well-known. Similarly, whoever would posit an
        infinite multitude would not admit it to be a number or that it has a
        number. For number adds to multitude the notion of measure, because a
        number is “multitude measured by unity,” as is said in
        <i>Metaphysics</i> X. For this reason number is considered to be a
        species of discrete quantity, but multitude is not; it is, rather, a
        transcendental.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        353. Then [238] he produces natural reasons to show that there is no
        infinite body in act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In connection with these reasons ane must consider that since Aristotle
        had not yet proved that the heavenly body was of another essence from
        that of the four elements, and the connon opinion of his time was that
        it was of the same nature as the four elements, he therefore proceeds in
        these reasonings as though there were no other sensible body outside of
        the four elements. This is in keeping with his custom, since he always,
        before proving that which is his own belief, proceeds from what is
        supposed by the common opinion of others. Hence, after he proved in
        <i>De Caelo</i> I (l.4) that the heavens are of another nature from the
        elements, he repeats, for the sake of the certitude of the truth, the
        consideration of the infinite, showing unqualifiedly that no sensible
        body is infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Here, however, he first shows that there is no sensible infinite body on
        the supposition that the elements are finite in number; secondly he
        shows the same thing in a universal way, at no. 358.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first that when one proceeds “naturally,” i.e.,
        according to the principles of natural science, one is better able, and
        with more certitude, to consider that there is no sensible infinite body
        from what will be said. For every sensible body is either simple or
        composite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        354. First therefore he shows that there is no composite sensible body
        that is infinite, supposing that the elements are finite according to
        multitude. For it cannot be that one of the elements is infinite and the
        others finite—because the composition of any compound body requires that
        there be a number of elements and that the contraries therein be somehow
        in equilibrium. If this were not so, the composition could not
        endure—for the strongest would destroy all the others, since the
        elements are contrary. But if one of the elements were infinite, no
        equilibrium would ensue as long as the other elements were finite,
        because there is no proportion between infinite and finite. Therefore it
        cannot be that only one of the elements in the composite be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But someone could claim that the infinite element might have such weak
        energy in acting, that it would not destroy the finite elements which
        are stronger; for example, if the infinite one were air and the finite
        one fire. And therefore, to remove this objection he says that no matter
        how much less the energy of that one infinite body is than that of the
        finite body (for example, if fire be infinite and air finite)
        nevertheless an infinite accumulation of air would be equal in energy to
        the fire. For if the energy of the fire is one hundred times greater
        than an equal quantity of air, then if the air be multiplied a
        hundredfold, it will equal the fire in energy; and yet air multiplied a
        hundred times is multiplied according to a finite number and is exceeded
        by the power of the whole infinite amount of air. Hence, it is clear
        that even the energy of the fire will be overcome by the energy of
        infinite air: thus the infinite will excel and corrupt the finite, no
        matter how powerful its nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        355. Similarly, it cannot be that any of the elements out of which a
        compound body is composed be infinite; because it is a property of a
        body that it have dimensions in every direction, and not in length only,
        as in a line, or in length and width only, as on a surface. But the
        nature of the infinite is to have infinite “distances” or dimensions.
        Therefore, the infinite body should have infinite dimensions in every
        direction. Thus, it cannot be that one body result from a number of
        infinite bodies, because each occupies the whole world, unless you posit
        that two bodies interpenetrate, which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        356. Therefore, having shown that a composite body cannot be infinite,
        he now proves that neither can a simple body, nor one of the elements,
        nor any medium among the elements(taking vapor as a medium between air
        and water) be infinite. For some posited this last as a principle
        stating other things to be generated from it. And they said that this
        was something infinite, but not air or water or any of the other
        elements; because the other elements would be corrupted by whichever one
        was supposed as infinite. For the elements have contrariety one to the
        other since air is humid, water cold, fire hot and earth dry. Hence if
        one of them were infinite, it would destroy the others, since one
        contrary is disposed to be corrupted by another. And that is why they
        said that something other than the elements was infinite, from which, as
        from a principle, the elements arose.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now he states this position to be impossible not only as to its
        maintaining such a mediate body to be infinite, since there will be
        applied a same common argument [in no. 35] to fire and air and water and
        likewise to the mediate body, but also as to its laying down some
        elemental principle in addition to the elements.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For there is found no sensible body outside of those things called the
        “elements,” namely, air, water, and the like. But this would have to be
        the case if anything besides the elements should enter into the
        composition of such bodies. If, therefore, anything else should enter
        into the composition of those bodies in addition to the four elements,
        it would follow that we should find here some simple body besides the
        elements, by the resolution of the above bodies into their elements. It
        follows therefore that the aforesaid position is false as to its
        positing of some simple body besides the known elements.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        357. He further shows by a general argument that none of the elements
        can be infinite. For if any of the elements were infinite, it would be
        impossible for the whole universe to be anything but that element. It
        would likewise be necessary that all the other elements be changed into
        it, or to have already been changed into it, due to the excess of power
        of the infinite over other things, as Heraclitus says that at some
        future time all things will be converted into fire because of the
        excelling power of fire. And the same reason holds good for one of the
        elements and for come other body that some natural philosophers create
        besides the elements. For it is necessary that this other body have
        contrariety toward the elements, since other things are laid down as
        being generated from it, and change does not take place except from one
        contrary to another, as in the case of going from hot to cold, as shown
        above (I, l.10). This middle body would therefore in this way destroy,
        by reason of its contrariety, the other elements.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first [239] that in what follows it is necessary to
        consider every body universally, without any suppositions, and ask
        whether any natural body can be infinite. And from the follwwing reasons
        it will be clear that none can. Then, he proves his proposition with
        four reasons, beginning at 359. The second reason begins at 367; the
        third at 368; the fourth at 369.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

        Thirdly, he excludes a false opinion, at 364.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        359. Therefore [240] he lays down three presuppositions. The first of
        these is that every sensible body has a natural aptitude to be in some
        definite place. Secondly, that every natural body has, among available
        places, some place that befits it. Thirdly, that the natural place of
        the whole and of the part is the same, i.e., of all earth and each clod,
        of all fire and each spark. A sign of this is that in whatever part of
        the place of the whole there is placed a part of some body, it is at
        rest there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        360. Then [24171 he gives the [first] reason, which is this. If an
        infinite body be supposed, it must have parts either of the same
        species, as water or air, of parts of varying species, as a man or a
        plant has.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If all its parts are of the same species, it follows according to our
        pre-suppositions (no. 359) that it is either entirely immobile and is
        never moved, or is always being moved. But both of these are impossible:
        for in the second case, rest is excluded; and in the other, motion is
        excluded from natural things. Thus, in both cases there is denied the
        notion of nature, for nature is a principle of motion and of rest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He proves that this body would be either entirely mobile or entirely at
        rest by the fact that no reason can be given for its being moved either
        up or down or in any direction whatsoever. He manifesto this by an
        example: for let us suppose that the entire infinite body which is
        similar throughout is earth. Then it will be impossible to say where any
        clod of earth should move or be at rest, because each part of infinite
        place would be occupied by some body related to it, i.e., of the same
        species. Can it be said that one clod of earth would be moved so as to
        occupy successively all the infinite places, as the sun is moved so as
        to be in each part of the zodiacal circle? And how could one clod of
        earth pass through all the parts of infinite place? Now nothing is moved
        toward the impossible: if therefore it is impossible for a clod of earth
        to be moved so as to occupy all the infinite places, in which place will
        it rest and in which will it be in motion? it will either always be at
        rest and thus never in motion or it will always be in motion and thus
        never at rest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        361. If we suppose the other possibility, namely, that the infinite body
        has parts that are unlike in species, it will then follow that there
        would be unlike places for the unlike parts, for the natural place of
        water is one thing and that of earth is another, But on this supposition
        it follows at once that the body of this infinite whole would not be one
        body simply but one through contact; and thus there will not be one
        infinite body as our supposition granted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        362. Because someone might not consider this impossible [i.e., an
        infinite body of dissimilar parts], he adds another reason against this,
        saying that if the infinite whole is composed of unlike parts, these
        parts will be either of a finite number of species or of an infinite
        number. It will not be the first, because it then follows that if the
        whole is infinite, then some of the parts will be finite and some
        infinite; otherwise we would be able to get an infinite composed all of
        finites. On this assumption it follows that those which are infinite
        will corrupt the others, on account of contrariety, as was said in
        previous reasoning (nos. 354, 356). For this reason, no one of the early
        philosophers who posited one infinite principle, posited it to be fire
        or earth, which are extremes; rather they posited water or air or some
        medium between them, because the places of the former were evident,
        i.e., above and below, but it is not the same with the others, for earth
        is below in respect of them and fire above.

        363. But if someone admits the other alternative, namely, that the parts
        of the body are infinite in species, it follows that their places also
        are infinite in species, and that the elements are infinite. But if it
        is impossible that the elements be infinite, as was already proved in
        Book I (l.11), and that places be infinite, since it is not possible to
        find infinite species of place, it is necessary to admit that the whole
        body is finite.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And because he had concluded to an infinity of places from the infinite
        of bodies, he adds that it is impossible not to equate body with place;
        for no place is greater than the body it contains, nor can a body be
        infinite if its place is not infinite, nor can in any way a body be
        greater than its place. This is so because if the place is greater than
        the body, there will be some empty place; if the body is greater than
        its place, then some part of the body is in no place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        364. Then [242] he excludes an error. First, he cites the error and says
        that Anaxagoras claimed that the infinite is at rest but gave an invalid
        reason for its rest. For he said that the infinite bears up, i.e.,
        sustains itself since it exists in itself and not in something else, for
        nothing contains it. And thus it could not be moved outside itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        365. Secondly [24R] he disproves this statement with two reasons. The
        first of which is that Anaxagoras so assigned his reason for the rest of
        the infinite as to suppose that wherever a thing is, that is its natural
        place, for the only reason he gave for saying that the infinite is at
        rest, is that it exists in itself. But it is not true that where a thing
        is, there it is always naturally disposed to be, because some things are
        somewhere by force and not by nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now although it is true that an infinite whole is not moved, because it
        is sustained and remains in itself and for that reason is immobile, yet
        a reason should be given why it is not naturally disposed to be moved.
        one cannot evade this simply by saying that the infinite is not moved,
        since by the same reasoning there is nothing to prevent any other body
        from not being moved while it might be naturally disposed to be moved.
        Because oven if earth were infinite, just as now it will not be carried
        further when it is in the center, so even then no part in the center
        would move further: but this would not be because it had no other
        natural place except the center where it could be sustained but because
        it does not have a natural aptitude to be moved from the center. If,
        therefore, this is the case with earth, that the reason why it rests at
        the center is not that it is infinite but that it has gravity which
        accounts for its remaining in the center; similarly, in the case of any
        other infinite, the reason why it rests should be given, and this is not
        simply because it is infinite or that it supports itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        366. He lays down another argument [244]. Thus he states that if the
        whole infinite is in repose because it remains within itself, it follows
        that any part thereof necessarily is necessarily at rest since it
        remains within itself. For the place of the whole and the part is the
        same, as was said (no. 359), e.g., that of fire and a spark upwards,
        that of earth and a clod of earth downward. If, therefore, the place of
        the whole infinite is itself, it follows that any part of the infinite
        will remain at rest within itself as in its proper place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        367. He gives a second reason against Anaxagoras [245] saying that it is
        clearly impossible to say that there is an actually infinite body and
        that there is some place for each body, if every sensible body is either
        heavy or light, as the ancients said who posited the infinite. Because
        if the body is heavy, it will be naturally carried to the center; if it
        is light, it will be carried upward. If, therefore, there be an infinite
        sensible body, there must be in it an “up” and a center. But it is
        impossible that the infinite body should sustain in itself either of
        these, i.e., either an “up” or a center, or even that it sustain both
        according to different centers. For how could the infinite be divided so
        that one part would be “up” and another “down” or how can there be in
        the infinite a boundary or a center? Therefore there is no infinite
        sensible body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        368. He gives the third reason [246] saying that every sensible body is
        in place. But the differences of place are six: above, and below, before
        and behind, to the right and to the left—and these are determined not
        only in relation to us but even in the whole universe itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For such positions are determined in themselves in those things in which
        there are determinate principles and terms of motion. Whence in living
        things “up” and “down” are determined according to the movement of food;
        “front” and “rear” according to the movement of sense; “right” and
        “left” according to forward motion, which begins from the right. But in
        inanimate things, in which there are no determinate principles of such
        motions, “right” and “left” are said with respect to us—for a column is
        said to be “at the right” which is to the right of a man, and “at the
        left” which is at his left.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But in the whole universe “up” and “down” are determined according to
        the movement of heavy and light things; while according to the motion of
        the heavens the rising sun determines “right,” the setting sun, “left”;
        “front” is determined by the upper hemisphere, “rear” by the lower
        hemisphere; “above” by the south, “below” by the north. Now such things
        cannot be determined in an infinite body. It is therefore impossible for
        the whole universe to be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        369. Then [247] he gives the fourth reason, saying that if it is
        impossible that there be an infinite place because every body is in a
        place, it follows that there can be no infinite body. That an infinite
        place is impossible be proves thus: To be in place and to be in some
        place are convertible, just as to be man and to be some man or to be
        quantity and to be some quantity. Therefore, just as it is impossible
        that there be infinite quantity, because then it would follow that some
        quantity is infinite, e.g., two cubits or three cubits, which is
        impossible, so infinite place is impossible, because it would follow
        that some place is infinite (either up or down or some other place),
        which is impossible—since each of these implies a definite term as was
        said (in 368). Therefore no sensible body is infinite.

        About the first he does three things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he shows that the infinite in a way exists and in a way it does

      >
        Thirdly, he manifests how it is in potency, at 373.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        371. Accordingly, he says first [246] that from the foregoing (ll.8.9)
        it is manifest that there is no infinite body in act. It is also clear
        from what has been said (l.7) that if the infinite absolutely does not
        exist, many impossibilities arise. One is that time will have a
        beginning and an end, considered impossible by those holding for the
        eternity of the world. Another is that it would follow that a magnitude
        would not be always divisible into further magnitudes, but eventually
        one would arrive through division of magnitudes at certain things which
        are not magnitudes. But every magnitude is divisible. Likewise, it would
        follow that number could not increase to infinity. Since therefore,
        according to what has been said (ll.7-9) neither seems to occur, i.e.,)
        either an infinite in act or no infinite at all, it must be said that
        the infinite somehow is and somehow is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        372. Then [244] he shows that the infinite is as a being in potency. And
        he says that something is said to be in act and something is said to be
        in potency. Now the infinite is said to come about either by addition,
        as in numbers, or by subtraction, as in magnitudes. Now it has been
        shown that magnitude is not infinite in act; hence in magnitudes an
        infinite through addition is not found, but there is found in them an
        infinite through division. For it is easy to destroy the opinion that
        posits lines as indivisibles, or according to another letter, it is easy
        “to divide indivisible lines,” i.e, to show that lines held indivisible
        by some, are divisible. Now the infinite, whether in addition or
        division, is spoken of to the extent of the ability [or potency] to add
        or divide. It therefore follows that the infinite is as a being in
        potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        373. Then [256] he shows how the infinite exists in potency. For
        something is found to be in potency in two ways. In one way, in the
        sense that the whole can be reduced to act, as it is possible for this
        bronze to be a statue, because at some time it will be a statue. But the
        infinite in potency is not so meant as that which later will be entirely
        in act. In another way, something is said to be in potency in such a way
        that later it will be in act, not, indeed, all at once, but part after
        part. For there are many ways in which a thing is said to be: 1) because
        the whole exists at the same time, as in the case of a man or a house;
        or 2) because one part of it always comes to be after another part, in
        the way that a day is said to exist and a competition exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is in this latter way that the infinite is said to be at once in
        potency and in act. For all successive things are at once in potency as
        to one part and in act as to another part. For the Olympic games, i.e.,
        the festive contests held on Mt. Olympus, are said to be and to continue
        as long as the contests are scheduled and as long as the schedule is
        being carried out. For as long as those games lasted, one part of the
        schedule was taking place at the time and another was to take place
        later.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        374. Then [251] he compares various infinites one to another:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First he compares the infinite of time and of generation to the infinite
        which is in magnitudes;
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;

      >
        Secondly, he compares the infinite according to addition to the infinite
        according to division in the case of magnitudes, at 377.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to the first he does three things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, he proposes his intention and says that the infinite in the
        generation of man, and in time, must be explained in a manner different
        from that of the infinite in the division of magnitudes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        375. Secondly [252] he shows what is common to all infinites, saying in
        all of them it is universally found that the infinite consists in always
        taking one thing followed by another according to some certain
        succession, in such away that the whole of whatever is taken, be finite.
        Hence one must not suppose the infinite to be some whole existing all at
        once, as a substance that can be pointed out, e.g.,a man or a house.
        Rather the infinite must be taken as in the case of successive things,
        such as a day or a tournament, whose existence is not that of a perfect
        substance actually existing as a complete whole all at once. Now, in
        generation and corruption, even though the process continue to infinity,
        whatever is taken in act is finite. For in the whole course of
        generation, even should it proceed to infinity, both all the men
        existing at a given time are finite in number, and this finite amount
        must be taken as other and other, accordingly as men succeed one another
        in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        376. Thirdly, [253] he shows how they differ, saying that the finite
        actually present in magnitudes as a result of adding or of dividing is
        permanent and is not corrupted, but the finites considered in the
        infinite course of time and of human generation are corrupted, although
        in such a way that time and generation themselves do not fail.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        377. Then [254] he compares the two types of infinite which are found in
        magnitudes; namely, the infinite according to addition and the infinite
        according to division. About this he does three things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First he shows their points of agreement;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, he shows wherein they differ, at 379;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, he draws a conclusion from what has been said, at 380.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to the first, [254] he says that in some sense the infinite
        resulting from addition is the same as the one resulting from division,
        because the former comes to be as a converse of the latter. For it is
        accordingly as something is divided to infinity, that additions to
        infinity seem to be able to be made to some determinate quantity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        378. He demonstrates, therefore, how the infinite in division exists in
        magnitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus he states that if someone, in some infinite magnitude, having taken
        some determinate part by division, should then continue to take other
        parts by division, always maintaining the same ratio, I.e., proportion,
        he will not go through that finite magnitude by means of division.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For example, from a line of one cubit we may take one half, and from the
        remainder one-half again. We can proceed in this process to infinity.
        For the same proportion will be maintained in subtracting, but not the
        same amount of what is subtracted. The half of the half is less,
        according to quantity, than the half of the whole. But if we were to
        take away always the same amount, the proportion taken away would be
        continually growing. For example, if from a quantity of ten cubits, we
        take away one cubit, the ratio of the part removed to the original is
        one-tenth. If we take from the remainder another inch, the ratio between
        the part removed and that which remains will be in a greater proportion
        [i.e., one-ninth]. For one cubit is less exceeded by 9 than by 10. Just
        as, by preserving the same proportion throughout, the quantity
        subtracted is continually smaller, so, by taking away the same amount
        each time, the proportion gets continually larger. If, therefore, by so
        subtracting from some finite magnitude, we continually increase the
        proportion by taking away the sawe amount, the original magnitude will
        be exhausted. For example, if from a line of 10 cubits we always
        subtract one cubit. This will happen because every finite thing will be
        exhausted by continually removing the same finite amount.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The infinite that depends on division does not exist, therefore, except
        in potency, but with this potency there exists always something in act,
        as was said of a day or of a tournament. And since the infinite is
        always in potency, it is assimilated to matter, which likewise is always
        in potency; and it never exists in act in its entirety, the way that the
        finite is in act. And just as the infinite according to division is at
        once in potency and act, so too is the infinite according to addition,
        which has been shown to be in some sense the same as the infinite
        according to division, as was said (no. 377). And the reason why the
        infinite according to addition is in potency is that it can always grow
        through addition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        379. Then [2557he shows the difference between the infinite according to
        addition and the infinite according to division. And he says that the
        former does not exceed any given finite magnitude, whereas the latter
        diminishes beyond any pre-determined smallness. For If we take any
        predetermined smallness, for example, the width of a finger, we can, by
        repeated halving of a line of 10 cubits, arrive at a remainder which is
        less than the width of a finger. But in adding to infinity, in
        distinction to division, there will exist some given finite quantity
        which will never be gone through. Take two magnitudes each of 10 cubits,
        and a third one of 20 cubits. If what I subtract to infinity from one
        magnitude of 10 cubits, always taking a half, is added to the other,
        which is also of 10 cubits, I shall never reach, by adding to infinity,
        the measure of the quantity of 20 cubits, since as much as remains in
        the quantity being divided will be lacking from the given measure in the
        quantity being added to.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        380. Then [256] he draws a conclusion from the foregoing. First he draws
        it; secondly he explains it by a saying of Plato, at 381.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first [256] that since addition to infinity never
        actually transcends every determined quantity, it is not possible, even
        in potency, to transcend every determined quantity by addition. For if
        there were in nature potency for addition transcending every quantity,
        it would follow that something actually infinite exists; such an
        infinite would be an accident of some nature, in the same way that the
        natural philosophers posit, outside the world we see, some sort of
        infinite, whose substance is air or something similar. But if, as was
        shown (ll.8,9), no infinite sensible body exists in act, it follows that
        there is in nature no potency to transcend every magnitude by addition,
        but only a potency to the infinite addition which is in contrast to [and
        derived from] division, as was said above (no. 379).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Why the existence of a potency to infinite addition transcending every
        magnitude would imply a body infinite in act, whereas in numbers
        infinite addition transcending every number does not imply an actually
        infinite umber will be explained below(in Lecture 12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        381. Then [257] he confirms what he has said by a dictum of Plato,
        saying that because the infinite resulting from the addition of
        magnitudes is the reverse of division, Plato therefore posited two
        infinites: “the large,” which pertains to addition, and “the small,”
        which pertains to division—for the finite seems to excel both by
        addition unto increase, and by division unto decrease or towards
        nothing. Yet although Plato makes two infinites, he does not use them.
        For in number, which he posited to be the substance of all things, there
        is no infinite by division since there is among them something smallest,
        which is unity; nor is there according to him an infinite according by
        addition, since he said that the species of number vary only up to ten
        and then a return is made to unity when we count eleven, twelve, and so
        on.

        383. He says therefore [258] that the infinite must be defined in a
        manner contrary to the way some have defined it. For some have said that
        infinite is ‘that outside of which there is nothing,” whereas, to the
        contrary, it should be defined as “that beyond which there is always

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He shows therefore first by an example that the infinite is “that beyond
        which there is always something.” For some people say that a ring is
        infinite since, because it has a circular direction, one can always take
        part after part. But this is to speak analogously and not properly,
        because to be infinite requires this, namely, that beyond whatever part
        is taken there be some other part, in such a way, nevertheless, that one
        never take again a part taken previously. But in a circle this does not
        happen, because the part which is counted after another happens to be
        different from that immediately before it, but not from all the parts
        previously counted, because one part can be counted any number of times,
        as is evident in a circular motion. Therefore, if rings are called
        infinite according to this analogy, it follows that that which is truly
        infinite is something which always has something beyond, if one were to
        measure its quantity. For it is impossible to measure the quantity of
        the infinite; but if someone should desire to reckon it, he would take
        part after part to infinity, as said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        385. Then [260] he proves that the definition of the earlier
        philosophers is since “that outside of which there is nothing” is a
        definition of the perfect and a whole thing. Here is his proof. Every
        whole is defined as “that to which nothing to lacking”—as we speak of a
        whole man, or of a whole box, if they lack nothing which they ought to
        have. And just as we speak thus in regard to some individual whole, as
        in the case of this or that particular, so too this notion holds in
        regard to what is truly and perfectly whole, namely, that outside of
        which there is absolutely nothing. But when something is lacking through
        the absence of something intrinsic, then such a thing is not a whole.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        So it is evident that this is the definition of a whole: “a whole is
        that nothing of which is outside of it.” But a whole thing and a perfect
        thing are either entirely the same or of a proximate nature. He says
        this, because “whole” is not found in simple things which have no parts;
        in which things, nevertheless, we use the word “perfect.” This shows
        that the perfect is “that which has nothing of itself outside of it.”
        But nothing that lacks an end is perfect, because the end is the
        perfection of each thing. For the end is the term of that of which it is
        the end. Nothing infinite, therefore, and unterminated, is perfect.
        Hence the definition of the perfect as that, namely, which has nothing
        of itself outside itself, does not apply to the infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        386. Then [261] he draws a conclusion from the foregoing. Since the
        definition of a “whole” does not apply to the infinite, it is clear that
        the position of Parmenides is better than that of Melissus. For Melissus
        said that the whole universe was infinite. Parmenides said the whole is
        terminated by what is “striving equally from the middle,”by which he
        designated the body of the universe as spherical. For in a spherical
        figure, lines from the center to the term, i.e., the circumference, are
        drawn according to equality, as though “striving equally” with each
        other. And it is rightly stated that the whole universe is finite, for
        to be a whole and to be infinite are not reciprocally connected, i.e.,
        not continuous as thread follows thread in spinning. For there was a
        proverb that things which follow one upon the other should be said to be
        continuous as thread following thread.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        387. Then [262] he rejects a false opinion that arose from the aforesaid
        definition, and first in a general way, covering all variations;
        secondly the opinion of Plato, at 389.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first that because some thought that whole and
        infinite were mutually connected, they consequently took it as a
        “dignity” [axium], i.e., something self-evident, that the infinite
        contains all things and that it has all things in itself. This was due
        to the fact that the infinite has a likeness to a whole, as what is in
        potency has a likeness to act. For the infinite, inasmuch as it is in
        potency, is as matter in respect to the perfection of magnitude, and it
        is as a whole in potency, not as a whole in act. This is proved by the
        fact that the infinite is based on the possibility of dividing things
        into what is smaller and of making, by a contrasting division, continual
        additions, as was said above (l.10). Consequently, the infinite in
        itself, according to its proper nature, is a whole in potency only; and
        it is something imperfect, comparable to matter not having perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For it is not whole and infinite [or finished] according to itself,
        i.e., according to proper notion by which it is infinite, but according
        to something other, i.e., according to end and whole, to which it is in
        potency. For division, which is possible <i>ad infinitum</i>, is called
        “perfect” insofar as it is, whereas the division that goes on
        <i>ad infinitum</i> is imperfect. And it is clear, since it is the whole
        that contains but matter that is contained, that the infinite an such
        does not contain but is contained. This is true, insofar, namely, as
        whatever is in act of the infinite is always contained by something
        greater, accordingly as it is possible to take something beyond.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        388. Now from the fact that the infinite is as a being in potency, not
        only does it follow that the infinite is contained and does not contain,
        but two other conclusions also follow. One is that the infinite, as
        such, is unknown, because it is as matter without species, i.e., form,
        and matter is not known except through form. The other conclusion, which
        has the same source, is that the infinite has more the notion of a part
        than that of a whole, since matter is compared to the whole as a part.
        And it is not a surprise that the infinite conducts itself as a part,
        inasmuch as only a part of it is ever actual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        389. Then [263] he rejects an opinion of Plato who posited an infinite
        both in sensible and in intelligible things. And he states that from
        this it is plain also that if “the large” and “the small.” to which
        Plato attributed infinity, are in sensible and intelligible things as
        containing (by virtue of containment being attributed to the infinite),
        it follows that the infinite contains the intelligible things. But this
        seems unfitting and impossible, namely, that the infinite, since it is
        unknown and undetermined, should contain and determine intelligible
        things. For the known is not determined by the unknown, but rather the
        converse is true.

        "
      >
        Secondly, the reason for what is said of it in numbers by comparison to
        magnitudes, at 392.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        391. It was said above (no. 379) that addition to infinity in magnitudes
        takes place in such a way that the resulting magnitude does not become
        greater than any given magnitude. But division to infinity in magnitudes
        results in reaching a quantity that is smaller than any pre-assigned
        quantity, as was expounded above (no. 379). However, he states [264]
        that this occurs reasonably, for since the infinite is like matter it is
        contained within just as matter is, while that which contains is the
        species and form. Now it is clear from what was said in Book II (l.5)
        that the whole is like form and the parts are like matter. Since,
        therefore, the division of a magnitude proceeds from the whole to the
        parts, it is reasonable that no limit be found there which is not
        transcended through infinite division. But the process of addition goes
        from the parts to the whole, which is like a form that contains and
        terminates; hence it is reasonable that there be some definite quantity
        which infinite addition does not exceed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        392. Then [267] he explains infinity in numbers by comparison to
        magnitudes. For it was said that in number there is a smallest terminus
        below which division does not go; but there is no maximum limit which it
        cannot exceed, because it is possible through addition to exceed any
        given number. The opposite hcwever takes place in magnitudes, as was
        said (no. 391). The reason why is because every unity, inasmuch as it is
        a unity, is indivisible, as indivisible man is one man and not many men.
        Now every number can be resolved into unity, as is evident from the
        nature of number. For number signifies that there are more things than
        one, and any plurality exceeding one to a greater or lesser degree
        constitutes a definite species of number. Hence, since unity pertains to
        the notion of number and indivisibility pertains to the notion of unity,
        It follows that the division of number should halt at an indivisible
        terminus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This statement that it is of the nature of number to be more than unity
        he explains by appealing to the species of number, because 2 and 3 and
        every other number is denominated by unity. Wherefore it is said in
        <i>Metaphysics</i> that the substance of 6 consists in its being six
        times one and not two times three, or three times two. Otherwise, it
        would follow that of the same thing there would be more than one
        definition and more than one nature, since, starting from different
        parts, a same number would come about in different ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        393. Then [266] he gives the reason why in numbers addition exceeds any
        predetermined multitude. And he says that we can always think of a
        number greater than any given number, for the reason that magnitude is
        divided to infinity. For it is plain that division causes multidude;
        hence the more magnitude is divided the greater is the multitude that
        results, and upon the infinite division of magnitudes there follows the
        infinite addition of numbers. Therefore just as infinite division of
        magnitude is not in act but in potency, and exceeds every determinate
        quantity in smallness, as was said (nos.391,392), so the infinite
        addition of numbers is not in act but in potency, and exceeds every
        determinate multitude. But this number which is thus multiplied to
        infinity is not a number independent of the division of magnitudes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        394. On this point it must be remembered that division, as was stated
        (no.393), causes multitude. But division is of two kinds: one is formal,
        which is through opposites; the other is according to quantity. Now the
        first division causes that multitude which is a transcendental,
        accordingly as being is divided into “one” and “many”; but the division
        of continuous quantity causes
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">number</span>, which is a
        species of quantity, insofar as it has the notion of measure. And this
        number can grow to infinity, just as magnitude is divisible to infinity.
        But the multitude which arises from formal division cannot grow to
        infinity. For the species of things are determined, just as there is a
        determined quantity of the universe. That is why he says that the number
        which grows to infinity is not separated from the division of the
        continuum. Nor is this number infinite in the sense of something
        permanent. Rather it is as something always in a state of becoming,
        inasmuch as, to any given number, additions may be successively made, as
        is evident in the case of time and the number of time. For the number of
        time increases successively by the addition of day to day but not all
        days existed at once.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        395. Then [267] he shows that the opposite occurs in magnitudes. For
        although a continuum be divided to infinity, as was said (nos. 393,394),
        the size cannot grow indefinitely even potentially. For as great as a
        thing is in potency, so great can it be in act. If, therefore, it were
        in the potency of nature that a magnitude grow to infinity, it would
        follow that there would actually be some infinite sensible
        magnitude—which is false, as stated (ll.8.9). The consequence is,
        therefore, that addition of magnitudes cannot go on to infinity so as to
        exceed every pre-determined quantity; for otherwise there would be
        something greater than the heavens.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        396. [rom the foregoing it is plain that the claim of some that in primi
        matter there is a potency to every quantity is false; for in prime
        matter there is a potency only to determined quantity. It Is plain also
        from the foregoing why number does not have to be as great in act as it
        is potentially, as is said here of magnitude: for addition occurs in
        number as a consequence of the division of the continuum, by which one
        passes from a whole to what is in potency to number. Hence one need not
        arrive at some act terminating the potency. But the addition of
        magnitudes arrives at act, as was said (no. 391).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Commentator [Averroes], however, assigns another reason: namely,
        that potency to addition in magnitude is in one and the same magnitude
        but the potency to addition in numbers is in various numbers inasmuch as
        to any number something can be added. But this reason has little value
        because just as addition produces varying species of number, so also
        varying species of measure, as, for example, “two cubits long” and
        “three cubits long” are called species of quantity. Moreover, whatever
        is added to a higher number is added to the lower. Accordingly, there is
        in one and the same number, e.g., two or three, a potency to infinite
        addition.

        397. Then [260] he shows how the infinite is found in diverse ways in
        diverse things. And he says that the infinite is not found according to
        the same aspect in motion and magnitude and time, as if it were one
        nature being predicated univocally in all three cases. Rather it is said
        of the subsequent member in terms of its antecedent, for example, of
        motion by reference to the magnitude in which notion takes place
        (whether it be local motion, alteration or augmentation;) and of time by
        reference to notion. This happens because the infinite pertains to
        quantity, and notion is quantified by reference to magnitude, while time
        is quantified by reference to motion, as will be evident below (Bk. IV,
        l.17). And therefore he says that we are now mentioning these, but later
        what each of them is will be explained, as well as that every magnitude
        is divisible into magnitudes (Bk. VI, l.1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        398. Then [269] he explains how mathematicians make use of the infinite,
        and says that the argument that there is no actually infinite
        magnitude,(ll.8,9) does not destroy the consideration of the
        mathematicians, who use the infinite, as, for examplao when the geometer
        says, “Let this line be infinite.” For they do not need for their
        demonstrations the infinite in act,nor do they use it, but they need
        only some finite line of sufficient quantity for their needs, so as to
        be able to subtract from it so much as they wish. For their purpose it
        is enough that there exist some maximum magnitude which can be divided
        according to any proportion in respect to another given magnitude.
        Hence, for purposes of demonstration, it makes no difference whether
        this maximum magnitude be one way or the other, i.e., finite or
        infinite;but as to the being of things, it makes a great difference
        whether it is one or the other.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        399. Then [270] he shows how the infinite is a principle. And he says
        that since there are four genera of causes, as was said above (Bk. II),
        the infinite is a cause in the manner of matter. For the infinite has
        being in potency, which is proper to matter. Now matter is sometimes
        under a form and sometimes under privation. The infinite, however, has
        the notion of matter, not insofar as matter lies under a form but
        inasmuch as matter has privation—for the infinite implies the lack of
        perfection and term. That is why the Philosopher adds that the being of
        the infinite is privation, i.e., the notion of the infinite consists in
        privation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And lest anyone suppose that the infinite is matter like prime matter,
        he adds that the <i>per se</i> subject of the privation which
        constitutes the nature of the infinite is the sensible continuum. That
        this is so is clear from the fact that the infinite found in numbers is
        caused from the infinite division of magnitude; and similarly, the
        infinite in time and notion are caused by magnitude. Hence, the first
        subject of the infinite in the continuum. And since really existing
        magnitude is not separated from sensible things, it follows that the
        subject of the infinite is sensible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And on this point all the earlier philosophers agree who use the
        infinite as a material principle. Wherefore they improperly attributed
        to the infinite the capacity to contain, for matter does not contain but
        rather is contained.

        400. After the Philosopher has used the definition of the infinite to
        explain the things attributed to it he now solves the argument presented

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He says therefore first [271] that after speaking of the nature of the
        it remains to settle the arguments which appeared to show that the
        infinite is not only something in potency, as we determined above (l.
        10), but that was in act, as things are that are finite and determined.
        For some of the arguments do not conclude necessarily but are entirely
        false, while others are partially true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        401. Then [272] he solves the five reasons cited above (l.7) as proving
        that the infinite exists. And first he solves the one based on the fact
        of generation. For it concluded that if generation does not cease, then
        the infinite must be. Now this argument concludes truly insofar as the
        infinite is in a potency that is successively reduced to act. But it is
        not necessary that there be some sensible body which is infinite in act,
        in order to account for generation not ceasing, as the earlier
        philosophers supposed when they said that generation continues to
        infinity, supposing it to take place by extracting from some body, with
        the consequence that the process could not be infinite unless that body
        were infinite. But this is not necessary: for even supposing the whole
        of sensible body as finite, generation can endure ad infinitum by the
        fact that the corruption of one thing is the generation of another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        402. Then [273] he solves the argument based on the principle of
        contact, as though it were necessary for every finite body to touch some
        other body and so on to infinity. But he solves this by saying that it
        is one thing to be “touched” and another to be “terminated”, because to
        be “touched” and “enclosed” are said in respect to something else, for
        whatever touches, touches something else. To be “terminated,” however,
        is said absolutely and does not imply a relationship to something else,
        because a thing is made finite in itself by its own terminations. For it
        is incidental to the finite that it be touching something. Nevertheless,
        neither is it necessary that everything touched by something should
        touch something else and that this go on to infinity. Hence it is
        evident that this argument does not conclude anything of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        403. Then [274] he solves the argument based on the intellect and the
        imagination, which latter the ancients did not distinguish from the
        intellect. This argument above (l.7) concluded that there was outside
        the universe an infinite space, and consequently a place and a body. But
        it is incorrect to “trust to thought,” i.e., believe that whatever is
        apprehended by the imagination or intellect is true, as some of the
        ancients thought, whose opinion is refuted in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. For
        if I apprehend a thing as smaller or larger than it is, it does not
        thereby follow that there is such an abundance or defect in the object
        itself but only in the apprehension of the intellect or imagination. For
        one might understand some man to be a multiple of himself, i.e., two or
        three times larger than he really if, or any other amount to infinity,
        yet there will not be because of this a corresponding multiplication of
        him outside the intellect or outside a definite quantity or magnitude.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        404. But while a thing remains what it is, one can conceive of it in
        such a manner. Then [275] he solves the difficulty based on time and
        motion. And he says that time and motion are not infinite in act,
        because nothing of time is actual but the “now,” and nothing of motion
        is actual except a kind of indivisible. But the intellect apprehends a
        continuity in time and in motion by apprehending an order of “prior” and
        “posterior,” in such a way, however, that what was first taken in time
        or in motion does not remain in the same state. Hence it is not
        necessary to say that the whole of motion is infinite, or that the whole
        of time is infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        405. Then [276] he solves the argument based on magnitude, and he says
        that magnitude is not infinite in act either as a result of division or
        of an intelligible increase, as is evident from what was said above
        (ll.8-10).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Finally he summarizes by saying that we have completed our study of the
