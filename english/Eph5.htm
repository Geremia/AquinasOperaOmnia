  var WPFootnote2 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The etymology of Aquinas is correct, although the Romans transferred the use of &#8220;fornix&#8221; from\
designating arches or vaults to brothels which were situated in underground vaults. The quotation\
from Prov. 20:26 is as given in the Piana-Cai edition; although far from the true reading of v. 26\
it seems to fit the context. The Parma gives the correct Vulgate reading: &#8220;incurvat super eos\
fornicem.&#8221; If St. Thomas actually quoted it in this way, he may have taken it to mean that the\
king built an arch near a place of fornication. It seems more probable, however, that he quoted\
the verse as the Piana-Cai gives it since &#8220;fornicam&#8221; here means &#8220;wheel.&#8221; The Confraternity\
translates the verse as: &#8220;A wise king winnows the wicked, and threshes them under the\
cartwheel.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote3 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The text of Col. 2:8 has &#8220;philosophy&#8221; and not &#8220;prophecy&#8221;: St. Thomas&#8217; commentary on\
Colossians, Ch. 2, Lect. 2, has the correct reading. Perhaps the syllogism he was about to give\
distracted him or a copyist. It could be schematized as follows: major: God punishes whoever\
sins gravely; minor: But those who commit carnal vices are punished by God; conclusion:\
Therefore carnal vices are gravely sinful.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote4 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas takes &#8220;<i>diffidentiae<\/i>&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;despair&#8221; rather than &#8220;unbelief.&#8221; The Greek term\
<i>apeitheia<\/i> means &#8220;disobedience,&#8221; especially (in the N.T.) against God. Hence the connotation of\
&#8220;disbelief&#8217; in the proclamation of his gospel, or &#8220;distrust&#8221; in the salvation he gives.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote5 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The City of God, 1, 9 and note 42. &#8220;If anyone forbears to reprove and find fault with those who\
are doing wrong, because be seeks a more seasonable opportunity, or because he fears they may\
be made worse by his rebuke, or that other weak persons may be disheartened from endeavouring\
to lead a good and pious life, and may be driven from the faith; this man&#8217;s omission seems to be\
occasioned not by covetousness, but by a charitable consideration. But what is blameworthy is,\
that they who themselves revolt from the conduct of the wicked... spare those faults... because\
they fear to give offense, lest they should injure their interests... that is to say, their\
non-intervention is the result of selfishness, and not of love. Accordingly, this seems to me to be\
one principal reason why the good are chastised along with the wicked, when God is pleased to\
visit with temporal punishments the profligate manners of a community.&#8221; St. Thomas&#8217; reference\
to losing &#8220;your benefices&#8221; (<i>beneficia tua<\/i>) may indicate that he had clergy in mind. A benefice\
was an ecclestiastical position or function to which a stipend or salary was attached. This\
naturally put the clerical recipient in an embarrassing position if he had to disagree or reprimand\
the &#8220;benefactors&#8221; supporting him.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote6 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Jerome, <i>Epistula<\/i> 22, (P.L. 23, 423). The following reference is to 3 Esdras, i.e., the\
apocryphal third book.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote7 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas&#8217; reflections on choral chant in S.T. II-II, 91 follow from his general analysis of\
external expressions in man&#8217;s religious worship (cf. references in note 114 above). &#8220;We use\
language with God, not to manifest our thoughts to him, for he is the searcher of hearts, but to\
induce reverence in ourselves and others who hear. Hence vocal praise is not necessary on God&#8217;s\
account, but for the one who praises him.&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 1c). A possible consequence of this is that\
&#8220;Doctrinal instruction and preaching are nobler than chant as methods of rousing men to\
devotion&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 2 ad 3). The reference to the &#8220;illiterates&#8221; must be taken within this context;\
Aquinas&#8217; own experience probably led him to conclude that good theological teaching and\
preaching did the educated more spiritual good than listening to Gregorian chant.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote8 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas&#8217; use of &#8220;<i>exemplum<\/i>&#8221; here should not be taken simply in the sense of an &#8220;illustration.&#8221;\
It also has the meaning of &#8220;exemplar&#8221; as in Lecture I of this chapter. The union of persons which\
is the very essence or formal cause of matrimony (S.T. III, 29, 2c; Suppl. 44, 1c) was raised to\
the dignity of a sacrament by Christ so that it conforms to the union of love he has for his spouse,\
the Church (Suppl. 42, 1 ad 3). Cf. St. Thomas&#8217; comments on Eph. 5:32 below.<\/p>\

      Once be has exhorted them to kindness and mercy, which are the effects of
      charity (4:32), he gives them a model [to imitate]. In reference to this
      he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
      First, he urges them to imitate the exemplar, namely, God.

      Secondly, he lets them know in what they should imitate him (5:2).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      I have affirmed, he says, that you ought to forgive one another as God has
      forgiven you in Christ.
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Be therefore followers of God</span>
      because this is indispensable even if it is difficult. “What is man, said
      I, that he can follow the King his maker?” (Eccl. 2:12). Nonetheless,
      human nature would never achieve its end except in union with God. “My
      foot has followed his steps: I have kept his way, and have not declined
      from it” (Job 23:11). He must be imitated insofar as it is possible for us
      to do so-a son must imitate his father. Thus he adds as children since he
      is our father through creation: “Is he not your father, who possessed you,
      and made you, and created you?” (Deut. 32:6). He puts in most dear because
      God chose us to share in what is his very own.

      <span style="font-weight: bold">And walk in love</span> (v. 2) comes next,

      First, be maintains that the way to imitate God is in ebarity.

    >
      Secondly, he speaks of the tremendous sign of charity (5:2b).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The charity of God has made us his most dear children: “For you have not
      received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the
      spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba, Father. For the Spirit
      himself gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God” (Rom.
      8:15-16). Certainly we ought to follow him in love. He says
      <span style="font-weight: bold">walk</span> to signify “you must always
      advance” as in Genesis 17 (1): ‘Walk before me and be perfect.” This
      should be in love since love is so good that man ought always to make
      further progress in it, and is that kind of a debt which man always has to
      pay. “Owe no man any thing, but to love one another” (Rom. 13:8). Or in
      love may mean the way in which God is followed more closely: “And I show
      you yet a more excellent way. If I speak with the tongues of men, and of
      angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
      symbol” (1 Cor. 12:31-13:1). “Above all these things have charity, which
      is the bond of perfection” (Col. 3:14). This must be done according to
      Christ’s example, whence he adds as
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Christ also has loved us</span>. Jesus
      “having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end”
      (Jn. 13:1).

    Therefore he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and delivered himself for us</span>. “He has
    loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood” (Apoc. 1:5). I live
    in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and delivered himself for me”
    (Gal. 2:20). “He hath delivered his soul unto death and was reputed with the
    wicked” (Is. 53:12).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This death was both advantageous and necessary for us, thus he says an
    <span style="font-weight: bold">oblation and a sacrifice</span>. Here the
    Apostle is speaking in the way the Old Law does. In it, as Leviticus 4
    indicates, when someone sinned he was obliged to offer, because of it, the
    sacrifice and oblation which was designated for the sin. Then too, when
    someone gave thanks to God, or wished to obtain some favor, he had to offer
    a victim of peace, as prescribed in Leviticus 3 (9), which was of a most
    sweet savour to the Lord (v. 16). These, however, are all accomplished
    through Christ who, in order that we might be cleansed from sin and attain
    to glory, <span style="font-weight: bold">delivered himself for us</span>,
    an oblation through the actions he performed during his life: “He was
    offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his mouth” (Is.
    53:7); and [he died as] a sacrifice to God for sin.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This was <span style="font-weight: bold">for an odour of sweetness</span>,
    hinting at what is said in Leviticus 3 (5 ff.). But certainly the odour
    described there was not pleasing to God in itself but according to its
    signification, inasmuch as it symbolized the sweet-smelling oblation of the
    body of Christ, the Son of God. “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell
    of a plentiful field” (Gen. 27:27). “Draw me, we will run after you to the
    odour of thy ointments” (Cant. 1:3). In this way also we ought to offer
    spiritual sacrifices to God: “A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit”
    (Ps. 50:19).

        Having previously cautioned them, the Apostle taught the Ephesians to
        put off the old man and put on the new by forbidding spiritual vices

      >He eliminates three vices. There is a natural voluptuousness committed
      with another outside of wedlock; whence he says
      <span style="font-weight: bold">fornication</span>. “For the spirit of
      fornication hath deceived them” (Os. 4:12); “flee from fornication” (1
      Cor. 6:18). Job did this: “I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would
      not so much as think upon a virgin” (31:1). This is called “fornication”
      from the word “fornix,” that is, the triumphal arch near which brothels
      were situated. “Fornication came in upon them.”</a

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">And all uncleanness</span> designates every
    impurity against nature, namely, when the act is not ordered toward the
    generation of offspring. “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which
    are: fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury” (Gal. 5:19).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thirdly, he bans avarice in mentioning
    <span style="font-weight: bold">covetousness</span>. But why this? Is it to
    be classed with carnal sins? I reply that it is neither identified with, nor
    completely separate from, carnal sin but midway between the spiritual and
    carnal sins. It can be explained this way. Sin contains two elements, the
    object of the sin and the gratification the object affords. Thus with
    certain sins both the object and the gratification are spiritual, such as
    anger. Both revenge, which is the objective of anger, and its gratification,
    are spiritual; the same holds true for vainglory. Other sins, however, are
    completely carnal both in their objects and their gratification; such as
    gluttony and voluptuousness. But covetousness is between each of these
    because its object is carnal, namely money, whereas its gratification is
    spiritual inasmuch as the mind finds rest in the possession of money.
    Therefore, covetousness is enumerated among The carnal sins by reason of its
    object, and among the spiritual ones by reason of the gratification it
    affords. “Let your manners be without covetousness” (Heb. 13:5).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Or it might be answered that covetousness is opposed to justice and thus is
    classed with the kind of sensuality known as adultery. The latter is the
    unjust use of another man’s woman and covetousness is the unjust use of
    money.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Above he said “He that stole, let him now steal no more” (Eph. 4:28). But
    here he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >let it not so much as be named among you</span
    >
    because in the spiritual battle carnal sins must first be conquered. In vain
    would anyone struggle against internal sins unless he had first overcome
    external, carnal ones—against which there will always be a struggle.
    Therefore he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >let it not so much as be named among you</span
    >, as becomes saints who refrain from such actions, thoughts and words. “I
    will destroy the name of Babylon, and the remains, and the bud, and the
    offspring” (Is. 14:22). “Take care of a good name” (Sirach 41:15) since this
    is fitting for saints. “In all things let us exhibit ourselves as the
    ministers of God” (2 Cor. 6:4).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next he sets down some vices associated with the aforementioned. Regarding
    them he makes two points:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he rejects these vices.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he encourages them to practice the contrary virtue.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Hence he bans three vices, namely,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">obscenity</span> which consists in impure
    touches, embraces and lustful kisses. “But he who is an adulterer, for the
    folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul. He gathers to himself shame
    and dishonor” (Prov. 6:32-33). Then there is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">foolish talking</span> which is words
    provocative of evil. “For her conversation,” that is, of an evil woman,
    “burns as fire” (Sirach 9:11). Finally there is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">scurrility</span> consisting in jocose words
    with which some attempt to please others. “But I say to you that for every
    idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account on the day of
    judgment” (Mt. 12:36). All of these are grave insofar as they are said or
    done in connection with mortal sins; for anything, even if it is generally
    good, becomes mortal to the degree that it is ordered toward mortal sins.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Then he introduces them to the opposite, namely, thanksgiving. Whence he
    says <span style="font-weight: bold">but rather giving of thanks</span>.
    “Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of
    praise” (Is. 51:3).

        The Apostle above forbade carnal sins (5:3), here he threatens them with
        the penalty of damnation that is inflicted on sinners. In reference to

        "
      >
        Secondly, he mentions the sins one by one (5:5b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He states
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For know you this and understand</span>,
        that is, be actually certain of it and not just habitually. “These
        things I write to you that you may know that you have eternal life; you
        who believe in the name of the Son of God” (1 Jn. 5:13). And what does
        he write?
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >That no fornicator or unclean or covetous person, which is a serving
          of idols, hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Notice that he calls covetousness idolatry, for idolatry happens when
        the honor due God alone is given to creatures. Now there is a twofold
        honor due God; we must establish him as the goal of our life and we must
        put our trust of reaching the goal in him. Hence, whoever places these
        ‘in creatures is guilty of idolatry. A covetous person commits this when
        he fixes his end in a created reality as well as putting all his trust
        in it. “Of their silver and their gold they have made idols to
        themselves, that they might perish” (Os. 8:4). This happens since, as
        Proverbs 11 (28) affirms: “He that trusteth in his riches shall fall.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, since in the other sins a man also puts his goal in a creature,
        chnging to it by love, why are not they termed idolatry too? I reply
        that idolatry consists in giving an illegitimate worship to some
        external object. Whereas in the other sins one’s end is deorientated
        interiorly, as though it consisted in one’s own exaltation. Whoever
        places his end in riches, on the other hand, fixes it in an external
        object as an idol. Does that mean that covetous persons, giving the
        honor due God to creatures, are really and essentially idolators? I hold
        that they are not, because in moral issues acts or deeds are judged by
        their end. Therefore, only those are essentially idolators who intend to
        really offer worship to a creature. A covetous person does not really
        (<i>per se</i>) intend to do this, be only happens (<i>per accidens</i>)
        to do it in his excessive and inordinate love [for riches].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        What happens to such people? They do not possess the inheritance since
        heirs are sons, as Romans 8 (17) states. But these persons are not sons
        because they are carnal, therefore they do not enjoy the inheritance as
        I Corinthians 15 (50) affirms: “Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
        blood cannot possess the kingdom of God,” that is, God himself who said:
        “I am their inheritance” (Ez. 44:28).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It might be asked: If the inheritance is God himself who is indivisible
        and inseparable, why does he say
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >in the kingdom of Christ and of God</span
        >, dividing the two as if the inheritance could be severed? I reply. Our
        inheritance consists in the enjoyment of God. But God enjoys himself in
        a way different from that in which we shall enjoy him. God perfectly
        delights in himself since he perfectly knows and totally loves himself
        inasmuch as he is knowable and lovable. Not so with us, even though we
        shall perfectly know him in heaven and, as a consequence, love him. For
        someone may indeed grasp a simple reality and know the whole of it,
        while still not [knowing it] totally. For example, if the light of the
        sun were as small as a point, the human eye could perceive the whole of
        it, although not fully, whereas the eagle’s eye would grasp it totally.”
        Similarly, even if we know God perfectly in heaven and love him
        perfectly, nevertheless we do not totally comprehend him. Hence it seems
        that there is a certain imperfection and individuality there. Therefore
        he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of Christ and of God</span> conjointly,
        as though setting one part with another part, since it is through Christ
        and none other that the inheritance is had.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Let no man deceive you</span>, thereby
        rejecting a fallacy of those who would mislead them. Regarding this he
        makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      vain words since words that claim these are not sins and do not exclude
      one from the kingdom of God and of Christ are irrational. “Beware lest any
      man cheat you by prophecy and vain deceit” (Col. 2:8).”</a

    He demonstrates that such men are deceivers and their words fallacious
    since, if carnal sins were not sins, they would not be punished by God; God
    is just and does not impose a penalty where there is no offense. But such
    acts are punished by God and therefore are sins. He proves the minor when he
    says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"

    This is evident in the flood (Gen. 7), in what happened to the Sodomites
    (Gen. 19); and again, almost the whole tribe of Benjamin was destroyed on
    account of this (Jg. 19 & 20).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He says the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">children of despair</span> because those who
    sin in this way despair of eternal life. If they acted this way and still
    hoped for eternal life, it would rather be presumption than hope, which is
    the certain expectation of obtaining future beatitude meritoriously. So he
    mentioned previously (Eph. 4:19): “Who, despairing, have given themselves up
    to lasciviousness unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.”
    “Let no meadow escape our riot. Let none of us go without his part in
    luxury,” and near the end of the same chapter “For they hoped not for the
    wages of justice, nor esteemed the honor of holy souls” (Wis. 2:8 & 22).
    Hence he states that
    <span style="font-weight: bold">upon the children of despair</span> who do
    not hope for eternal joys,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">comes the anger of God</span> on account of

    justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness? And

        Previously the Apostle had banned carnal sins by threatening punishment
        and rejecting a fallacy (5:6). Here he gives the reason; it is taken
        from their situation. He does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he describes their situation.

      >
        Secondly, he deduces two conclusions from it (5:8b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Their situation, however, is described as twofold:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, their past.

        Secondly, their present situation (5:8a).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus he remarks
        <span style="font-weight: bold">you were heretofore darkness</span>
        blinded by ignorance and error. “Having their understanding darkened”
        (Eph. 4:18). “They have not known nor have they understood; they walk on
        in darkness” (Ps. 81:5). The darkness also comes from sin: “The way of
        the wicked is darksome; they know not where they fall” (Prov. 4:19). But
        observe that be does not vaguely call them “darksome” but
        <span style="font-weight: bold">darkness</span>. For anyone appears to
        be whatever is predominant in him; thus the whole state appears to be
        the king and whatever the king does is said to be done by the state,
        likewise when sin dominates a man the entire person is referred to as
        sin and darkness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next he describes their present condition, as though he said: But now
        you enjoy the light of faith: “among whom you shine as lights in the
        world” (Phil. 2:15), for “you are the light of the world” (Mt. 5:14).
        But this contradicts what was said of John the Baptist: “He was not the
        light” (Jn. 1:8). How then can other believers be called the light? I
        reply. They are not referred to as the light in essence but through
        participation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Afterwards, he derives two conclusions. He had said that they had been
        darkness but now are light. Therefore:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

        He affirms: Since you are now light, perform the deeds of light—

        “Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not”
        (Jn. 12:35). He interprets this when he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >For the fruit of the light is in all goodness</span

        Secondly, with what intention they should be done (5:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore he remarks: I have said that you should walk as children of
        the light,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">but the fruit of the light</span> is
        actions which are fruitful and resplendent. “And my flowers are the
        fruit of honour and riches” (Sirach 24:23). This is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in all goodness</span>. Whence it must
        be recalled that every act of virtue is reduced to three relationships.
        For it is necessary that the agent be ordered within himself, to his
        neighbor, and to God. Within himself, that he be good in himself; and on
        this account he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in all goodness</span>. “Teach me
        goodness and discipline and knowledge” (Ps. 118:66). He must be ordered
        to his fellow man by justice; whence he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and justice</span>. “I have done
        judgment and justice” (Ps. 118:121). While he is ordered to God through
        knowledge and a confession of the truth; so he adds
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and truth</span>. “Only love ye truth
        and peace” (Zach. 8:19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another interpretation is that goodness refers to the heart, justice to
        one’s actions, and truth to the tongue. This was mentioned above in
        Chapter 4 (25); it is also in Zacharias 8 (16): “Speak ye truth every
        one with his neighbor.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Then he discloses with what intention the actions should be performed.
        For they should not be done abruptly but with
        <span style="font-weight: bold">proving</span>, that is, discerning with
        one’s mind—“Let everyone prove his own work,” as Galatians 6 (4)
        expresses it—
        <span style="font-weight: bold">what is well pleasing to God</span>,
        that is, you ought to have the intention of doing whatever pleases God.
        “Be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the
        good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God” (Rom. 12:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        After this he exhorts them not to return to the state they have left
        behind because, as Galatians 2 (18) remarks: “If I build up again the
        things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.” Lest “the
        dog is returned to his vomit; and, the sow that was washed, to her
        wallowing in the mire” (2 Pet. 2:22). This section is divided into two

        He stated
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >proving what is well pleasing to God. And have no fellowship with the
          unfruitful works of darkness</span
        >
        which are sensuous actions leading to an everlasting darkness. They are
        unfruitful since they only possess a momentary delight which disappears
        very quickly. “What fruit therefore had you then in those things of
        which you are now ashamed?” (Rom. 6:21). “Trees of the autumn,
        unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots, raging waves of the
        sea, foaming out their own confusion; wandering stars, to whom the storm
        of darkness is reserved for ever” (Jude 1:12). Moreover, they seek out
        places of darkness for their depravity where they have the companionship
        of beasts. “The eye of the adulterer observes darkness, saying: No eye
        shall see me. And he will cover his face. He digs through houses in the
        dark, as in the day they had appointed for themselves; and they have not
        known the light” (Job. 24:15-16). With these, therefore, have no
        fellowship, neither by imitating, nor assisting, nor consenting to them.
        “What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog?” (Sirach 13:22).

    Should you refrain from reprimanding out of a fear of charity, namely, lest
    the sinner fall into greater evil and begin to afflict those who are good,
    you shall not sin. But if you do this from a fear that has its source in
    greed, lest the sinner grow indignant and you lose your benefices, then you
    do sin.

        The Apostle explained his warnings above (5:9), and now he gives the
        reasons for them. He had given two warnings: the first was that they
        should not associate in the works of darkness, the second that they
        should reprove sinners. Hence he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he gives the reason for the first warning.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;

        "
      >
        Secondly, the reason for the second (5:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus he asserts: I said well that vou ought not to have fellowship but
        rather reprimand and reprove such as these. Why? Because
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to
          speak of</span
        >. This is characteristic of carnal vices which possess a great
        depravity; they have the least amount of rational good since actions of
        this type are common to us and the beasts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        After this the Apostle gives the reason for the second warning, and he
        makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he sets down the reason.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he produces a confirmation of it (5:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Regarding the first, he wants to prove that it is fitting for them to
        reprimand delinquents. He proves it this way: Whatever is shown to be
        evil is to be reproved, for every reproof is a certain manifestation;
        but every manifestation occurs through the light, and you are the light;
        hence it is fitting for you to reprove and reveal those who are evil. He
        expresses the major of this reasoning at
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light</span
        >. And the minor is expressed in
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >for all that is made manifest is light</span
        >. As though he said: For this reason it is fitting for you to reprimand
        them because, as 1 Corinthians 2 (15) puts it, “the spiritual man
        judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.” Thus a Gloss
        offers the following interpretation:
        <span style="font-weight: bold">All</span> sins
        <span style="font-weight: bold">that are reproved by the light</span>
        that is, by the good and holy men who are the children of the light,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">are made manifest</span> through a
        confession. “But he that shall confess and forsake them [his sins],
        shall obtain mercy” (Prov. 28:13).
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >For all evil that is made manifest</span
        >
        through confession, <span style="font-weight: bold">is light</span>,
        that is, is turned into light.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next, he verifies this by an authority (v. 14) which a Gloss interprets:
        In order that light might prevail he—the Holy Spirit—says: Rise you who
        sleep and arise from the dead and Christ shall enlighten you. But this
        is not customary for Paul. Hence it must be said that the Apostle is
        introducing the image found in Isaiah 60 (1): “Arise, be enlightened, O
        Jerusalem; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen
        upon you.” Thus
        <span style="font-weight: bold">wherefore it says</span> refers to
        Scripture. <span style="font-weight: bold">Rise</span> from a neglect of
        good works, <span style="font-weight: bold">you who sleep</span>. “How
        long will you sleep, O sluggard?” (Prov. 6:9). “Shall he that sleepeth
        rise again no more?” (Ps. 40:9).
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And arise from the dead</span>, that is,
        from dead or destructive actions. Christ “will cleanse our conscience
        from dead works” (Heb. 9:14). “Your dead men shall live, my slain shall
        rise again” (Is. 26:19). Rise therefore
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and Christ shall enlighten you</span>.
        “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?” (Ps. 26:1).
        “Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death” (Ps. 12:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Yet are not we capable of rising from sin ourselves since it says:
        Rise... and Christ shall enlighten you? I reply. Two things are
        requisite for the justification of a sinner, namely, a free decision
        cooperating in the act of rising [from sin] and grace itself. And
        certainly the free decision itself is had from prevenient grace, while
        the meritorious actions that follow are from subsequent grace. Hence the
        last chapter of Lamentations (v. 21) says: “Convert us, O Lord, to you,
        and we shall be converted.”

        Thirdly, he teaches them how to act according to it (5:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Whence he states <span style="font-weight: bold">therefore</span> from
        the preceding
        <span style="font-weight: bold">see how you walk circumspectly</span>.
        Caution is one of the conditions of prudence by which a person avoids
        hindrances in accomplishing what he has to do. Everyone ought to possess
        this caution. “Let thy eyes look straight on and let thy eyelids go
        before thy steps” (Prov. 4:25). This is a characteristic of wise men,
        thus he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">not as unwise</span> who do
        not know how to avoid the obstacles. “All the foolish of heart were
        troubled” (Ps. 75:6).
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But as wise</span>: “The eyes of a wise
        man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness” (Ecel. 2:14). Some
        say: “If you do not act chastely, nonetheless act cautiously.” The
        Apostle does not take it in such a sense; when he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">circumspectly</span> it is as though he
        said: Beware of men who thwart chastity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He explains the necessity of this precaution when he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">redeeming the time</span>, which can be
        interpreted in two ways. On certain occasions a man redeems his property
        by offering a gift or something else for it; for instance, someone is
        said to compensate for a grievance he caused by offering a gift or
        money, or by renouncing something which is rightfully his. In this sense
        he would be saying: The whole of time is now a time of deception, hence
        you should be
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >redeeming the time, because the days are evil</span
        >. At the time Adam sinned, and from then on, snares have always been
        set to thrust men into sin. It was not that way in the state of
        innocence when it was unnecessary for a man to abstain from anything
        which was licit, since there was nothing in his will driving him to sin.
        But now we have to redeem the time,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">because the days are evil</span>;
        we.must avoid the depravity of the days, and “beware beforehand of the
        evil day,” as Ecclesiastes 7 (15) expresses it. To do this we must
        renounce even certain things which are lawful: “All things are lawful
        for me; but all things do not edify” (I Cor. 10:23). In this way a
        person is said to redeem a grievance he caused since he permits
        something that is rightfully his to be forfeited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is another interpretation of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">redeeming the time</span>. For it
        sometimes happens that a person lives a great part of his life in sin,
        and this is time lost. But how is he to redeem it when man is incapable
        of paying his debts? I reply that he ought to devote himself to good
        works to an even greater degree than be bad previously pursued sinful
        ones. “For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will. of
        the Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excesses
        of wine, revellings, banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols” (1
        Pet. 4:3). The first interpretation, however, is better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Then he goes on to teach them how to abide by the precaution, saying:
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherefore</span> that you may be able to
        redeem the time
        <span style="font-weight: bold">become not imprudent</span>. Notice that
        there is a difference between wisdom and prudence. For prudence is a
        certain type of wisdom, but not the whole of wisdom. “Wisdom is prudence
        to a man” (Prov. 10:23). That man is called wise in an absolute sense
        who puts everything into perspective; but a man is wise only in a
        certain respect when he puts in order only those things about which he
        is well informed. “As a wise architect I have laid the foundation” (1
        Cor. 3:10). For the role of the wise man is to put things in order, as
        the First Book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> states.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Everyone who sets things in perspective considers their end; hence he is
        wise in an absolute sense who knows and acts for the universal end, God.
        “For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations”
        (Deut. 4:6). For wisdom, as Augustine mentions in the Fourth Book on the
        Trinity, is the knowledge of divine realities. Prudence, on the other
        hand, is the directive care of particular things, as when a person
        regulates his actions. Thus, wisdom is prudence to man. For this reason
        he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >become not imprudent, but understanding what is the will of God</span
        >. For just as speculative reason puts whatever is to be done in
        perspective and judges it—it is necessary to have conclusions and to
        judge them by principles—so likewise in the field of performance. Now
        the first principle through which we ought to judge and regulate
        everything is the will of God. Hence the intellect, in moral matters and
        those which lead to God, must have the will of God for its principle. If
        it does, then the intellect becomes prudent. “O that they would be wise
        and would understand, and would provide for their last end” (Deut.
        32:29). Our Lord taught this: “Thy will be done” (Mt. 26:42).

        He urged them before to that newness which is in opposition to the old
        illusion (5:15), now he does the same in reference to the old ways of
        carnal sins. Or, we might say that he previously reprimanded carnal sins
        in regard to voluptuousness, and here does it concerning gluttony. He
        makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

      not be even named among you. Yet you ought also be careful to abstain from
      superfluous wine since excessive food and drink is a cause of sensuality;
      and especially wine which warms and excites a man. ‘Vine is a luxurious
      thing, and drunkenness riotous” (Prov. 20:1). “When the king was merry,
      and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded...
      to, bring in queen Vasthi before the king” (Est. 1:10-11). “Fornication
      and wine and drunkenness take away the understanding” (0s. 4:11). Whence

      wine—Lot.”</a

    Among all those things which breed a variety of moods is wine; thus it
    begets animosity and makes men “talk in thousands” as 3 Esdras 3 (21)
    affirms. Appropriately therefore does he teach them the opposite, to be
    filled with the Holy Spirit who engenders an intensity of devotion: “In
    spirit fervent” (Rom. 12:11). Who also spreads joy and spiritual happiness:
    “Justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost” (Rom. 14:17). Who, moreover,
    makes men speak out boldly: “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost;
    and they began to speak with diverse tongues, according as the Holy Ghost
    gave them to speak” (Ac. 2:4), so that those who heard them thought they
    were drunk (Ac. 2:13).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But do we possess the Holy Spirit by our own power? reply and say that the
    Holy Spirit is possessed in two ways. Either he is had receptively, and it
    is not in our power to receive him, rather we accept him as a gift from God:
    “the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is
    given to us” (Rom. 5:5). Or he is possessed dispositively, and even here we
    are not capable of receiving him since we cannot dispose ourselves without
    the grace of God: “Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of
    ourselves, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God” (2 Cor. 3:5).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Or, someone may be said to receive the Holy Spirit, and nonetheless not be
    full of the Holy Spirit. He has the grace of the Holy Spirit in reference to
    certain aspects of his life, but not in reference to every one of his
    actions. Then is he said to be full of the Holy Spirit when he avails
    himself of the Spirit in all be does.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The way to be filled is found in the love of God and one’s fellow men. Thus
    when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">speaking to yourselves in Psalms</span> (v.
    19):
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he touches on the way of being filled in relation to God.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, in relation to one’s fellow man (5:21).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Concerning the first of these he does three things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he prescribes spiritual meditation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Secondly, he speaks of spiritual exultation (5:19b).
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Thirdly, comes the thanksgiving (5:20).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first has two parts:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he writes of the manner of the meditation.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, the subject matter of it (5:19a).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    There are two ways of speaking to yourselves. One is external, of a man
    talking to other men; another is interior, of a man speaking to himself.
    This latter ought to be repentant: I will speak in the bitterness of my
    soul” (Job 10:1). And it ought to be done in secret: “when you pray, enter
    your chamber and, having shut the door, pray to your Father in secret” (Mt.
    6:6). “When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her [wisdom]”
    (Wis. 8:16).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He then touches on the subject-matter of meditative prayer when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles</span
    >. To sing is to make use of the psaltery; and thus in psalms, that is, in
    good works. “Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: thepleasant
    psaltery with the harp” (Ps. 80:3). And hymns, that is, by the divine
    praises: “A hymn to all. his saints” (Ps. 148:14); and
    <span style="font-weight: bold">spiritual canticles</span> concerning the
    hope of eternal realities: “Rejoicing in hope” (Rom. 12:12); “Upon the ten
    stringed psaltery, with a canticle upon the harp” (Ps. 91:4), “sing ye to
    the Lord a new canticle, because he hath done wonderful things” (Ps. 97:1).
    Hence we meditate on honest actions and what we should do; on the divine
    praise and what we should imitate; and on the joy of heaven and what we
    should render homage to, and how.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first effect of the Holy Spirit is a holy meditation, and the second is
    a spiritual exultation; from frequent meditation the fire of charity is
    enkindled in the heart. “My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditation a
    fire shall flame out” (Ps. 38:4). And from this a spiritual joy is born
    within the heart; thus he mentions
    <span style="font-weight: bold">singing and making melody</span> so that our
    will would be stirred by spiritual joys to undertake good works. I will sing
    with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding” (1 Cor. 14:15).
    “In all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and
    spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God” (Col. 3:16).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This refutes the error of those heretics who claim that it is useless to
    sing vocal canticles to the Lord; that only spiritual ones matter. In the
    praises of the Church there is an essential element to consider, what the
    Apostle refers to as <span style="font-weight: bold">in your hearts</span>.
    Yet there is another element [the external expression in song] which has a
    twofold purpose. One is that it is for us, to stimulate our minds to an
    interior devotion. If someone is rather moved to frivolity or vain glory by
    it, this is contrary to the Church’s intention. Its second purpose is for
    others, since by it the illiterate become more devout: “And when the
    minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him” (2 Kgs. 3:15).”

      }
    </script>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The third effect is thanksgiving because, when someone is influenced in
    these ways toward God, he recognizes that everything he has is from God. For
    the more a person is affected by his relation to God and knows him, the more
    does he see God as greater while he himself becomes smaller, indeed almost
    nothing, in comparison with God. “Now my eye seeth you. Therefore do I
    reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes” (Job 42:5-6). So he
    declares
    <span style="font-weight: bold">giving thanks always for all things</span>,
    for all his gifts, whether of prosperity or adversity. “I will bless the
    Lord at all times; his praise shall be always in my mouth” (Ps. 33:1). For
    adversities are also gifts to us on the way: “Count it all joy when you
    shall fall into divers temptations” (Jas. 1:2). And the Apostles “indeed
    went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted
    worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus” (Ac. 5:41). “In all things
    give thanks” (1 Thess. 5:18).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>
    since all blessings come through him. “Let us have peace with God, through
    our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom also we have access through faith into this
    grace” (Rom. 5:1-2). Yet he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">to God</span> inasmuch as he is our maker
    through creation,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and the Father</span> since he sent Christ
    to us through whom he regenerated us. Thus we give thanks to him as God
    regarding the goods of nature, and to him as Father in reference to the
    goods of grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He sets down the way of being filled [by the Spirit] in relation to one’s
    fellow men by saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ</span
    >, that is, not out of a human fear but from a reverence for Christ.

        Up until now the Apostle has set down general precepts applicable to
        everyone (4:17), at this point he expresses those which pertain to
        particular persons or classes. According to the Philosopher in his
        <i>Politics</i>, a home must possess three relationships if it is to be
        complete, namely, that of the husband and wife, of the father and the
        children, and that between the master and his servants. Hence these
        three are dealt with when the Apostle instructs:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, the husband and wife.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, the father and child (6: 1).
      </p>
      <p
        style="

        "
      >
        Thirdly, the servants and masters (6:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first has two divisions:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he cautions the women to be subject.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;

          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he admonishes the men to love (5:25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first is again twofold:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he gives an admonition.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he explains the reason for it (5:23).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence he states:
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Let women be subject to their husbands</span
        >
        because “a woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband”
        as Ecclesiasticus 25 (30) affirms. So he especially warns them about
        subjection. This is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">as to a lord</span> since the relation
        of a husband to his wife is, in a certain way, like that of a master to
        his servant, insofar as the latter ought to be governed by the commands
        of his master. The difference between these two relationships is that
        the master employs his servants in whatever is profitable to himself;
        but a husband treats his wife and children in reference to the common
        good. Thus he mentions
        <span style="font-weight: bold">as to a lord</span>; the husband is not
        really a lord, but is as a lord. “Let wives be subject to their
        husbands” (1 Pet. 3:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next, he adds his reason; regarding it he makes three points:

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he offers it for consideration.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The reason for this subjection is that the husband is the bead of the wife,
    and the sense of sight is localized in the head—“The eyes of a wise man are
    in his head” (Eccl. 2:14)—and hence a husband ought to govern his wife as
    her head. “The head of the woman is the man” (1 Cor. 11:3). Then he brings
    in his example when he says:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">as Christ is the head of the church</span>.
    God “has made him head over all the church, which is his body” (Eph.
    1:22-23). This is not for his own utility, but for that of the Church since
    <span style="font-weight: bold">he is the saviour of his body</span>. “For
    there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved”
    (Ac. 4:12). “Behold, God is my saviour; I will deal confidently and will not
    fear” (Is. 12:2).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    From this he draws the conclusion he intended, saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ.</span
    >
    As though he said: It is not proper for an organ to rebel against its head
    in any situation; but as Christ is head of the church in his own way, so a
    husband is the head of his wife; therefore the wife must be obedient to her
    husband
    <span style="font-weight: bold">as the church is subject to Christ</span>.
    “Shall not my soul be subject to God?” (Ps. 61:2),
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >so also let the wives be to their husbands</span
    >. “And you shall be under your husband’s power” (Gen. 3:16),
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in all things</span> which are not contrary
    to God, for Acts 5 (29) affirms: “We ought to obey God rather than men.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    After this he admonishes the husbands that they are to love their wives.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he does this.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he gives his reason (5:25b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He states:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Husbands, love your wives.</span> For
    certainly it is from the love he has for his wife that he will live more
    chastely and both of them will enjoy a peaceful relationship. If he should
    love another more than his own wife, he exposes both himself and his wife to
    the possibility of sin. “Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter towards
    them” (Col. 3:19).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He then treats of the threefold reason for this.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, one springs from the example of Christ (v. 25b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Secondly, another comes from the husband himself (5:28b).
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Thirdly, another from a divine commandment (5:31).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Concerning the first he does three things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he offers the example of Christ’s love.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Secondly, then the sign of that love (5:25b-27).
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Thirdly, finally he deduces his intended conclusion (5:28a).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thus he says:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">as Christ also loved the church</span>; “Be
    ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; and walk in love, as
    Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered himself for us” (Eph. 5:1-2).
    The sign of Christ’s love for the church is that
    <span style="font-weight: bold">he delivered himself up for it</span>. “The
    Son of God who loved me and delivered himself for me” (Gal. 2:20). “He hath
    delivered his soul unto death” (Is. 53:12). And for what?
    <span style="font-weight: bold">That he might sanctify it</span>: Wherefore
    Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered
    without the gate” (Heb. 13:12). “Sanctify them in truth” (Jn. 17:17); that
    is the effect of Christ’s death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As a result of this sanctification he cleanses it from the stains of sin.
    Hence he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">cleansing it by the laver of water</span>.
    This washing has a power from the passion of Christ. “All we who are
    baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his death; for we are buried
    together with him by baptism into deatY’ (Rom. 6:3-4). “And I will pour upon
    you clean water and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness” (Ez.
    36:25). “There shall be a fountain open to the house of David and to the
    inhabitants of Jerusalem; for the washing of the sinner and of the unclean
    woman” (Zach. 13:1). This occurs
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the word of life</span> which, coming
    upon the water, gives it the power to cleanse: “Going, therefore, teach ye
    all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
    the Holy Spirit” (Mt. 28:19).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The goal of this sanctifying action is the Church’s purity. Thus he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that he might present it to himself, a glorious church</span
    >; as if the Apostle said: It would be highly improper for the immaculate
    bridegroom to wed a soiled bride. This is why he presents her to himself in
    an immaculate state, now through grace and in the future through glory.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Regarding the latter, he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">glorious</span> by the clarity of both body
    and soul. For “he will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body
    of his glory” (Phil. 3:21). Hence he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">not having spot</span>: “the man that walked
    in the perfect way, he served me” (Ps. 100:6); “blessed are the undeffled in
    the way: who walk in the law of the Lor&amp;’ (Ps. 118: 1).
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Or wrinkle</span> refers to the lack of
    suffering since, as the Apocalypse 7 (16) remarks: “they shall no more
    hunger nor thirst,”
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >or any such thing, but that it should be holy</span
    >
    through its confirmation in grace,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and without</span> the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">blemish</span> of any defilement. Thus all
    of these characteristics can be understood of the appearance of the Church
    in the future through glory.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But if they are taken to refer to her appearance through faith, then he
    would be saying:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might present to himself</span>,
    through faith, <span style="font-weight: bold">a glorious church</span>,
    since “it is a great glory to follow the Lord7 (Sirach 23:38),
    <span style="font-weight: bold">not having</span> a
    <span style="font-weight: bold">spot</span> of mortal sin. “Thou are stained
    in thy iniquity” (Jer. 2:22). Nor does it have a
    <span style="font-weight: bold">wrinkle</span>, that is, a duplicity of
    purpose which those who are rightly united with Christ and the Church do not
    have. “My wrinkles bear witness against me” (job 16:9).
    <span style="font-weight: bold">But</span> rather
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that it should be holy</span> through its
    aspiration and
    <span style="font-weight: bold">without blemish</span> through every kind of
    purity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    From the above he, in the third place, draws the conclusion he intended by
    affirming:
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.</span

        Above he urged husbands to love their wives, he appealed to Christ and
        to the example of Christ’s love for the church (5:25). Here he
        demonstrates the same thing from the point of view of the husband
        himself. He makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he gives the reason.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, he verifies it through an example (5:29b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason is as follows. A husband and wife are somehow one; hence, as
        the flesh is subject to the soul, so is the wife to the husband; but no
        one ever held his own flesh in contempt, therefore neither should anyone
        his wife. Whence he states
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >He who loves his wife loves himself</span
        >. “Therefore, now they are not two, but one flesh” (Mt. 19:6). just as
        a man sins against nature in hating himself, so does he who hates his
        wife. ‘With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before
        God and men: the concord of brethren, and the love of neighbors, and man
        and wife that agree well together” (Sirach 25:1-2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He proves that they ought to love one another in saying
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >For no man ever hated his own flesh</span
        >. This love is evident in what happens since “love is verified when it
        is expressed in action.” For we love anything whose powers we sustain.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But</span> everyone
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >nourishes and cherishes his own flesh</span
        >
        in order to sustain it. “But, having food and wherewith to be covered,
        with these we are content” (1 Tim. 6:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But is not this contrary to Luke 14 (26): “If any man come to me, and
        hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and
        sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple?” I reply.
        The Apostle affirms that a man ought to love his wife as he does
        himself; but he must love himself less than God; hence he should also
        love his wife less than God. In stating “he who does not hate his wife,”
        he is not commanding that she be hated—which would be to command a
        mortal sin—but that she be loved as the man loves himself. Now love in a
        lesser degree is like a certain hatred in comparison with whatever is
        loved most or to a greater degree, in this case, God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Likewise,
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes
          it.</span
        >
        But there are objections to this. When anyone loves something he never
        wants nor desires to be separated from it. Yet the saints wanted to be
        separated from the flesh. “Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me
        from the body of this death?” (Rom. 7:24), “having a desire to be
        dissolved and to be with Chrisf’ (Phil. 1:23). Besides, nobody afflicts
        what he loves, but the saints punished their flesh while they were in
        this world. “I chastise my body and bring it into subjection” (1 Cor.
        9:27). Moreover, some people even kill themselves, as is frequently
        heard of. Judas did it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I reply. The flesh, when considered in itself, is not held in contempt,
        but everyone naturally wants it to exist and nourishes it for this end.
        On the other hand ‘ the flesh can be considered as an obstacle to what
        we will, and thus, through circumstance (per accidens), it can be
        detested in a certain way. For everything that we will is either good or
        evil. If good, it may be the ultimate end, eternal life, from which we
        are held back by the flesh. “While we are in the body we are absent from
        the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6). And since we naturally desire our fulfillment
        and well-being—nor can we enjoy these while we are in the flesh—we will
        to discard it, not as an evil held in contempt, but as a good we love
        less than the greater good it impedes. The authoritative texts quoted
        above, and others like them, are to be explained in this way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or, we may will a good that is not the end, but disposes for the end;
        for example, virtuous habits. But this type of good is opposed by the
        immoral tendencies of the flesh. On this account do the saints
        discipline and punish their flesh in order that it might submit to the
        spirit for the curbing of sensual desires. For, in desiring such, the
        flesh blocks our acquisition of the virtues which dispose us for the
        ultimate good. Therefore, whoever punishes his flesh that it might
        submit to his spirit does not hate it, but rather obtains its own good
        which is that it be subject to the spirit-just as the good of man is to
        be subject to God: “it is good for me to adhere to my God” (Ps. 72:28).
        “I chastise my body...” and similar passages are to be understood in
        this way. This would not have been necessary in the state of innocence
        as long as man was subject to God, and the flesh totally submissive to
        the spirit; the gift of original justice consisted precisely in this
        mutual submission.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the other hand we sometimes will what is evil. Hence, just as holy
        persons discipline, or wish to discard, their flesh inasmuch as it is an
        obstacle to the good they desire, so also the wicked, insofar as the
        flesh blocks the evil they desire, will kill it and commit suicide, as
        Judas did.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Then he indicates that a man must love his wife through an example. Thus
        he says, <span style="font-weight: bold">Christ also</span> loved
        <span style="font-weight: bold">the Church</span> as something of his
        very self
        <span style="font-weight: bold">because we are members of his body</span
        >. “For we are members one of another” (Eph. 4:25). He mentions
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of his flesh</span> on account of his
        sharing the same nature with us. “For a spirit hath not flesh and bones,
        as you see me to have” (Lk. 24:39). Or, he says this mystically so that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of his flesh</span> refers to the weak
        who are of the flesh, and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of his bones</span> would refer to the
        strong who are hard as bone.

        The Apostle exhorted the Ephesians above to love their wives. He did
        this in two ways: both by offering the example of Christ’s love for the
        Church, and by the love a man has for himself (5:25), now he gives a
        third encouragement drawn from the authority of Scripture. Regarding
        this he does three things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he brings in the authoritative text.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, he explains it mystically (5:32).
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;

        "
      >
        Thirdly, he adapts it according to its literal meaning to the case in
        question (5:33).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The authoritative text is Genesis 2 (24); words spoken by Adam when be
        saw his wife who had been formed from his rib. Yet does not this
        contradict Matthew 19 (4-5) which states that God himself spoke these
        words? I reply that Adam spoke them as inspired by God, and God spoke
        them insofar as he was inspiring and teaching Adam. We use the same
        expressions; there are many words which the Lord spoke by those whom the
        spirit of God instructed; so Matthew 10 (20) affirms: “For it is not you
        who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaks in you.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be noted that in the above mentioned authority a threefold
        union of a man and wife is designated. The first union is through the
        devotion of their love, for it is strong enough in each that they both
        left their fathers behind. “So a man loves his wife better than his
        father or mother. Many have lost their heads completely for their wives”
        (3 Esd. 4:25-26), and much more concerning this is stated there [in 3
        Esd. 4]. But this is natural, for natural desires fit in harmoniously
        with actions that must be performed. It is evident that a desire exists
        in all higher agents that they administer to, and communicate with,
        lower agents. Thus a natural love for the lower is present in them. Now
        a man is an inferior in relation to his father and mother, he is not
        higher than they; hence he is naturally more drawn towards his wife and
        children, to whom he is superior, than to his parents. And also because
        his wife is intimately united to him in the act of procreation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second union is through living together. Thus he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and he shall cleave to his wife</span>.
        “With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God
        and men: the concord of brethren, and the love of neighbors, and man and
        wife that agree well together” (Sirach 25:1-2).
      </p>

        The third is their carnal union—
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and they shall be two in one flesh</span

        there is an active and a passive power. In plants both powers are in the
        same [plant], but in the perfect animals they are distinguished. And
        hence in the act of generation among animals the male and female become,
        as in plants, only one and the same body.158

        He goes on to interpret this mystically, and he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">This is a great sacrament</span>, it is
        the symbol of a sacred reality, namely, the union of Christ and the
        Church. “I will not hide from you the mysteries of God” (Wis. 6:24).

        Notice here that four Sacraments are termed great. Baptism by reason of
        its effect, since it blots out sin and opens the gate of paradise;
        Confirmation by reason of its minister, it is conferred only by bishops
        and not by others; the Eucharist because of what it contains, the Whole
        Christ; and Matrimony by reason of its signification, for it symbolizes
        the union of Christ and the Church. If, therefore, the text is
        mystically interpreted, the preceding passage should be explained as
        follows:
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For this cause shall a man</span>,
        namely, Christ,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">leave his father and mother</span>. I
        say <span style="font-weight: bold">leave his father</span>, because he
        was sent into the world and became incarnate—“I came forth from the
        Father and am come into the world” (Jn. 16:28)—
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and his mother</span> who was the
        synagogue—“I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance, I have
        given my dear soul into the hand of her enemies” (Jer. 12:7).
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And he shall cleave to his wife</span>,
        the Church. “Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of
        the world” (Mt. 28:20).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next, the point is argued by interpreting the above example according to
        its literal meaning. For there are certain passages in the Old Testament
        which can be said only of Christ. For instance, Psalm 21 (17): “They
        have dug my hands and feet: they have numbered all my bones”; or Isaias
        7 (14): “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and his name
        shall be called Emmanuel.” Other passages, however, can be explained as
        referring to Christ and others; to Christ principally, and to others as
        they were types of Christ. The above example (Gen. 2:24) is of this
        category.

        Thus it must first be interpreted in reference to Christ, and afterwards
        concerning others. Hence he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love his wife</span
        >, as though he asserted: The above example is principally related of
        Christ, but not only about him since it must be interpreted and
        fulfilled in other persons as types of Christ.” He states
        <span style="font-weight: bold">as himself</span> because, just as
        everyone loves himself in relation to God, so he ought to love his wife
        in this way, and not inasmuch as she draws him into sin. “If any man
        come to me, and hate not his father and mother and wife... he cannot be
        my disciple” (Lk. 14:26). But what about the wife?
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And let the wife fear her husband</span
        >, with the fear of reverence and submission since she must be subject
        to him.
