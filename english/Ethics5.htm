    Apparently everyone wants to call justice that habit by which men are
    disposed to just works, and by which they actually perform and will just
    deeds. We must speak in a similar way about injustice, viz., that it is a
    habit by which men are disposed to unjust deeds and by which they do and
    will unjust actions. For that reason we must presuppose what is said here in
    outline.

    Likewise, the same is not true in regard to sciences and potencies as in
    regard to habits, for contraries belong to the same potency and the same
    science, but with a habit contrary things are not referred to it. We see,
    for example, that things contrary to health do not proceed from health, but
    only things in keeping with it. Thus we say that a man walks in a healthy
    way when he walks like a healthy man.

    Oftentimes, then, one contrary habit is known by another, and oftentimes by
    its subject. If a healthy condition is known, then an unhealthy condition
    also becomes known. But from the things that make a man healthy a healthy
    condition is known, and the things themselves from the condition. If
    firmness of flesh is a sign of good condition, then flabbiness is
    necessarily a sign of bad condition. Likewise, what makes a man healthy
    necessarily makes his flesh firm.

    The unjust man should be understood in as many ways as he is designated. He
    is spoken of as lawbreaking, as covetous and as unfair. It is clear then
    that the just man will be taken as law-abiding and fair. Hence what is just
    is according to law and fair, but what is unjust is contrary to law and
    unfair.

    Since the unjust man is covetous, he will be concerned not about all goods
    but about whatever pertains to fortune and misfortune. Goods of this kind
    are always good in themselves but not always for a particular man. They are
    objects of his prayers and pursuits. This ought not to be so, but a man
    should pray that the things that are good in themselves become good for him,
    and should choose such as are good for him.

    But the unjust man does not always choose too much, rather sometimes too

    evil apparently is in some way a good—covetousness is concerned with a
    good—therefore it seems that this type of man is covetous. But he is
    unfair—a term which contains both and is common.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    885. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of the moral
    virtues dealing with the passions, he now begins to consider the virtue of
    justice dealing with actions. He divides the inquiry into two parts, in the
    first of which [I] he examines justice in the proper sense; and then [Lect.
    17], at “Whether or not it is possible etc.” (B. 1138 a 4), in the
    metaphorical sense. He discusses the first point under two headings.
    Initially [A] he investigates the virtue of justice; and then [Lect. 16], at
    “Next we will treat equity etc.” (B. 1137 a 31), a certain virtue, namely,
    equity that
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    gives direction to ordinary justice. He handles the initial point in a
    twofold manner. First [A’] he indicates what he intends to treat; and next
    [B’] at “Apparently everyone wants to call etc.,” he carries out his
    intention. He considers the first under two aspects. Initially [A’, 1] he
    shows what subject he intends to consider, viz., justice and injustice.
    Concerning justice he proposes for consideration three differences existing
    between justice and the previously mentioned virtues.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    886. The first difference is touched upon when he says that we must aim it
    such operations as are done by justice and injustice. The virtues and vices
    discussed before (649-884) are concerned with the passions, for there we
    consider. in what way a man may be internally influenced by reason of the
    passions; but we do not consider what is externally done, except as
    something secondary, inasmuch as external operations originate from internal
    passions. However, in treating justice and injustice we direct our principal
    attention to what a man does externally; how he is influenced internally we
    consider only as a by-product, namely, according as he is helped or hindered
    in the operation. The second difference is touched upon when he says “what
    is the mean of justice and the just action,” i.e., the object of justice. In
    the virtues previously treated we took the mean of reason and not of the
    thing. But in justice the mean of the thing is used, as will be determined
    later (932-977). The third difference is touched upon when he says “and
    between what extremes the just action is the mean.” Each of the
    afore-mentioned virtues is a mean between two vices, but justice is not a
    mean between two vices, as will be clear afterwards (993-994).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    887. Then [A’, 2], at “It is our intention,” he shows by what method we are
    to examine the differences just mentioned. He says that we intend to
    investigate justice in the same way as we investigated the virtues just
    discussed, i.e., according to type and so on.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    888. Next [B’], at “Apparently everyone etc.,” he begins the investigation
    of justice. First [B’, 1] he distinguishes particular from legal justice.
    Then [Lect. 4], at “One species of particular etc.” (B.1130 b 30), he
    considers particular justice, his principal concern. He discusses the first
    point in a threefold manner. First [i, a] he divides justice into legal and
    particular. Second [Lect. 2], at “Since it was said that etc.” (B.i129 b
    12), he shows what the nature of legal justice is. Third [Lect. 3], at “We
    are now investigating etc.” (B. 1l30 a 14), he explains that, besides legal
    justice, there is a particular justice. He treats the initial point in a
    twofold manner. First [a, i] he shows what the names, justice and injustice,
    signify; and then [a, ii], at “It follows in most instances etc.,” he
    distinguishes the two concepts. He develops the first under three headings.
    At the outset [i, x] he explains justice and injustice. Next [i, y], at
    “Likewise, the same etc.,” he shows that the explanation is reasonable. Last
    [i, z], at “Oftentimes then etc.,” he infers a corollary from the premises.
    He says in the beginning that all seem to contend that justice is the sort
    of habit that brings about three effects in man. The first is an inclination
    to a work of justice in accord with which a man is said to be disposed to
    just works. The second is a just action. The Third is that a man wants to
    perform just operations. We must say the same about injustice, namely, that
    it is a habit by which men are disposed to unjust deeds and by which they do
    and will unjust actions. For that reason we must presuppose these things
    about justice as apparently typical in such matters.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    889. Likewise, we must take into consideration that he properly explained
    justice after the manner of a will, which does not have passions but
    nevertheless is the principle of external actions. Consequently, the will is
    a proper subject of justice, which is not concerned with the passions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    890. At “Likewise, the same” [i, y] he shows that the preceding explanations
    are reasonable in this respect, viz., that justice is explained by the fact
    that its purpose is to will and perform just actions, and injustice to will
    and perform unjust actions. What is true of sciences and potencies is not
    true of habits, for contraries belong to the same potency (for example,
    white and black to sight) and to the same science (for instance, health and
    sickness to medicine). But in regard to habits, contrary things are not
    referred to them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    891. He takes an example from habits of the body. Not the things that are
    contrary to health but only those in keeping with health proceed from
    health. In this way we say that a man walks with a vigorous step who is
    vigorous in health. Hence science itself, as it is a kind of knowledge,
    refers to contraries inasmuch as one of contraries is the reason for knowing
    the other; nevertheless, inasmuch as science is a certain habit, it is
    attributed to one act only (which is knowing the truth) and not to the
    contrary error. So then it was properly said that by justice we do just
    actions; by injustice, unjust actions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    892. Then [i, z], at “Oftentimes, then,” he infers a corollary from the
    premises. Since contrary habits belong to contraries, and one act belongs to
    one object in a fixed manner, it follows that frequently one contrary habit
    is known by another and oftentimes by its object which is, as it were,
    matter subject to the operation of the habit. He illustrates this by an
    example. If <i>evexia</i> or a healthy condition is known,
    <i>cachexia</i> or an unhealthy condition is also known. In this way a habit
    is known by its contrary. Likewise it is known from its object because from
    the things that make a man healthy, a healthy condition becomes known. This
    is further illustrated in a more particular way. If the fact that a man has
    very firm flesh is a characteristic of a healthy condition, then the fact
    that he has flabby flesh—as it were loosely compressed by reason of
    disordered humors—is necessarily characteristic of an unhealthy condition.
    Again, that which makes a man healthy is necessarily a condition making him
    have firm flesh.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    893. Next [a, ii], at “It follows in most instances,” he distinguishes
    justice and injustice. First [ii, x] he gives the division; and then [ii,
    y], at “Since the unjust man etc.,” the parts of the division. He treats the
    first point in three ways. At the outset [x, aa] he shows that various
    meanings of injustice indicate various meanings of justice. The reason is
    that it follows in most instances that if one of opposites may be spoken of
    in diverse ways, then the other can be. This is the case, too, with what is
    just and unjust.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    894. Second [x, bb], at “Justice and injustice,” he explains the nature of
    their various meanings. He says that both justice and injustice can be
    spoken of in diverse ways, but their many meanings lie concealed because the
    things making for equivocation are close to one another in their agreement
    among themselves. But in widely separated things equivocation is evident, if
    the same name be given them, because their great difference in concept,
    i.e., in the essential element of the proper species, is immediately
    apparent. In this way the name key is used equivocally of an instrument
    which locks doors and of the clavicle (<i>clavicula</i> i.e. little key)
    which covers the artery in the shoulder of animals.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    895. Third [x, cc], at “The unjust man,” he explains in how many ways the
    previously mentioned habits may be signified, saying that first we must
    consider the unjust man in as many ways as he is designated. He is spoken of
    in three ways: in one way as the lawbreaking man, i.e., one who acts
    contrary to the law; in another way as the covetous man who wants too much
    prosperity; in the last way as the unfair man who determines to have too few
    burdens.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    896. It is obvious then that the man is taken in two ways: in one way as a
    law-abiding person, i.e., as one who observes the law; in the other way as
    the fair person who is willing to have the smiles and frowns of fortune in
    equal measure. The equal is opposed to both, i.e., to what is excessive and
    to what is deficient. From this he draws a further conclusion that what is
    just is said to be according to the law and fair; and what is unjust,
    contrary to the law and unfair inasmuch as objects are made known by habits,
    as was said before (892).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    897. At “Since the unjust man” [ii, y] he makes clear the parts: of the
    division just given. First [y, aa] he shows in what way the covetous man is
    said to be unjust. He affirms that since the covetous person who wants to
    have too much is unjust, it follows that he will be concerned about an
    abundance of goods which men desire. However, he will not be solicitous
    about all goods but only those pertaining to fortune and adversity. Goods of
    this kind are beneficial if we do not make qualification, i.e., they are
    good considered independently and in themselves. But they are not always
    beneficial for an individual because they are not always proportionate to
    him nor always expedient for him. However, men seek these goods from God,
    and pray for and desire them as if such things were always beneficial. By
    reason of this they become covetous and unjust. It should not be this way,
    but a man ought to pray that those things that are in themselves good be
    made good for him, so that each may choose what is good for him, i.e., the
    proper exercise of virtue.

    898. Then [y, bb], at “But the unjust man,” he shows how the unjust person
    is said to be unfair, stating that a man is not always called unjust because
    he chooses too much but because he chooses too little of the things that
    simply and considered in themselves are burdensome—like labors, lack of
    necessities and so on. However, since lesser evil apparently is in some way
    a good precisely as it is eligible—covetousness regards a good as was just
    said (897)—it seems for this reason that a person who desires too little of
    what is arduous is in some way covetous. But it is nearer the truth to say
    that he is unfair-a term that contains both and is common to excess and
    defect.

    899. Last [y, cc], at “Besides, the unjust,” he explains how the unjust man
    is said to be lawbreaking, affirming that he who is unlawful is also called
    unjust. A person is designated a lawbreaker by reason of unlawfulness which
    is also an inequality inasmuch as a man is not equal to the norm of the law.
    This unlawfulness contains in general all injustice and something common in
    respect of every kind of injustice, as will be made clear later (911, 919,
    922).

        Legal justice is perfect because the person who has this virtue can
        exercise it in relation to another and not in relation to himself alone.
        Some people can apply virtue to their own affairs but not to affairs
        pertaining to others. Because of this, the saying of Bias seems to be
        commendable that authority tests a man, for the prince is already
        engaged in communication with others. Therefore, justice alone among the
        virtues seems to be another’s good because it refers to another. It
        produces goods useful to another, viz., the prince or the common good.
        Consequently, the man who practices vice in regard to himself and his
        friends is most wicked. On the other hand the man who practices virtue
        in regard to himself and toward others—a difficult thing to do—is most
        honorable.

        How virtue and justice differ from one another is evident from what has

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        900. After the Philosopher has given the division of justice, he now
        considers legal justice. First [A] he treats the legally just itself,
        which is the object of legal justice. Second [B], at “Justice itself
        then etc., he considers legal justice. He discusses the first point in a
        twofold manner. First [A, 1 ] he shows that the legally just is
        determined by law. Now [A, 2], at “But laws aim etc.,” he explains the
        nature of legal enactments. He affirms first that, since it was said
        above (895-896, 899) that the lawless man is unjust and the law-abiding
        man just, it clearly follows that all lawful acts are just in some
        measure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        goi. He says “in some measure” because every law is determined in
        relation to some state. Now, not every state possesses what is simply
        just but some states have only what is partially just, as is evident in
        the third book of the Politics (Ch. 9, 1281 a 10; St. Th. Lect. 7, 413).
        In a democratic state where all the people govern, what is partially
        just is observed but not what is simply just, so that because all the
        citizens are equal in one respect (i.e., in liberty), therefore they are
        considered equal in every respect. Consequently, acts that are
        prescribed by law in a democracy are not simply but only in some measure
        just. But Aristotle says that those enactments are lawful that have been
        fixed and determined by positive law, which is within the competence of
        legislators, and that each enactment so decreed is said to he just in
        some way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        902. Next [A’, 2], at “But laws aim,” he explains with what the decrees
        of law are concerned. He considers this point from two aspects. First
        [2, a] he shows for whose sake a law is enacted. Then [2, b], at “A law
        commands,” he shows on what matters laws are made. He says first that
        laws touch on everything that can be of any possible utility for the
        community (as in the ideal states where the common good is kept in
        mind), or for the utility of the best (i.e., certain elders of the state
        who govern it and are called nobles), or for the utility ofthe rulers
        (as happens in states ruled by kings and tyrants). In the framing of
        laws attention is always given to what is useful to the affair of chief
        importance in the city.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        903. Some may be considered as best or as ruling either because of
        virtue (as in an aristocratic state where certain ones rule on account
        of virtue), or for the sake of something else (as in an oligarchy where
        the few rule on account of riches or power). Since human utility of
        every kind is finally ordered to happiness, obviously the legal
        enactments that bring about happiness and the means to it (i.e., the
        things that are ordered to happiness either principally, like the
        virtues, or instrumentally like riches and other external goods of this
        kind) are called just in some fashion. This is by comparison with the
        civic community to which the framing of a law is directed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        904. At “A law commands” [2, b] he explains on what matters laws are
        made, saying that a law commands what belongs to individual virtues. It
        commands deeds of bravery, for instance, that a soldier should not leave
        the battle line, nor take flight, nor throw away his arms. Likewise, it
        commands things pertaining to temperance, for example, that no one
        should commit adultery, that no one should dishonor the person of a
        woman. Also it commands the things belonging to meekness: no one should
        strike another in anger, no one should contend with another by insults.
        It is the same with other virtues whose acts the law commands, and with
        other vices whose acts the law forbids.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        905. If the law is rightly drafted according to this, it will be
        declared an excellent law. Otherwise it is called
        <i>aposchediasmenos</i> (from <i>a</i> meaning without,
        <i>poschedias</i> meaning knowledge, and <i>menos</i> meaning a
        searching) as if the law was drafted without a thorough knowledge, or
        the expression may come from <i>schedos</i> signifying a decree
        published without being thoroughly scanned, from which we have
        <i>schediazo</i>, i.e., I am doing something off-hand. Hence a law is
        said to be <i>aposchediasmenos</i> which lacks proper forethought.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        906. Then [B], at “Justice itself then,” he determines how legal justice
        is constituted, showing first [B, 1] the nature of legal justice; and
        then [B, 2], at “But under justice,” in what way it is related to the
        virtues. He says first that justice itself is a certain perfect virtue
        not in terms of itself but in relation to another. Since it is better to
        be perfect not only in oneself but also in relation to another,
        therefore it is often said that this justice is the most excellent among
        all virtues. This is the origin of the proverb that neither Hesperus nor
        Lucifer, the brightest of the morning and evening stars, shine with such
        brilliance as justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        907. Next [B, 2], at “But under justice,” he shows from our discussion
        thus far how legal justice is related to the virtues. He treats this
        point under three headings. First [B, 2, a] he sets forth his intention.
        Then [B, 2, b], at “Legal justice is perfect etc.,” he explains his
        proposition. Lastly [B, 2, c], at “How virtue and justice etc.,” he
        settles a point which could be called in question by the present
        discussion. He states first that justice itself comprehends every virtue
        at the same time and is even the perfect virtue in a special way. The
        reason is that legal justice consists in the exercise of virtue having
        do with another and is in agreement with every virtue prescribed by the
        law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        908. At “Legal justice is perfect” [ B, 2, b] he explains what was set
        forth: first [b, i] that legal justice is an especially perfect virtue;
        and then, at “This virtue, therefore” [b, ii], that it includes every
        virtue. He says first that legal justice is a perfect virtue because a
        man who has this virtue can employ it in relation to another and not to
        himself only—something not characteristic of all virtuous people. Many
        can practice virtue in things pertaining to themselves but not in the
        things pertaining to others. To make clear the previous statements he
        introduces two common sayings or proverbs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        909. Bias, one of the seven wise men, said that authority tests whether
        a man is perfect or deficient. The man who rules is already engaged in
        communication with another because it is his business to arrange the
        things which are ordered to the common good. So from this we see that
        the perfection of virtue is indicated by the fact that one person is in
        touch with another. He proposes another saying to show that legal
        justice refers to another. For this reason legal justice alone seems to
        be the good of another (that is, relates to our neighbor) inasmuch as it
        aims to perform actions useful to another, viz., to the community or the
        ruler of the community. But some virtues aim to achieve an individual’s
        good, for instance, temperance strives to quiet the disgraceful desires
        of the soul. The same is true of the other virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        910. He draws the conclusion that, as that man is most wicked who
        practices vice not only in regard to himself but also in regard to his
        friends, so, that man is most honorable who practices virtue in relation
        not only to himself but also to others. This is especially difficult. So
        then it is clear that the law-abiding just man is most virtuous and
        legal justice is the most perfect of virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        911. Then [b, ii], at “This virtue, therefore,” he infers that legal
        justice embraces every virtue, for it pertains to legal justice to
        exercise virtue in regard to another. But a person can practice every
        virtue in his relation with another. Hence obviously legal justice is
        not a particular virtue but has a connection with virtue in general.
        Likewise, the opposite vice is not a particular vice but a general vice,
        since in a similar way man can exercise every vice in his relations with
        his neighbor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        912. Next [B, 2, c], at “How justice and virtue,” he clarifies something
        that may be doubtful from the premises. He says that it is clear, from
        what has been said, the way in which virtue and legal justice differ
        since they are the same in substance but different in concept. However,
        virtue in its relation to another is called justice, but precisely as it
        is a habit operative of such good, it is a virtue simply. This must be
        understood in regard to the act itself of justice and virtue, for an act
        identical in subject but diverse in concept is produced by legal justice
        and by virtue simply so called, for instance, not to commit adultery.
        But where a special formal aspect of an object exists even in general
        matter, thee a special habit must be found. For this reason it follows
        that legal justice is a definite virtue taking its species from this,
        that it tends to the common good.

        The proof for the existence of a particular justice is that a man who
        practices other vices acting unjustly, nevertheless does not act
        covetously, for example, one who throws away his shield out of
        cowardice, or who speaks ill of another out of anger, or who refuses
        financial help because of stinginess. On the other hand, a person often
        sins by covetousness, although not by one or all of the other vices, but
        he does sin by this particular vice, for we reproach him for being
        unjust. There is then another kind of injustice, a part of injustice in
        general. Likewise, there is a certain unjust thing that is a part of
        that which is legally unjust.

        Moreover, if one man commits adultery for the sake of gain and makes
        money by this act, while another commits adultery for the sake of
        concupiscence and pays, thus sustaining a loss; the second man seems to
        be more lustful than the first who is unjust rather than lustful, for
        obviously he acted for gain.

        cowardice. If anyone strikes another, it is attributed to anger. But if
        a person makes an exorbitant profit, it is not reduced to any other vice
        but only to injustice. Hence it is clear that over and above general
        justice, there is a particular justice.

        Therefore, in accord with the illegally unjust thing, there is an
        injustice that we previously discussed. Now, the unjust thing that
        consists in a desire for inequality is not the same, but is related to
        the other as a part to the whole, for every unjust thing consisting in a
        desire for inequality is an illegally unjust thing but not the reverse.
        Besides, the excessive is unequal but not the reverse. Because one
        unjust thing is not the same as another, so also one injustice is not
        the same as another but different from it as a part from the whole. The

        Justice that corresponds to all of virtue and injustice that corresponds
        to all of vice, as their exercise pertains to our neighbor, are both to
        be passed over for the present. It is evident in these cases how the
        just thing must be determined. Nearly all legal enactments are
        prescribed by the general virtue, for the law commands us to live
        according to every virtue and forbids us to live according to any vice.

        However, positive laws are productive of virtue in general in regard to
        instruction which pertains to the common good. But that instruction
        according to which a man is good simply, whether it belongs to political
        science or some other science, must be determined afterwards. Perhaps,
        to be a good man and to be a good citizen are not the same thing in any

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        913. After the Philosopher has shown that besides this there is a
        particular what is the nature of legal justice, which is a general
        virtue, now he shows justice. He treats this point under three headings.
        First [A] he indicates his proposition; and then [B], at “The proof for
        etc.,” he explains it. Last [C], at “Obviously then etc.,” he sums up
        what has already been said and shows what remains to be discussed. He
        says first that, while legal justice is a general virtue, we are not
        principally investigating this at present, but that which as a part of
        the general virtue is a particular virtue. As is commonly held, there is
        such a virtue. Also we intend to speak about particular injustice in a
        similar manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        914. Then [B], at “The proof for,” he explains the proposition. He
        discusses this point from two aspects. First [B, 1] he shows that
        besides legal justice, which is a general virtue, there is a justice
        that is a particular virtue. Next [B, 2], at “This justice etc.,” he
        assigns the reason why it has a name in common with legal justice. On
        this question we must consider that to prove there is a justice that is
        a particular virtue, he takes for granted that there is an injustice
        that is a particular vice, for we said above (892) that habits are made
        known by their contraries. He proposes three arguments for this. The
        first argument [B, 1, a] is taken according to the real distinction of
        injustice from other vices inasmuch as injustice is found without the
        others and conversely. From this it is evident that injustice is a
        particular vice distinct from other vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        915. He says that we have this proof that there is a particular justice
        and injustice because a man, who practices other particular vices acting
        unjustly according to legal injustice, nevertheless does not act
        covetously in taking something from his neighbor, for example, when a
        soldier throws away his shield because of cowardice, or a man casts
        opprobrium on someone because of anger, or a person refuses financial
        help to a friend because of the vice of stinginess. So other vices can
        exist without covetousness which is a special kind of injustice.
        Sometimes, on the contrary, it happens that a person sins by
        covetousness in taking another’s goods; although he does not sin by some
        one or all of the other vices, he does sin by a particular vice. This is
        clear because he is reproached as unjust for that reason. Hence
        obviously there is another justice-a part of the virtue-that is a
        special virtue. So evidently there exists also a certain unjust thing
        that is a part of what is legally unjust-the legally unjust being the
        unjust thing in general.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        916. At “Moreover, if one man” [B, 1, b] he gives the second argument,
        which is taken from the order to the end. Clearly, if a vicious or evil
        act is ordered to another unbecoming end, from this fact it will obtain
        a new species of vice. This is so when a man commits adultery for the
        sake of gain, for example, to rob a woman or to take from her in any way
        whatsoever. Also it happens sometimes that a man commits adultery
        entirely because of concupiscence, so that he not only does not gain but
        rather gives something of his own and suffers a loss of is goods. A man
        of this sort seems to be lustful, essentially speaking (<i>per se</i>),
        since the vice of lust is strictly ordered to the satisfaction of
        concupiscence. But the man who commits adultery to take a woman’s goods
        does not seem to be lustful, absolutely speaking, because he does not
        intend lust as his end. He seems rather to be unjust since he sins
        against justice for the sake of gain. So it is clear then that injustice
        is a special vice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        917. At “Yet in all” [B, i, c] he assigns the third argument, which is
        taken by comparison with legal justice. As nothing is contained in a
        genus that is not contained in some species, so anything that is done
        according to legal injustice is reduced to a particular vice. If a man
        acts contrary to legal justice by committing adultery, this will be
        referred to the vice of lust. If a soldier deserts his general in
        battle, this will be attributed to the vice of cowardice. If anyone
        immoderately strikes his neighbor, this will be ascribed to the vice of
        a anger. But if a person inordinately enriches himself by pilfering
        another’s goods, this will not be ascribed to any other vice except
        injustice. Hence it remains that there is a particular injustice over
        and above the other injustice that is a general vice. For a like reason
        there is another particular justice besides legal justice that is a
        general virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        918. Then [B, 2] at “This justice has,” he shows why a particular virtue
        of this kind is also named justice. First [B, 2, a] he assigns the
        reason for this from the agreement of particular with legal justice.
        Next [B, 2, b], at “But particular justice,” he explains the difference
        between them. He says first that particular justice is univocal, that
        is, has a common name with legal justice. The reason is that they agree
        in definition according to the same genus inasmuch as both are concerned
        about what relates to another. However, legal justice is taken into
        account in relation to what is the common good, while particular justice
        is ordered to another as pertaining to a private person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        919. Next [B, 2, b], at “But particular justice,” he explains the
        difference between justice and injustice on part of the matter. He says
        that particular justice regards those things hat take into account
        social intercourse, like honor, money, whatever pertains to the safety
        or harm to the body, and so on. Likewise, particular justice is
        concerned not alone with external things but also with pleasure
        consequent on the profit by which a man takes his neighbor’s goods
        beyond what he ought. But legal justice and injustice treat all moral
        matters in general in whatsoever way a man may be said to be good or
        virtuous about a thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        920. At “Obviously then” [C] he summarizes what has been said and shows
        what remains to be discussed. First [C, 1] he sets this forth in a
        general way; and then [C, 2] at “We have determined etc.,” he takes it
        up in a specific way. He says first that it is clear from the premises
        (913-919) that there is more than one justice, viz., legal justice and
        justice aiming at equality, and that over and above legal justice, as a
        general virtue, there is a particular justice. But we must determine
        later on (927-1077) the nature and characteristics of particular
        justice.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        921. Then [C, 2], at “We have determined,” he shows in detail what has
        been treated and what remains to be discussed. First [C, 2, a] he
        resumes what was said about the distinction between justice and
        injustice. He affirms that we have determined that the unjust thing is
        called illegal and unequal either by excess or defect. On the contrary,
        the just thing is called legal and equal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        922. Next [C, 2, b], at “Therefore, in accord with,” he resumes what he
        has said, viz., that as there is a twofold just thing, so there is a
        twofold justice. He affirms that in accord with the illegally unjust
        thing there is a certain injustice, previously discussed (911, 919),
        which is a general vice. Likewise, in accord with the just corresponding
        to the law, there is a certain justice that is a general virtue. Now,
        the unjust thing consisting in a desire for inequality and the illegally
        unjust thing are not altogether the same, but one is related to the
        other as a part to the whole so that every unjust thing consisting in a
        desire for inequality is an illegally unjust thing, but not the reverse.
        Again, every thing that is excessive is unequal but not the reverse,
        since there is a certain illegal injustice in having too few burdens.
        Because (I say) one unjust thing is a part of the other unjust thing,
        and they are not entirely the same; in a similar way, therefore, the
        injustice called inequality is not entirely the same as illegal
        injustice but is compared to it as a part to the whole. Also the justice
        aiming at equality is compared to legal justice in a similar manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        923. Last [C, 2, c], at “We must then,” he shows which of these things
        we must discuss. On this point he does three things. First [c, i] he
        says that we must treat particular justice after this (927-1077), and
        similarly the just and the unjust thing particularly so called.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        924. Then [c, ii], at “Justice that corresponds,” he explains that here
        we are not going to treat legal justice. He affirms that legal
        justice-which conforms to all of virtue inasmuch as the use of the whole
        of virtue referring to our neighbor pertains to it-is to be passed over
        for the present. Likewise, the opposite injustice (inasmuch as the use
        of the whole of vice pertains to it) is to be passed over. It is clear
        how what is just and unjust ought to be determined according to justice
        and injustice of this kind, because they are the precepts as laid down
        by the law. The greater part of legal prescriptions are enjoined in
        agreement with the whole of virtue inasmuch as the law commands us to
        live according to every virtue and forbids us to live according to any
        vice. However, there are certain determinations of the law that do not
        belong directly to the exercise of any virtue but to some disposition of
        external goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        925. Last [c, iii], at “However, positive law,” he raises a doubt. It is
        evident that positive laws are productive of virtue in general by the
        instruction given a man in reference to the common good. But there is
        another kind of instruction by which a man is trained in virtuous
        actions as applicable to him individually, i.e., to his proper good
        inasmuch as in this way a man becomes virtuous in himself. Therefore,
        there can be a doubt whether instruction of this kind should belong to
        political science or to so-me other science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        926. He says that this question must be settled afterwards in the work
        on Politics. It is proved in the third book of the Politics (Ch. 4, 1276
        b 16-1277 b 33; St. Th. Lect. 3, 365-377) that to be a good man simply
        and to be a good citizen are not the same in every state. There are some
        states not worthy of honor in which a person can be a good citizen yet
        not be a good man. But in the most worthy state no one is a good citizen
        who is not a good man.

        Since the unjust person is unfair and the unjust thing is unequal, it is
        clear that there is a mean corresponding to what is unjust. This is the
        equal, for in operations of this kind where there is more or less, there
        is also an equal. Therefore, if the unjust thing is the unequal and, the
        just thing the equal—and this is evident in all situations without need
        of proof—then the just thing will be the mean since the equal is the
        mean.

        However, the equal implies at least two things. Therefore, since the
        just thing is both a mean and an equal, it necessarily is related to
        another and pertains to certain matters of equality. As a mean it will
        be between two things which are more and less. As it is an equal it will
        be between two things. As it is a just thing it will concern matters in
        relation to other persons, for justice regards another. Therefore, the
        just necessarily involves at least four objects, viz., two persons by
        whom justice is observed and two things about which justice is done.
        There will be the same equality between persons and between things in
        such a way that, as things are related to one another, so are persons.
        If they are not equal they will not have equal shares, and from this
        source quarrels and complaints. will arise, when either persons who are
        equal do not receive equal shares in distribution, or persons who are
        not equal do receive equal shares.

        Moreover, this is clear from the fact that bestowal should be made
        according to merit, for the just thing in distribution has to be done
        according to a certain merit. But all do not agree that merit consists
        in the same thing. People of a democracy place it in a condition of
        freedom, people of an oligarchy in one’s riches or nobility of birth,
        and people of an aristocracy in a state of virtue.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        927. After the Philosopher has differentiated particular justice from
        legal justice, he now begins to investigate particular justice without
        treating legal justice. He divides the investigation into two parts. In
        the first part [I] he considers particular justice in a general way by
        comparison with its proper object, and in the second part [Lect. 11], at
        “Since someone etc.” (B. 1134 a 16), he considers it in its application
        to the subject. In regard to the first part, he does two things.
        Initially [A] he makes a division of particular justice. Next [B], at
        “Since the unjust person etc.,” he explains how a mean may be taken in
        this virtue. He discusses the initial point from three aspects. First
        [A’] he indicates a species of particular justice. He says that one
        species—the same holds for the unjust thing corresponding to it—consists
        in the distribution of certain common goods (either honor or money or
        any other thing belonging to external goods or even to external evils,
        like labor, expenses and so on) that are to be apportioned among people
        who share in social community. He proves that this should belong to
        particular justice because in matters of this kind, equality and
        inequality—which belong to particular justice and injustice, as was
        stated before (922).Of one person to another are taken into
        consideration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        928. Next [B’], at “Another species,” he gives a second kind of
        particular justice. He says that another species establishes a measure
        of justice in transactions, by which a thing is transferred from one
        person to another -in the first species the transfer of a thing from the
        community to the individual was considered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        929. Last [C’], at “There sire two parts,” he subdivides commutative
        justice according to the different kinds of transactions, making a
        twofold division. He says first [1] that there are two parts of
        commutative justice because there are two kinds of transactions. Some
        are voluntary, others involuntary. The voluntary are so-called because
        the principle of transaction is voluntary in both parties as is evident
        in <i>selling and buying</i>, by which one man transfers the dominion
        over his own property to another as compensation for a price received;
        in <i>barter</i>, by which someone gives what is his to another for
        something of equal value; in <i>bail</i>, by which a person voluntarily
        appoints himself a debtor for another; in a <i>loan</i>, by which a man
        grants the use of his property to another without recompense but
        reserves ownership of the thing to himself; in a <i>deposit</i>, by
        which one commits something of his to the custody of another; in
        <i>rent</i>, by which a person accepts the use of something belonging to
        another for a price.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        930. Then [2], at “Some kinds of involuntary,” he subdivides the other
        division of transactions, saying that some involuntary transactions are
        occult: like theft by which one takes a thing belonging to another who
        is unwilling; adultery, by which a man secretly approaches the wife of
        another for sexual intercourse, poisoning, which a person poison another
        with intent either to kill or injure in some way. Also they are
        especially called poisoners who by some sorcery bring about murder or
        harm. <i>Paragogia</i> is a derivation or a leading away, for example
        the occult diversion of a stream belonging to one person to the property
        of another. The enticement of a slave takes place when someone induces
        another’s slave to flee from his master. Assassination is that slaying
        which happens from wounds inflicted by trickery. Testimony is false in
        which a person conceals the truth by lying. Other transactions are
        involuntary and done by manifest violence. Thus a man may use violence
        either upon a person by beating, fettering, murdering, or upon things by
        robbing another of his goods, by despoiling parents of their children
        through murder. Likewise, a man may use violence through infamy by using
        reproachful words, or through injury by inflicting outrage.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        931. We must consider that the voluntary and involuntary in transactions
        make a difference in the species of justice because voluntary
        transactions cause the subtraction of only a thing which must be repaid
        according to the equality of justice. But involuntary transactions cause
        a certain injury. Hence the robber is forced not only to return the
        thing plundered but to undergo punishment because of the affront
        inflicted. Since the involuntary is twofold, viz., arising from force
        and from ignorance, he divides involuntary transactions into those which
        are occult, as it were through ignorance, and those that are done openly
        through violence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        932. Next [B], at “Since the unjust person,” he shows how a mean is
        understood in these matters. He discusses this point from two aspects.
        First [13, A’] he explains how the just thing is a mean; and then [Lect.
        10], at “From these discussions etc.” (B. 1133 b 30), how justice is a
        mean. He treats the first point in a twofold manner. First [A’, 1 ] he
        shows in what way the just thing, consisting in a mean according to
        either justice, may be determined. Next [Lect. 8], at “Some philosophers
        seem to think etc.” (B. 1132 b 21), he rejects an error. He further
        discusses the first point in two stages. First [1, a] he explains how
        the just thing may be taken as a mean according to distributive justice;
        and second (Lect. 6], at “There remains another etc.” (B. 1131 b 25),
        according to commutative justice. He considers the first point in two
        ways. First [a, i] he proves that the mean of distributive should be
        taken according to a certain relationship of proportions. Next [Lect.
        5],at “Therefore the just thing etc.” (B. 113i a 30), he shows what the
        nature of that relationship of proportions is. On the initial point he
        does two things. First [i, x] he proves the proposition from the very
        concept of justice; and then [ i, y ], at “Moreover, this is clear
        etc.,” from the concept of merit. He treats the first point under two
        headings. First [x, aa] he shows from the very notion of justice that
        the just thing is a certain mean. Second [x, bb], at “However, the equal
        etc.,” he explains that the mean is according to a certain relationship
        of proportions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        913. He says first that, as was said previously (898, 921), the unjust
        man is one who desires an inequality of good and evil, and the unjust
        thing is that which consists in an inequality, and concerns both too
        much and too little. But wherever there is more and less, there the
        equal must be found, for the equal is the mean between the greater and
        the less. Hence wherever we find equality, there we find a mean. It is
        clear then that the unjust thing is a kind of unequal thing. That the
        just thing is a kind of equal thing is obvious to everyone without any
        proof. Therefore, since the equal is a mean between more and less, as
        has been shown (310, 896, 898), it follows that the just thing is a kind
        of mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        934. At “However, the equal” [x, bb] he explains that the just thing is
        a mean according to a certain relationship of proportions. To prove this
        he takes for granted that the equal consists in at least two things
        between which an equality is considered. Therefore, since the just thing
        is both a mean and an equal, inasmuch as it is just, it is necessarily a
        relation to something, i.e., with respect to another, as is evident from
        what has been indicated (922); but inasmuch as it is an equal it
        pertains to certain matters in which equality between two persons is
        taken into account. Thus it is evident that if we consider the just
        thing precisely as a mean, it will then be a mean between two things
        that are more and less. But precisely as the just thing is an equal, it
        must be between two things (as a just thing, of course, it must concern
        some matters in relation to other persons, because justice regards
        another person). However, justice insofar as it is a mean, an extrinsic
        thing, considers more or less; but as something intrinsic it considers
        two things and two persons in which justice is established. So it is
        clear that what is just, necessarily consists in at least four objects,
        viz., two persons by whom justice is observed and two things about which
        justice is done.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        935. In the concept of justice there must be the same equality between
        persons who practice justice and between things about which justice is
        done, so that as the things are related to one another, so are the
        persons. Otherwise they will not have shares proportional to themselves.
        But, by reason of this quarrels and complaints arise as if justice had
        been neglected because, either persons who are equal do not receive
        equal shares, for example, if laborers are paid wages for doing an
        unequal amount of work, or are paid unequal wages for doing an equal
        amount of work. So then it is evident that the mean of distributive
        justice is taken according to a certain relationship of proportions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        936. Then [i, y], at “Moreover, this is,” he shows that it is obvious
        also by reason of merit that the just thing consists in a certain
        relationship of fore they think it proper that equal proportions. In
        this way a thing is said to be just in distributions inasmuch as
        allotment is made according to merit as each is worthy to receive. A
        certain relationship of proportions is designated by this—that as one
        person is deserving of one thing, so another is deserving of another
        thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        937. However, all do not judge merit in distribution in agreement with
        the same norm. In a democratic state where everyone governs, they judge
        merit according to a condition of freedom. Because the common people are
        the equal of others in freedom, therefore they think it proper that
        equal distribution be made to them. In an oligarchy where some few rule,
        they measure merit according to a man’s riches or according to nobility
        of birth, so that men who are more eminent by birth or riches should
        have more of the common goods. In an aristocracy where certain men
        govern because of their virtue, they measure merit according to a state
        of virtue, so that a man should have more who practices virtue more
        perfectly. Thus it is clear that the mean of distributive justice is
        understood according to a relationship of proportions.

        it twice, for example, A is in proportion to B as B is to G. So B has

        This just thing then is a proportional. But the unjust thing is outside

        distributions where a man acts unjustly when he accepts too much and a
        man suffers unjustly when he has too little of good. The reverse is true
        in regard to evil. By comparison with a greater evil a lesser evil has
        the aspect of good, for a lesser evil is preferable to a greater one.
        Good is preferable, and a greater good is more to be preferred. This

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        938. After the Philosopher has shown that the mean of distributive
        justice is taken according to proportionality, he now shows according to
        what proportionality and in what way it is understood. He considers this
        point in a twofold manner. First [A] he explains in what way the just
        thing should be taken according to a certain proportionality. Second
        [B], at “This just thing etc.,” he shows how the unjust thing is outside
        that proportionality. He discusses the initial point under three
        aspects. First [A, 1] he presents in advance some general comments about
        proportionality. Then [A, 2], at “Like proportionality etc.,” he
        explains how the just thing consists in a certain proportionality. Last
        [A, 3], at “Mathematicians call etc.,” he shows the nature of
        proportionality by which a thing is judged just in distributive justice.
        On the first point he premises two comments. The first [1, a] is that
        the just thing is fittingly said to be according to proportionality,
        because proportionality is found not only in the enumeration of units
        (which is number simply taken and here called abstract number), but the
        quality of being proportionate is met with wherever number is found.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        939. This is so because proportionality is simply geometrical equality,
        i.e. this to this and that to that contains the proportion of equality.
        Proportion is only a relation of one quantity to another. But quantity
        has the nature of a measure. It is found in numerical unity and is
        transferred from there to every kind of quantity, as the tenth book of
        the <i>Metaphysics</i> indicates (Ch. 1, 1052 b 20 sq.; St. Th. Lect. 2,
        1938). Therefore, number primarily is found in the enumeration of units,
        and thence is attributed to every genus of quantity which is measured
        according to the idea of number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        940. He makes the second comment at “Proportionality consists” [1, b],
        saying that every proportionality consists of four parts at least. It
        has a twofold division, one of which is a disjunctive proportionality
        and the other a continuous proportionality. The disjunctive
        proportionality is an equality of two proportions not alike in any term.
        Therefore, when any proportion exists between the two, it is evident
        that the disjunctive proportionality consists of four terms, as when I
        say: as six is to three as ten is to five. There is a double proportion
        on both sides. The continuous proportionality is an equality of two
        proportions alike in one term, for instance, if I say: as eight is to
        four so four is to two. There is a double proportion on both sides.
        Therefore in this continuous proportionality there are in some measure
        four terms inasmuch as we use one term in two different aspects,
        declaring it twice, i.e., in either proportion as when I say: the
        proportion of A to B (or eight to four) is the same as the proportion B
        to C (or four to two). There is a double proportion from both sides. In
        this way B is used twice. Hence, although B is one in subject,
        nevertheless, because it is taken in two different aspects there will be
        four proportioned terms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        941. Then [A, 2], at “Like proportionality” he shows how the mean of
        distributive justice is taken according to proportionality. He says
        that, like proportionality, the just thing is found in four terms in
        which the same proportion is observed, because the things that are
        distributed and the persons to whom distribution is made are divided
        according to the same proportion. Therefore, let A be one term, for
        example, two pounds, and B one pound. But let G be one person, for
        example, Socrates who has worked two days, and D, Plato, who has worked
        one day. Therefore, as A is to B so G is to D, because a double
        proportion is found on the one side and the other. Hence by alternation,
        as A is to G, so B is to D. Whatever things are proportionable one to
        another are proportionable by alternation, as is evident in the
        preceding example (940), for instance, as ten is to five so eight is to
        four. Therefore, by alternation, as ten is to eight, so five is to four,
        for there is a ratio of five to four on one side and the other. In this
        way then, by alternation, it will be true to say that as A is to G,
        i.e., two pounds to the man who worked two days, so B is to D, i.e., one
        pound to the man who worked a day.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        942. In such matters we must also consider that in the things
        proportionable in this way, the ratio of one to the other is the ratio
        of the whole to the whole. For example, if the ratio ten to eight is the
        same as five to four, it follows further that the ratio ten to eight and
        five to four will be the same ratio as ten and five taken together’
        i.e., fifteen to eight and four taken together, i.e., twelve. The reason
        is that here we have also the ratio of five to four. How does this
        happen? Because fifteen contains twelve and its fourth part, i.e.,
        three.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        943. In the proposition it follows that, if as this thing is to this
        person, so that thing is to that person, then also the whole will be to
        the whole in the same way, i.e., both things taken together will be to
        both persons taken together. This is as distribution connects them. If
        in distribution man unites the things to the persons in this way, he
        acts justly. It is plain then that the union of A with G, i.e., of a
        thing doubled with a person doubly more deserving, and of B with D,
        i.e., of a half thing with a person deserving only half is the just
        thing in distribution and such a just thing is a mean. But the unjust
        thing is outside this proportionality. The proportional is a mean
        between excess and defect because the proportionality is an equality of
        proportion, as has been remarked (939). So the just thing is a mean
        since it is a certain proportional.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        944. At “Mathematicians call” [A, 3] he explains the nature of
        proportionality according to which this just thing is understood. On
        this point he does two things. First 13, a] he says that the
        above-mentioned proportionality, which is considered according to the
        equality of proportion, is called geometrical by mathematicians. In this
        it happens that as the whole is to the whole so one part is to another,
        as we have pointed out in previous discussions (939-940). But this does
        not take place in arithmetical proportionality, which we will treat
        later (950).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        945. Next [3, b], at “But this” he says that this proportionality, which
        is observed in distributive justice, cannot be continuous because on one
        side are the things and on the other the persons. So it is not possible
        to take for a common term a person to whom distribution is made and the
        thing which is distributed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        946. Then [B], at “This just thing,” he considers what is unjust in
        distributions. He says that, since the just thing is proportionable, it
        follows that the unjust thing is outside the proportionable. This
        happens either by reason of more or less than the equality of proportion
        demands, as is evident in the very operations of just and unjust
        distribution. That man acts unjustly who accepts for himself too many
        goods, but he suffers unjustly who has too few. The reverse is true in
        regard to evils. Since a lesser evil has the aspect of good by
        comparison with a greater evil, the lesser evil is more to be preferred
        than the greater evil. Everything is chosen under the aspect of good,
        and for this reason the thing which has the aspect of greater good is
        more to be preferred. So then this is one species of justice that has
        been discussed.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        947. After the Philosopher has shown how the mean should be taken in
        distributive justice, he now explains in what way the mean should be
        understood in commutative justice. He discusses this point under three
        aspects. First [A] he shows there is a species of justice in addition to
        distributive. Then [B], at “This differs etc.,” he says this differs
        from the other justice. Third [Lect. 7], at “It is as though etc.” (B.
        1132 a 25), he shows how a mean should be understood in this kind of
        justice. He says first that in addition to the preceding species of
        justice which exists in distributions, there remains one that is
        directive of transactions both voluntary and involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        948. Then [B], at “This differs,” he shows the difference between this
        species and the preceding. He treats this point under two headings.
        First [ B, 1] he sets forth his proposition, saying that the just thing
        existing in transactions belongs to another species than distributive
        justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        949. Second [B, 2], at “What is just,” he presents the difference. First
        [2, a] he reviews something relevant to distributive justice. Then [2,
        b], at “However, in transactions etc.,” he shows what pertains to
        commutative justice. He says first that the justice mentioned before
        always directs the distribution of common goods in conformity with
        proportionality, i.e., the geometrical which is observed in the equality
        of proportion. This is clear because if wealth belonging to the city or
        to certain men must be distributed to individuals, the distribution will
        be made in such a way that each may receive from the community in that
        ratio according to which he contributed to the community. We suppose in
        business ventures that the more a man invests in a company the greater
        is his return. As the just thing directing distributions consists in
        this proportionality, so the opposite unjust thing consists in
        disregarding proportionality of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        950. At “However, in transactions” [2, b], he shows what pertains to
        commutative justice. He gives a threefold consideration of this notion.
        First [b, i ] he explains a f act relative to commutative justice. Next
        [b, ii], at “If one of two contestants etc.,” he clarifies this by an
        example. Third [b, iii], at “Therefore, that which etc.,” he deduces
        some corollaries from the premises. He says first that the Just thing
        that exists in transactions agrees somewhat with the just thing
        directing distributions in this-that the just thing is equal, and the
        unjust thing, unequal. But they differ in the fact that the equal in
        commutative justice is not observed according to that proportionality,
        viz., geometrical, which was observed in distributive justice, but
        according to arithmetical proportionality which is observed according to
        equality of quantity, and not according to equality of proportion as in
        geometry. By arithmetical proportionality six is a mean between eight
        and four, because it is in excess of the one and exceeds the other by
        two. But there is not the same proportion on the one side and the other,
        for six is to four in a ratio of three to two while eight is to six in a
        ratio of four to three. On the contrary by geometrical proportionality
        the mean is exceeded and exceeds according to the same proportion but
        not according to the same quantity. In this way six is a mean between
        nine and four, since from both sides there is a three to two ratio. But
        there is not the same quantity, for nine exceeds six by three and six
        exceeds four by two.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        951. Therefore, in commutative justice the equal is observed according
        to arithmetic proportion. This is clear from the fact that here the
        different relations of persons are not considered. It does not matter,
        insofar as commutative justice is concerned, whether a good man has
        stolen or robbed an evil man of his property or an evil man has done it
        to a good citizen. Likewise, it does not matter whether a good or evil
        man commits adultery. The law takes into account only the nature of the
        injury, so that the man who has done more damage, whatever his
        condition, must make more restitution. So it is evident that if one of
        two contestants does an injustice and the other suffers an injustice,
        one injures and the other is injured, the law treats them as equals,
        however much they may be unequal. Hence a judge, who is a dispenser of
        the law, attempts to reduce that injustice-by which one man injures
        another and which has a certain inequality-to an equality by
        establishing an equality in the very quantity of things and not
        according to the relation of different persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        952. Next [b, ii], at “If one of two contestants,” he clarifies what he
        had said, by an example. First [ii, x] he presents the example; and then
        [ii, y], at “In the interest of plain talk etc.,” he resolves a doubt.
        First he sets forth the example of a personal injury about which too
        little is clear. He says that if one of two contestants receives a wound
        and the other inflicts it, or even if one commits murder and the other
        is murdered, this division of action and passion brings about inequality
        because the assailant and the murderer have more of what is esteemed
        good, inasmuch as they have done their own will and so seem as it were
        to have gained. But the man who is wounded or murdered has more of evil
        insofar as he is deprived against his will of well-being or life, and so
        he seems as it were to have suffered loss. The judge tries to equalize
        this by subtracting from the gain and allotting compensation for the
        loss, inasmuch as he takes away something from the assailant and the
        murderer contrary to their will and bestows it to the gain or honor of
        the person wounded or murdered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        953. Then [ii, y], at “In the interest of plain talk,” he resolves a
        certain doubt that could arise from the words “gain and loss.” He says
        that, in the interest of plain talk, the terms “gain and loss” are used
        in matters where a person has more or less. Strictly these words refer
        to what we possess, and sometimes they do not seem suitable, for
        example, in the case of personal injuries (as when one person receives a
        blow and another inflicts it, some injury results) because a fixed
        measure of action and passion cannot be taken in injuries of this kind
        so that what is more can be called gain and what is less, loss. But when
        passion is measured, i.e., according to the measure of justice, then
        what is more is called gain and what is less, loss.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        954. At “Therefore, that which is just” [b, iii], he deduces two
        conclusions: the first [iii, x] on the part of the just thing itself;
        and the second [iii, y], at “For this reason etc.,” on the part of the
        judge. He says first that the just thing in transactions is a kind of
        equal that is a mean between more and less in such a way that gain is
        taken as more and loss as less. However, they are understood in
        different ways in good and evil, for to have more of good and less of
        evil belongs to the nature of gain. But the contrary pertains to the
        idea of loss. Between these two, gain and loss, stands a mean, that
        equal which we call the just thing. Consequently that just thing, which
        gives directions in transactions, is a mean between gain and loss as
        both these terms are commonly understood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        955. Next [iii, y], at “For this reason,” he draws a conclusion on the
        part of the judge of whom it was said (952) that he tries to bring about
        an equality. Aristotle affirms that because the just thing is a mean
        between gain and loss, it follows that when men are in doubt about the
        mean they have recourse to a judge. A judge ought to be, as it were,
        living justice, so that his soul is entirely possessed by justice. But
        the people who go to a judge seem to be seeking a mediator between
        parties who quarrel. Consequently, judges are called intermediaries or
        mediators as if they may attain the intermediate or the mean, and lead
        the way to what is just. So then it is evident that what is just, the
        subject of our discussion, is a certain mean because the judge, who
        determines this just thing, is the middle inasmuch as he proposes what
        is equal between the parties. But the equal is the mean or middle
        between more and less, as we have pointed out (310, 933).

        The names, gain and loss, have their origin in voluntary transactions.
        When a man owns more than he did own he is said to have profit, but when
        less he is said to have loss, as in buying, selling, and other exchanges
        permitted by law. However, when men have neither more nor less but the
        same after their transactions they are said to have what is theirs,
        neither gaining profit nor suffering loss. Therefore, justice is a mean
        between some kind of gain and loss arising in involuntary transactions;
        it is having an equal amount of these both before and after the
        transaction.

        COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        956. After the philosopher has shown the difference between the mean of
        justice regulating transactions and the mean of justice regulating
        distributions, now [C] he shows how the mean of that justice which
        regulates transactions is understood. He handles this point in a twofold
        fashion. First [ C, 1] he discloses his proposition. Then [C, 2], at
        “The names etc.,” he explains the origin of the names, gain and loss,
        which he has used. He discusses the initial point from two aspects.
        First [1, a] he shows how we may discover the mean of commutative
        justice in these things; next [1, b], at “This is true etc.,” how we may
        discover it in the matter of the different arts. He treats the first
        point in two ways. First [a, ij he introduces an example to show how the
        mean is applied in commutative justice. Then [a, ii], at “If there are
        etc.,” he clarifies what he has said. In regard to the initial point he
        first [i, x] gives the example to explain his proposition. Then [i, y],
        at “Therefore, this mean etc.,” he shows the appropriateness of the
        example from the very manner of speaking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        957. Aristotle says that this is the way a judge expresses a reduction
        to equality. If he wishes to reduce to equality a line divided into
        unequal parts, he takes away from the larger part that portion by which
        it exceeds the half of the whole line and adds it to the smaller part so
        that the half of the whole line is a certain <i>dicha</i>, i.e., rule or
        measure for reducing unequal portions to an equality. So when a whole
        thing belonging to two men is divided by such a <i>dicha</i> or measure,
        then it is said that each one has what is his inasmuch as he receives
        equality—which is the mean between more and less—according to arithmetic
        proportionality. The reason is that the mean of justice is exceeded by
        the one with more to the extent that it exceeds the person with
        less-this pertains to arithmetic proportionality, as we pointed out
        before (944,950).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        958. Then [i, y], at “Therefore, this mean,” he shows that the preceding
        example is suitable according to Greek usage. He says that since the
        mean of this justice is a certain <i>dicha</i>, hence it is that the
        just thing is called <i>dicheon</i> by the Greeks, as if a person
        wanting to vary the names should say that dicheon is the just thing,
        <i>dichastes</i> the just man, and <i>dichaste</i> justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        959. Next [a, ii], at “If there aretwo equals,” he makes clear what he
        has said, viz., that it is necessary to take from one with more in the
        amount exceeding the mean and to give to one with less. First [ii, x] he
        explains his statement; and then [ii, y], at “Let us take etc.,” he
        expresses it by terminals. He says first, let us take two equal lines
        both of which are two measures long, for example, two palms breadth or
        two feet; let us subtract half from one line and add it to the other.
        Obviously, the line receiving the addition exceeds the other by two
        units because the line from which the subtraction was made has only one
        unit remaining, and the line to which the addition has been made has
        three units. But if the section subtracted from one line is not added to
        the other, there will be an excess of only one unit. By that line, to
        which nothing is added or from which nothing is subtracted, we
        understand the mean of justice, having as it does neither more nor less
        than what belongs to it. By the line to which addition has been made we
        understand the person who has too much. By the line from which
        subtraction has been made we understand the person who has too little.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        960. In this way then it is evident that the man who has too much
        exceeds the mean by one unit, which has been added to it over and above,
        but the mean exceeds by one-which has been taken from it-that from which
        subtraction has been made. Therefore, we will know by this mean what we
        ought to take from him who has more and give to him who has less.
        Besides, we will know that we ought to take from the greater, i.e., from
        him who has more, the amount by which he exceeds the mean because we
        ought to give him who has less in the amount the mean exceeds him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        961. At “Let us take” [ii, y] he sets forth in figure what was said. Let
        us take three equal lines and mark the terminations of one AA, of
        another BB, of the third GG. Then let BB remain undivided, but divide AA
        in half at the point E, and divide GG in half at the point 3. Next, take
        away from line AA a section AE, add it to the line GG and call the
        addition GD. It is clear then that the whole line DG exceeds the line A
        E by two units, viz., by that which is GG and by that which is GD, but
        it exceeds the line BB by one unit only, viz., GD. Therefore, obviously,
        that which is longest exceeds the mean by one unit and the shortest by
        two units after the manner of arithmetic proportionality.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        962. Then [1, b], at “This is true,” he shows that what has been said
        must be observed in transactions having to do with the different arts.
        The arts would be destroyed if the craftsman, who works at some
        handicraft, would not be supported, i.e., would not receive for his
        workmanship according to the quantity and quality of what he produced.
        For that reason the work of one craftsman must be commensurate with the
        work of another to the extent that there is a just transaction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        963. Next [C, 2], at “The names,” he explains the origin of the names,
        gain and loss, saying that they come from voluntary transactions in
        which names of this kind were first used. When a man owned more than he
        previously had owned, he was said to have gained; but when less, he was
        said to have suffered loss, as in buying, selling and in all other
        transactions which are permitted by law. However, when men have neither
        more nor less than they had in the beginning, but bring back in equal
        quantity the same as they had taken by their transactions, then they are
        said to have what belongs to them, neither gaining nor losing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        964. He draws the final inference that he had principally intended. It
        is evident from the premises that the justice we are now discussing is a
        mean between gain and loss, that justice is simply the possession of an
        equal amount before and after a transaction even an involuntary one, as
        we see in the person who, when constrained by a judge, restores to
        another what he had in excess.

        A conjunction by means of a diagonal shows how to make that compensation
        which is according to proportionality. Let A be a builder, B a
        shoemaker, G a house, and D a sandal. It is necessary that a builder
        should take from the shoemaker his product and in return give what he
        himself makes. If first an equality according to proportionality be
        found and then reciprocation be made, it will be as we have said. But if
        not, there will not be an equality-and the state will not continue to
        exist-because nothing hinders the work of one craftsman from being of
        more value than the work of another. Therefore these things must be

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        965. After the Philosopher has shown how the mean should be understood
        in both kinds of justice, now he rejects a false opinion about the
        understanding of the mean of justice. He discusses this point under
        three headings. First [I] he states the erroneous opinion. Next [II], at
        “However, reciprocation etc.,” he rejects it. Third [III], at “But in
        dealings etc.,” he shows where and how the truth may be found. He says
        first it seems to some that, generally speaking, justice is nothing
        other than reciprocation, viz., that a man should suffer according to
        what he has done. This was the opinion of the Pythagoreans who decided
        that justice is the same as reciprocation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        966. Then [II], at “However, reciprocation,” he rejects this opinion on
        two accounts; and first [II, A] in regard to distributive justice, he
        says that reciprocation does not correspond to what is just
        distributively. The reason for this is evident. The just thing in
        distributions is not judged according to what one of two, who must be
        equated by justice, does against the other or suffers from the other.
        This is necessary for the nature of reciprocation; but in distribution a
        share of the common goods is given to each by an equality of proportion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        967. Next [II, B], at “Likewise, it is not,” he rejects the preceding
        error in the case of commutative justice. First [II, B, I] he proposes
        what he intends to do with commutative justice. He says that
        reciprocation does not coincide with all the processes in justice that
        regulate transactions, although the philosophers who expressed the
        foregoing opinion meant that in transactions justice is the same as
        reciprocation. This is clear from the fact that a legislator named
        Rhadamantus maintained that this justice is of such a nature that if a
        man suffers those very things he inflicted on others, justice is
        vindicated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        968. Then [II, B, 2], at “Such justice,” he rejects this view for two
        reasons. In regard to the first [2, a] he says that in many situations
        vengeance of this kind is found to be at variance with true justice, for
        instance, if a ruler strikes a private person justice does not require
        that the ruler be struck. But if a person strikes a ruler it is
        necessary that such a person not only be struck but be more gravely
        punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        969. This seems to contradict what the Philosopher said before (951)
        that in commutative justice the different rank of persons is not taken
        into account—all being equal under the law. But it should be noted what
        the Philosopher had said was this: in commutative justice the law
        considers only the nature of the damage. It is clear that when damage is
        considered in the taking of an external thing—money for instance—the
        amount of damage does not vary according to a person’s rank. Still when
        the injury is personal, the extent of the injury necessarily changes
        according to the rank of the person. Obviously, worse damage is done
        when someone strikes a ruler, by reason of the fact that injury is done
        not only to the person of the ruler but also the whole commonweal.
        Therefore, reciprocation simply taken is not suitable for justice in
        matters of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        970. At “Moreover, it makes” [2, b] he gives the second reason. He says
        in the matter of imposing punishment, it makes a great deal of
        difference whether the offender inflicted the injury voluntarily or
        involuntarily, i.e., because of ignorance or violence or fear. The man
        who sinned voluntarily ought to be punished more severely than the man
        who sinned involuntarily, for two reasons. First, because in regard to
        punishments, consideration is given to the restoration of equality of
        justice not only by a person restoring what he has taken but also by his
        being punished for the crime. For this reason some are punished by law
        even for sins causing no injury or damage to another. Likewise a thief
        is compelled not only to restore what he took—by which the equality of
        justice is reestablished—but beyond that he is punished for the offense
        perpetrated. But the offense is increased or diminished by the fact that
        a man sins voluntarily or involuntarily. Hence the voluntary offender is
        punished more severely than the involuntary offender. The second reason
        is that the injury of the deliberate transgressor is greater, for
        internal contempt is added to the external damage.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        971. Next [III], at “But in dealings,” he explains in what matter and
        manner the statement is true that reciprocation is justice. He discusses
        this point from three aspects. First [III, A] he shows that there must
        be reciprocation in exchanges according to proportionality. Then [III,
        B], at “A conjunction by means etc.,” he explains the form of this
        proportionality. Last [Lect. 9; C], at “Therefore all etc.” (B. 1133 a
        18), he shows how such a form can be observed. On the initial point he
        does two’ things. First [III, A, 1] he states his intention. Next [III,
        A, 2], at “By reason of proportional etc.,” he proves his statement. He
        says that in dealings of exchange it is true that justice is of such a
        nature that it includes reciprocation not according to equality but
        according to proportionality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        972. It seems this is contrary to what was said before (950), that in
        commutative justice the mean is taken not according to geometrical
        proportionality, which consists in an equality of proportion, but
        according to arithmetic proportionality, which consists in a
        quantitative equality. We must say that, in regard to commutative
        justice there should always be an equality of thing to thing, not,
        however, of action and passion, which implies corresponding requital.
        But in this, proportionality must be employed in order to bring about an
        equality of things because the work of one craftsman is of more value
        than the work of another, e.g., the building of a house than the
        production of a penknife. Hence, if the builder exchanged his work for
        the work of the cutler, there would not be equality of thing, given and
        taken, i.e., of house and penknife.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        973. Then [III, A, 2], at “By reason of proportional,” he proves his
        statement, saying that justice in exchanges includes reciprocation
        according to proportionality. This can be shown by the fact that the
        citizens live together amicably because they have proportionate
        kindliness towards one another. Accordingly, if one does something for
        another, the other is anxious to do something in proportion in return.
        Obviously, all citizens desire that reciprocation be done to them
        proportionately. By reason of this all men can live together because
        they do for one another what they themselves seek. Therefore, they never
        seek in regard to evil that corresponding requital be done to them
        proportionately. But if they do not seek this in regard to evil, for
        example, when one man does not take vengeance on another who injures
        him, a kind of servility seems to result. Indeed it is servile when a
        man cannot gain by his own activity something that he does not desire in
        an evil way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        974. We may even say that men not only do not desire that corresponding
        requital, when unjust, be done to the -m proportionately, but they do
        not desire that it be done when just. In this way if corresponding
        requital is not done them in a proportionate way, proper retribution
        will not be effected. But men live together because one makes a return
        to another for the favors he has received. So it is that virtuous men
        promptly express gratitude to their benefactors as if it were a sacred
        duty to make them a return in this way-repaying a favor is
        characteristic of gratitude. It is fitting that a man should be of
        service to one who has done him a favor, i.e., bestowed a gratuitous
        kindness, and that he be not content to give only as much as he received
        but that in return he begins to offer more than he got so that he
        himself may do a favor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        975. Next [III, B], at “A conjunction by means,” he makes known the form
        of proportionality according to which reciprocation ought to be made.
        First [III, B, 1] he gives an example in the shoemaker and the builder;
        then [III, B, 2], at “This is to be observed etc.,” he shows that the
        same is found in other arts. He says first that a conjunction by means
        of a diagonal shows how to make compensation or reciprocation according
        to proportionality. To understand this draw A B G D, make two diagonals
        intersecting one another, viz., AD and BD. Let A represent a builder, B
        a shoemaker, G a house that is the work of the builder, and D a sandal
        that is the work of a shoemaker. It is necessary at times that the
        builder should take from the shoemaker his product, a sandal. But the
        builder himself ought to give his product as a recompense to the
        shoemaker.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        976. Therefore, if first an equality according to proportionality is
        found so that on one side a certain number of sandals be fixed as equal
        to one house (for a builder incurs more expense in building one house
        than a shoemaker in making one sandal), next, corresponding
        reciprocation is had so that the builder may receive many sandals equal
        to one house and the shoemaker one house, there will be recompense—as
        was said—made according to proportion by a diagonal conjunction.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason is that a proportionate number of sandals are given to the
        builder, and the house to the shoemaker. But if compensation is not made
        in this way, there will not be an equality of things exchanged—and so
        men will not be able to live together—since nothing hinders the work of
        one craftsman from being worth more than the work of another, a house
        than a sandal. For this reason these things must be equated one with the
        other according to the previously mentioned proportionality, so that a
        just exchange may take place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        977. Then [III, B, 2], at “This is to be observed,” he shows that the
        same thing is found in the other arts. He affirms that what was said
        (975, 976) about the builder and the shoemaker must be observed also in
        the other arts, so that reciprocation and exchange may take place
        according to diagonal proportionality. Indeed the arts would be
        destroyed if a workman did not receive according to the quantity and
        quality of what he produced—a thing that must be discovered in the way
        indicated. It is not common for men practicing one art, for example, two
        doctors, to communicate their work with one another, but very often men
        practicing different arts do, for instance, a doctor and a farmer, both
        entirely different and unequal. These must be equated in the preceding
        way.

        Therefore, it is reasonable to measure all things by one norm, as has
        been pointed out previously. This norm in reality is demand which
        connects all things. If men were not in need there would be no exchange,
        or if they did not have a similar demand, exchange would not be the
        same. Money originated by agreement on account of necessary exchange.
        Hence money (<i>numisma</i>) has the name because it is a norm not by
        nature but by law (<i>nomos</i>). We have the power to change money and
        to make it useless.

        When things have been equated there will be reciprocation, so that as
        the farmer is to the shoemaker, the amount of the shoemaker’s work is to

        That human demand connects everything as by a kind of measure is evident
        because when men are so mutually situated that both or at least one is
        not in need, they do not exchange their goods. But they engage in
        exchange when one needs what the other has, e.g., wine, and they give

        no present need, will be helped when he is in want later on. The man who

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        978. After the Philosopher has proposed the form of proportionality,
        with which reciprocation is identified in exchange, he now shows [III,
        C] in what way this form of proportionality can be observed. First [C,
        1] he explains his intention. Then [C, 2], at “That human demand etc.,”
        he clarifies the previous statements. He discusses the initial point in
        a twofold manner. First [1, a] he shows that to preserve the form of
        proportionality perfectly it is necessary to make everything
        commensurate. Next [1, b), at “When things have been etc.,” lie explains
        how a just reciprocation in exchanges may be effected by a
        commensuration of this kind. He treats the first point under three
        aspects. Initially [1, a, i] he explains the nature of that which
        measures all things, Then [1, a, ii], at “A certain number etc.,” he
        shows how such a commensuration is established in exchanges. Last [ 1,
        a, iii ], at “Therefore, it is etc.,” he indicates the nature of this
        commensuration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        979. He says first, in order that the products of the different workmen
        be equated and thus become possible to exchange, it is necessary that
        all things capable of exchange should be comparable in some way with one
        another so that it can be known which of them has greater value and
        which less. It was for this purpose that money or currency was invented,
        to measure the price of such things. In this way currency becomes a
        medium inasmuch as it measures everything, both excess and defect, to
        the extent that one thing exceeds another, as was pointed out before
        (955, 959-960). It is a mean of justice—as if someone should call it a
        measure of excess and defect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        980. Next [1, a, ii], at ‘W certain number,” he shows how exchange takes
        place according to the preceding commensuration. Although a house is
        worth more than a sandal, nevertheless, a number of sandals are equal in
        value to one house or the food required for one man during a long
        period. In order then to have just exchange, as many sandals must be
        exchanged for one house or for the food required for one man as the
        builder or the farmer exceeds the shoemaker in his labor and costs. If
        this is not observed, there will be no exchange of things and men will
        not share their goods with one another. But what has been said, that a
        number of sandals are exchanged for one house, is not possible unless
        the sandals are equated with the house in some way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        981. At “Therefore, it is” [i, a, iii] he indicates the nature of this
        commensuration made by means of money. He states that for this reason it
        is possible to equate things because all things can be measured by some
        one standard, as was pointed out (957). But this one standard which
        truly measures all things is demand. This includes all commutable things
        inasmuch as everything has a reference to human need. Articles are not
        valued according to the dignity of their nature, otherwise a mouse, an
        animal endowed with sense, should be of greater value than a pearl, a
        thing without life. But they are priced according as man stands in need
        of them for his own use.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        982. An indication of this is that if man were not in need there would
        be no exchange, or if they did not have a similar need, i.e., of these
        things, exchange would not be the same because men would not exchange
        what they have for something they did not need. That demand really
        measures everything is evident from the fact that money originated by
        arrangement or a kind of agreement among men on account of the necessity
        of exchange, i.e., exchange of necessary goods. There is an agreement
        among men that what a person needs will be given him in exchange for
        currency. Hence currency is called money (<i>numisma</i>)—nomos means
        law—since currency is not a measure by nature but by law (<i>nomos</i>).
        It is in our power to change currencies and make them useless.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        983. Then [i, b], at “When things have been,” he shows how just
        reciprocation takes place in exchanges according to the preceding
        commensuration. First [i, b, i] he explains his proposition; and then
        [i, b, ii], at “Let A represent etc.,” puts it in a diagram. He says
        first that the norm measuring all things by need according to nature and
        by currency according to human convention will then become reciprocation
        when everything will be equated in the way just mentioned. This is done
        in such a manner that as the farmer (whose work is raising food for men)
        excels the shoemaker (whose work is making sandals), in the same
        proportion the work of the shoemaker exceeds in number the work of the
        farmer, so that many sandals are exchanged for one bushel of wheat. Thus
        when exchange of things takes place, the articles to be exchanged ought
        to be arranged in a proportional figure with diagonals, as was stated
        previously (957). If this was not done, one extreme would have both
        excesses; if a farmer gave a bushel of wheat for a sandal, he would have
        a surplus of labor in his product and would have also an excess of loss
        because he would be giving more than he would receive. But when all have
        what is theirs, they are in this way equal and do business with one
        another because the equality previously mentioned is possible for them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        984. Next [1, b, ii], at “Let A represent,” he puts in a diagram what
        has been said about the proportional figure. Take then (as in the
        previous example) a square A, B, G, D, and two diagonals AD and BG
        intersecting one another. Let A represent the farmer and G the food, his
        product, e.g., a bushel of wheat. Let B represent the shoemaker and D
        his equated product, i.e., as many sandals as have the value of a bushel
        of wheat. There will then be a just reciprocation if A be joined with D
        and B with G. If there is not such a compensation men will not share
        their goods with one another.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        985. At “That human demand” [C, 2] he explains more fully what has
        already been mentioned. First [2, a] he shows how things are made
        commensurate; and next [2, b], at “Everything then,” how the things made
        commensurate may be exchanged. He discusses the first point from two
        aspects. First [2, a, i] he shows that necessity is a measure according
        to reality; and then [2, a, ii], at “For future exchanges etc.,” how
        currency is a measure according to the provision of law. He says first
        the statement (981-982) that human need contains everything as a certain
        measure is explained in this way. When men are so situated among
        themselves that either both, or at least one, do not need a thing
        possessed by the other, they do not engage in mutual exchange. But
        exchange does take place when a man owning grain is in need of wine
        which his neighbor has, and thus gives the grain for the wine, so that a
        quantity of grain is allotted according to the value of the wine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        986. Then [2, a, ii], at “For future exchanges,” he shows clearly how
        currency serves as a measure. On this point we must consider that if men
        always needed immediately the goods they have among themselves, they
        would have no need of any exchange except of thing for thing, e.g., wine
        for grain. But sometimes one man (who has a surplus of wine at present)
        does not need the grain that another man has (who is in need of wine),
        but perhaps later he will need the grain or some other product. In this
        way then for the necessity of future exchange, money or currency is, as
        it were, a surety that if a man has no present need but may want in the
        future, the thing he needs will be available when he presents the
        currency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        987. The particular virtue of currency must be that when a man presents
        it he immediately receives what he needs. However, it is true that
        currency also suffers the same as other things, viz., that it does not
        always obtain for a man what he wants because it cannot always be equal
        or of the same value. Nevertheless it ought to be so established that it
        retains the same value more permanently than other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        988. Next [2, b], at “Everything then,” he explains how, by the measure
        of currency, there is exchange of things which are made commensurate in
        currency. He discusses this point from three aspects. First [2, b, i] he
        shows in what manner there is exchange of goods that are measured in
        currency. Then [2, b, ii], at “It is impossible,” he discloses under
        what aspect currency serves as a measure. Last, [2, b, iii], at “Let A
        represent a house,” he puts in terminals what was said. He states first
        that, because currency as a measure ascertaining quantity retains its
        value longer, all goods must be evaluated in currency. In this way
        exchange of goods can take place and, consequently, association among
        men. Money equates commutable goods, as a certain measure making them
        commensurate. He clarifies what has been said by stating that
        association is not possible if there is no exchange. But exchange is
        impossible unless an equality is established in goods, which in turn
        cannot exist without commensuration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        989. Then [2, b, ii], at “It is impossible,” he shows in what way
        currency is used as a measure. He says that it is impossible that things
        so greatly different be made commensurate according to reality, i.e.,
        according to the peculiar nature of the things themselves. But they can
        be sufficiently contained under one measure by comparison with the needs
        of men. Hence there must be some one criterion that measures all things
        of this kind and is not a measure by reason of nature but because so
        fixed by men. Therefore, this is called money owing to the fact that it
        makes all things commensurate insofar as they are measured by money.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        990. At “Let A represent a house” 12, b, iii] he explains in terminals
        what has been said, stating: let A be a house worth five <i>minae</i>, B
        a bed worth one <i>mina</i>, and in this way the bed will be one fifth
        the value of the house. Hence it is obvious how many beds are equal in
        value to one house, viz., five. Likewise it is obvious that barter took
        place before there was currency, since five beds have been exchanged for
        one house. But it makes no difference whether five or the value of five
        beds are given.

        From these discussions it is clear that a just action is a mean between

        himself and less desirable things on his neighbor, and on the contrary
        less hurtful things on himself than on his neighbor, but he distributes
        equally according to proportion. Likewise, he observes a rule regarding
        one man in relation to another. On the other hand injustice is a habit
        operative of what is unjust. This takes place by excess and defect of
        useful or hurtful things contrary to what is proportional. Hence
        injustice is called excess and defect because it brings about excess and
        defect, the unjust man assigning himself an excess of what is simply
        useful and a deficiency of what is harmful. In a similar way he
        attributes both an excess and a deficiency to others. But this too is

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        992. After the Philosopher has shown how the just thing is a mean, now
        he shows how justice is a mean. On this point he does three things.
        First [1] he states his intention. Then [2], at “Justice is also etc.,”
        he proves his statement. Finally [3], at “We have then discussed etc.,”
        he recapitulates what has been said. Since habits are known by acts, he
        treats two aspects of the initial point. First [1, a] he proposes that
        the operation of justice is a mean; and second [1, b], at “But justice
        etc.,” how justice itself is a mean. He says first that, from previous
        considerations (978-991), it is evident that a just operation, that is,
        an operation of justice, is a mean between doing what is unjust and
        suffering what is unjust. The first is to have more than is due to
        oneself, i.e., to do an unjust action; but the other, viz., to suffer an
        unjust thing, is to have too little by reason of the fact that a person
        has been deprived of what is due him. The act of justice is to do what
        is equal, i.e., the mean between too much and too little. Obviously then
        it follows from the premises that a just action is a mean between doing
        what is unjust and suffering what is unjust.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        993. Then [i, b], at “But justice,” he explains how justice is a mean,
        saying that justice is not a mean in the same way as the other moral
        virtues. Their mean lies between two vices; liberality is a mean between
        parsimony and extravagance. But justice is not a mean between two vices.
        However, it can be called a mean by reason of its effect inasmuch as it
        constitutes a mean, since its act is a just operation which is a mean
        between doing what is unjust and bearing the unjust. The first of these,
        active injustice pertains to a vice of injustice which is a habit of
        extremes inasmuch as it takes for itself too many goods and too few
        evils. But the other, i.e., the toleration of the injustice is not a
        vice, but a suffering.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        994. Next [2], at “Justice is also,” he proves what was said, viz., that
        justice is not a middle course between two vices, as is the case with
        other moral virtues. He treats this point in a twofold manner. First [2,
        a] he takes up the nature of justice; then [2, b], at “One injustice
        etc.,” he adds some remarks to bring his subject to a conclusion. He
        discusses the first point from two aspects. Initially [a, i] he states
        what justice is; and next [a, ii] at “He does not act etc.,” what in
        justice is. He says first that justice is a habit by which the just man
        does the just thing—and this by deliberate choice because, as was
        previously pointed out in the second book (305, 308, 382), a moral
        virtue is a habit of correct choice. Doing the just thing can be
        referred to justice directing exchanges, in which the nature of justice
        is more apparent by reason of the equality of the thing. Hence he adds
        an “and to distribute” in order to include also distributive justice,
        which consists in the equality of proportion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        995. A man can do the just thing by choice, both in exchanges and in
        distributions, in two ways. In one way he does this between himself and
        another, and touching this point Aristotle says “both to himself in
        relation to his neighbor.” In the second way a man does this between two
        others—this pertains to a judge or an-arbiter—and so the Philosopher
        adds “and to one man in relation to another.” He explains, by exclusion
        of the contrary, how the just man does a just deed. He adds that the
        just man does not so act that in regard to desirable things (for
        example, riches and honors) he bestows more on himself and less on his
        neighbor, and in regard to harmful things (i.e., burdensome and
        painful), on the contrary, more on his neighbor than himself; but he
        makes an equal distribution according to proportion—a thing he observes
        not only between himself and another but also between two others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        996. At “He does not act” [a, ii] he presents the nature of injustice.
        He affirms that on the contrary injustice is a habit which does by
        choice what is unjust. This happens by excess or defect of useful or
        harmful things which the just man accepts according to due proportion.
        Hence, as justice is called a mean because it produces a mean, so also
        injustice is called excess and defect because it produces excess and
        defect in such a way that the unjust man bestows on himself an excess of
        things which are simply useful but a deficiency of things which are
        harmful. In a similar way he attributes to others both excess and
        defect, however not of the same things, but a defect of the useful and
        an excess of the harmful. Nevertheless, it has not been determined in
        what way injustice may depart from the proper proportion, i.e., how much
        more or how much less it may accept than is due. But injustice does
        this, howsoever it may happen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        997. Next [2, b], at “One injustice,” he adds some remarks required to
        conclude the subject. He says there is a twofold injustice: one consists
        in a lack of beneficial things, and indicates an excess of onerous
        things-which amounts to the same. This is to suffer what is unjust. The
        other injustice is to have an excess of beneficial things and a lack of
        onerous things-and this is to do an injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        998. From what has been said we can come to three conclusions. To do an
        unjust act pertains to injustice. However, to have a lack of benefits or
        an excess of burdens is not to do what is unjust but to suffer what is
        unjust. Therefore this does not pertain to the vice of injustice. But
        justice is a mean between having too much and too little, as was pointed
        out before (992, 993). Consequently, injustice is not a mean between two
        vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        999. Then [3], at “We have then discussed,” he concludes by
        recapitulating what has been said. He affirms that we have discussed
        justice and injustice and the nature of both. Likewise we have treated
        what is just and what is unjust in a general way, for he will determine
        afterwards (1000-1008) certain particular modes of what is just and
        unjust.

        Since someone doing an unjust act may not be unjust himself, we will
        investigate the nature of the unjust actions that show the doer—for
        example, a thief or an adulterer or a robber—already unjust according to
        the injustice proper to each case. Or does not this make any difference?
        If a man having sexual intercourse with a woman knows with whom he sins
        and acts not by choice but by passion, he does an unjust act but is not
        unjust. So neither is a man a thief although he steals, nor an adulterer
        although he commits adultery. The same is true in other cases.

        For justice exists between those very persons whose relations are
        governed by law. But the law is enacted for those among whom injustice
        is found, because punishment is a judgment of what is just and what is
        unjust. Among these there is unjust action, but injustice does not exist
        in everyone who does an unjust action, which is to attribute to oneself
        too many of the things good in themselves and too few of the things

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1000. After the Philosopher has treated justice and the unjust thing in
        themselves together with their opposites, now he treats them in
        comparison with their subject, showing how a man in doing an unjust
        action becomes unjust. He handles this point under two headings. First
        [I] he determines the truth. Then [Lect. 14, [II], at “Someone may raise
        etc.” (B. 1136 a 10), he raises some doubts about matters previously
        settled. He discusses the initial point from three aspects. First [A] he
        asks a question. Next [B], at “We must not forget etc.,” he interposes
        some subjects necessary for a solution of the question. Finally [Lect.
        13, C], at “Since just and unjust etc.” (B. 1135 a 15), he answers the
        question. He treats the first point in a twofold manner. First [A, A’]
        he presents the question. Then [A, B’], at “We have previously etc.,” he
        shows that another question was settled previously. He says first that a
        person who does an unjust action still may not be unjust. Therefore, we
        must inquire into the characteristics of injustice, i.e., the actions of
        unjust men must be of such a type that the man who does unjust deeds is
        already unjust in that particular species of injustice, for example,
        theft or adultery or robbery. Or, passing over the cases just mentioned,
        can it be said that for a man to be unjust it makes no difference in
        what actions he may act unjustly?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1001. For this reason we ask with what kind of injustice it occurs,
        because the doing of an unjust action takes place in many ways. A man
        may have sexual intercourse with a woman, the wife of another, and not
        be ignorant who the person is (ignorance could cause an involuntary) but
        know with whom he is having intercourse, and still not perform the act
        by deliberate choice but by passion. Such a man does an unjust act
        although he does not seem to be unjust because he does not act by
        deliberate choice. So also we can say in a particular case that a man is
        not a thief although he has stolen, since he did not commit theft by
        deliberate choice. In a similar way a man is not an adulterer although
        he has committed adultery. The same idea is found in other matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1002. Then [A, B’], at “We have previously,” he shows that a particular
        doubt has already been solved, viz., in what way reciprocation is
        related to justice—a point we discussed previously (971-972).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1003. Next [B], at “We must not forget,” he interposes some subjects
        that are necessary for the solution of the proposed question: first [B,
        A’] what is justice in the absolute sense; and second [Lect. 12; B, B’]
        at “There is a difference etc.” (B.1135 a 9), what is unjust action. He
        handles the initial point in a twofold fashion. First [A’, 1] he states
        his intention. Then [A’, 2] at “The latter consists etc.,” he carries
        out his intention. He says first that for a clear understanding of the
        question (in which we seek by what actions a man who does a just or an
        unjust act is said to be just or unjust) we must not forget the fact
        that the justice sought is justice in the absolute sense which is
        political justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1004. Then [A’, 2], at “The latter consists’ “ he carries out his
        intention. First [2, a] he shows what political justice is. Then [Lect.
        XII; 2, b], at “One kind of political justice etc.” (B. 1134 b 18), he
        divides it. He treats the initial point under two aspects. First [a, i]
        he proposes what he intends, viz., what political justice is Next [a,
        ii], at “For justice exists etc.,’; he explains his intention. He
        discusses the first point under two headings. Initially [i, x] he shows
        what political justice is. Second [i, y], at “Therefore, among those
        persons etc.,” he concludes that there are other kinds of justice
        differing from this. He says first that political justice consists in a
        community of life that is ordered to a self-sufficiency of the things
        pertaining to human living. And the state-community should be such that
        everything sufficient for the needs of human life is found in it. This
        justice is found in free men, not slaves, because masters exercise
        towards slaves not political justice but the justice of dominion, of
        which more later (1006-1012). However, political justice is encountered
        with persons who are equal, i.e., one of whom is not subject to the
        other in the natural or political order, as a son to a father between
        whom there is no question of political justice but of paternal right.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1005. This political justice is either according to proportionality,
        i.e., proportional equality pertaining to distributive justice, or
        numerical equality, i.e., the equality of numerical quantity pertaining
        to commutative justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1006. Next [i, y], at “Therefore, among those persons,” he concludes
        there are other kinds of justice differing from that just mentioned. He
        states that-since political justice exists among the free and equal—in
        people who do not have this (that they are free and equal) there is not
        found political justice, which is unqualified justice, but a peculiar
        justice, viz., of a master or father, which is a qualified justice
        inasmuch as it has some likeness to political justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1007. At “For justice exists” [a, ii], he clarifies his statement: first
        [ii, x] in regard to political justice, which is unqualified justice;
        second [ii, y] in regard to justice of a master or a father, which is
        qualified justice, at “However, the justice of a master etc.” First [x,
        aa] he clarifies his statement, viz., that political justice is in free
        and equal persons. Next [x, bb], at “For this reason we do not etc.,” he
        draws some corollaries from the premises. He says first-as has been
        pointed out (1004).that political justice is in the free and equal
        because, being determined by law, it necessarily is found in those for
        whom the law is enacted. But law is enacted principally not for slaves
        who are restrained by masters nor for children who are restrained by
        fathers but for the free and equal. That political justice exists in men
        of this kind, for whom law is enacted, is obvious from this that justice
        and injustice exist in them. Now, law extends to persons in whom there
        can be injustice. This is clear from the fact that punishment, which is
        fixed by law, is nothing other than a judgment about what is just and
        unjust.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1008. From this statement—the law exists for those between whom justice
        exists—it follows that it is for those between whom there is unjust
        action and for those between whom there is Just action. The reason is
        that in whomsoever there is injustice, in these the performance of an
        unjust act is found but not the reverse. It was pointed out in the
        second book (252-253) that the doing of a virtuous action may take place
        without virtue, and likewise the doing of vicious actions without the
        habit of vice. An unjust act arises from the fact that a person should
        attribute to himself too many of those things which are absolutely and
        of themselves good, like riches and too few of those things which are
        simply and of themselves evil, as the opposite of these.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1009. Next [x, bb], at “For this reason we do not permit,” he draws
        three corollaries from the premises. First [bb, a’] he says that because
        injustice consists in this that a man attributes to himself too many of
        the benefits and too few of the burdens, it follows that in good
        government of the multitude we do not permit that men should rule, that
        is, according to whim and human passion but that the law, which is a
        dictate of reason, should rule man, or that man who acts according to
        reason should rule. The explanation is that if a prince follows human
        passions he will do this for himself; he will take more of the good
        things and less of the burdensome and so become a tyrant, although this
        is contrary to the concept of a prince. A prince was given the office to
        observe justice, and consequently equality, which he passes over when he
        usurps for himself too many beneficial and too few onerous things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1010. He gives the second corollary [bb, b’] at “Since a prince.” He
        affirms that since a prince—if he is just—attributes no more of the good
        things to himself than to others (unless perhaps according to a proper
        ratio of distributive justice), it follows that he does not labor for
        the advantage of himself but of others. Because of this it was said
        before (909) that legal justice, by which the prince rules the multitude
        of the people, is the good of another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1011. He presents the third corollary at “Consequently a reward” [bb,
        c]. It is clear that everyone should reward the man who labors for him.
        Therefore, since the prince labors for the multitude, a reward should be
        given by the multitude, namely, honor and glory, which are the greatest
        goods that can be offered by men. But if there are some princes who are
        not satisfied with these for a reward but seek wealth, they are unjust
        and tyrannical. Over and above this reward proffered by man, good
        princes look for a reward from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1012. Then [ii, y], at “However, the justice of a master,” he explains
        what was indicated previously about the fact that this is not justice in
        the absolute sense but by similitude. First [y, aa] (he explains) in
        regard to the justice of a master and of a father; and second [y, bb],
        at “Hence justice concerns etc.,” in regard to justice which belongs to
        a husband in relation to a wife. On the prior point he does three
        things. First [aa, a’] he proposes what he intends, saying that the
        justice of a master, i.e., of a lord over a slave, and paternal justice,
        i.e., of a father over a son, are not the same as political justice but
        have some likeness to it according as it has a relation to another in a
        way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1013. Second [aa, b’], at “Toward one’s own things,” he explains what
        was pointed out regarding this that the justice of a master or of a
        father is not justice without qualification. It is evident that
        injustice cannot exist in an unqualified way for a man in regard to the
        things belonging to him, and neither can justice, because both have a
        relation to another. But the slave belongs to the master as a chattel,
        and a son is—so to speak—a part of the father until he is a certain age
        or mature and separated from the father by emancipation. That there is
        no injustice toward oneself is clear from the fact that no one chooses
        to injure himself. Hence it is obvious that absolutely speaking there is
        no justice or injustice towards a son or a slave.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1014. Third [aa, c’], at “Nor is political justice,” he explains that
        even if the justice of a master and of a father would be justice without
        qualification, it would not be political justice because political
        justice is according to the law and in those for whom the law is
        designed by its nature. Such are those persons who have equality in
        regard to ruling and being ruled; but of these one is subject to
        another, e.g., a slave to a master and a son to a father. Hence
        political justice does not exist in these matters.

        1015. Then [y, bb], at “Hence justice concerns,” he treats justice
        pertaining to a wife. He says that because a wife is less subject to a
        husband than a slave to a master or a son to a father, therefore the
        relation of a husband to a wife has more of the nature of justice than
        the relation of a father to his children, and of a master to his
        chattels or slaves. The justice that belongs to a husband in regard to a
        wife is domestic because the husband is the head of the home, as the
        prince of the state. However, domestic justice is different from
        political, as the home is different from the state.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        io16. After the Philosopher has shown the nature of political justice,
        i.e., unqualified justice, now [b] he makes a division of it. First [i]
        he divides political justice into species. Then [ii], at “Particular
        just and legal things etc.,” he touches upon the division of this
        justice into individual parts. He discusses the first point from three
        aspects. First [x] he proposes the division. Next [y], at “Natural
        justice etc.,” he explains it. Last [z], at “Some people were etc.,” he
        rejects an error opposed to the division. He says first that there is a
        twofold division of political justice: natural justice, and legal
        justice. This is the same as the division that the jurists make, namely,
        that one kind of right is natural and the other positive. They call
        right the very thing that Aristotle calls the just object. Isadore too
        says in <i>Libri Etymologiarum</i> (Bk. V, Ch. 3) that right is as it
        were what is just. But there seems to be inconsistency in that political
        is the same as civil. In this way what the Philosopher considers the
        whole division seems to be considered by the jurists as a part of the
        division, for they make civil law a part of positive law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1017. But we must take into account that political or civil is taken
        here in one way by the Philosopher and in another way by the jurists.
        The Philosopher here calls justice political or civil from the usage the
        citizens are accustomed to, but the jurists call right political or
        civil from the cause, viz., that some city has decreed for itself. For
        this reason the Philosopher appropriately designates legal or posited by
        law that which they call positive. Political justice then is properly
        divided by means of these two, for the citizens use justice to the
        extent that it is imparted to the human mind by nature and to the extent
        that it is posited by law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1018. Then [y], at “Natural justice,” he indicates the parts of the
        preceding, division. First [y, aa] he explains natural justice in two
        ways: in one way according to its effect or power, saying that that
        justice is natural which everywhere has the same force and power to
        induce to good and prevent evil. This happens because nature, the cause
        of this justice, is the same everywhere among all men. But justice by
        the decree of a state or prince has force only among those who are
        subject to the jurisdiction of that state or prince. In the other way he
        explains this justice according to its cause, when he says that natural
        justice does not consist in what seems or does not seem to be, i.e., it
        does not arise from human conjecture but from nature. In speculative
        matters there are some things naturally known, like indemonstrable
        principles, and truths closely connected with them; there are other
        things discovered by human ingenuity, and conclusions flowing from
        these. Likewise in practical matters there are some principles naturally
        known as it were, indemonstrable principles and truths related to them,
        as evil must be avoided, no one is to be unjustly injured, theft must
        not be committed and so on; others are devised by human diligence which
        are here called just legal enactments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1019. We must consider that that justice is natural to which nature
        inclines men. But a twofold nature is observed in man. One, is that
        which is common to him and other animals. The other nature belongs to
        man properly inasmuch as he is man, as he distinguishes the disgraceful:
        from the honorable by reason. However, jurists call only that right
        natural which follows the inclination of nature common to man and other
        animals, as the union of male and female, the education of offspring,
        and so forth. But the right which follows the inclination proper to the
        nature of man, i.e., precisely as he is a rational animal, the jurists
        call the right of the peoples (<i>jus gentium</i>) because all people
        are accustomed to follow it, for example, that agreements are to be
        kept, legates are safe among enemies, and so on. Both of these, though,
        are included under natural justice as it is here taken by the
        Philosopher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1020. Next [y, bb ],at “That is called legal justice,” he explains legal
        justice and seems to give three differences in justice of this kind. The
        first is this: when something is universally or commonly imposed by law
        it becomes legal. Regarding this he says that that justice is called
        legal which in the beginning, i.e., before it becomes law, is
        indifferent whether something is done in this way or that, but when it
        is laid down, i.e., enacted into law, then a difference arises because
        observing it is just, disregarding it is unjust. Thus in some state it
        has been decreed that a prisoner may be redeemed at a fixed price and
        that a goat should be offered in sacrifice but that two sheep are not to
        be sacrificed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1020. The second difference in legal justice is that something is stated
        by law in a particular case, for instance, when a state or a prince
        grants some privilege—called a private law—to an individual person.
        Touching this point he says there are also legal enactments, not those
        that are decreed in a general way but whatever are prescribed by
        legislators as law in individual cases. It was enacted, for example, in
        a particular state that sacrifice should be offered to a woman named
        Brasidas who rendered great service to the state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1022. The third difference in legal justice is that sentences passed by
        judges are called a kind of legal justice. In regard to this he adds
        that the decrees of judges are also legal enactments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1023. But here we must take into consideration that legal or positive
        justice always has its origin in natural justice, as Cicero says in his
        <i>Rhetoric</i> [ <i>Rhetorica, De Inventione</i>, lib. II, cap. 53].
        Origin from natural right can occur in two ways: in one way as a
        conclusion from a principle, and in such a manner positive or legal
        right cannot originate from natural right. The reason is that once the
        premises are stated the conclusion necessarily follows. But since
        natural justice exists always and everywhere, as has been pointed out
        (1018), this is not applicable to legal or positive justice. On this
        account it is necessary that whatever follows from natural justice as a
        conclusion will be natural justice. Thus, from the fact that no one
        should be unjustly injured it follows that theft must not be
        committed—this belongs to natural justice. In the other way something
        can originate from natural justice after the manner of a determination,
        and thus all positive or legal justice arises from natural justice. For
        example, that a thief be punished is natural justice but that he be
        punished by such and such a penalty is legal justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1024. Also we must consider here that legal justice has its origin in
        two ways from natural justice in the preceding manner. In one way it
        exists with an admixture of some human error, and in the other without
        such error. Aristotle explains this by examples. It is natural justice
        that a citizen who is oppressed without any fault on his part should be
        aided, and consequently that a prisoner should be ransomed, but the
        fixing of the price pertains to legal justice which proceeds from
        natural justice without error. Likewise it is natural justice that honor
        be bestowed on a benefactor but that divine honor be given him—that he
        be offered sacrifice—arises from human error. But the just decrees of
        judges are applications of legal justice to particular cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1025. At “Some people were of the opinion” [z] he rejects an error
        opposed to this division. On this point he does three things. First [z,
        aa] he proposes the error together with the reason for it. Second [z,
        bb], at “However, that opinion etc.,” he refutes it. Last [z, cc], at
        “Among the things etc.,” he asks a question occasioned by the
        refutation. He says first that some were of the opinion that all justice
        is that which is established by law and there is then no natural
        justice. This was the opinion of the followers of the Socratic
        philosopher Aristippus. They were influenced by this reason: that which
        is according to nature is invariable, and wherever it is it has the same
        force, as is obvious fire burns in Greece as well as in Persia.
        Apparently this is not true of justice because all just things seem to
        be changed at times. Nothing seems to be more just than that a deposit
        should be returned to the owner. Nevertheless the return must not be
        made to a madman demanding his sword or to a traitor to his country
        demanding money for arms. So then it seems that there is nothing just by
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1026. Then [z, bb], at “However, that opinion,” he provides a
        refutation, saying that the statement that natural things are
        unchangeable is not so universally but is true in some respect. The
        reason is that the nature of divine things never changes, for example,
        the nature of separated substances and of the heavenly bodies, which the
        ancients called gods. But with us humans, who’ are counted among
        perishable things, there is something according to nature and yet
        whatever is in us is changeable either intrinsically or extrinsically.
        Moreover, there is in us something natural like having two feet, and
        something not natural like having a coat. Undoubtedly all the things
        that are just among us are variable, although some of them are naturally
        just.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1027. Next [z, cc], at “Among the things,” he raises a doubt occasioned
        by the preceding refutation. He handles the first point in a twofold
        manner. First [cc, a’] he asks the question. Then [cc, b’], at
        “Obviously, the same,” he answers it. First he proposes this question.
        If all just human things are changeable the question remains: of the
        things that change, what kind is just by nature and what kind is just
        not by nature but by the decision of the law and agreement among men, if
        both are changeable in a similar way?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1028. At “Obviously, the same” [cc, b’] he answers the question just
        asked. He considers this point in a twofold manner. First [b’, a] he
        shows how things just by nature are changeable. Then [b’, b), at “Those
        things that are,” he shows how things just by law are changeable. He
        says it is obvious that the arrangement found in other natural things,
        likewise applies to things just by nature. Those things that are natural
        with us occur in the same way in the greater number of cases but fail in
        a few. Thus it is natural that the right hand is stronger than the left,
        and this is so in the greater number of instances, although it happens
        occasionally that some men are ambidexterous since their left hand is as
        strong as their right. So also the things that are just by nature, for
        example, that a deposit ought to be returned must be observed in the
        majority of cases but is changed in the minority.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1029. However, we must keep in mind that the essences of changeable
        things are immutable; hence whatever is natural to us, so that it
        belongs to the very nature of man, is not changeable in any way, for
        instance that man is an animal. But things that follow a nature, like
        dispositions, actions, and movement, are variable in the fewer
        instances. Likewise those actions belonging to the very nature of
        justice cannot be changed in any way, for example, theft must not be
        committed because it is an injustice. But those actions that follow
        (from the nature of justice) are changeable in a few cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1030. Then [b’, b], at ‘Those things that are,” he shows how the legally
        just are changeable without exception. He says that regulations that are
        just according to arrangement and advantage, i.e., by what is agreed
        among men for some utility, are similar to measures of salable
        commodities, wine and wheat. These are greater where products are bought
        wholesale but smaller where products are sold retail. So also things
        that are not naturally just but fixed by men are not the same
        everywhere, thus the same punishment is not inflicted everywhere for
        theft. The reason is that civil life and the administration of the state
        are not the same everywhere. All laws are framed as they are needed for
        the end of the state, although only one form of government is everywhere
        best according to nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1031. Next [ii], at “Particular just and legal things,” he treats the
        division of justice in regard to the individual parts. He says that each
        particular just and legal thing is related to human affairs as a
        universal to singulars. The reason is that actions which are done
        according to justice are many but each just thing is one, as it were a
        kind of universal. Thus, that a deposit must be returned is one which
        has a reference to many cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1032. At “There is a difference” [B’] he shows what just action and
        unjust action are. First [1], what unjust action is. Then [2], at “It is
        the same etc.,” what just action is. He says first that unjust action
        and unjust thing differ, for an unjust thing is something that is
        contrary to justice either by nature or by human decree, as theft. But
        the doing of an action by someone, for instance, stealing is called
        unjust action, the execution of injustice so to speak. However, before
        this is done by anyone it is not called an unjust action but an unjust
        thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1033. Then [2], at “It is the same,” he shows what just action is. He
        says that in a similar way just action is present when a person does a
        thing which is just by nature or by regulation of law. But with the
        Greeks the doing of a just thing in general is rather called
        <i>dicaeopragma</i> or doing of what is just, but every doing of a just
        thing does not seem to be called justifying action but only when a
        person is corrected in the justifying action, i.e., by restoring what is
        unjust to justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1034. Finally, he says that we must discuss later, in the
        <i>Politics</i> (Bk. I, Ch. 6, 1255 a 3-1255 b 15; St. Th. Lect. 4,
        75-88), the nature, the number, and the species of each type of justice,
        viz., natural and legal.

        Since just and unjust acts are such as have been described, a man acts
        unjustly or justly when he acts voluntarily. But when he acts
        involuntarily he works neither injustice nor justice except
        incidentally, for it is incidental that the actions are just or unjust.
        An act of justice and a just action are indicated by reason of a
        voluntary and an involuntary. When a voluntary is done and a person is
        blamed, then there is at the same time an unjust action. Wherefore
        something unjust may be present but an unjust action never exists if
        there is no voluntary.

        As has been pointed out previously, I call voluntary any of the actions
        within a man’s power, which he does knowingly and without ignorance of
        the what, how and why; for example, whom he struck, with what
        instrument, and with what intention-none of these being unintentional.
        Also the act must be done without violence, thus when one takes a
        person’s hand and strikes another, that person does not act voluntarily
        because it was not in his power to hinder this. It can happen that the
        one struck is the man’s father, the striker knowing the person is a
        human being or someone present but not recognizing his father. Likewise
        the same should be determined in what concerns the intention and the
        whole operation. Certainly the act done without knowledge, or knowingly
        and not being in our power, is like an involuntary. We knowingly do and
        experience many natural things none of which are either voluntary or
        involuntary, for example, growing old and dying.

        The same is true even when the act is just or unjust incidentally,
        because if someone restores a deposit unwillingly and on account of fear
        his act is not said to be just, nor is it an act of justice except
        incidentally. In a similar way a person forced against his will not to
        restore a deposit is said to do an unjust thing or an act incidentally
        unjust.

        Injury may occur in dealings among men in three ways. Through ignorance

        the alternative is necessarily evil if the action is not done through
        forgetfulness. But angry people, acknowledging the fact, are uncertain
        in what way there is injustice. However, those who act deviously are not
        ignorant on this point. Therefore the cunning, but not the angry, know
        that the injured party suffered unjustly.

        Some involuntary acts deserve pardon, others do not. Whatever sins men
        commit not only in ignorance but also because of ignorance are
        excusable. However, the sins they commit not by reason of ignorance but
        in ignorance because of passion, which is neither natural nor human, are

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1035. After the Philosopher has shown what justice in itself is, and
        what just action and unjust action are, now [C] he answers a question
        that he previously asked, viz., by what just or unjust actions may a man
        become just or unjust? He treats this point in a twofold manner. First
        [A’] he explains his plan. Then [B’], at “Some involuntary acts etc.,”
        he introduces a division to explain things mentioned previously. He
        discusses the initial point from two aspects. First [1] he shows when a
        just or unjust thing may exist without a just or unjust action. Next
        [2], at “We perform some voluntary etc.,” he shows that there is just or
        unjust action without the agent being just or unjust. He discusses the
        first point under two headings. Initially [1, a] he explains his
        intention. Second [1, b], at “As has been pointed out etc.,” he
        clarifies what he said. He affirms first that since just and unjust acts
        are such as have been described before (1000-1001), then a man acts
        unjustly or justly in this way: there is an act of injustice or a just
        action when he voluntarily does these very things, i.e., what is just
        and unjust. But when a man does them involuntarily he does not act
        justly or unjustly except perhaps incidentally; it happens contrary to
        his intention that the acts he does are just or unjust.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1036. Those things that we intend to do are said to be done in
        themselves and not incidentally. However, nothing is specified by what
        is incidental but only by what is in itself (<i>per se</i>). Therefore
        the act of justice and the <i>dicaeopragma</i> or the just operation,
        and likewise the act of injustice are indicated by a voluntary or
        involuntary, in such a way that when something is voluntary a person is
        praised or blamed. Hence, obviously, on the part of the thing done there
        will be something unjust, but there will not be an unjust action as
        regards the species of the operation if there is not a voluntary on the
        part of the agent. The same holds for just action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1037. Then [1, b], at “As has been pointed out,” he clarifies some
        things that have been said, what a voluntary and an involuntary are. He
        handles this point in a twofold fashion. First [1, b, i] he indicates
        his intention. Second [1, b, ii], at “The same is true etc.,” he shows
        that the previous explanation is applicable to both just and unjust
        acts. He says first that a voluntary, as has been pointed out in the
        third book (382, 391, 427, 435, 436), is said to be present when a
        person knowingly does a thing that is in his power and is not ignorant
        either of what is done, or by what means, or for what end he does this.
        For example, he knows whom he struck, how he delivered the blow—as by an
        instrument—and the purpose of it; so too he knows each of these in
        themselves and not incidentally. In order that there be a voluntary it
        is necessary that the thing not happen by violence, for instance, if one
        takes a person’s hand by force and strikes another, he whose hand it is
        does not do this voluntarily, because it is not in his power to avoid
        being forced.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1038. After this, he explains how a thing may be known incidentally. It
        is possible that the man struck is his father. He who delivers the blow
        knows that a human being or someone present was struck but not that his
        father was; thus he knows incidentally that this was his father inasmuch
        as he knows that the person to whom this happened was his father. As we
        have discussed the man who delivers the blow, similarly we must
        investigate the purpose of the whole operation, i.e., all the
        circumstances of the operation. From the statement of what the voluntary
        is we can know what the involuntary is. The reason is that if something
        is done through ignorance or (after ignorance has ceased) is not in the
        power of the agent, or still more is done through violences it will be
        an involuntary. On this account it was added “by violence” because many
        things that are in us are not involuntary, for there are many natural
        things we knowingly do and experience, for example, growing old and
        dying. Nevertheless none of these is voluntary or involuntary because
        each one of them concerns the things which are in us by nature. But if
        it happens through violence that one of them is not in us, then it is
        called an involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1039. Next [1, b, ii ], at “The same is true,” he explains what was said
        about just and unjust acts. In regard to just acts, for example, if a
        man hands over a deposit to its owner not willingly but on account of
        fear, we do not say there is just action in this case except
        incidentally. Likewise if a person forced against his will abstains from
        restoring a deposit, we say he does an unjust thing or acts unjustly by
        accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1040. At “We perform some voluntary actions” [2] he shows when there is
        just or unjust action and yet the agent himself is not just or unjust.
        First [2, a] he premises a division necessary to explain the statement.
        Next [2, b], at “Injury may occur etc.,” he explains the statement. Last
        [2, c], at “Therefore, it is etc.,” he clarifies some things that have
        been said. He states first that we do some voluntary actions by
        deliberate choice and others without deliberate choice. Whatever we do
        by deliberate choice we do with preceding counsel or deliberation; but
        whatever is not subject to choice or is performed without choice we do
        without previous counsel or deliberation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1041. Next [2, b], at “Injury may occur,” he explains the statement.
        First [2, b, i] he repeats when there may be an unjust thing without an
        unjust action. Then [2, b, ii], at “However, when etc.,” he restates
        when there is unjust action without the agent being unjust. Last [2, b,
        iii], at “But when injury etc.,” he shows when one is unjust by the
        injustice and wickedness of the agent. He says first, as appears from
        what has been stated previously (1037-1038), that injury may occur in
        dealings among men in three ways: in one way by ignorance and
        involuntarily, in another way voluntarily but without choice, and in a
        third way voluntarily and with choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1042. Those sins are committed through ignorance that are done by a man
        who does not know what he is doing, nor against whom he acts, nor with
        what means, nor for what end even if he was aware of performing an act.
        Thus a man thought that he landed a blow not with this instrument, e.g.,
        a piked lance but with a rounded one; or he thought that he struck not
        this man, viz., not his father but an enemy; or he did not think he was
        about to strike for this objective but an objective was achieved he did
        not think of, for example, when he intended to strike not to wound but
        to tap. The case is similar when ignorance, exists in regard to the way
        a man landed a blow, mightily or lightly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1043. But on this point we must consider that when injury is inflicted
        unintentionally, i.e., contrary to plan or intention, then an altogether
        unfortunate accident happens. For instance, a man means to brandish a
        spear and instead throws it. But when someone inflicts injury not
        unintentionally, that is, not without the intention of injuring but
        without malice in the sense that he does not mean to injure much or
        injure such a person, then there is some sin, although not so great a
        one. A man sins when the principle of an inordinate act is in his power
        in this that he intends to perform the act. But when the principle of
        operation is entirely external so that it works contrary to the
        intention, then an unfortunate accident occurs since fortune is an
        intellectual cause acting outside of reason, as is explained in the
        second book of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 5, 196 b 10-197 a 8; St. Th.
        Lect. 8, 207-216).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1044. Then [2, b, ii], at “However, when,” he shows when there may be
        unjust action without wickedness or injustice of the agent. He says that
        when a man inflicts injury knowingly but not with previous counsel,
        i.e., without deliberation, then there is a kind of injustice, as there
        is in any action that a person commits through anger and other
        passions-provided these passions are not natural and necessary to men,
        like desire for food and drink in extreme necessity which excuses the
        taking of what belongs to another. Therefore, those who injure others
        because of these passions sin and do an unjust thing and their acts are
        unjust actions. Nevertheless by reason of this they are not unjust and
        evil because they do not inflict injury from wickedness but from
        passion. Such people are said to sin from weakness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1045. At “But when injury” [2, b, iii] he shows when there may be unjust
        action with injustice on the part of the agent. He says that when a man
        by deliberate choice causes injury to another, he is unjust and evil.
        Such a one is said to sin out of sheer wickedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1046. Next [2, c], at “Therefore, it is,” he clarifies what has been
        said. Because the first of the three things mentioned previously (which
        treats of what is done from ignorance) was commented on before
        (1042-1043), in the beginning [2, c, i] he explains the second, which
        deals with what is done from weakness or passion. Then [2, C, ii], at
        “If a man inflicts injury by choice etc.,” he explains the third, which
        treats of what is done by deliberate choice. He says first that when
        people sin from anger they are not evil or unjust because of this.
        Therefore we are well able to judge from this proof of previous
        statements that what is done from anger is not considered to be done
        with premeditation. He proves this afterwards, at “for it is the man”
        [i, x], by two reasons. The first is this, that it is not the man
        himself who does something in anger that begins the process of injuring
        but the person who provoked him. So it does not seem that the injury
        arose with premeditation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1047. Then [i, y], at “Besides, it is not,” he gives the second reason.
        He says that when a man inflicts injury in anger there is no question
        whether he does the act or not but whether he does it justly, for by
        anger some injustice is obvious, i.e., operates openly. And the angry
        man wishes the punishment to be obvious but it seems to him that he is
        justly provoked. It is not the same thing with unjust dealings, like
        theft and so forth in which there is doubt whether the act should have
        been done. One of the things must be evil, for instance, giving or not
        giving; for we sin sometimes by omission, other times by transgression
        unless we are excused by reason of forgetfulness, as when a person
        forgets to pay a debt to a creditor at an agreed time. But people acting
        in anger admit the thing, or the fact, but doubt whether what they did
        is unjust. This does not happen to those who act deviously by choice and
        are not ignorant that they act unjustly. Wherefore, the insidious person
        judges that the man he injured suffers unjustly; but the angry person
        does not think this. So it is evident that he who does an unjust thing
        in anger does not act with premeditation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1048. At “If a man inflicts injury” [2, c, ii] he explains the third
        reason concerned with acts done by deliberate choice. He says that if a
        man inflicts injury by deliberate choice, it is obvious that absolutely
        speaking he acts unjustly, because he operates voluntarily. He who acts
        according to an injustice of this kind is called unjust since this
        action is contrary to the proportional, i.e., against distributive
        justice, or contrary to the equal, i.e., against commutative justice. In
        a similar way a man is called just when he acts justly by deliberate
        choice. However, if he should act voluntarily and not by choice he will
        be called the worker or doer of what is just.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1049. Then [B’], at “Some involuntary things,” he gives a division to
        explain things mentioned previously. He says that some involuntary acts
        are venial, i.e., deserving of pardon, and others are not. Those sins
        deserve pardon that men commit not only in ignorance, that is, when they
        have concomitant ignorance, but on account of ignorance, viz., when
        ignorance is the cause so to speak-this happens to those who are sorry
        when they become aware. But those sins do not deserve pardon that men
        commit not on account of causative ignorance but in ignorance because of
        passion, which is neither natural nor human nor according to right
        reason. In actions of this kind passion is the cause of ignorance and
        sin; these have been more fully treated in the third book (406-424).

        In regard to what is incidental the same holds for receiving as for
        doing, since clearly we take one for the other in matters concerning
        justice and in justice alike. Acting unjustly is not the same as doing
        something unjust, nor is suffering unjustly the same as suffering
        something unjust. Likewise, doing an unjust thing and suffering an
        unjust thing are not the same. It is impossible to suffer unjustly

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1050. After the Philosopher has shown by what just actions a person may
        be called just or unjust, now [II] he raises some doubts about the
        questions just discussed. He treats this point from two aspects. First
        [A] he raises the doubts and solves them. Then [Lect. 15, B], at “Men
        are of the opinion etc.” (B. 1137 a 5), he refutes the errors of some
        philosophers about these subjects. The first part [A’] is divided into
        two according to the two questions he answers. The second part begins at
        [Lect. 15, B’] “There are still etc.” (B.1136 b 15). He handles the
        initial part under two headings. First [1] he proposes the question.
        Then [2], at “Every doing of justice,” he follows up the question. He
        discusses the first point in a two-fold manner. First [1, a] he proposes
        the matter of the question. Next [1, b], at “Is it true or not etc.,” he
        puts the questioning into form. in the first place the matter of the
        question is taken from material that was settled earlier (1035-1040).
        Hence he says that someone can raise a doubt whether the suffering and
        doing of injustice have been sufficiently discussed by reason of what
        has been said already. It was stated (1035) that doing justice is
        voluntary. So it can be questioned whether this must be referred to
        suffering injustice. In the second place the matter of the doubt is
        taken from the words of the poet Euripides who somewhat unbecomingly
        introduced a character saying: “I killed my mother—to make the story
        short, either I voluntarily killed her who wished to be put to death or
        else I killed her involuntarily.” In either case we understand that the
        mother had expressed a wish to be killed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1051. Then [1, b], at “Is it true or not,” he puts the questioning into
        form. He considers this in two ways. First [1, b, i] he proposes one
        question, viz., whether it is really proper to say that a man
        voluntarily suffers injustice or whether this is untrue, but that every
        suffering of injustice is involuntary, as every doing of injustice is
        voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1052. Second [1, b, ii], at “Is suffering injustice,” he proposes
        another question. The question is whether every suffering of injustice
        is constituted in this way or in such a way that every suffering of
        injustice is either voluntary or involuntary. As this question can be
        asked about doing injustice—whether every such action is voluntary or
        whether some are voluntary and others involuntary—so in a similar way
        the same question can be asked about the reception of justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1053. Next [2], at “Every doing of justice,” he follows up the question
        previously asked. He develops this in a threefold fashion. First [2, a]
        he argues that every reception of justice is voluntary or every
        reception is involuntary. Then [2, b], at “It seems unreasonable,” he
        argues that not every suffering of injustice is voluntary. Last [2, c],
        at “Doing an injustice,” he argues that not every suffering of injustice
        is involuntary. He argues in this way for the first point. Every doing
        of justice is voluntary, as is clear from what has been pointed out
        (1035). But doing justice is the opposite of receiving justice.
        Therefore it seems reasonable that receiving justice or injustice should
        be opposed similarly according to both, i.e., voluntary and involuntary,
        so that all of the one is voluntary and all of the other involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1054. At “It seems unreasonable” [2, b] he argues that not every
        suffering of injustice is voluntary. He treats this point from three
        aspects. First [2, b, i] he argues for the proposition, saying it seems
        unreasonable to hold that every suffering of injustice is voluntary.
        Obviously some people unwillingly suffer injustice, like those who are
        flogged or whose possessions are taken by others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1055. Second [2, b, ii], at “Wherefore, doubt can arise,” he asks a
        question on this point: whether everyone who suffers injustice
        materially and incidentally can be said to suffer injustice formally and
        in itself. Thus someone may readily object that the man who unwillingly
        suffers robberies or blows, suffers injustice incidentally, nevertheless
        he is not, so to speak, simply a victim of injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1056. Last [2, b, iii], at “In regard to what is incidental” he answers
        the objection. He says that the same holds for doing as for receiving.
        The reason is that in both cases it is possible to take one for the
        other: to understand what is incidental about justice in a similar way
        to what is incidental about injustice. He gives this explanation, that
        performing acts incidentally unjust is not the same as doing an act
        unjust in itself. It was pointed out (1035-1036) that sometimes a person
        in ignorance does by chance what is unjust, nevertheless, absolutely
        speaking, he does not act unjustly. Similarly, undergoing things that
        are incidentally unjust is not the same as undergoing what is simply
        unjust. Likewise it is impossible that these things are the same in the
        doing of justice and in receiving justice; and that the same reason
        holds for the doing and receiving both in regard to just things and
        unjust things. He explains this afterwards by the fact that it is not
        possible to suffer something just or unjust simply speaking because
        passion is an effect of action. If then, a man does what is unjust
        incidentally and does not become unjust simply, it follows that neither
        does he suffer injustice simply who suffers an unjust thing. The same
        argument holds for justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1057. Then [2, c], at “Doing an injustice,” he argues against the idea
        that suffering injustice is involuntary. First [c, i], he argues for the
        proposition. Second [c, ii], at “Perhaps the definition etc.,” he solves
        the proposition. Concerning the initial point he offers two reasons. In
        regard to the first [i, x] of these he presents three considerations.
        First [x, aa] he gives a definition of doing injustice, which was
        defined previously (1035, 1045): doing injustice simply and in itself is
        simply the voluntary inflicting of injury. By voluntary is meant that
        one knows who is injured, what inflicts the injury, and how, i.e., in
        what manner together with other circumstances of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1058. Second [x, bb], at,”The incontinent person,” he argues from the
        definition given. It is obvious that the incontinent person voluntarily
        injures himself, inasmuch as he does voluntarily what he knows is
        harmful to him. If then suffering injustice resembles doing injustice,
        it follows that the person acting voluntarily himself may suffer
        injustice from himself, so it is possible for someone to do injustice to
        himself. Thus it follows that not every suffering of injustice is
        involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1059. Third [x, cc], “But this is one,” he asks an incidental question:
        whether in fact someone can do an injustice to himself. But he takes up
        this question later (1091-1108).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1060. At “Moreover, it happens” [i, y] he gives the second reason. If it
        happens that anyone by reason of incontinence is knowingly and willingly
        injured by another (for example, a man ensnared by love of a prostitute
        allows himself to be robbed) then it is possible that a person may
        willingly suffer injustice. So, not every suffering of injustice is
        involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        io6i. Then [c, ii], at “Perhaps the definition,” he gives the solution.
        He discusses this point from three aspects. First [ii, x] he corrects
        the definition of doing injustice given above (1057), and from it he
        infers the truth of the question. He says that the definition of doing
        injustice, stated without qualification, is not correct. But the
        statement should be added that doing injustice is present when someone
        with a knowledge of the circumstances inflicts injury on another against
        his will. From this it follows that although a person voluntarily may be
        injured and suffer incidentally what is unjust; nevertheless, no one
        voluntarily suffers injustice, absolutely speaking, because in itself
        doing injustice is to inflict harm on another against his will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1062. Next [ii, y], at “No one wants,” he answers the first reason. No
        one wishes with a complete will to suffer injustice, not even the
        incontinent person, although he does things harmful to himself against
        his will. Essentially he wills good, but by concupiscence he is drawn to
        evil. Aristotle proves this statement from the fact that, since the will
        desires what appears good, no one wills what he does not think is good.
        But the incontinent person in a passionless moment does not think what
        he does is good and therefore he does not will it absolutely;
        nevertheless he does what he thinks he ought not to do, on account of
        concupiscence which is in the sensitive appetite, the will being in the
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1063. Last [ii, z], at “Anyone who gives,” he answers the second reason
        concerning the person who is willingly injured by another. He says that
        a man does not suffer injustice absolutely speaking who voluntarily
        gives what is his own, as Homer narrates [Iliad vi. 236] about an
        individual named Glaucus that he gave Diomede golden armor for brass
        armor and a hundred oxen for nine oxen. Therefore this type does not
        suffer injustice because it is in the man’s power to give what belongs
        to him. However, suffering injustice is not in the power of him who
        suffers injustice, but there must be someone who does the injustice.
        Consequently suffering injustice is involuntary, and doing injustice is
        voluntary because the principle of action is in the agent—this belongs
        to the nature of a voluntary. However, the source of suffering is not in
        the patient but in another—and this belongs to the nature of an
        involuntary.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1064. He concludes by way of summary that suffering injustice obviously
        is involuntary.

        Men are of the opinion that they are unjust when they do what is unjust,

        Similarly, some people think that no wisdom is needed to know what
        things are just and unjust because it is not difficult to understand
        what the law says. However, these things are only incidentally just but
        become truly just when done and distributed in a particular way. Now to
        know this way is a more difficult task than to know the things that are
        healthful because there it is easy to know the virtue of honey, wine,
        and hellebore, to know the effect of cautery and surgery, but how they
        ought to be prescribed for health, for what patient, and when is as

        For this very reason it is thought also that the just man is not less
        able to do injustice but rather can do any unjust thing: for example, he
        can have carnal intercourse, strike a blow, and a brave man can throw
        away his shield, can turn and run away. However, perpetration of a
        cowardly action or of something unjust is doing these things only
        incidentally, but the doing is absolute for one having the permanent
        facility, just as healing and restoring to health do not consist in
        cutting or not cutting, in giving medicine or not giving it, but in
        prescribing these things as they should be.

        Just acts are found among people who participate in things good in
        themselves but have both defect and excess of them. For some persons
        there is no excess in regard to such goods (possibly so with the gods).
        For others, the hopelessly evil, no particle of these goods is useful
        but every one of them is harmful. In still others the goods become
        harmful at a determined point; and this is human.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1065. After the Philosopher has then [2], at “If the first proposal
        etc.,” solved one doubt, now [B’] he comes he follows it up. He says
        first that in to another. First [1] he proposes it, the matter of
        justice and injustice two questions still remain which he wishes to
        treat in preference to others. The first of these is, which of the two
        persons does an injustice in regard to distribution: he who gives to
        someone without regard to worth or he who accepts? The second—Can a
        person do injustice to himself?—is a question he asked before (1059) and
        resolves later (1091-1108).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1066. Then [2], at “If the first proposal,” he follows up the question
        previously asked. First [2, a] he objects to the false part. Next [2,
        b], at “But it does not seem,” he solves it. Last [2, c], at “However it
        is,” he determines the truth. He says first that if what was just said
        (1065) is true, viz., that the dishonest distributor does injustice and
        not he who receives too much, something inappropriate seems to follow.
        It can happen that a person knowingly and willingly gives more to
        another than to himself, and so it seems that he may do injustice to
        himself a thing that is inappropriate. The reason is that moderate men
        apparently do this, as they retain things of less value for themselves.
        It is characteristic of the virtuous man that he belittles himself,
        i.e., accepts things of less value for himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1067. Next [b, i], at “But it does not seem,” he solves this by two
        reasons. The first is that sometimes it is not entirely true that the
        distributor retains things of less value for himself. Although he keeps
        the less valuable external goods for himself, he nevertheless has an
        abundant share of another good, viz., glory, and of moral or honorable
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1068. At “Again we can answer” [b, ii] be gives the second reason
        proceeding from the definition of doing justice given before (1061). To
        this an addition was made indicating that it is contrary to the will of
        him who suffers. But the distributor suffers nothing contrary to his
        will. Consequently he does not suffer injustice but only undergoes some
        damage.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1069. Then [2, c], at “However it is obvious,” he determines the truth.
        He says [c, i] that obviously the man who distributes more than one’s
        share does an injustice, yet this is not always true of him who accepts
        too much but only when he works to bring about this object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1070. Next [c, ii], at “Not the man in whom,” he proves the proposition
        by three reasons. The first [ii, x] is that the man in whom the unjust
        thing exists is not said to do injustice, because in this way the one
        who is injured would do injustice; but he does injustice who wills to do
        it—he is the principle of action. This is the case of the person who
        distributes but not so with the recipient. Therefore the distributor
        does injustice and not the receiver.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1071. Aristotle gives the second reason at “Action is said” [ii, y],
        affirming that a man is said to act in various ways. In one way he acts
        as a principal agent, and in another, as instruments act. In the latter
        way it can be said that inanimate things, like stones, swords, or arrows
        cause death, and that the hand or the servant of the one who commands
        brings about death. None of these, absolutely speaking, does injustice
        although they are the means by which unjust actions are done. The reason
        is that doing injustice, since it is voluntary, is attributable to the
        agent in whom the principle of action lies, as has been pointed out
        (1063). But it is clear that in distribution the distributor holds the
        place of the principal agent while the recipient holds the place of an
        instrument after the manner of one obeying. Hence it remains that the
        distributor does the injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1072. At “Moreover, he has formed” [ii, z] he gives the third reason. He
        says that if a person by reason of ignorance of legal justice wrongly
        judges, tic does not do injustice, absolutely speaking, nor is the
        judgment by which his action is done unjust in itself; but it is unjust
        in a way because the thing judged is unjust. Therefore we spoke of legal
        justice because one kind of justice is legal which can be unknown,
        another is natural which cannot be unknown because it is impressed by
        nature on the human mind. But if someone knowing legal justice judges
        unjustly, then he acts greedily, that is, unjustly either for the sake
        of acquiring the favor of another or to avoid a penalty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1073. If a man wishes to share injustice in unfair portions, he who
        judges unjustly to curry someone’s favor has more good than belongs to
        him. So he acts greedily, although he may not have more of that good in
        which he injured another. The reason is that in such affairs a man who
        unjustly awarded a field to someone obviously for profit, did not get
        the field but money. And so a distributor is situated in distribution as
        a judge in exchanges. Therefore as a judge wrongly judging with full
        knowledge does an injustice, so too does he who distributes unjustly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1074. Then [B], at “Men are of the opinion,” he refutes some errors.
        Regarding this he does two things. First [B, 1] he refutes some false
        opinions concerned with one doing justice or injustice. Next [B, 2], at
        “Just acts are found,” he shows in whom just and unjust acts exist. In
        regard to the first point he refutes three false opinions. The first of
        these [1, a] concerns the facility in becoming unjust. He says that many
        people are of the opinion that they are ready to do even injustice
        immediately. Hence they think that it is easy to be habitually unjust.
        Certainly it is easy, and immediately in a man’s power, to do unjust
        things: to have sexual intercourse with his neighbor’s wife, to strike
        his neighbor, to take money from the hand of another, or to hand over
        money to have murder or some crime done. But that men should do actions
        of this kind in such a way that they act promptly and with pleasure is
        not easily nor immediately in a man’s power, but they come to this point
        through persistent habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1075. Second [1, b], at “Similarly, some people,” he refutes a false
        opinion about the knowledge of just and unjust things. He says some
        people think great wisdom is not needed for a man to discern just and
        unjust acts because it is not difficult to understand the decrees of the
        law determining legally just acts. However, such people are
        self-deceived because these acts simply considered are just only
        accidentally inasmuch as it is an accident that such things are just.
        But they become genuinely just when in some way they are performed and
        distributed (i.e., attributed) in some way to affairs and persons. But
        proper adaptation to affairs and people is more laborious and difficult
        than knowing remedies in which the whole art of medicine consists. There
        is a greater diversity among voluntary acts about which justice is
        concerned than among the humors about which health is concerned. Also it
        is easy to know the virtue of honey, wine, and hellebore, and the effect
        of cautery and surgery, but to prescribe these things for the
        restoration of health in the right way, for the right person, and at the
        right time is as great an accomplishment as being a doctor, for one who
        has this knowledge is a doctor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1076. Third [i, c], at “For this very reason, “ he refutes a false
        opinion concerning facility in doing justice and unjust things. He
        affirms that, on account of what has been said, people also are of the
        opinion that the just man can do injustice as readily as any one else,
        because from the fact that he is just he knows not less but more and can
        do any one of the things called unjust, like having sexual intercourse
        with another’s wife, striking another, throwing away his shield in
        battle; and a man can attack anyone he pleases. But they deceive
        themselves because the perpetration of cowardly actions and the doing of
        what is unjust is doing these things only incidentally inasmuch as it
        happens that the acts are unjust, but to do what is simply unjust is for
        someone to do these things in such a way that he is willing and prompt
        at it. So it is in medicine-healing and restoring to health do not
        consist in operating or not operating, in prescribing or not prescribing
        a drug, i.e., a laxative, but in a person prescribing them as he ought.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1077. Then [B, 2], at “Just acts are found,” he shows to whom they are
        attributable. We say that just acts are attributable to the people among
        whom are found things simply and in them-selves desirable, like riches
        and so on, although these persons (as is common among men) have excess
        and defect in this matter. For some there is no excess in such things
        that are used most laudably, as becomes men perfect in virtue and
        perhaps the gods (according to the error of people who hold that gods
        use things of this nature). For others, viz., the very wicked and the
        incurably evil no particle of these goods is useful but everything is
        harmful. For still others not everything is harmful but it becomes so at
        a certain fixed point. Hence it is evident that justice is a human good
        because it regards the general condition of man.

        When we stop to think of it, they are not absolutely the same nor do
        they altogether differ in kind. Sometimes we praise a thing and a man as
        equitable, and hence transfer “equitable” as a greater good to the
        things b we praise, showing that it is better. Other times it seems
        unfitting, to those following reason, that the equitable—as something
        beyond the just—is praiseworthy. Either the just thing or the equitable
        (which is other than the just) is not good. Or if both are good then

        The reason for this is that every law is proposed universally, but it is
        not possible to deal with some things in a universal way. Where the
        necessary exists we can speak universally but it is impossible to apply
        this rightly where the law understands the application to be valid in

        Therefore, when the law proposes something universally and a particular
        thing happens contrary to this, then, where the legislator has left a
        gap and erred in speaking absolutely, it is right to correct what is
        deficient. The legislator would have spoken on the point in this way if
        he had been present, and if he had known he would have filled this gap
        in the law.

        For this reason what is equitable is just and is something more
        excellent than one kind of just thing, not better than that which is
        absolute but better than that which errs by reason of being proposed
        absolutely. This thing that is the equitable is the directing of the law
        where there is deficiency because of faulty universal application. The
        reason why everything cannot be judged according to the law is that it
        is impossible to make a law for certain cases. Hence there is need of
        passing judgment, for the rule of indeterminate matter is itself
        flexible, like the leaden rule used by builders in Lesbos; just as that
        rule conforms to the shape of the stone, and does not remain the same,
        so also the sentence is adapted to the conditions. In this way then it
        has been made clear what the equitable is, that it is both the just and
        better than the just thing.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1078. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of justice in
        general, he now begins to consider equity which is a general directive
        of justice. First [I] he indicates his intention. Then [II], at “When we
        stop to think etc.,” he proceeds with his proposition. He says first
        that following what has been said, we should discuss equity that
        designates a certain habit and the equitable thing that is its object.
        In the discussion we should declare how equity is related to justice and
        how its object, which is called the equitable thing, is related to the
        just thing, the object of justice. In Greek <i>epiiches</i> is
        understood as what is reasonable or becoming; it is derived from
        <i>epi</i> meaning “above” and <i>ikos</i> meaning “obedient,” because
        by equity a person is obedient in a higher way when he follows the
        intention of the legislator where the words of the law differ from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1079. Then [II], at “When we stop to think,” he proceeds with his
        proposition. He discusses it under three headings. First [II, A] he
        determines the object of equity. Second [II, B], at “From this it is
        obvious etc.,” the subject of it. Last [II, C], at “And this habit
        etc.,” he determines the habit. He considers the initial point in a
        twofold manner. First [A, 1] he raises a doubt; then [A, 2], at
        “Everything said is true,” he solves it. He says first that if we look
        closely, it does not seem that the equitable thing is absolutely the
        same as the just, because the equitable sometimes departs from what is
        legally just; nor does it seem to be altogether different in species
        from what is just. He assigns a reason for these things: sometimes we
        praise what is equitable and declare that it is well done. Likewise we
        praise the kind of man who does it-we even call him a manly and perfect
        individual. So it is evident that, when we transfer praise to what is
        equitable, or to a person, as if to a greater good, we show what is
        equitable as something better than what is just. Hence the equitable -
        does not seem to be the same absolutely as the just thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1080. On the other hand (if we wish to follow reason) it seems
        inappropriate if what is equitable is praiseworthy and something over
        and above the just. It seems necessary that either the just thing is not
        desirable, i.e., good, or that if what is equitable is different from
        the just, it is not good because good (in the law) is achieved in one
        way, as was pointed out in the second book (319-321); or it is necessary
        that if both are good, they are identical. So he infers that a doubt
        arises about what is equitable on account of the things just stated. On
        the one hand it seems that it is not the same inasmuch as it is praised
        as better than the just thing, on the other it seems that it is the same
        as the just thing, for what is beyond the just apparently is not good
        and praiseworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1081. Next [A, 2], at “Everything Said is true,” he solves the question
        raised. He handles this point in two ways. First [2, a] he sets forth
        the truth. Then [2, b], at “What raises the doubt etc.,” he assigns the
        reason. He says first that everything that has been said for either side
        of the doubt is in some way right, and if correctly understood no
        opposition lies hidden there. It is true that what is equitable is one
        kind of just thing and is better than another just thing because, as was
        noted before (1016-1017), justice which citizens practice is divided
        into natural and legal. But what is equitable is better than what is
        legally just but is contained under the naturally just. Consequently it
        is not said to be better than the just thing as if it were some other
        kind of norm distinct from the genus of just things. Although both,
        viz., the legally just thing and the equitable, are good, the equitable
        is better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1082. At “What raises the doubt” [2, b] he assigns the reason, treating
        it in a threefold manner. First [b, i] he assigns the reason for doubt.
        Second [b, ii], at “The reason for this etc.,” he indicates the reason
        for the truth proposed. Third [b, iii], at “For this reason what is
        equitable etc.,” he infers the truth intended. He says first that this
        is what raised the doubt: that the equitable is a just thing, yet it is
        not something legal. But it is a certain directing of legal justice, for
        we said (1023) that it was contained under natural justice from which
        legal justice has its origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1083. Then [b, ii], at “The reason for this,” he assigns the reason for
        the truth proposed, i.e., why legal justice has need of direction. He
        discusses this point from three aspects. First [ii, x] he points out a
        defect in legal justice. Next [ii, y], at “Nevertheless the law,” he
        shows that this defect does not destroy the rectitude of legal justice.
        Last [ii, z], at “Therefore, when,” he infers the necessity for
        direction. He says first that the reason why legal justice has need of
        direction is that every law is proposed universally. Since particulars
        are infinite, our mind cannot embrace them to make a law that applies to
        every individual case. Therefore a law must be framed in a universal
        way, for example, whoever commits murder will be put to death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1084. It is evident that our intellect can predicate something
        universally true about some things, in the case of what is necessary
        where no defect can occur. But about other things it is not possible
        that something true be predicated universally, in the case of what is
        contingent. Here even though something is true in most instances,
        nevertheless it errs as we know in a few instances. And of such a nature
        are human acts about which laws are framed. In, these things the
        legislator necessarily speaks in a universal way on account of the
        impossibility of comprehending particulars; however, he cannot be
        correct in all the situations for which he legislates since error arises
        in some few cases. For this reason the legislator accepts what happens
        in most cases, and nevertheless he is not ignorant that defect is
        possible in some cases. Thus the anatomist says that man has five
        fingers, although he knows that by a mistake of nature it happens that
        man has more or less in rarer cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1085. Next [ii, y], at “Nevertheless the law,” he shows that the
        previously mentioned defect does not destroy the rectitude of law or of
        legal justice. He says that, although a fault may be committed in some
        cases by the observance of the law, nevertheless the law is good because
        that fault is not on the part of the law (since it was made according to
        reason) nor on the part of the legislator (who legislated according to
        the condition of the material), but the fault arises from the nature of
        the thing. Such is the nature of human actions that they are not done
        always in the same way but are done otherwise in certain infrequent
        instances. For example, the return of a deposit is in itself just and
        good, as it happens in most cases, but in a particular situation it can
        be bad, for instance, if a sword is returned to a madman.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1086. At “Therefore, when” [ii, z] he infers the necessity for directing
        legal justice. He says that when the law proposes something in a
        universal way, and the observance is not beneficial in a special
        instance, reason rightly dictates that a person should correct what is
        deficient in the law. Where the legislator evidently left indeterminate
        a particular case (in which the law falls short) he is at fault, i.e.,
        he proposed a defective proposition in speaking absolutely or
        universally. The reason is that even the legislator himself, had he been
        present where such a case happened, would have determined in this way
        and the correction would have been made. Moreover, had he foreseen this
        from the beginning he would have put it in the law. But he could not
        comprehend all particulars; in a certain city it was decreed under
        penalty of death that strangers were not to climb the walls of the city
        for fear they would usurp the civil government. But during an enemy
        invasion some strangers by climbing the walls defended the city from the
        invaders. They do not deserve to be punished by death; it would be
        against the natural law to reward benefactors with punishment. Therefore
        in this case legal justice must be directed by natural justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1087. Then [b, iii], at “For this reason what is equitable” he infers
        the truth intended, affirming that by reason of what has been said it is
        clear what the equitable is. It is a just thing and it is better than
        one kind but not better than what is naturally just that is laid down
        absolutely, that is, universally. Hence the nature of the equitable is
        that it be directive of the law where the law is deficient for some
        particular case. Indeed the law does fail in particular cases. The
        reason why not everything can be determined according to the law is that
        the law cannot possibly be framed to meet some rare particular
        incidents, since all cases of this kind cannot be foreseen by man. On
        account of this, after the enactment of the law, a decision of the
        judges is required by which the universal statement of the law is
        applied to a particular matter. Because the material of human acts is
        indeterminate, it follows that their norm, which is the law, must be
        indeterminate in the sense that it is not absolutely rigid.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1088. He offers an example of a norm for building in Lesbos. In this
        island there arecertain hard stones that cannot easily be dressed by
        chisel so they may be arranged in an entirely correct position.
        Therefore the builders there use a leaden rule. just as this leaden rule
        conforms to the shape of the stone and does not stay in the same form,
        so the sentence of the judge must be adapted to things according to
        their suitableness. In this way then he ends by way of summary that it
        is clear from the premises what the equitable thing is, that it is
        something just which is better than one kind of just thing, viz., the
        legally just.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1089. Next [B], at “From this it is obvious,- he determines the subject
        of equity. He affirms that it is evident from what has been proposed
        (1078-1088), who the equitable man is: he who chooses and does the
        things which have been discussed. He lays down a certain characteristic
        of this kind of virtuous person. He says that such a one is not
        <i>acribodikaios</i>, i.e., a zealous enforcer of justice in the worse
        sense, for vengeance, like those who are severe in punishing, but rather
        like those who mitigate the penalties although they may have the law on
        their side in punishing. The legislator does not intend punishments in
        themselves but as a kind of medicine for offenses. Therefore the
        equitable person does not add more punishment than is sufficient to
        prevent violations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1090. At “And this habit” [C] he determines the habit of virtue. He says
        that this habit, called equity, is a particular species of justice and
        is not a habit different from legal justice; we said the same about its
        object, for habits are known by reason of their objects.

        However, to do injustice is worse because it is blameworthy and wicked
        either completely and absolutely, or for the most part (not every
        voluntary injury takes place with injustice). But a man suffers
        injustice without being guilty of wickedness or injustice. Therefore in

        By metaphor and likeness, there is justice not of a man toward himself
        but among the parts of man toward one another. However, not every kind
        of justice is found here but the justice of master or administrator.
        According to these concepts, one part of the soul has been divided as
        against the irrational part (irascible and concupiscible). Looking at
        these, some people think that injustice to oneself is present because in
        them it is possible to suffer something contrary to one’s own desire.
        Here a kind of injustice is found as between master and slave. We have,

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1091. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on justice in the
        proper sense, he now intends to treat justice in the metaphorical sense.
        Because justice of this kind exists in things that relate to oneself,
        therefore, he first [ I ] shows that no one, properly speaking, can do
        himself an injustice. Second [II], at “By metaphor etc.,” he shows how
        this takes place in a metaphorical sense. He develops this point in a
        twofold manner. First [A] he shows that no one can do himself an
        injustice nor suffer an injustice from himself. Then [B], at “Obviously
        both are evil etc.,” he shows whether it is worse to do an injustice or
        suffer an injustice. He considers the first under three aspects.
        Initially [A, A’] he suggests that a question of this kind can be
        settled from what has been said before. Next [A, B’] at “There are
        certain just acts etc.,” he proposes certain grounds on which it seems
        that a person can do himself an injustice. Last [A, C’] at “But to whom?
        etc.,” he determines the truth. He says first that from the premises it
        can be made clear whether a man may do an injustice to himself. He
        raised this question before (1059-1064). But here he follows it up
        because of the connection it has with an understanding of justice taken
        in a metaphorical sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1092. Then [A, B’] at “There are certain just acts,” he gives two
        reasons from which it seems that someone can do himself an injustice.
        The first is this [ B’, 1 ]. Obviously from what has been said before,
        the things that are just according to any virtue are ordered by law.
        Hence what is not ordered at all by law does not seem to be just in
        terms of any virtue and hence is unjust. In no case does the law command
        a man to take his own life. But those acts that the law does not command
        as just, it forbids as unjust. This is not to be understood as if no
        mean exists between the command and the prohibition of the law, since
        there are many acts that are neither commanded nor forbidden by the law
        but are left to man’s will, for example, buying or not buying a
        particular thing. But this is to be understood in the sense that it is
        only those things which are forbidden as unjust in themselves that the
        law in no case commands. So it seems that to take one’s own life is of
        itself unjust, since the law never commands it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1093. At “Again, however” [B’ 2] he gives the second reason, saying that
        one who injures another contrary to the precept of the law (as when the
        law commands that an action be punished provided it is not against a
        person defending himself, i.e., resisting injury inflicted on oneself by
        another), such a one, I say, willingly does injustice. When I say
        “willingly,” it is understood the person should know what he does, in
        what manner, and the other circumstances. But he who takes his own life
        because of anger acts contrary to a good law in willing something the
        law does not permit. Therefore he does injustice. Consequently it seems
        that a man can do himself an injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1094. At “But to whom” [A, C] he solves the previously mentioned doubt.
        First [C, 1] he presents and confirms the solution. Second [C’, 2], at “
        This question,” he’,gives the root of the solution. He treats the first
        point in two ways. Initially [1, a] he solves the doubt raised before,
        regarding legal justice. Second [1, b], at “Besides, inasmuch etc.,” he
        solves the doubt regarding particular justice. On the initial point he
        does two (three) things. First [a, i] he proposes the solution saying
        that the man who commits suicide does some injustice. But we must
        consider against whom he acts unjustly. Certainly he does an injustice
        to the state, which he deprives of a citizen, even if he does no
        injustice to himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1095. Next [a, ii], at “He voluntarily suffers,” he confirms the
        solution given; first [a, ii, x] in regard to the fact that one does not
        do himself an injustice. He may willingly endure the slaying but no one
        willingly suffers injustice, as was said before (1094). Therefore this
        person does not suffer an injustice and does not do himself an
        injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1096. Then [a, ii, y], at “For this reason,” he confirms the solution in
        regard to the injustice to the state-this by a certain sign. We see that
        the state imposes what punishment is possible, dishonor or censure on
        the suicide; that it has his body dragged or left unburied. In this way
        we are given to understand that this man committed injustice against the
        state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1097. At “Besides, inasmuch” [1, b] he shows that no one does himself an
        injustice according to particular justice. First [b, i] he proposes what
        he intends. He says that inasmuch as a person is called unjust not as
        being completely perverse in evil but only as doing particular
        injustice, according to this injustice it is not possible for a person
        to do injustice to himself. This particular injustice, which we
        discussed before (913-926), is different from legal injustice. A man may
        be called unjust in some measure not as being completely evil but as
        being partially evil, for example, someone is called cowardly according
        to a particular evil. Hence neither according to particular injustice
        can anyone do injustice to himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1099. Next [b, ii], at “Indeed something,” he proves the proposition by
        four reasons. The first [b, ii, w] is that one who does injustice
        according to particular injustice has more than is due him, and he who
        suffers injustice has less. If then someone could do injustice to
        himself, it would follow that something could be taken from him and
        added to him at one and the same time-things that are opposites.
        Therefore it is impossible for the same person to be the one doing
        injustice and suffering injustice from himself. But justice and
        injustice necessarily implies more than one person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1099. At “Again, doing injustice” [b, ii, x] he gives the second reason
        saying that doing injustice must be voluntary and with-choice, and must
        be previous to suffering injustice. That man, who first has suffered
        injustice and reacts against it according as the law allows, does not
        seem to do injustice, for example, if he repossesses a thing taken from
        him. But if a person injures himself, he suffers and inflicts the same
        act at the same time. Therefore he does not seem to do injustice to
        himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1100. Then [b, ii, y], at “Moreover, he will,” he offers the third
        reason. Certainly a person voluntarily does harm to himself. If then
        such a one suffers injustice from himself, it follows that suffering
        injustice is a voluntary. This we disproved before (1094-1096).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1101. Next [b, ii, z], at “Besides, no one,” he gives the fourth reason.
        If we look at particular injustice, that is, the species of particular
        injustice, it is apparent that no one does himself an injustice. One
        particular species of injustice is fornication, i.e., adultery. But no
        man fornicates or commits adultery with his own wife. No one is called a
        burglar—burglary belongs to another species of injustice—because he
        breaks into his own home, nor a thief if he secretly takes his own
        goods. Obviously then it is not possible to do oneself injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1102. At “This question” [C’, 2] he gives the principal root of the
        previously mentioned solution. He says that this question about doing
        injustice to oneself is completely solved in accord with what was
        determined before (1063, 1071, 1099) on the point that it is impossible
        to suffer any injustice voluntarily. From this it clearly follows that
        no one unwillingly does injustice, since doing injustice is a voluntary,
        as was pointed out previously (1063, 1071, 1099).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1103. Then [B], at “Obviously both,” he compares these two things with
        one another. In regard to the comparison he takes up three points. First
        [B, A’] he shows that both of them are evil. Next [B, B’], at “However,
        to do injustice etc.,” he shows that in itself it is worse to do
        injustice. Last [B, C’], at “although nothing hinders etc.,” he shows
        that by chance the contrary can be true. He says first that both, doing
        injustice and suffering injustice, are evil. He proves the statement
        from the fact that to suffer injustice is to have less than the mean of
        justice requires. But the first, to do injustice, is to have more than
        the measure of justice. Now the mean of justice, called the just thing,
        is related to exchanges and distributions as the healthful is to
        medicine and the well-conditioned to gymnastics. Consequently, as in
        medicine and gymnastics what is too much or too little is evil, so also
        in regard to justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1104. Next [B, B’], at “However, to do injustice,” he shows that it is
        worse to do injustice than to suffer injustice. This he proves from the
        fact that to do injustice is blameworthy and evil—a thing that is to be
        understood either as complete and absolute evil (for instance, when
        someone does injustice not only voluntarily but by choice) or “Coming
        close to complete evil (evident in the person who acts unjustly not by
        choice but by anger or some other passion). It has been explained before
        (1041) that not every voluntary accompanies injustice, because sometimes
        a man does an unjust act and nevertheless is not unjust, although he is
        blameworthy. But a person’s suffering injustice is entirely without evil
        and injustice, for he who suffers injustice can in no way be considered
        unjust or evil. But, obviously, that by which a man is called evil is
        worse than that by which he is not called evil, an actual whiteness by
        which a person is called white is whiteness in a greater degree than
        potential whiteness by which a person is not called white. It follows
        then that suffering injustice is in itself less evil than doing
        injustice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1105. At “although nothing hinders” [B, C’] he shows that the contrary
        can be true by chance. He says nothing prevents suffering injustice from
        being more evil by chance than doing injustice, as when a man is
        provoked to do greater injustice by the fact that he suffers unjustly.
        But this is by chance, and art does not care about what is by chance but
        judges only according to what is essential. Thus the art of medicine
        calls pleurisy a dangerous and deadly abscess under the ribs, a worse
        ailment than a sore foot that nevertheless can by chance be worse, for
        instance, when a man falls because of an injured foot and so by accident
        is captured and slain by an enemy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1106. Next [II], at “By metaphor and likeness,” he shows of what nature
        metaphorical justice is. He says that by a kind of metaphor and
        likeness, it is possible to have, not justice or injustice of the whole
        man toward himself, but a certain species of justice among the parts of
        man. However, this is not justice in the full sense but only the justice
        of a master or an administrator (viz., the head of a household), because
        corresponding to these reasons of dominion and administration the
        rational part of the soul seems to be distinguished from the irrational
        part, which is divided into irascible and concupiscible. The reason is
        master of the irascible and concupiscible parts and governs them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1107. In view of such consideration some people think that a man’s
        justice extends to himself because, by reason of these parts, he can
        suffer from his own desires, for instance, when he acts against reason
        out of anger or concupiscence. Hence, among the parts a kind of justice
        and injustice is found, as between one who commands and one who obeys.
        However, it is not genuine justice because it is not between two, but it
        has a resemblance to justice inasmuch as the diversity in the soul is
        like the diversity between persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1108. Finally, as a summary, he concludes that we have finished the
        treatise on Justice and the other moral virtues according to the
        preceding plan. With this the teaching of the fifth book is completed.
