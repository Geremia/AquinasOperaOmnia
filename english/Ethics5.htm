<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Apparently everyone wants to call justice that habit by which men are disposed to just works, and by
which they actually perform and will just deeds. We must speak in a similar way about injustice, viz.,
that it is a habit by which men are disposed to unjust deeds and by which they do and will unjust actions.
For that reason we must presuppose what is said here in outline.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -1.71583in; margin-left: 1.71583in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>y.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>THE EXPLANATION IS REASONABLE. &#8212; 890-891</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Likewise, the same is not true in regard to sciences and potencies as in regard to habits, for contraries
belong to the same potency and the same science, but with a habit contrary things are not referred to it.
We see, for example, that things contrary to health do not proceed from health, but only things in keeping
with it. Thus we say that a man walks in a healthy way when he walks like a healthy man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -1.71583in; margin-left: 1.71583in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>z.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>HE INFERS A COROLLARY. &#8212; 892</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Oftentimes, then, one contrary habit is known by another, and oftentimes by its subject. If a healthy
condition is known, then an unhealthy condition also becomes known. But from the things that make a
man healthy a healthy condition is known, and the things themselves from the condition. If firmness of
flesh is a sign of good condition, then flabbiness is necessarily a sign of bad condition. Likewise, what
makes a man healthy necessarily makes his flesh firm.</span></p>

be, as is the case with what is just and unjust.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Justice and injustice can be spoken of in various ways but the different meanings lending themselves to
equivocation are not immediately apparent, and are not so evident as in the things which are widely
separated. In these there is a great difference in concept, for instance, the name key is used equivocally
both for the clavicle in the shoulder of animals and for the instrument which locks doors.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The unjust man should be understood in as many ways as he is designated. He is spoken of as
lawbreaking, as covetous and as unfair. It is clear then that the just man will be taken as law-abiding and
fair. Hence what is just is according to law and fair, but what is unjust is contrary to law and unfair.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Since the unjust man is covetous, he will be concerned not about all goods but about whatever pertains
to fortune and misfortune. Goods of this kind are always good in themselves but not always for a
particular man. They are objects of his prayers and pursuits. This ought not to be so, but a man should
pray that the things that are good in themselves become good for him, and should choose such as are
good for him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But the unjust man does not always choose too much, rather sometimes too little of the things
burdensome in themselves. However, because a lesser evil apparently is in some way a
good&#8212;covetousness is concerned with a good&#8212;therefore it seems that this type of man is covetous. But
he is unfair&#8212;a term which contains both and is common.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">885. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of the moral virtues dealing with the passions,
he now begins to consider the virtue of justice dealing with actions. He divides the inquiry into two parts,
in the first of which [I] he examines justice in the proper sense; and then [Lect. 17], at &#8220;Whether or not
it is possible etc.&#8221; (B. 1138 a 4), in the metaphorical sense. He discusses the first point under two
headings. Initially [A] he investigates the virtue of justice; and then [Lect. 16], at &#8220;Next we will treat
equity etc.&#8221; (B. 1137 a 31), a certain virtue, namely, equity that</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">gives direction to ordinary justice. He handles the initial point in a twofold manner. First [A&#8217;] he
indicates what he intends to treat; and next [B&#8217;] at &#8220;Apparently everyone wants to call etc.,&#8221; he carries
out his intention. He considers the first under two aspects. Initially [A&#8217;, 1] he shows what subject he
intends to consider, viz., justice and injustice. Concerning justice he proposes for consideration three
differences existing between justice an the previously mentioned virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">886. The first difference is touched upon when he says that we must aim it such operations as aredone
by justice and injustice. The virtues and vices discussed before (649-884) are concerned with the
passions, for there we consider. in what way a man may be internally influenced by reason of the
passions; but we do not consider what is externally done, except as something secondary, inasmuch as
external operations originate from internal passions. However, in treating justice and injustice we direct
our principal attention to what a man does externally; how he is influenced internally we consider only
as a by-product, namely, according as he is helped or hindered in the operation. The second difference
is touched upon when he says &#8220;what is the mean of justice and the just action,&#8221; i.e., the object of justice.
In the virtues previously treated we took the mean of reason and not of the thing. But in justice the mean
of the thing is used, as will be determined later (932-977). The third difference is touched upon when he
says &#8220;and between what extremes the just action is the mean.&#8221; Each of the afore-mentioned virtues is a
mean between two vices, but justice is not a mean between two vices, as will be clear afterwards (993-994).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">887. Then [A&#8217;, 2], at &#8220;It is our intention,&#8221; he shows by what method we are to examine the differences
just mentioned. He says that we intend to investigate justice in the same way as we investigated the
virtues just discussed, i.e., according to type and so on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">888. Next [B&#8217;], at &#8220;Apparently everyone etc.,&#8221; he begins the investigation of justice. First [B&#8217;, 1] he
distinguishes particular from legal justice. Then [Lect. 4], at &#8220;One species of particular etc.&#8221; (B.1130 b
30), he considers particular justice, his principal concern. He discusses the first point in a threefold
manner. First [i, a] he divides justice into legal and particular. Second [Lect. 2], at &#8220;Since it was said that
etc.&#8221; (B.i129 b 12), he shows what the nature of legal justice is. Third [Lect. 3], at &#8220;We are now
investigating etc.&#8221; (B. 1l30 a 14), he explains that, besides legal justice, there is a particular justice. He
treats the initial point in a twofold manner. First [a, i] he shows what the names, justice and injustice,
signify; and then [a, ii], at &#8220;It follows in most instances etc.,&#8221; he distinguishes the two concepts. He
develops the first under three headings. At the outset [i, x] he explains justice and injustice. Next [i, y],
at &#8220;Likewise, the same etc.,&#8221; he shows that the explanation is reasonable. Last [i, z], at &#8220;Oftentimes then
etc.,&#8221; he infers a corollary from the premises. He says in the beginning that all seem to contend that
justice is the sort of habit that brings about three effects in man. The first is an inclination to a work of
justice in accord with which a man is said to be disposed to just works. The second is a just action. The
Third is that a man wants to perform just operations. We must say the same about injustice, namely, that
it is a habit by which men are disposed to unjust deeds and by which they do and will unjust actions. For
that reason we must presuppose these things about justice as apparently typical in such matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">889. Likewise, we must take into consideration that he properly explained justice after the manner of a
will, which does not have passions but nevertheless is the principle of external actions. Consequently,
the will is a proper subject of justice, which is not concerned with the passions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">890. At &#8220;Likewise, the same&#8221; [i, y] he shows that the preceding explanations are reasonable in this
respect, viz., that justice is explained by the fact that its purpose is to will and perform just actions, and
injustice to will and perform unjust actions. What is true of sciences and potencies is not true of habits,
for contraries belong to the same potency (for example, white and black to sight) and to the same science
(for instance, health and sickness to medicine). But in regard to habits, contrary things are not referred
to them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">891. He takes an example from habits of the body. Not the things that are contrary to health but only
those in keeping with health proceed from health. In this way we say that a man walks with a vigorous
step who is vigorous in health. Hence science itself, as it is a kind of knowledge, refers to contraries
inasmuch as one of contraries is the reason for knowing the other; nevertheless, inasmuch as science is
a certain habit, it is attributed to one act only (which is knowing the truth) and not to the contrary error.
So then it was properly said that by justice we do just actions; by injustice, unjust actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">892. Then [i, z], at &#8220;Oftentimes, then,&#8221; he infers a corollary from the premises. Since contrary habits
belong to contraries, and one act belongs to one object in a fixed manner, it follows that frequently one
contrary habit is known by another and oftentimes by its object which is, as it were, matter subject to the
operation of the habit. He illustrates this by an example. If <i>evexia</i> or a healthy condition is known,
<i>cachexia</i> or an unhealthy condition is also known. In this way a habit is known by its contrary. Likewise
it is known from its object because from the things that make a man healthy, a healthy condition becomes
known. This is further illustrated in a more particular way. If the fact that a man has very firm flesh is
a characteristic of a healthy condition, then the fact that he has flabby flesh&#8212;as it were loosely
compressed by reason of disordered humors&#8212;is necessarily characteristic of an unhealthy condition.
Again, that which makes a man healthy is necessarily a condition making him have firm flesh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">893. Next [a, ii], at &#8220;It follows in most instances,&#8221; he distinguishes justice and injustice. First [ii, x] he
gives the division; and then [ii, y], at &#8220;Since the unjust man etc.,&#8221; the parts of the division. He treats the
first point in three ways. At the outset [x, aa] he shows that various meanings of injustice indicate various
meanings of justice. The reason is that it follows in most instances that if one of opposites may be spoken
of in diverse ways, then the other can be. This is the case, too, with what is just and unjust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">894. Second [x, bb], at &#8220;Justice and injustice,&#8221; he explains the nature of their various meanings. He says
that both justice and injustice can be spoken of in diverse ways, but their many meanings lie concealed
because the things making for equivocation are close to one another in their agreement among
themselves. But in widely separated things equivocation is evident, if the same name be given them,
because their great difference in concept, i.e., in the essential element of the proper species, is
immediately apparent. In this way the name key is used equivocally of an instrument which locks doors
and of the clavicle (<i>clavicula</i> i.e. little key) which covers the artery in the shoulder of animals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">895. Third [x, cc], at &#8220;The unjust man,&#8221; he explains in how many ways the previously mentioned habits
may be signified, saying that first we must consider the unjust man in as many ways as he is designated.
He is spoken of in three ways: in one way as the lawbreaking man, i.e., one who acts contrary to the law;
in another way as the covetous man who wants too much prosperity; in the last way as the unfair man
who determines to have too few burdens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">896. It is obvious then that the man is taken in two ways: in one way as a law-abiding person, i.e., as one
who observes the law; in the other way as the fair person who is willing to have the smiles and frowns
of fortune in equal measure. The equal is opposed to both, i.e., to what is excessive and to what is
deficient. From this he draws a further conclusion that what is just is said to be according to the law and
fair; and what is unjust, contrary to the law and unfair inasmuch as objects are made known by habits,
as was said before (892).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">897. At &#8220;Since the unjust man&#8221; [ii, y] he makes clear the parts: of the division just given. First [y, aa] he
shows in what way the covetous man is said to be unjust. He affirms that since the covetous person who
wants to have too much is unjust, it follows that he will be concerned about an abundance of goods which
men desire. However, he will not be solicitous about all goods but only those pertaining to fortune and
adversity. Goods of this kind are beneficial if we do not make qualification, i.e., they are good considered
independently and in themselves. But they are not always beneficial for an individual because they are
not always proportionate to him nor always expedient for him. However, men seek these goods from
God, and pray for and desire them as if such things were always beneficial. By reason of this they
become covetous and unjust. It should not be this way, but a man ought to pray that those things that are
in themselves good be made good for him, so that each may choose what is good for him, i.e., the proper
exercise of virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">898. Then [y, bb], at &#8220;But the unjust man,&#8221; he shows how the unjust person is said to be unfair, stating
that a man is not always called unjust because he chooses too much but because he chooses too little of
the things that simply and considered in themselves are burdensome&#8212;like labors, lack of necessities and
so on. However, since lesser evil apparently is in some way a good precisely as it is
eligible&#8212;covetousness regards a good as was just said (897)&#8212;it seems for this reason that a person who
desires too little of what is arduous is in some way covetous. But it is nearer the truth to say that he is
unfair-a term that contains both and is common to excess and defect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">899. Last [y, cc], at &#8220;Besides, the unjust ,&#8221; he explains how the unjust man is said to be lawbreaking,
affirming that he who is unlawful is also called unjust. A person is designated a lawbreaker by reason
of unlawfulness which is also an inequality inasmuch as a man is not equal to the norm of the law. This
unlawfulness contains in general all injustice and something common in respect of every kind of
injustice, as will be made clear later (911, 919, 922).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">A law commands deeds of bravery, for instance, that a soldier should not leave the battle line nor throw
away his arms. It commands things belonging to temperance, for example, that no one should commit
adultery, that no one should be guilty of outrage. It commands things that pertain to meekness: no one
should strike another, no one should contend with another. It is the same with other virtues and vices, the
law ordering the former and forbidding the latter. In accord with this, a law rightly drafted will be
excellent but one insufficiently considered will be bad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Legal justice is perfect because the person who has this virtue can exercise it in relation to another and
not in relation to himself alone. Some people can apply virtue to their own affairs but not to affairs
pertaining to others. Because of this, the saying of Bias seems to be commendable that authority tests a
man, for the prince is already engaged in communication with others. Therefore, justice alone among the
virtues seems to be another&#8217;s good because it refers to another. It produces goods useful to another, viz.,
the prince or the common good. Consequently, the man who practices vice in regard to himself and his
friends is most wicked. On the other hand the man who practices virtue in regard to himself and toward
others&#8212;a difficult thing to do&#8212;is most honorable.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">How virtue and justice differ from one another is evident from what has been said, for they are the same
in substance but different in concept. Virtue as related to another is justice; as this kind of habit it is
virtue without qualification.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">900. After the Philosopher has given the division of justice, he now considers legal justice. First [A] he
treats the legally just itself, which is the object of legal justice. Second [B], at &#8220;Justice itself then etc.,
he considers legal justice. He discusses the first point in a twofold manner. First [A, 1 ] he shows that
the legally just is determined by law. Now [A, 2], at &#8220;But laws aim etc.,&#8221; he explains the nature of legal
enactments. He affirms first that, since it was said above (895-896, 899) that the lawless man is unjust
and the law-abiding man just, it clearly follows that all lawful acts are just in some measure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">goi. He says &#8220;in some measure&#8221; because every law is determined in relation to some state. Now, not
every state possesses what is simply just but some states have only what is partially just, as is evident in
the third book of the Politics (Ch. 9, 1281 a 10; St. Th. Lect. 7, 413). In a democratic state where all the
people govern, what is partially just is observed but not what is simply just, so that because all the
citizens are equal in one respect (i.e., in liberty), therefore they are considered equal in every respect.
Consequently, acts that are prescribed by law in a democracy are not simply but only in some measure
just. But Aristotle says that those enactments are lawful that have been fixed and determined by positive
law, which is within the competence of legislators, and that each enactment so decreed is said to he just
in some way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">902. Next [A&#8217;, 2] , at &#8220;But laws aim,&#8221; he explains with what the decrees of law are concerned. He
considers this point from two aspects. First [2, a] he shows for whose sake a law is enacted. Then [2, b],
at &#8220;A law commands,&#8221; he shows on what matters laws are made. He says first that laws touch on
everything that can be of any possible utility for the community (as in the ideal states where the common
good is kept in mind), or for the utility of the best (i.e., certain elders of the state who govern it and are
called nobles), or for the utility of he rulers (as happens in states ruled by kings and tyrants). In the
framing of laws attention is always given to what is useful to the affair of chief importance in the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">903. Some may be considered as best or as ruling either because of virtue (as in an aristocratic state
where certain ones rule on account of virtue), or for the sake of something else (as in an oligarchy where
the few rule on account of riches or power). Since human utility of every kind is finally ordered to
happiness, obviously the legal enactments that bring about happiness and the means to it (i.e., the things
that are ordered to happiness either principally, like the virtues, or instrumentally like riches and other
external goods of this kind) are called just in some fashion. This is by comparison with the civic
community to which the framing of a law is directed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">904. At &#8220;A law commands&#8221; [2, b] he explains on what matters laws are made, saying that a law
commands what belongs to individual virtues. It commands deeds of bravery, for instance, that a soldier
should not leave the battle line, nor take flight, nor throw away his arms. Likewise, it commands things
pertaining to temperance, for example, that no one should commit adultery, that no one should dishonor
the person of a woman. Also it commands the things belonging to meekness: no one should strike another
in anger, no one should contend with another by insults. It is the same with other virtues whose acts the
law commands, and with other vices whose acts the law forbids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">905. If the law is rightly drafted according to this, it will be declared an excellent law. Otherwise it is
called <i>aposchediasmenos</i> (from <i>a</i> meaning without, <i>poschedias</i> meaning knowledge, and <i>menos</i> meaning
a searching) as if the law was drafted without a thorough knowledge, or the expression may come from
<i>schedos</i> signifying a decree published without being thoroughly scanned, from which we have <i>schediazo</i>,
i.e., I am doing something off-hand. Hence a law is said to be <i>aposchediasmenos</i> which lacks proper
forethought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">906. Then [B], at &#8220;Justice itself then,&#8221; he determines how legal justice is constituted, showing first [B,
1] the nature of legal justice; and then [B, 2], at &#8220;But under justice,&#8221; in what way it is related to the
virtues. He says first that justice itself is a certain perfect virtue not in terms of itself but in relation to
another. Since it is better to be perfect not only in oneself but also in relation to another, therefore it is
often said that this justice is the most excellent among all virtues. This is the origin of the proverb that
neither Hesperus nor Lucifer, the brightest of the morning and evening stars, shine with such brilliance
as justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">907. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;But under justice,&#8221; he shows from our discussion thus far how legal justice is related
to the virtues. He treats this point under three headings. First [B, 2, a] he sets forth his intention. Then
[B, 2, b], at &#8220;Legal justice is perfect etc.,&#8221; he explains his proposition. Lastly [B, 2, c], at &#8220;How virtue
and justice etc.,&#8221; he settles a point which could be called in question by the present discussion. He states
first that justice itself comprehends every virtue at the same time and is even the perfect virtue in a
special way. The reason is that legal justice consists in the exercise of virtue having do with another and
is in agreement with every virtue prescribed by the law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">908. At &#8220;Legal justice is perfect&#8221; [ B, 2, b] he explains what was set forth: first [b, i] that legal justice
is an especially perfect virtue; and then, at &#8220;This virtue, therefore&#8221; [b, ii], that it includes every virtue.
He says first that legal justice is a perfect virtue because a man who has this virtue can employ it in
relation to another and not to himself only&#8212;something not characteristic of all virtuous people. Many
can practice virtue in things pertaining to themselves but not in the things pertaining to others. To make
clear the previous statements he introduces two common sayings or proverbs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">909. Bias, one of the seven wise men, said that authority tests whether a man is perfect or deficient. The
man who rules is already engaged in communication with another because it is his business to arrange
the things which are ordered to the common good. So from this we see that the perfection of virtue is
indicated by the fact that one person is in touch with another. He proposes another saying to show that
legal justice refers to another. For this reason legal justice alone seems to be the good of another (that
is, relates to our neighbor) inasmuch as it aims to perform actions useful to another, viz., to the
community or the ruler of the community. But some virtues aim to achieve an individual&#8217;s good, for
instance, temperance strives to quiet the disgraceful desires of the soul. The same is true of the other
virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">910. He draws the conclusion that, as that man is most wicked who practices vice not only in regard to
himself but also in regard to his friends, so, that man is most honorable who practices virtue in relation
not only to himself but also to others. This is especially difficult. So then it is clear that the law-abiding
just man is most virtuous and legal justice is the most perfect of virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">911. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;This virtue, therefore,&#8221; he infers that legal justice embraces every virtue, for it
pertains to legal justice to exercise virtue in regard to another. But a person can practice every virtue in
his relation with another. Hence obviously legal justice is not a particular virtue but has a connection with
virtue in general. Likewise, the opposite vice is not a particular vice but a general vice, since in a similar
way man can exercise every vice in his relations with his neighbor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">912. Next [B, 2, c], at &#8220;How justice and virtue,&#8221; he clarifies something that may be doubtful from the
premises. He says that it is clear, from what has been said, the way in which virtue and legal justice differ
since they are the same in substance but different in concept. However, virtue in its relation to another
is called justice, but precisely as it is a habit operative of such good, it is a virtue simply. This must be
understood in regard to the act itself of justice and virtue, for an act identical in subject but diverse in
concept is produced by legal justice and by virtue simply so called, for instance, not to commit adultery.
But where a special formal aspect of an object exists even in general matter, thee a special habit must be
found. For this reason it follows that legal justice is a definite virtue taking its species from this, that it
tends to the common good.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The proof for the existence of a particular justice is that a man who practices other vices acting unjustly,
nevertheless does not act covetously, for example, one who throws away his shield out of cowardice, or
who speaks ill of another out of anger, or who refuses financial help because of stinginess. On the other
hand, a person often sins by covetousness, although not by one or all of the other vices, but he does sin
by this particular vice, for we reproach him for being unjust. There is then another kind of injustice, a
part of injustice in general. Likewise, there is a certain unjust thing that is a part of that which is legally
unjust.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Moreover, if one man commits adultery for the sake of gain and makes money by this act, while another
commits adultery for the sake of concupiscence and pays, thus sustaining a loss; the second man seems
to be more lustful than the first who is unjust rather than lustful, for obviously he acted for gain.</span></p>

reduced to any other vice but only to injustice. Hence it is clear that over and above general justice, there
is a particular justice.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, in accord with the illegally unjust thing, there is an injustice that we previously discussed.
Now, the unjust thing that consists in a desire for inequality is not the same, but is related to the other
as a part to the whole, for every unjust thing consisting in a desire for inequality is an illegally unjust
thing but not the reverse. Besides, the excessive is unequal but not the reverse. Because one unjust thing
is not the same as another, so also one injustice is not the same as another but different from it as a part
from the whole. The same comparison holds for one injustice with the other.</span></p>

pertains to our neighbor, are both to be passed over for the present. It is evident in these cases how the

law commands us to live according to every virtue and forbids us to live according to any vice.</span></p>

to be a good citizen are not the same thing in any state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">913. After the Philosopher has shown that besides this there is a particular what is the nature of legal
justice, which is a general virtue, now he shows justice. He treats this point under three headings. First
[A] he indicates his proposition; and then [B], at &#8220;The proof for etc.,&#8221; he explains it. Last [C], at
&#8220;Obviously then etc.,&#8221; he sums up what has already been said and shows what remains to be discussed.
He says first that, while legal justice is a general virtue, we are not principally investigating this at
present, but that which as a part of the general virtue is a particular virtue. As is commonly held, there
is such a virtue. Also we intend to speak about particular injustice in a similar manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">914. Then [B], at &#8220;The proof for,&#8221; he explains the proposition. He discusses this point from two aspects.
First [B, 1] he shows that besides legal justice, which is a general virtue, there is a justice that is a
particular virtue. Next [B, 2], at &#8220;This justice etc.,&#8221; he assigns the reason why it has a name in common
with legal justice. On this question we must consider that to prove there is a justice that is a particular
virtue, he takes for granted that there is an injustice that is a particular vice, for we said above (892) that
habits are made known by their contraries. He proposes three arguments for this. The first argument [B,
1, a] is taken according to the real distinction of injustice from other vices inasmuch as injustice is found
without the others and conversely. From this it is evident that injustice is a particular vice distinct from
other vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">915. He says that we have this proof that there is a particular justice and injustice because a man, who
practices other particular vices acting unjustly according to legal injustice, nevertheless does not act
covetously in taking something from his neighbor, for example, when a soldier throws away his shield
because of cowardice, or a man casts opprobrium on someone because of anger, or a person refuses
financial help to a friend because of the vice of stinginess. So other vices can exist without covetousness
which is a special kind of injustice. Sometimes, on the contrary, it happens that a person sins by
covetousness in taking another&#8217;s goods; although he does not sin by some one or all of the other vices,
he does sin by a particular vice. This is clear because he is reproached as unjust for that reason. Hence
obviously there is another justice-a part of the virtue-that is a special virtue. So evidently there exists also
a certain unjust thing that is a part of what is legally unjust-the legally unjust being the unjust thing in
general.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">916. At &#8220;Moreover, if one man&#8221; [B, 1, b] he gives the second argument, which is taken from the order
to the end. Clearly, if a vicious or evil act is ordered to another unbecoming end, from this fact it will
obtain a new species of vice. This is so when a man commits adultery for the sake of gain, for example,
to rob a woman or to take from her in any way whatsoever. Also it happens sometimes that a man
commits adultery entirely because of concupiscence, so that he not only does not gain but rather gives
something of his own and suffers a loss of is goods. A man of this sort seems to be lustful, essentially
speaking (<i>per se</i>), since the vice of lust is strictly ordered to the satisfaction of concupiscence. But the
man who commits adultery to take a woman&#8217;s goods does not seem to be lustful, absolutely speaking,
because he does not intend lust as his end. He seems rather to be unjust since he sins against justice for
the sake of gain. So it is clear then that injustice is a special vice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">917. At &#8220;Yet in all&#8221; [B, i, c] he assigns the third argument, which is taken by comparison with legal
justice. As nothing is contained in a genus that is not contained in some species, so anything that is done
according to legal injustice is reduced to a particular vice. If a man acts contrary to legal justice by
committing adultery, this will be referred to the vice of lust. If a soldier deserts his general in battle, this
will be attributed to the vice of cowardice. If anyone immoderately strikes his neighbor, this will be
ascribed to the vice of a anger. But if a person inordinately enriches himself by pilfering another&#8217;s goods,
this will not be ascribed to any other vice except injustice. Hence it remains that there is a particular
injustice over and above the other injustice that is a general vice. For a like reason there is another
particular justice besides legal justice that is a general virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">918. Then [B, 2] at &#8220;This justice has,&#8221; he shows why a particular virtue of this kind is also named justice.
First [B, 2, a] he assigns the reason for this from the agreement of particular with legal justice. Next [B,
2, b], at &#8220;But particular justice,&#8221; he explains the difference between them. He says first that particular
justice is univocal, that is, has a common name with legal justice. The reason is that they agree in
definition according to the same genus inasmuch as both are concerned about what relates to another.
However, legal justice is taken into account in relation to what is the common good, while particular
justice is ordered to another as pertaining to a private person.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">919. Next [B, 2, b], at &#8220;But particular justice,&#8221; he explains the difference between justice and injustice
on part of the matter. He says that particular justice regards hose things hat take into account social
intercourse, like honor, money, whatever pertains to the safety or harm to the body, and so on. Likewise,
particular justice is concerned not alone with external things but also with pleasure consequent on the
profit by which a man takes his neighbor&#8217;s goods beyond what he ought. But legal justice and injustice
treat all moral matters in general in whatsoever way a man may be said to be good or virtuous about a
thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">920. At &#8220;Obviously then&#8221; [C] he summarizes what has been said and shows what remains to be
discussed. First [C, 1] he sets this forth in a general way; and then [C, 2] at &#8220;We have determined etc.,&#8221;
he takes it up in a specific way. He says first that it is clear from the premises (913-919) that there is
more than one justice, viz., legal justice and justice aiming at equality, and that over and above legal
justice, as a general virtue, there is a particular justice. But we must determine later on (927-1077) the
nature and characteristics of particular justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">921. Then [C, 2], at &#8220;We have determined,&#8221; he shows in detail what has been treated and what remains
to be discussed. First [C, 2, a] he resumes what was said about the distinction between justice and
injustice. He affirms that we have determined that the unjust thing is called illegal and unequal either by
excess or defect. On the contrary, the just thing is called legal and equal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">922. Next [C, 2, b], at &#8220;Therefore, in accord with,&#8221; he resumes what he has said, viz., that as there is a
twofold just thing, so there is a twofold justice. He affirms that in accord with the illegally unjust thing
there is a certain injustice, previously discussed (911, 919), which is a general vice. Likewise, in accord
with the just corresponding to the law, there is a certain justice that is a general virtue. Now, the unjust
thing consisting in a desire for inequality and the illegally unjust thing are not altogether the same, but
one is related to the other as a part to the whole so that every unjust thing consisting in a desire for
inequality is an illegally unjust thing, but not the reverse. Again, every thing that is excessive is unequal
but not the reverse, since there is a certain illegal injustice in having too few burdens. Because (I say)
one unjust thing is a part of the other unjust thing, and they are not entirely the same; in a similar way,
therefore, the injustice called inequality is not entirely the same as illegal injustice but is compared to
it as a part to the whole. Also the justice aiming at equality is compared to legal justice in a similar
manner.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">923. Last [C, 2, c], at &#8220;We must then,&#8221; he shows which of these things we must discuss. On this point
he does three things. First [c, i] he says that we must treat particular justice after this (927-1077), and
similarly the just and the unjust thing particularly so called.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">924. Then [c, ii], at &#8220;Justice that corresponds,&#8221; he explains that here we are not going to treat legal
justice. He affirms that legal justice-which conforms to all of virtue inasmuch as the use of the whole of
virtue referring to our neighbor pertains to it-is to be passed over for the present. Likewise, the opposite
injustice (inasmuch as the use of the whole of vice pertains to it) is to be passed over. It is clear how what
is just and unjust ought to be determined according to justice and injustice of this kind, because they are
the precepts as laid down by the law. The greater part of legal prescriptions are enjoined in agreement
with the whole of virtue inasmuch as the law commands us to live according to every virtue and forbids
us to live according to any vice. However, there are certain determinations of the law that do not belong
directly to the exercise of any virtue but to some disposition of external goods.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">925. Last [c, iii], at &#8220;However, positive law,&#8221; he raises a doubt. It is evident that positive laws are
productive of virtue in general by the instruction given a man in reference to the common good. But there
is another kind of instruction by which a man is trained in virtuous actions as applicable to him
individually, i.e., to his proper good inasmuch as in this way a man becomes virtuous in himself.
Therefore, there can be a doubt whether instruction of this kind should belong to political science or to
so-me other science.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">926. He says that this question must be settled afterwards in the work on Politics. It is proved in the third
book of the Politics (Ch. 4, 1276 b 16-1277 b 33; St. Th. Lect. 3, 365-377) that to be a good man simply
and to be a good citizen are not the same in every state. There are some states not worthy of honor in
which a person can be a good citizen yet not be a good man. Bt in the most worthy state no one is a good
citizen who is not a good man.</span></p>

corresponding to what is unjust. This is the equal, for in operations of this kind where there is more or
less, there is also an equal. Therefore, if the unjust thing is the unequal and, the just thing the equal&#8212;and
this is evident in all situations without need of proof&#8212;then the just thing will be the mean since the equal
is the mean.</span></p>

equal, it necessarily is related to another and pertains to certain matters of equality. As a mean it will be
between two things which are more and less. As it is an equal it will be between two things. As it is a just
thing it will concern matters in relation to other persons, for justice regards another. Therefore, the just
necessarily involves at least four objects, viz., two persons by whom justice is observed and two things
about which justice is done. There will be the same equality between persons and between things in such
a way that, as things are related to one another, so are persons. If they are not equal they will not have
equal shares, and from this source quarrels and complaints. will arise, when either persons who are equal
do not receive equal shares in distribution, or persons who are not equal do receive equal shares.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">927. After the Philosopher has differentiated particular justice from legal justice, he now begins to
investigate particular justice without treating legal justice. He divides the investigation into two parts.
In the first part [I] he considers particular justice in a general way by comparison with its proper object,
and in the second part [Lect. 11], at &#8220;Since someone etc.&#8221; (B. 1134 a 16), he considers it in its application
to the subject. In regard to the first part, he does two things. Initially [A] he makes a division of particular
justice. Next [B], at &#8220;Since the unjust person etc.,&#8221; he explains how a mean may be taken in this virtue.
He discusses the initial point from three aspects. First [A&#8217;] he indicates a species of particular justice.
He says that one species&#8212;the same holds for the unjust thing corresponding to it&#8212;consists in the
distribution of certain common goods (either honor or money or any other thing belonging to external
goods or even to external evils, like labor, expenses and so on) that are to be apportioned among people
who share in social community. He proves that this should belong to particular justice because in matters
of this kind, equality and inequality&#8212;which belong to particular justice and injustice, as was stated
before (922).Of one person to another are taken into consideration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">928. Next [B&#8217;], at &#8220;Another species,&#8221; he gives a second kind of particular justice. He says that another
species establishes a measure of justice in transactions, by which a thing is transferred from one person
to another -in the first species the transfer of a thing from the community to the individual was
considered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">929. Last [C&#8217;], at &#8220;There sire two parts,&#8221; he subdivides commutative justice according to the different
kinds of transactions, making a twofold division. He says first [1] that there are two parts of commutative
justice because there are two kinds of transactions. Some are voluntary, others involuntary. The voluntary
are so-called because the principle of transaction is voluntary in both parties as is evident in <i>selling and
buying</i>, by which one man transfers the dominion over his own property to another as compensation for
a price received; in <i>barter</i>, by which someone gives what is his to another for something of equal value;
in <i>bail</i>, by which a person voluntarily appoints himself a debtor for another; in a <i>loan</i>, by which a man
grants the use of his property to another without recompense but reserves ownership of the thing to
himself; in a <i>deposit</i>, by which one commits something of his to the custody of another; in <i>rent</i>, by which
a person accepts the use of something belonging to another for a price.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">930. Then [2], at &#8220;Some kinds of involuntary,&#8221; he subdivides the other division of transactions, saying
that some involuntary transactions are occult: like theft by which one takes a thing belonging to another
who is unwilling; adultery, by which a man secretly approaches the wife of another for sexual
intercourse, poisoning, which a person poison another with intent either to kill or injure in some way.
Also they are especially called poisoners who by some sorcery bring about murder or harm. <i>Paragogia</i>
is a derivation or a leading away, for example the occult diversion of a stream belonging to one person
to the property of another. The enticement of a slave takes place when someone induces another&#8217;s slave
to flee from his master. Assassination is that slaying which happens from wounds inflicted by trickery.
Testimony is false in which a person conceals the truth by lying. Other transactions are involuntary and
done by manifest violence. Thus a man may use violence either upon a person by beating, fettering,
murdering, or upon things by robbing another of his goods, by despoiling parents of their children
through murder. Likewise, a man may use violence through infamy by using reproachful words, or
through injury by inflicting outrage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">931. We must consider that the voluntary and involuntary in transactions make a difference in the species
of justice because voluntary transactions cause the subtraction of only a thing which must be repaid
according to the equality of justice. But involuntary transactions cause a certain injury. Hence the robber
is forced not only to return the thing plundered but to undergo punishment because of the affront
inflicted. Since the involuntary is twofold, viz., arising from force and from ignorance, he divides
involuntary transactions into those which are occult, as it were through ignorance, and those that are done
openly through violence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">932. Next [B], at &#8220;Since the unjust person,&#8221; he shows how a mean is understood in these matters. He
discusses this point from two aspects. First [13, A&#8217;] he explains how the just thing is a mean; and then
[Lect. 10], at &#8220;From these discussions etc.&#8221; (B. 1133 b 30), how justice is a mean. He treats the first point
in a twofold manner. First [A&#8217;, 1 ] he shows in what way the just thing, consisting in a mean according
to either justice, may be determined. Next [Lect. 8], at &#8220;Some philosophers seem to think etc.&#8221; (B. 1132
b 21), he rejects an error. He further discusses the first point in two stages. First [1, a] he explains how
the just thing may be taken as a mean according to distributive justice; and second (Lect. 6], at &#8220;There
remains another etc.&#8221; (B. 1131 b 25), according to commutative justice. He considers the first point in
two ways. First [a, i] he proves that the mean of distributive should be taken according to a certain
relationship of proportions. Next [Lect. 5],at &#8220;Therefore the just thing etc.&#8221; (B. 113i a 30), he shows what
the nature of that relationship of proportions is. On the initial point he does two things. First [i, x] he
proves the proposition from the very concept of justice; and then [ i, y ], at &#8220;Moreover, this is clear etc.,&#8221;
from the concept of merit. He treats the first point under two headings. First [x, aa] he shows from the
very notion of justice that the just thing is a certain mean. Second [x, bb], at &#8220;However, the equal etc.,&#8221;
he explains that the mean is according to a certain relationship of proportions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">913. He says first that, as was said previously (898, 921), the unjust man is one who desires an inequality
of good and evil, and the unjust thing is that which consists in an inequality, and concerns both too much
and too little. But wherever there is more and less, there the equal must be found, for the equal is the
mean between the greater and the less. Hence wherever we find equality, there we find a mean. It is clear
then that the unjust thing is a kind of unequal thing. That the just thing is a kind of equal thing is obvious
to everyone without any proof. Therefore, since the equal is a mean between more and less, as has been
shown (310, 896, 898), it follows that the just thing is a kind of mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">934. At &#8220;However, the equal&#8221; [x, bb] he explains that the just thing is a mean according to a certain
relationship of proportions. To prove this he takes for granted that the equal consists in at least two things
between which an equality is considered. Therefore, since the just thing is both a mean and an equal,
inasmuch as it is just, it is necessarily a relation to something, i.e., with respect to another, as is evident
from what has been indicated (922); but inasmuch as it is an equal it pertains to certain matters in which
equality between two persons is taken into account. Thus it is evident that if we consider the just thing
precisely as a mean, it will then be a mean between two things that are more and less. But precisely as
the just thing is an equal, it must be between two things (as a just thing, of course, it must concern some
matters in relation to other persons, because justice regards another person). However, justice insofar as
it is a mean, an extrinsic thing, considers more or less; but as something intrinsic it considers two things
and two persons in which justice is established. So it is clear that what is just, necessarily consists in at
least four objects, viz., two persons by whom justice is observed and two things about which justice is
done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">935. In the concept of justice there must be the same equality between persons who practice justice and
between things about which justice is done, so that as the things are related to one another, so are the
persons. Otherwise they will not have shares proportional to themselves. But, by reason of this quarrels
and complaints arise as if justice had been neglected because, either persons who are equal do not receive
equal shares, for example, if laborers are paid wages for doing an unequal amount of work, or are paid
unequal wages for doing an equal amount of work. So then it is evident that the mean of distributive
justice is taken according to a certain relationship of proportions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">936. Then [i, y], at &#8220;Moreover, this is,&#8221; he shows that it is obvious also by reason of merit that the just
thing consists in a certain relationship of fore they think it proper that equal proportions. In this way a
thing is said to be just in distributions inasmuch as allotment is made according to merit as each is worthy
to receive. A certain relationship of proportions is designated by this&#8212;that as one person is deserving
of one thing, so another is deserving of another thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">937. However, all do not judge merit in distribution in agreement with the same norm. In a democratic
state where everyone governs, they judge merit according to a condition of freedom. Because the
common people are the equal of others in freedom, therefore they think it proper that equal distribution
be made to them. In an oligarchy where some few rule, they measure merit according to a man&#8217;s riches
or according to nobility of birth, so that men who are more eminent by birth or riches should have more
of the common goods. In an aristocracy where certain men govern because of their virtue, they measure
merit according to a state of virtue, so that a man should have more who practices virtue more perfectly.
Thus it is clear that the mean of distributive justice is understood according to a relationship of
proportions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Like proportionality, what is just is also found in four terms at least, for both the things and persons are
divided according to a similar proportion. Therefore, as the term A will be to B, so G will be to D. Hence,

what distribution conjoins.</span></p>

suffers unjustly when he has too little of good. The reverse is true in regard to evil. By comparison with
a greater evil a lesser evil has the aspect of good, for a lesser evil is preferable to a greater one. Good is
preferable, and a greater good is more to be preferred. This then is one kind of the just thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">938. After the Philosopher has shown that the mean of distributive justice is taken according to
proportionality, he now shows according to what proportionality and in what way it is understood. He
considers this point in a twofold manner. First [A] he explains in what way the just thing should be taken
according to a certain proportionality. Second [B], at &#8220;This just thing etc.,&#8221; he shows how the unjust
thing is outside that proportionality. He discusses the initial point under three aspects. First [A, 1] he
presents in advance some general comments about proportionality. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;Like proportionality
etc.,&#8221; he explains how the just thing consists in a certain proportionality. Last [A, 3], at &#8220;Mathematicians
call etc.,&#8221; he shows the nature of proportionality by which a thing is judged just in distributive justice.
On the first point he premises two comments. The first [1, a] is that the just thing is fittingly said to be
according to proportionality, because proportionality is found not only in the enumeration of units (which
is number simply taken and here called abstract number), but the quality of being proportionate is met
with wherever number is found.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">939. This is so because proportionality is simply geometrical equality, i.e. this to this and that to that
contains the proportion of equality. Proportion is only a relation of one quantity to another. But quantity
has the nature of a measure. It is found in numerical unity and is transferred from there to every kind of
quantity, as the tenth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> indicates (Ch. 1, 1052 b 20 sq.; St. Th. Lect. 2, 1938).
Therefore, number primarily is found in the enumeration of units, and thence is attributed to every genus
of quantity which is measured according to the idea of number.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">940. He makes the second comment at &#8220;Proportionality consists&#8221; [1, b], saying that every proportionality
consists of four parts at least. It has a twofold division, one of which is a disjunctive proportionality and
the other a continuous proportionality. The disjunctive proportionality is an equality of two proportions
not alike in any term. Therefore, when any proportion exists between the two, it is evident that the
disjunctive proportionality consists of four terms, as when I say: as six is to three as ten is to five. There
is a double proportion on both sides. The continuous proportionality is an equality of two proportions
alike in one term, for instance, if I say: as eight is to four so four is to two. There is a double proportion
on both sides. Therefore in this continuous proportionality there are in some measure four terms
inasmuch as we use one term in two different aspects, declaring it twice, i.e., in either proportion as when
I say: the proportion of A to B (or eight to four) is the same as the proportion B to C (or four to two).
There is a double proportion from both sides. In this way B is used twice. Hence, although B is one in
subject, nevertheless, because it is taken in two different aspects there will be four proportioned termes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">941. Then [A, 2], at &#8220;Like proportionality&#8221; he shows how the mean of distributive justice is taken
according to proportionality. He says that, like proportionality, the just thing is found in four terms in
which the same proportion is observed, because the things that are distributed and the persons to whom
distribution is made are divided according to the same proportion. Therefore, let A be one term, for
example, two pounds, and B one pound. But let G be one person, for example, Socrates who has worked
two days, and D, Plato, who has worked one day. Therefore, as A is to B so G is to D, because a double
proportion is found on the one side and the other. Hence by alternation, as A is to G, so B is to D.
Whatever things are proportionable one to another are proportionable by alternation, as is evident in the
preceding example (940), for instance, as ten is to five so eight is to four. Therefore, by alternation, as
ten is to eight, so five is to four, for there is a ratio of five to four on one side and the other. In this way
then, by alternation, it will be true to say that as A is to G, i.e., two pounds to the man who worked two
days, so B is to D, i.e., one pound to the man who worked a day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">942. In such matters we must also consider that in the things proportionable in this way, the ratio of one
to the other is the ratio of the whole to the whole. For example, if the ratio ten to eight is the same as five
to four, it follows further that the ratio ten to eight and five to four will be the same ratio as ten and five
taken together&#8217; i.e., fifteen to eight and four taken together, i.e., twelve. The reason is that here we have
also the ratio of five to four. How does this happen? Because fifteen contains twelve and its fourth part,
i.e., three.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">943. In the proposition it follows that, if as this thing is to this person, so that thing is to that person, then
also the whole will be to the whole in the same way, i.e., both things taken together will be to both
persons taken together. This is as distribution connects them. If in distribution man unites the things to
the persons in this way, he acts justly. It is plain then that the union of A with G, i.e., of a thing doubled
with a person doubly more deserving, and of B with D, i.e., of a half thing with a person deserving only
half is the just thing in distribution and such a just thing is a mean. But the unjust thing is outside this
proportionality. The proportional is a mean between excess and defect because the proportionality is an
equality of proportion, as has been remarked (939). So the just thing is a mean since it is a certain
proportional.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">944. At &#8220;Mathematicians call&#8221; [A, 3] he explains the nature of proportionality according to which this
just thing is understood. On this point he does two things. First 13, a] he says that the above-mentioned
proportionality, which is considered according to the equality of proportion, is called geometrical by
mathematicians. In this it happens that as the whole is to the whole so one part is to another, as we have
pointed out in previous discussions (939-940). But this does not take place in arithmetical
proportionality, which we will treat later (950).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">945. Next [3, b], at &#8220;But this&#8221; he says that this proportionality, which is observed in distributive justice,
cannot be continuous because on one side are the things and on the other the persons. So it is not possible
to take for a common term a person to whom distribution is made and the thing which is distributed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">946. Then [B], at &#8220;This just thing,&#8221; he considers what is unjust in distributions. He says that, since the
just thing is proportionable, it follows that the unjust thing is outside the proportionable. This happens
either by reason of more or less than the equality of proportion demands, as is evident in the very
operations of just and unjust distribution. That man acts unjustly who accepts for himself too many
goods, but he suffers unjustly who has too few. The reverse is true in regard to evils. Since a lesser evil
has the aspect of good by comparison with a greater evil, the lesser evil is more to be preferred than the
greater evil. Everything is chosen under the aspect of good, and for this reason the thing which has the
aspect of greater good is more to be preferred. So then this is one species of justice that has been
discussed.</span></p>

as more, and loss as less. Gain is understood in contrary ways, for it is more in relation to good and less
in relation to evil, while the opposite is true of loss. Between gain and loss stands a mean, the equal
which we call the just. This then is a directive, and will be the mean between gain and loss.</span></p>

justice, for a judge ought to be living justice. Men approaching a judge are seeking an intermediate, and
this is why judges are called intermediaries or mediators, as if they touch the mean when they attain what
is just. Therefore, the just thing is a mean as also is the judge who brings about an equality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">947. After the Philosopher has shown how the mean should be taken in distributive justice, he now
explains in what way the mean should be understood in commutative justice. He discusses this point
under three aspects. First [A] he shows there is a species of justice in addition to distributive. Then [B],
at &#8220;This differs etc.,&#8221; he says this differs from the other justice. Third [Lect. 7], at &#8220;It is as though etc.&#8221;
(B. 1132 a 25), he shows how a mean should be understood in this kind of justice. He says first that in
addition to the preceding species of justice which exists in distributions, there remains one that is
directive of transactions both voluntary and involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">948. Then [B], at &#8220;This differs,&#8221; he shows the difference between this species and the preceding. He
treats this point under two headings. First [ B, 1] he sets forth his proposition, saying that the just thing
existing in transactions belongs to another species than distributive justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">949. Second [B, 2], at &#8220;What is just,&#8221; he presents the difference. First [2, a] he reviews something
relevant to distributive justice. Then [2, b], at &#8220;However, in transactions etc.,&#8221; he shows what pertains
to commutative justice. He says first that the justice mentioned before always directs the distribution of
common goods in conformity with proportionality, i.e., the geometrical which is observed in the equality
of proportion. This is clear because if wealth belonging to the city or to certain men must be distributed
to individuals, the distribution will be made in such a way that each may receive from the community in
that ratio according to which he contributed to the community. We suppose in business ventures that the
more a man invests in a company the greater is his return. As the just thing directing distributions
consists in this proportionality, so the opposite unjust thing consists in disregarding proportionality of
this kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">95o. At &#8220;However, in transactions&#8221; [2, b], he shows what pertains to commutative justice. He gives a
threefold consideration of this notion. First [b, i ] he explains a f act relative to commutative justice. Next
[b, ii], at &#8220;If one of two contestants etc.,&#8221; he clarifies this by an example. Third [b, iii], at &#8220;Therefore, that
which etc.,&#8221; he deduces some corollaries from the premises. He says first that the Just thing that exists
in transactions agrees somewhat with the just thing directing distributions in this-that the just thing is
equal, and the unjust thing, unequal. But they differ in the fact that the equal in commutative justice is
not observed according to that proportionality, viz., geometrical, which was observed in distributive
justice, but according to arithmetical proportionality which is observed according to equality of quantity,
and not according to equality of proportion as in geometry. By arithmetical proportionality six is a mean
between eight and four, because it is in excess of the one and exceeds the other by two. But there is not
the same proportion on the one side and the other, for six is to four in a ratio of three to two while eight
is to six in a ratio of four to three. On the contrary by geometrical proportionality the mean is exceeded
and exceeds according to the same proportion but not according to the same quantity. In this way six is
a mean between nine and four, since from both sides there is a three to two ratio. But there is not the
same quantity, for nine exceeds six by three and six exceeds four by two.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">951. Therefore, in commutative justice the equal is observed according to arithmetic proportion. This is
clear from the fact that here the different relations of persons are not considered. It does not matter,
insofar as commutative justice is concerned, whether a good man has stolen or robbed an evil man of his
property or an evil man has done it to a good citizen. Likewise, it does not matter whether a good or evil
man commits adultery. The law takes into account only the nature of the injury, so that the man who has
done more damage, whatever his condition, must make more restitution. So it is evident that if one of two
contestants does an injustice and the other suffers an injustice, one injures and the other is injured, the
law treats them as equals, however much they may be unequal. Hence a judge, who is a dispenser of the
law, attempts to reduce that injustice-by which one man injures another and which has a certain
inequality-to an equality by establishing an equality in the very quantity of things and not according to
the relation of different persons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">952. Next [b, ii], at &#8220;If one of two contestants,&#8221; he clarifies what he had said, by an example. First [ii,
x] he presents the example; and then [ii, y], at &#8220;In the interest of plain talk etc.,&#8221; he resolves a doubt. First
he sets forth the example of a personal injury about which too little is clear. He says that if one of two
contestants receives a wound and the other inflicts it, or even if one commits murder and the other is
murdered, this division of action and passion brings about inequality because the assailant and the
murderer have more of what is esteemed good, inasmuch as they have done their own will and so seem
as it were to have gained. But the man who is wounded or murdered has more of evil insofar as he is
deprived against his will of well-being or life, and so he seems as it were to have suffered loss. The judge
tries to equalize this by subtracting from the gain and allotting compensation for the loss, inasmuch as
he takes away something from the assailant and the murderer contrary to their will and bestows it to the
gain or honor of the person wounded or murdered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">953. Then [ii, y], at &#8220;In the interest of plain talk,&#8221; he resolves a certain doubt that could arise from the
words &#8220;gain and loss.&#8221; He says that, in the interest of plain talk, the terms &#8220;gain and loss&#8221; are used in
matters where a person has more or less. Strictly these words refer to what we possess, and sometimes
they do not seem suitable, for example, in the case of personal injuries (as when one person receives a
blow and another inflicts it, some injury results) because a fixed measure of action and passion cannot
be taken in injuries of this kind so that what is more can be called gain and what is less, loss. But when
passion is measured, i.e., according to the measure of justice, then what is more is called gain and what
is less, loss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">954. At &#8220;Therefore, that which is just&#8221; [b, iii], he deduces two conclusions: the first [iii, x] on the part
of the just thing itself; and the second [iii, y], at &#8220;For this reason etc.,&#8221; on the part of the judge. He says
first that the just thing in transactions is a kind of equal that is a mean between more and less in such a
way that gain is taken as more and loss as less. However, they are understood in different ways in good
and evil, for to have more of good and less of evil belongs to the nature of gain. But the contrary pertains
tp the idea of loss. Between these two, gain and loss, stands a mean, that equal which we cail the just
thing. Consequently that just thing, which gives directions in transactions, is a mean between gain and
loss as both these terms are commonly understood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">955. Next [iii, y], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he draws a conclusion on the part of the judge of whom it was said
(952) that he tries to bring about an equality. Aristotle affirms that because the just thing is a mean
between gain and loss, it follows that when men are in doubt about the mean they have recourse to a
judge. A judge ought to be, as it were, living justice, so that his soul is entirely possessed by justice. But
the people who go to a judge seem to be seeking a mediator between parties who quarrel. Consequently,
judges are called intermediaries or mediators as if they may attain the intermediate or the mean, and lead
the way to what is just. So then it is evident that what is just, the subject of our discussion, is a certain
mean because the judge, who determines this just thing, is the middle inasmuch as he proposes what is
equal between the parties. But the equal is the mean or middle between more and less, as we have pointed
out (310, 933).</span></p>

it b by two. But if what was taken away was not added to the other, the other would exceed the half by
one. Therefore, the half taken is equal to one, and the half from which subtraction was made is equal to
one. From this we know both what must be taken from the person with too much, and what must be added
to the one with too little. The amount exceeding the mean must be awarded to the man with too little and
taken from the one with too much.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The names, gain and loss, have their origin in voluntary transactions. When a man owns more than he
did own he is said to have profit, but when less he is said to have loss, as in buying, selling, and other
exchanges permitted by law. However, when men have neither more nor less but the same after their
transactions they are said to have what is theirs, neither gaining profit nor suffering loss. Therefore,
justice is a mean between some kind of gain and loss arising in involuntary transactions; it is having an
equal amount of these both before and after the transaction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">956. After the philosopher has shown the difference between the mean of justice regulating transactions
and the mean of justice regulating distributions, now [C] he shows how the mean of that justice which
regulates transactions is understood. He handles this point in a twofold fashion. First [ C, 1] he discloses
his proposition. Then [C, 2], at &#8220;The names etc.,&#8221; he explains the origin of the names, gain and loss,
which he has used. He discusses the initial point from two aspects. First [1, a] he shows how we may
discover the mean of commutative justice in these things; next [1, b], at &#8220;This is true etc.,&#8221; how we may
discover it in the matter of the different arts. He treats the first point in two ways. First [a, ij he introduces
an example to show how the mean is applied in commutative justice. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;If there are etc.,&#8221;
he clarifies what he has said. In regard to the initial point he first [i, x] gives the example to explain his
proposition. Then [i, y], at &#8220;Therefore, this mean etc.,&#8221; he shows the appropriateness of the example from
the very manner of speaking.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">957. Aristotle says that this is the way a judge expresses a reduction to equality. If he wishes to reduce
to equality a line divided into unequal parts, he takes away from the larger part that portion by which it
exceeds the half of the whole line and adds it to the smaller part so that the half of the whole line is a
certain <i>dicha</i>, i.e., rule or measure for reducing unequal portions to an equality. So when a whole thing
belonging to two men is divided by such a <i>dicha</i> or measure, then it is said that each one has what is his
inasmuch as he receives equality&#8212;which is the mean between more and less&#8212;according to arithmetic
proportionality. The reason is that the mean of justice is exceeded by the one with more to the extent that
it exceeds the person with less-this pertains to arithmetic proportionality, as we pointed out before
(944,950).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">958. Then [i, y], at &#8220;Therefore, this mean,&#8221; he shows that the preceding example is suitable according
to Greek usage. He says that since the mean of this justice is a certain <i>dicha</i>, hence it is that the just thing
is called <i>dicheon</i> by the Greeks, as if a person wanting to vary the names should say that dicheon is the
just thing, <i>dichastes</i> the just man, and <i>dichaste</i> justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">959. Next [a, ii], at &#8220;If there aretwo equals,&#8221; he makes clear what he has said, viz., that it is necessary to
take from one with more in the amount exceeding the mean and to give to one with less. First [ii, x] he
explains his statement; and then [ii, y], at &#8220;Let us take etc.,&#8221; he expresses it by terminals. He says first,
let us take two equal lines both of which are two measures long, for example, two palms breadth or two
feet; let us subtract half from one line and add it to the other. Obviously, the line receiving the addition
exceeds the other by two units because the line from which the subtraction was made has only one unit
remaining, and the line to which the addition has been made has three units. But if the section subtracted
from one line is not added to the other, there will be an excess of only one unit. By that line, to which
nothing is added or from which nothing is subtracted, we understand the mean of justice, having as it
does neither more nor less than what belongs to it. By the line to which addition has been made we
understand the person who has too much. By the line from which subtraction has been made we
understand the person who has too little.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">960. In this way then it is evident that the man who has too much exceeds the mean by one unit, which
has been added to it over and above, but the mean exceeds by one-which has been taken from it-that from
which subtraction has been made. Therefore, we will know by this mean what we ought to take from him
who has more and give to him who has less. Besides, we will know that we ought to take from the
greater, i.e., from him who has more, the amount by which he exceeds the mean because we ought to give
him who has less in the amount the mean exceeds him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">961. At &#8220;Let us take&#8221; [ii, y] he sets forth in figure what was said. Let us take three equal lines and mark
the terminations of one AA, of another BB, of the third GG. Then let BB remain undivided, but divide
AA in half at the point E, and divide GG in half at the point 3. Next, take away from line AA a section
AE, add it to the line GG and call the addition GD. It is clear then that ihe whole line DG exceeds the
line A E by two units, viz., by that which is GG and by that which is GD, but it exceeds the line BB by
one unit only, viz., GD. Therefore, obviously, that which is longest exceeds the mean by one unit and the
shortest by two units after the manner of arithmetic proportionality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">E</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">A&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;A</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">962. Then [1, b], at &#8220;This is true,&#8221; he shows that what has been said must be observed in transactions
having to do with the different arts. The arts would be destroyed if the craftsman, who works at some
handicraft, would not be supported, i.e., would not receive for his workmanship according to the quantity
and quality of what he produced. For that reason the work of one craftsman must be commensurate with
the work of another to the extent that there is a just transaction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">963. Next [C, 2], at &#8220;The names,&#8221; he explains the origin of the names, gain and loss, saying that they
come from voluntary transactions in which names of this kind were first used. When a man owned more
than he previously had owned, he was said to have gained; but when less, he was said to have suffered
loss, as in buying, selling and in all other transactions which are permitted by law. However, when men
have neither more nor less than they had in the beginning, but bring back in equal quantity the same as
they had taken by their transactions, then they are said to have what belongs to them, neither gaining nor
losing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">964. He draws the final inference that he had principally intended. It is evident from the premises that
the justice we are now discussing is a mean between gain and loss, that justice is simply the possession
of an equal amount before and after a transaction even an involuntary one, as we see in the person who,
when constrained by a judge, restores to another what he had in excess.</span></p>

equality according to proportionality be found and then reciprocation be made, it will be as we have said.

be equated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">965. After the Philosopher has shown how the mean should be understood in both kinds of justice, now
he rejects a false opinion about the understanding of the mean of justice. He discusses this point under
three headings. First [I] he states the erroneous opinion. Next [II], at &#8220;However, reciprocation etc.,&#8221; he
rejects it. Third [III], at &#8220;But in dealings etc.,&#8221; he shows where and how the truth may be found. He says
first it seems to some that, generally speaking, justice is nothing other than reciprocation, viz., that a man
should suffer according to what he has done. This was the opinion of the Pythagoreans who decided that
justice is the same as reciprocation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">966. Then [II], at &#8220;However, reciprocation,&#8221; he rejects this opinion on two accounts; and first [II, A] in
regard to distributive justice, he says that reciprocation does not correspond to what is just distributively.
The reason for this is evident. The just thing in distributions is not judged according to what one of two,
who must be equated by justice, does against the other or suffers from the other. This is necessary for
the nature of reciprocation; but in distribution a share of the common goods is given to each by an
equality of proportion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">967. Next [II, B], at &#8220;Likewise, it is not,&#8221; he rejects the preceding error in the case of commutative
justice. First [II, B, I] he proposes what he intends to do with commutative justice. He says that
reciprocation does not coincide with all the processes in justice that regulate transactions, although the
philosophers who expressed the foregoing opinion meant that in transactions justice is the same as
reciprocation. This is clear from the fact that a legislator named Rhadamantus maintained that this justice
is of such a nature that if a man suffers those very things he inflicted on others, justice is vindicated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">968. Then [II, B, 2], at &#8220;Such justice,&#8221; he rejects this view for two reasons. In regard to the first [2, a] he
says that in many situations vengeance of this kind is found to be at variance with true justice, for
instance, if a ruler strikes a private person justice does not require that the ruler be struck. But if a person
strikes a ruler it is necessary that such a person not only be struck but be more gravely punished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">969. This seems to contradict what the Philosopher said before (951) that in commutative justice the
different rank of persons is not taken into account&#8212;all being equal under the law. But it should be noted
what the Philosopher had said was this: in commutative justice the law considers only the nature of the
damage. It is clear that when damage is considered in the taking of an external thing&#8212;money for
instance&#8212;the amount of damage does not vary according to a person&#8217;s rank. Still when the injury is
personal, the extent of the injury necessarily changes according to the rank of the person. Obviously,
worse damage is done when someone strikes a ruler, by reason of the fact that injury is done not only to
the person of the ruler but also the whole commonweal. Therefore, reciprocation simply taken is not
suitable for justice in matters of this kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">970. At &#8220;Moreover, it makes&#8221; [2, b] he gives the second reason. He says in the matter of imposing
punishment, it makes a great deal of difference whether the offender inflicted the injury voluntarily or
involuntarily, i.e., because of ignorance or violence or fear. The man who sinned voluntarily ought to be
punished more severely than the man who sinned involuntarily, for two reasons. First, because in regard
to punishments, consideration is given to the restoration of equality of justice not only by a person
restoring what he has taken but also by his being punished for the crime. For this reason some are
punished by law even for sins causing no injury or damage to another. Likewise a thief is compelled not
only to restore what he took&#8212;by which the equality of justice is reestablished&#8212;but beyond that he is
punished for the offense perpetrated. But the offense is increased or diminished by the fact that a man
sins voluntarily or involuntarily. Hence the voluntary offender is punished more severely than the
involuntary offender. The second reason is that the injury of the deliberate transgressor is greater, for
internal contempt is added to the external damage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">971. Next [III], at &#8220;But in dealings,&#8221; he explains in what matter and manner the statement is true that
reciprocation is justice. He discusses this point from three aspects. First [III, A] he shows that there must
be reciprocation in exchanges according to proportionality. Then [III, B], at &#8220;A conjunction by means
etc.,&#8221; he explains the form of this proportionality. Last [Lect. 9; C], at &#8220;Therefore all etc.&#8221; (B. 1133 a 18),
he shows how such a form can be observed. On the initial point he does two&#8217; things. First [III, A, 1] he
states his intention. Next [III, A, 2], at &#8220;By reason of proportional etc.,&#8221; he proves his statement. He says
that in dealings of exchange it is true that justice is of such a nature that it includes reciprocation not
according to equality but according to proportionality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">972. It seems this is contrary to what was said before (950), that in commutative justice the mean is taken
not according to geometrical proportionality, which consists in an equality of proportion, but according
to arithmetic proportionality, which consists in a quantitative equality. We must say that, in regard to
commutative justice there should always be an equality of thing to thing, not, however, of action and
passion, which implies corresponding requital. But in this, proportionality must be employed in order to
bring about an equality of things because the work of one craftsman is of more value than the work of
another, e.g., the building of a house than the production of a penknife. Hence, if the builder exchanged
his work for the work of the cutler, there would not be equality of thing, given and taken, i.e., of house
and penknife.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">973. Then [III, A, 2], at &#8220;By reason of proportional,&#8221; he proves his statement, saying that justice in
exchanges includes reciprocation according to proportionality. This can be shown by the fact that the
citizens live together amicably because they have proportionate kindliness towards one another.
Accordingly, if one does something for another, the other is anxious to do something in proportion in
return. Obviously, all citizens desire that reciprocation be done to them proportionately. By reason of this
all men can live together because they do for one another what they themselves seek. Therefore, they
never seek in regard to evil that corresponding requital be done to them proportionately. But if they do
not seek this in regard to evil, for example, when one man does not take vengeance on another who
injures him, a kind of servility seems to result. Indeed it is servile when a man cannot gain by his own
activity something that he does not desire in an evil way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">974. We may even say that men not only do not desire that corresponding requital, when unjust, be done
to the -m proportionately, but they do not desire that it be done when just. In this way if corresponding
requital is not done them in a proportionate way, proper retribution will not be effected. But men live
together because one makes a return to another for the favors he has received. So it is that virtuous men
promptly express gratitude to their benefactors as if it were a sacred duty to make them a return in this
way-repaying a favor is characteristic of gratitude. It is fitting that a man should be of service to one who
has done him a favor, i.e., bestowed a gratuitous kindness, and that he be not content to give only as
much as he received but that in return he begins to offer more than he got so that he himself may do a
favor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">975. Next [III, B], at &#8220;A conjunction by means,&#8221; he makes known the form of proportionality according
to which reciprocation ought to be made. First [III, B, 1] he gives an example in the shoemaker and the
builder; then [III, B, 2], at &#8220;This is to be observed etc.,&#8221; he shows that the same is found in other arts. He
says first that a conjunction by means of a diagonal shows how to make compensation or reciprocation
according to proportionality. To understand this draw A B G D, make two diagonals intersecting one
another, viz., AD and BD. Let A represent a builder, B a shoemaker, G a house that is the work of the
builder, and D a sandal that is the work of a shoemaker. It is necessary at times that the builder should
take from the shoemaker his product, a sandal. But the builder himself ought to give his product as a
recompense to the shoemaker.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">976. Therefore, if first an equality according to proportionality is found so that on one side a certain
number of sandals be fixed as equal to one house (for a builder incurs more expense in building one
house than a shoemaker in making one sandal), next, corresponding reciprocation is had so that the
builder may receive many sandals equal to one house and the shoemaker one house, there will be
recompense&#8212;as was said&#8212;made according to proportion by a diagonal conjunction.</span></p>
<table align=center><tr><td>BUILDER: A<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>HOUSE: G<td><img src="Square.jpg"><td>B: SHOEMAKER<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
D: SANDAL</table>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The reason is that a proportionate number of sandals are given to the builder, and the house to the
shoemaker. But if compensation is not made in this way, there will not be an equality of things
exchanged&#8212;and so men will not be able to live together&#8212;since nothing hinders the work of one
craftsman from being worth more than the work of another, a house than a sandal. For this reason these
things must be equated one with the other according to the previously mentioned proportionality, so that
a just exchange may take place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">977. Then [III, B, 2], at &#8220;This is to be observed,&#8221; he shows that the same thing is found in the other arts.
He affirms that what was said (975, 976) about the builder and the shoemaker must be observed also in
the other arts, so that reciprocation and exchange may take place according to diagonal proportionality.
Indeed the arts would be destroyed if a workman did not receive according to the quantity and quality
of what he produced&#8212;a thing that must be discovered in the way indicated. It is not common for men
practicing one art, for example, two doctors, to communicate their work with one another, but very often
men practicing different arts do, for instance, a doctor and a farmer, both entirely different and unequal.
These must be equated in the preceding way.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, it is reasonable to measure all things by one norm, as has been pointed out previously. This
norm in reality is demand which connects all things. If men were not in need there would be no exchange,
or if they did not have a similar demand, exchange would not be the same. Money originated by
agreement on account of necessary exchange. Hence money (<i>numisma</i>) has the name because it is a norm

then must be made between these goods.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">978. After the Philosopher has proposed the form of proportionality, with which reciprocation is
identified in exchange, he now shows [III, C] in what way this form of proportionality can be observed.
First [C, 1] he explains his intention. Then [C, 2], at &#8220;That human demand etc.,&#8221; he clarifies the previous
statements. He discusses the initial point in a twofold manner. First [1, a] he shows that to preserve the
form of proportionality perfectly it is necessary to make everything commensurate. Next [1, b), at &#8220;When
things have been etc.,&#8221; lie explains how a just reciprocation in exchanges may be effected by a
commensuration of this kind. He treats the first point under three aspects. Initially [1, a, i] he explains
the nature of that which measures all things, Then [1, a, ii], at &#8220;A certain number etc.,&#8221; he shows how
such a commensuration is established in exchanges. Last [ 1, a, iii ], at &#8220;Therefore, it is etc.,&#8221; he indicates
the nature of this commensuration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">979. He says first, in order that the products of the different workmen be equated and thus become
possible to exchange, it is necessary that all things capable of exchange should be comparable in some
way with one another so that it can be known which of them has greater value and which less. It was for
this purpose that money or currency was invented, to measure the price of such things. In this way
currency becomes a medium inasmuch as it measures everything, both excess and defect, to the extent
that one thing exceeds another, as was pointed out before (955, 959-960). It is a mean of justice&#8212;as if
someone should call it a measure of excess and defect.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">98o. Next [1, a, ii], at &#8216;W certain number,&#8221; he shows how exchange takes place according to the
preceding commensuration. Although a house is worth more than a sandal, nevertheless, a number of
sandals are equal in value to one house or the food required for one man during a long period. In order
then to have just exchange, as many sandals must be exchanged for one house or for the food required
for one man as the builder or the farmer exceeds the shoemaker in his labor and costs. If this is not
observed, there will be no exchange of things and men will not share their goods with one another. But
what has been said, that a number of sandals are exchanged for one house, is not possible unless the
sandals are equated with the house in some way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">981. At &#8220;Therefore, it is&#8221; [i, a, iii] he indicates the nature of this commensuration made by means of
money. He states that for this reason it is possible to equate things because all things can be measured
by some one standard, as was pointed out (957). But this one standard which truly measures all things
is demand. This includes all commutable things inasmuch as everything has a reference to human need.
Articles are not valued according to the dignity of their nature, otherwise a mouse, an animal endowed
with sense, should be of greater value than a pearl, a thing without life. But they are priced according as
man stands in need of them for his own use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">982. An indication of this is that if man were not in need there would be no exchange, or if they did not
have a similar need, i.e., of these things, exchange would not be the same because men would not
exchange what they have for something they did not need. That demand really measures everything is
evident from the fact that money originated by arrangement or a kind of agreement among men on
account of the necessity of exchange, i.e., exchange of necessary goods. There is an agreement among
men that what a person needs will be given him in exchange for currency. Hence currency is called
money (<i>numisma</i>)&#8212;nomos means law&#8212;since currency is not a measure by nature but by law (<i>nomos</i>).
It is in our power to change currencies and make them useless.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">983. Then [i, b], at &#8220;When things have been,&#8221; he shows how just reciprocation takes place in exchanges
according to the preceding commensuration. First [i, b, i] he explains his proposition; and then [i, b, ii],
at &#8220;Let A represent etc.,&#8221; puts it in a diagram. He says first that the norm measuring all things by need
according to nature and by currency according to human convention will then become reciprocation when
everything will be equated in the way just mentioned. This is done in such a manner that as the farmer
(whose work is raising food for men) excels the shoemaker (whose work is making sandals), in the same
proportion the work of the shoemaker exceeds in number the work of the farmer, so that many sandals
are exchanged for one bushel of wheat. Thus when exchange of things takes place, the articles to be
exchanged ought to be arranged in a proportional figure with diagonals, as was stated previously (957).
If this was not done, one extreme would have both excesses; if a farmer gave a bushel of wheat for a
sandal, he would have a surplus of labor in his product and would have also an excess of loss because
he would be giving more than he would receive. But when all have what is theirs, they are in this way
equal and do business with one another because the equality previously mentioned is possible for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">984. Next [1, b, ii], at &#8220;Let A represent,&#8221; he puts in a diagram what has been said about the proportional
figure. Take then (as in the previous example) a square A, B, G, D, and two diagonals AD and BG
intersecting one another. Let A represent the farmer and G the food, his product, e.g., a bushel of wheat.
Let B represent the shoemaker and D his equated product, i.e., as many sandals as have the value of a
bushel of wheat. There will then be a just reciprocation if A be joined with D and B with G. If there is
not such a compensation men will not share their goods with one another.</span></p>

D: SANDAL</table>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">985. At &#8220;That human demand&#8221; [C, 2] he explains more fully what has already been mentioned. First [2,
a] he shows how things are made commensurate; and next [2, b], at &#8220;Everything then,&#8221; how the things
made commensurate may be exchanged. He discusses the first point from two aspects. First [2, a, i] he
shows that necessity is a measure according to reality; and then [2, a, ii], at &#8220;For future exchanges etc.,&#8221;
how currency is a measure according to the provision of law. He says first the statement (981-982) that
human need contains everything as a certain measure is explained in this way. When men are so situated
among themselves that either both, or at least one, do not need a thing possessed by the other, they do
not engage in mutual exchange. But exchange does take place when a man owning grain is in need of
wine which his neighbor has, and thus gives the grain for the wine, so that a quantity of grain is allotted
according to the value of the wine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">986. Then [2, a, ii], at &#8220;For future exchanges,&#8221; he shows clearly how currency serves as a measure. On
this point we must consider that if men always needed immediately the goods they have among
themselves, they would have no need of any exchange except of thing for thing, e.g., wine for grain. But
sometimes one man (who has a surplus of wine at present) does not need the grain that another man has
(who is in need of wine), but perhaps later he will need the grain or some other product. In this way then
for the necessity of future exchange, money or currency is, as it were, a surety that if a man has no
present need but may want in the future, the thing he needs will be available when he presents the
currency.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">987. The particular virtue of currency must be that when a man presents it he immediately receives what
he needs. However, it is true that currency also suffers the same as other things, viz., that it does not
always obtain for a man what he wants because it cannot always be equal or of the same value.
Nevertheless it ought to be so established that it retains the same value more permanently than other
things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">988. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Everything then,&#8221; he explains how, by the measure of currency, there is exchange
of things which are made commensurate in currency. He discusses this point from three aspects. First [2,
b, i] he shows in what manner there is exchange of goods that are measured in currency. Then [2, b, ii],
at &#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; he discloses under what aspect currency serves as a measure. Last, [2, b, iii], at &#8220;Let
A represent a house,&#8221; he puts in terminals what was said. He states first that, because currency as a
measure ascertaining quantity retains its value longer, all goods must be evaluated in currency. In this
way exchange of goods can take place and, consequently, association among men. Money equates
commutable goods, as a certain measure making them commensurate. He clarifies what has been said
by stating that association is not possible if there is no exchange. But exchange is impossible unless an
equality is established in goods, which in turn cannot exist without commensuration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">989. Then [2, b, ii], at &#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; he shows in what way currency is used as a measure. He says
that it is impossible that things so greatly different be made commensurate according to reality, i.e.,
according to the peculiar nature of the things themselves. But they can be sufficiently contained under
one measure by comparison with the needs of men. Hence there must be some one criterion that measures
all things of this kind and is not a measure by reason of nature but because so fixed by men. Therefore,
this is called money owing to the fact that it makes all things commensurate insofar as they are measured
by money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">990. At &#8220;Let A represent a house&#8221; 12, b, iii] he explains in terminals what has been said, stating: let A
be a house worth five <i>minae</i>, B a bed worth one <i>mina</i>, and in this way the bed will be one fifth the value
of the house. Hence it is obvious how many beds are equal in value to one house, viz., five. Likewise it
is obvious that barter took place before there was currency, since five beds have been exchanged for one
house. But it makes no difference whether five or the value of five beds are given.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">991. He concludes saying that we have now discussed the nature of what is just and what is unjust.</span></p>

equally according to proportion. Likewise, he observes a rule regarding one man in relation to another.
On the other hand injustice is a habit operative of what is unjust. This takes place by excess and defect
of useful or hurtful things contrary to what is proportional. Hence injustice is called excess and defect
because it brings about excess and defect, the unjust man assigning himself an excess of what is simply
useful and a deficiency of what is harmful. In a similar way he attributes both an excess and a deficiency
to others. But this too is contrary to what is proportional in whatever way it takes place.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We have then discussed justice and injustice, and the nature of both. Likewise we have treated in a
general way what is just and unjust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">992. After the Philosopher has shown how the just thing is a mean, now he shows how justice is a mean.
On this point he does three things. First [1] he states his intention. Then [2], at &#8220;Justice is also etc.,&#8221; he
proves his statement. Finally [3], at &#8220;We have then discussed etc.,&#8221; he recapitulates what has been said.
Since habits are known by acts, he treats two aspects of the initial point. First [1, a] he proposes that the
operation of justice is a mean; and second [1, b], at &#8220;But justice etc.,&#8221; how justice itself is a mean. He
says first that, from previous considerations (978-991), it is evident that a just operation, that is, an
operation of justice, is a mean between doing what is unjust and suffering what is unjust. The first is to
have more than is due to oneself, i.e., to do an unjust action; but the other, viz., to suffer an unjust thing,
is to have too little by reason of the fact that a person has been deprived of what is due him. The act of
justice is to do what is equal, i.e., the mean between too much and too little. Obviously then it follows
from the premises that a just action is a mean between doing what is unjust and suffering what is unjust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">993. Then [i, b], at &#8220;But justice,&#8221; he explains how justice is a mean, saying that justice is not a mean in
the same way as the other moral virtues. Their mean lies between two vices; liberality is a mean between
parsimony and extravagance. But justice is not a mean between two vices. However, it can be called a
mean by reason of its effect inasmuch as it constitutes a mean, since its act is a just operation which is
a mean between doing what is unjust and bearing the unjust. The first of these, active injustice pertains
to a vice of injustice which is a habit of extremes inasmuch as it takes for itself too many goods and too
few evils. But the other, i.e., the toleration of the injustice is not a vice, but a suffering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">994. Next [2], at &#8220;Justice is also,&#8221; he proves what was said, viz., that justice is not a middle course
between two vices, as is the case with other moral virtues. He treats this point in a twofold manner. First
[2, a] he takes up the nature of justice; then [2, b], at &#8220;One injustice etc.,&#8221; he adds some remarks to bring
his subject to a conclusion. He discusses the first point from two aspects. Initially [a, i] he states what
justice is; and next [a, ii] at &#8220;He does not act etc.,&#8221; what in justice is. He says first that justice is a habit
by which the just man does the just thing&#8212;and this by deliberate choice because, as was previously
pointed out in the second book (305, 308, 382), a moral virtue is a habit of correct choice. Doing the just
thing can be referred to justice directing exchanges, in which the nature of justice is more apparent by
reason of the equality of the thing. Hence he adds an &#8220;and to distribute&#8221; in order to include also
distributive justice, which consists in the equality of proportion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">995. A man can do the just thing by choice, both in exchanges and in distributions, in two ways. In one
way he does this between himself and another, and touching this point Aristotle says &#8220;both to himself
in relation to his neighbor.&#8221; In the second way a man does this between two others&#8212;this pertains to a
judge or an-arbiter&#8212;and so the Philosopher adds &#8220;and to one man in relation to another.&#8221; He explains,
by exclusion of the contrary, how the just man does a just deed. He adds that the just man does not so
act that in regard to desirable things (for example, riches and honors) he bestows more on himself and
less on his neighbor, and in regard to harmful things (i.e., burdensome and painful), on the contrary, more
on his neighbor than himself; but he makes an equal distribution according to proportion&#8212;a thing he
observes not only between himself and another but also between two others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">996. At &#8220;He does not act&#8221; [a, ii] he presents the nature of injustice. He affirms that on the contrary
injustice is a habit which does by choice what is unjust. This happens by excess or defect of useful or
harmful things which the just man accepts according to due proportion. Hence, as justice is called a mean
because it produces a mean, so also injustice is called excess and defect because it produces excess and
defect in such a way that the unjust man bestows on himself an excess of things which are simply useful
but a deficiency of things which are harmful. In a similar way he attributes to others both excess and
defect, however not of the same things, but a defect of the useful and an excess of the harmful.
Nevertheless, it has not been determined in what way injustice may depart from the proper proportion,
i.e., how much more or how much less it may accept than is due. But injustice does this, howsoever it
may happen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">997. Next [2, b], at &#8220;One injustice,&#8221; he adds some remarks required to conclude the subject. He says there
is a twofold injustice: one consists in a lack of beneficial things, and indicates an excess of onerous
things-which amounts to the same. This is to suffer what is unjust. The other injustice is to have an
excess of beneficial things and a lack of onerous things-and this is to do an injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">998. From what has been said we can come to three conclusions. To do an unjust act pertains to injustice.
However, to have a lack of benefits or an excess of burdens is not to do what is unjust but to suffer what
is unjust. Therefore this does not pertain to the vice of injustice. But justice is a mean between having
too much and too little, as was pointed out before (992, 993). Consequently, injustice is not a mean
between two vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">999. Then [3], at &#8220;We have then discussed,&#8221; he concludes by recapitulating what has been said. He
affirms that we have discussed justice and injustice and the nature of both. Likewise we have treated
what is just and what is unjust in a general way, for he will determine afterwards (1000-1008) certain
particular modes of what is just and unjust.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Since someone doing an unjust act may not be unjust himself, we will investigate the nature of the unjust
actions that show the doer&#8212;for example, a thief or an adulterer or a robber&#8212;already unjust according
to the injustice proper to each case. Or does not this make any difference? If a man having sexual
intercourse with a woman knows with whom he sins and acts not by choice but by passion, he does an
unjust act but is not unjust. So neither is a man a thief although he steals, nor an adulterer although he
commits adultery. The same is true in other cases.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1000. After the Philosopher has treated justice and the unjust thing in themselves together with their
opposites, now he treats them in comparison with their subject, showing how a man in doing an unjust
action becomes unjust. He handles this point under two headings. First [I] he determines the truth. Then
[Lect. 14, [II], at &#8220;Someone may raise etc.&#8221; (B. 1136 a 10), he raises some doubts about matters
previously settled. He discusses the initial point from three aspects. First [A] he asks a question. Next
[B], at &#8220;We must not forget etc.,&#8221; he interposes some subjects necessary for a solution of the question.
Finally [Lect. 13, C], at &#8220;Since just and unjust etc.&#8221; (B. 1135 a 15), he answers the question. He treats
the first point in a twofold manner. First [A, A&#8217;] he presents the question. Then [A, B&#8217;], at &#8220;We have
previously etc.,&#8221; he shows that another question was settled previously. He says first that a person who
does an unjust action still may not be unjust. Therefore, we must inquire into the characteristics of
injustice, i.e., the actions of unjust men must be of such a type that the man who does unjust deeds is
already unjust in that particular species of injustice, for example, theft or adultery or robbery. Or, passing
over the cases just mentioned, can it be said that for a man to be unjust it makes no difference in what
actions he may act unjustly?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1001. For this reason we ask with what kind of injustice it occurs, because the doing of an unjust action
takes place in many ways. A man may have sexual intercourse with a woman, the wife of another, and
not be ignorant who the person is (ignorance could cause an involuntary) but know with whom he is
having intercourse, and still not perform the act by deliberate choice but by passion. Such a man does
an unjust act although he does not seem to be unjust because he does not act by deliberate choice. So also
we can say in a particular case that a man is not a thief although he has stolen, since he did not commit
theft by deliberate choice. In a similar way a man is not an adulterer although he has committed adultery.
The same idea is found in other matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1002. Then [A, B&#8217;], at &#8220;We have previously,&#8221; he shows that a particular doubt has already been solved,
viz., in what way reciprocation is related to justice&#8212;a point we discussed previously (971-972).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1003. Next [B], at &#8220;We must not forget,&#8221; he interposes some subjects that are necessary for the solution
of the proposed question: first [B, A&#8217;] what is justice in the absolute sense; and second [Lect. 12; B, B&#8217;]
at &#8220;There is a difference etc.&#8221; (B.1135 a 9), what is unjust action. He handles the initial point in a twofold
fashion. First [A&#8217;, 1] he states his intention. Then [A&#8217;, 2] at &#8220;The latter consists etc.,&#8221; he carries out his
intention. He says first that for a clear understanding of the question (in which we seek by what actions
a man who does a just or an unjust act is said to be just or unjust) we must not forget the fact that the
justice sought is justice in the absolute sense which is political justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1004. Then [A&#8217;, 2], at &#8220;The latter consists&#8217; &#8220; he carries out his intention. First [2, a] he shows what
political justice is. Then [Lect. XII; 2, b], at &#8220;One kind of political justice etc.&#8221; (B. 1134 b 18), he divides
it. He treats the initial point under two aspects. First [a, i] he proposes what he intends, viz., what
political justice is Next [a, ii], at &#8220;For justice exists etc.,&#8217;; he explains his intention. He discusses the first
point under two headings. Initially [i, x] he shows what political justice is. Second [i, y], at &#8220;Therefore,
among those persons etc.,&#8221; he concludes that there are other kinds of justice differing from this. He says
first that political justice consists in a community of life that is ordered to a self-sufficiency of the things
pertaining to human living. And the state-community should be such that everything sufficient for the
needs of human life is found in it. This justice is found in free men, not slaves, because masters exercise
towards slaves not political justice but the justice of dominion, of which more later (1006-1012).
However, political justice is encountered with persons who are equal, i.e., one of whom is not subject
to the other in the natural or political order, as a son to a father between whom there is no question of
political justice but of paternal right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1005. This political justice is either according to proportionality, i.e., proportional equality pertaining
to distributive justice, or numerical equality, i.e., the equality of numerical quantity pertaining to
commutative justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1006. Next [i, y], at &#8220;Therefore, among those persons,&#8221; he concludes there are other kinds of justice
differing from that just mentioned. He states that-since political justice exists among the free and
equal&#8212;in people who do not have this (that they are free and equal) there is not found political justice,
which is unqualified justice, but a peculiar justice, viz., of a master or father, which is a qualified justice
inasmuch as it has some likeness to political justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1007. At &#8220;For justice exists&#8221; [a, ii], he clarifies his statement: first [ii, x] in regard to political justice,
which is unqualified justice; second [ii, y] in regard to justice of a master or a father, which is qualified
justice, at &#8220;However, the justice of a master etc.&#8221; First [x, aa] he clarifies his statement, viz., that political
justice is in free and equal persons. Next [x, bb], at &#8220;For this reason we do not etc.,&#8221; he draws some
corollaries from the premises. He says first-as has been pointed out (1004).that political justice is in the
free and equal because, being determined by law, it necessarily is found in those for whom the law is
enacted. But law is enacted principally not for slaves who are restrained by masters nor for children who
are restrained by fathers but for the free and equal. That political justice exists in men of this kind, for
whom law is enacted, is obvious from this that justice and injustice exist in them. Now, law extends to
persons in whom there can be injustice. This is clear from the fact that punishment, which is fixed by
law, is nothing other than a judgment about what is just and unjust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1008. From this statement&#8212;the law exists for those between whom justice exists&#8212;it follows that it is
for those between whom there is unjust action and for those between whom there is Just action. The
reason is that in whomsoever there is injustice, in these the performance of an unjust act is found but not
the reverse. It was pointed out in the second book (252-253) that the doing of a virtuous action may take
place without virtue, and likewise the doing of vicious actions without the habit of vice. An unjust act
arises from the fact that a person should attribute to himself too many of those things which are
absolutely and of themselves good, like riches and too few of those things which are simply and of
themselves evil, as the opposite of these.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1009. Next [x, bb], at &#8220;For this reason we do not permit,&#8221; he draws three corollaries from the premises.
First [bb, a&#8217;] he says that because injustice consists in this that a man attributes to himself too many of
the benefits and too few of the burdens, it follows that in good government of the multitude we do not
permit that men should rule, that is, according to whim and human passion but that the law, which is a
dictate of reason, should rule man, or that man who acts according to reason should rule. The explanation
is that if a prince follows human passions he will do this for himself; he will take more of the good things
and less of the burdensome and so become a tyrant, although this is contrary to the concept of a prince.
A prince was given the office to observe justice, and consequently equality, which he passes over when
he usurps for himself too many beneficial and too few onerous things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1010. He gives the second corollary [bb, b&#8217;] at &#8220;Since a prince.&#8221; He affirms that since a prince&#8212;if he is
just&#8212;attributes no more of the good things to himself than to others (unless perhaps according to a
proper ratio of distributive justice), it follows that he does not labor for the advantage of himself but of
others. Because of this it was said before (909) that legal justice, by which the prince rules the multitude
of the people, is the good of another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1011. He presents the third corollary at &#8220;Consequently a reward&#8221; [bb, c]. It is clear that everyone should
reward the man who labors for him. Therefore, since the prince labors for the multitude, a reward should
be given by the multitude, namely, honor and glory, which are the greatest goods that can be offered by
men. But if there are some princes who are not satisfied with these for a reward but seek wealth, they are
unjust and tyrannical. Over and above this reward proffered by man, good princes look for a reward from
God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1012. Then [ii, y], at &#8220;However, the justice of a master,&#8221; he explains what was indicated previously about
the fact that this is not justice in the absolute sense but by similitude. First [y, aa] (he explains) in regard
to the justice of a master and of a father; and second [y, bb], at &#8220;Hence justice concerns etc.,&#8221; in regard
to justice which belongs to a husband in relation to a wife. On the prior point he does three things. First
[aa, a&#8217;] he proposes what he intends, saying that the justice of a master, i.e., of a lord over a slave, and
paternal justice, i.e., of a father over a son, are not the same as political justice but have some likeness
to it according as it has a relation to another in a way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1013. Second [aa, b&#8217;], at &#8220;Toward one&#8217;s own things,&#8221; he explains what was pointed out regarding this
that the justice of a master or of a father is not justice without qualification. It is evident that injustice
cannot exist in an unqualified way for a man in regard to the things belonging to him, and neither can
justice, because both have a relation to another. But the slave belongs to the master as a chattel, and a
son is&#8212;so to speak&#8212;a part of the father until he is a certain age or mature and separated from the father
by emancipation. That there is no injustice toward oneself is clear from the fact that no one chooses to
injure himself. Hence it is obvious that absolutely speaking there is no justice or injustice towards a son
or a slave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1014. Third [aa, c&#8217;], at &#8220;Nor is political justice,&#8221; he explains that even if the justice of a master and of
a father would be justice without qualification, it would not be political justice because political justice
is according to the law and in those for whom the law is designed by its nature. Such are those persons
who have equality in regard to ruling and being ruled; but of these one is subject to another, e.g., a slave
to a master and a son to a father. Hence political justice does not exist in these matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1015. Then [y, bb], at &#8220;Hence justice concerns,&#8221; he treats justice pertaining to a wife. He says that
because a wife is less subject to a husband than a slave to a master or a son to a father, therefore the
relation of a husband to a wife has more of the nature of justice than the relation of a father to his
children, and of a master to his chattels or slaves. The justice that belongs to a husband in regard to a
wife is domestic because the husband is the head of the home, as the prince of the state. However,
domestic justice is different from political, as the home is different from the state.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">ioi6. After the Philosopher has shown the nature of political justice, i.e., unqualified justice, now [b] he
makes a division of it. First [i] he divides political justice into species. Then [ii], at &#8220;Particular just and
legal things etc.,&#8221; he touches upon the division of this justice into individual parts. He discusses the first
point from three aspects. First [x] he proposes the division. Next [y], at &#8220;Natural justice etc.,&#8221; he explains
it. Last [z], at &#8220;Some people were etc.,&#8221; he rejects an error opposed to the division. He says first that there
is a twofold division of political justice: natural justice, and legal justice. This is the same as the division
that the jurists make, namely, that one kind of right is natural and the other positive. They call right the
very thing that Aristotle calls the just object. Isadore too says in <i>Libri Etymologiarum</i> (Bk. V, Ch. 3) that
right is as it were what is just. But there seems to be inconsistency in that political is the same as civil.
In this way what the Philosopher considers the whole division seems to be considered by the jurists as
a part of the division, for they make civil law a part of positive law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1017. But we must take into account that political or civil is taken here in one way by the Philosopher
and in another way by the jurists. The Philosopher here calls justice political or civil from the usage the
citizens are accustomed to, but the jurists call right political or civil from the cause, viz., that some city
has decreed for itself. For this reason the Philosopher appropriately designates legal or posited by law
that which they call positive. Political justice then is properly divided by means of these two, for the
citizens use justice to the extent that it is imparted to the human mind by nature and to the extent that it
is posited by law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1018. Then [y], at &#8220;Natural justice,&#8221; he indicates the parts of the preceding, division. First [y, aa] he
explains natural justice in two ways: in one way according to its effect or power, saying that that justice
is natural which everywhere has the same force and power to induce to good and prevent evil. This
happens because nature, the cause of this justice, is the same everywhere among all men. But justice by
the decree of a state or prince has force only among those who are subject to the jurisdiction of that state
or prince. In the other way he explains this justice according to its cause, when he says that natural justice
does not consist in what seems or does not seem to be, i.e., it does not arise from human conjecture but
from nature. In speculative matters there are some things naturally known, like indemonstrable principles,
and truths closely connected with them; there are other things discovered by human ingenuity, and
conclusions flowing from these. Likewise in practical matters there are some principles naturally known
as it were, indemonstrable principles and truths related to them, as evil must be avoided, no one is to be
unjustly injured, theft must not be committed and so on; others are devised by human diligence which
are here called just legal enactments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1019. We must consider that that justice is natural to which nature inclines men. But a twofold nature
is observed in man. One, is that which is common to him and other animals. The other nature belongs
to man properly inasmuch as he is man, as he distinguishes the disgraceful: from the honorable by reason.
However, jurists call only that right natural which follows the inclination of nature common to man and
other animals, as the union of male and female, the education of offspring, and so forth. But the right
which follows the inclination proper to the nature of man, i.e., precisely as he is a rational animal, the
jurists call the right of the peoples (<i>jus gentium</i>) because all people are accustomed to follow it, for
example, that agreements are to be kept, legates are safe among enemies, and so on. Both of these,
though, are included under natural justice as it is here taken by the Philosopher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1020. Next [y, bb ],at &#8220;That is called legal justice,&#8221; he explains legal justice and seems to give three
differences in justice of this kind. The first is this: when something is universally or commonly imposed
by law it becomes legal. Regarding this he says that that justice is called legal which in the beginning,
i.e., before it becomes law, is indifferent whether something is done in this way or that, but when it is
laid down, i.e., enacted into law, then a difference arises because observing it is just, disregarding it is
unjust. Thus in some state it has been decreed that a prisoner may be redeemed at a fixed price and that
a goat should be offered in sacrifice but that two sheep are not to be sacrificed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1020. The second difference in legal justice is that something is stated by law in a particular case, for
instance, when a state or a prince grants some privilege&#8212;called a private law&#8212;to an individual person.
Touching this point he says there are also legal enactments, not those that are decreed in a general way
but whatever are prescribed by legislators as law in individual cases. It was enacted, for example, in a
particular state that sacrifice should be offered to a woman named Brasidas who rendered great service
to the state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1022. The third difference in legal justice is that sentences passed by judges are called a kind of legal
justice. In regard to this he adds that the decrees of judges are also legal enactments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1023. But here we must take into consideration that legal or positive justice always has its origin in
natural justice, as Cicero says in his <i>Rhetoric</i> [<i>Rhetorica, De Inventione</i>, lib. II, cap. 53]. Origin from
natural right can occur in two ways: in one way as a conclusion from a principle, and in such a manner
positive or legal right cannot originate from natural right. The reason is that once the premises are stated
the conclusion necessarily follows. But since natural justice exists always and everywhere, as has been
pointed out (1018), this is not applicable to legal or positive justice. On this account it is necessary that
whatever follows from natural justice as a conclusion will be natural justice. Thus, from the fact that no
one should be unjustly injured it follows that theft must not be committed&#8212;this belongs to natural
justice. In the other way something can originate from natural justice after the manner of a determination,
and thus all positive or legal justice arises from natural justice. For example, that a thief be punished is
natural justice but that he be punished by such and such a penalty is legal justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1024. Also we must consider here that legal justice has its origin in two ways from natural justice in the
preceding manner. In one way it exists with an admixture of some human error, and in the other without
such error. Aristotle explains this by examples. It is natural justice that a citizen who is oppressed without
any fault on his part should be aided, and consequently that a prisoner should be ransomed, but the fixing
of the price pertains to legal justice which proceeds from natural justice without error. Likewise it is
natural justice that honor be bestowed on a benefactor but that divine honor be given him&#8212;that he be
offered sacrifice&#8212;arises from human error. But the just decrees of judges are applications of legal justice
to particular cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1025. At &#8220;Some people were of the opinion&#8221; [z] he rejects an error opposed to this division. On this point
he does three things. First [z, aa] he proposes the error together with the reason for it. Second [z, bb], at
&#8220;However, that opinion etc.,&#8221; he refutes it. Last [z, cc], at &#8220;Among the things etc.,&#8221; he asks a question
occasioned by the refutation. He says first that some were of the opinion that all justice is that which is
established by law and there is then no natural justice. This was the opinion of the followers of the
Socratic philosopher Aristippus. They were influenced by this reason: that which is according to nature
is invariable, and wherever it is it has the same force, as is obvious fire burns in Greece as well as in
Persia. Apparently this is not true of justice because all just things seem to be changed at times. Nothing
seems to be more just than that a deposit should be returned to the owner. Nevertheless the return must
not be made to a madman demanding his sword or to a traitor to his country demanding money for arms.
So then it seems that there is nothing just by nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1026. Then [z, bb], at &#8220;However, that opinion,&#8221; he provides a refutation, saying that the statement that
natural things are unchangeable is not so universally but is true in some respect. The reason is that the
nature of divine things never changes, for example, the nature of separated substances and of the
heavenly bodies, which the ancients called gods. But with us humans, who&#8217; are counted among perishable
things, there is something according to nature and yet whatever is in us is changeable either intrinsically
or extrinsically. Moreover, there is in us something natural like having two feet, and something not
natural like having a coat. Undoubtedly all the things that are just among us are variable, although some
of them are naturally just.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1027. Next [z, cc], at &#8220;Among the things,&#8221; he raises a doubt occasioned by the preceding refutation. He
handles the first point in a twofold manner. First [cc, a&#8217;] he asks the question. Then [cc, b&#8217;], at
&#8220;Obviously, the same,&#8221; he answers it. First he proposes this question. If all just human things are
changeable the question remains: of the things that change, what kind is just by nature and what kind is
just not by nature but by the decision of the law and agreement among men, if both are changeable in a
similar way?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1028. At &#8220;Obviously, the same&#8221; [cc, b&#8217;] he answers the question just asked. He considers this point in
a twofold manner. First [b&#8217;, a] he shows how things just by nature are changeable. Then [b&#8217;, b), at &#8220;Those
things that are,&#8221; he shows how things just by law are changeable. He says it is obvious that the
arrangement found in other natural things, likewise applies to things just by nature. Those things that are
natural with us occur in the same way in the greater number of cases but fail in a few. Thus it is natural
that the right hand is stronger than the left, and this is so in the greater number of instances, although it
happens occasionally that some men are ambidexterous since their left hand is as strong as their right.
So also the things that are just by nature, for example, that a deposit ought to be returned must be
observed in the majority of cases but is changed in the minority.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1029. However, we must keep in mind that the essences of changeable things are immutable; hence
whatever is natural to us, so that it belongs to the very nature of man, is not changeable in any way, for
instance that man is an animal. But things that follow a nature, like dispositions, actions, and movement,
are variable in the fewer instances. Likewise those actions belonging to the very nature of justice cannot
be changed in any way, for example, theft must not be committed because it is an injustice. But those
actions that follow (from the nature of justice) are changeable in a few cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1030. Then [b&#8217;, b], at &#8216;Those things that are,&#8221; he shows how the legally just are changeable without
exception. He says that regulations that are just according to arrangement and advantage, i.e., by what
is agreed among men for some utility, are similar to measures of salable commodities, wine and wheat.
These are greater where products are bought wholesale but smaller where products are sold retail. So also
things that are not naturally just but fixed by men are not the same everywhere, thus the same punishment
is not inflicted everywhere for theft. The reason is that civil life and the administration of the state are
not the same everywhere. All laws are framed as they are needed for the end of the state, although only
one form of government is everywhere best according to nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1031. Next [ii], at &#8220;Particular just and legal things,&#8221; he treats the division of justice in regard to the
individual parts. He says that each particular just and legal thing is related to human affairs as a universal
to singulars. The reason is that actions which are done according to justice are many but each just thing
is one, as it were a kind of universal. Thus, that a deposit must be returned is one which has a reference
to many cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1032. At &#8220;There is a difference&#8221; [B&#8217;] he shows what just action and unjust action are. First [1], what
unjust action is. Then [2], at &#8220;It is the same etc.,&#8221; what just action is. He says first that unjust action and
unjust thing differ, for an unjust thing is something that is contrary to justice either by nature or by
human decree, as theft. But the doing of an action by someone, for instance, stealing is called unjust
action, the execution of injustice so to speak. However, before this is done by anyone it is not called an
unjust action but an unjust thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1033. Then [2], at &#8220;It is the same,&#8221; he shows what just action is. He says that in a similar way just action
is present when a person does a thing which is just by nature or by regulation of law. But with the Greeks
the doing of a just thing in general is rather called <i>dicaeopragma</i> or doing of what is just, but every doing
of a just thing does not seem to be called justifying action but only when a person is corrected in the
justifying action, i.e., by restoring what is unjust to justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1034. Finally, he says that we must discuss later, in the <i>Politics</i> (Bk. I, Ch. 6, 1255 a 3-1255 b 15; St. Th.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Since just and unjust acts are such as have been described, a man acts unjustly or justly when he acts
voluntarily. But when he acts involuntarily he works neither injustice nor justice except incidentally, for
it is incidental that the actions are just or unjust. An act of justice and a just action are indicated by
reason of a voluntary and an involuntary. When a voluntary is done and a person is blamed, then there
is at the same time an unjust action. Wherefore something unjust may be present but an unjust action
never exists if there is no voluntary.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As has been pointed out previously, I call voluntary any of the actions within a man&#8217;s power, which he
does knowingly and without ignorance of the what, how and why; for example, whom he struck, with
what instrument, and with what intention-none of these being unintentional. Also the act must be done
without violence, thus when one takes a person&#8217;s hand and strikes another, that person does not act
voluntarily because it was not in his power to hinder this. It can happen that the one struck is the man&#8217;s
father, the striker knowing the person is a human being or someone present but not recognizing his father.
Likewise the same should be determined in what concerns the intention and the whole operation.
Certainly the act done without knowledge, or knowingly and not being in our power, is like an
involuntary. We knowingly do and experience many natural things none of which are either voluntary
or involuntary, for example, growing old and dying.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The same is true even when the act is just or unjust incidentally, because if someone restores a deposit
unwillingly and on account of fear his act is not said to be just, nor is it an act of justice except
incidentally. In a similar way a person forced against his will not to restore a deposit is said to do an
unjust thing or an act incidentally unjust.</span></p>

1041-1043</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Injury may occur in dealings among men in three ways. Through ignorance sins are committed in which
neither the person against whom, nor the what, nor the how, nor the end are known, and they take place
for an end not considered, for example, a man intends not to wound but to tap, not this person or not in
this way. When therefore (1) injury is inflicted unintentionally, we have an unfortunate accident, but
when (2) the injury is not unintentional although without evil intent, we have a sin certainly since the
principle of the cause is in the agent. But what happens incidentally has an external cause.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">However, when (3) injury is inflicted knowingly but without deliberation, we have unjust action, thus
whatever is done through anger or other passions which are necessary or natural to man. Under these
circumstances persons sinning and injuring others act unjustly and their actions are unjust but they are
not unjust or evil on account of this, for they do not inflict injury from wickedness.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Besides, it is not a question of whether the act is done but whether it is done justly, for anger indicates
some injustice which is obvious. The case is different when the fact is questioned as in transactions
where the alternative is necessarily evil if the action is not done through forgetfulness. But angry people,
acknowledging the fact, are uncertain in what way there is injustice. However, those who act deviously
are not ignorant on this point. Therefore the cunning, but not the angry, know that the injured party
suffered unjustly.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If a man inflicts injury by deliberate choice, he acts unjustly and he is now called unjust because of those
unjust acts since they are contrary to the proportional or the equal. In a similar way a person is called just
when he acts justly by deliberate choice, but he is said to be a doer of a just act only if he acts voluntarily. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1035. After the Philosopher has shown what justice in itself is, and what just action and unjust action are,
now [C] he answers a question that he previously asked, viz., by what just or unjust actions may a man
become just or unjust? He treats this point in a twofold manner. First [A&#8217;] he explains his plan. Then
[B&#8217;], at &#8220;Some involuntary acts etc.,&#8221; he introduces a division to explain things mentioned previously.
He discusses the initial point from two aspects. First [1] he shows when a just or unjust thing may exist
without a just or unjust action. Next [2], at &#8220;We perform some voluntary etc.,&#8221; he shows that there is just
or unjust action without the agent being just or unjust. He discusses the first point under two headings.
Initially [1, a] he explains his intention. Second [1, b], at &#8220;As has been pointed out etc.,&#8221; he clarifies what
he said. He affirms first that since just and unjust acts are such as have been described before (1000-1001), then a man acts unjustly or justly in this way: there is an act of injustice or a just action when he
voluntarily does these very things, i.e., what is just and unjust. But when a man does them involuntarily
he does not act justly or unjustly except perhaps incidentally; it happens contrary to his intention that the
acts he does are just or unjust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1036. Those things that we intend to do are said to be done in themselves and not incidentally. However,
nothing is specified by what is incidental but only by what is in itself (<i>per se</i>). Therefore the act of justice
and the <i>dicaeopragma</i> or the just operation, and likewise the act of injustice are indicated by a voluntary
or involuntary, in such a way that when something is voluntary a person is praised or blamed. Hence,
obviously, on the part of the thing done there will be something unjust, but there will not be an unjust
action as regards the species of the operation if there is not a voluntary on the part of the agent. The same
holds for just action.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1037. Then [1, b], at &#8220;As has been pointed out,&#8221; he clarifies some things that have been said, what a
voluntary and an involuntary are. He handles this point in a twofold fashion. First [1, b, i] he indicates
his intention. Second [1, b, ii], at &#8220;The same is true etc.,&#8221; he shows that the previous explanation is
applicable to both just and unjust acts. He says first that a voluntary, as has been pointed out in the third
book (382, 391, 427, 435, 436), is said to be present when a person knowingly does a thing that is in his
power and is not ignorant either of what is done, or by what means, or for what end he does this. For
example, he knows whom he struck, how he delivered the blow&#8212;as by an instrument&#8212;and the purpose
of it; so too he knows each of these in themselves and not incidentally. In order that there be a voluntary
it is necessary that the thing not happen by violence, for instance, if one takes a person&#8217;s hand by force
and strikes another, he whose hand it is does not do this voluntarily, because it is not in his power to
avoid being forced.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1038. After this, he explains how a thing may be known incidentally. It is possible that the man struck
is his father. He who delivers the blow knows that a human being or someone present was struck but not
that his father was; thus he knows incidentally that this was his father inasmuch as he knows that the
person to whom this happened was his father. As we have discussed the man who delivers the blow,
similarly we must investigate the purpose of the whole operation, i.e., all the circumstances of the
operation. From the statement of what the voluntary is we can know what the involuntary is. The reason
is that if something is done through ignorance or (after ignorance has ceased) is not in the power of the
agent, or still more is done through violences it will be an involuntary. On this account it was added &#8220;by
violence&#8221; because many things that are in us are not involuntary, for there are many natural things we
knowingly do and experience, for example, growing old and dying. Nevertheless none of these is
voluntary or involuntary because each one of them concerns the things which are in us by nature. But if
it happens through violence that one of them is not in us, then it is called an involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1039. Next [1, b, ii ], at &#8220;The same is true,&#8221; he explains what was said about just and unjust acts. In
regard to just acts, for example, if a man hands over a deposit to its owner not willingly but on account
of fear, we do not say there is just action in this case except incidentally. Likewise if a person forced
against his will abstains from restoring a deposit, we say he does an unjust thing or acts unjustly by
accident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1040. At &#8220;We perform some voluntary actions&#8221; [2] he shows when there is just or unjust action and yet
the agent himself is not just or unjust. First [2, a] he premises a division necessary to explain the
statement. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Injury may occur etc.,&#8221; he explains the statement. Last [2, c], at &#8220;Therefore,
it is etc.,&#8221; he clarifies some things that have been said. He states first that we do some voluntary actions
by deliberate choice and others without deliberate choice. Whatever we do by deliberate choice we do
with preceding counsel or deliberation; but whatever is not subject to choice or is performed without
choice we do without previous counsel or deliberation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1041. Next [2, b], at &#8220;Injury may occur,&#8221; he explains the statement. First [2, b, i] he repeats when there
may be an unjust thing without an unjust action. Then [2, b, ii], at &#8220;However, when etc.,&#8221; he restates
when there is unjust action without the agent being unjust. Last [2, b, iii], at &#8220;But when injury etc.,&#8221; he
shows when one is unjust by the injustice and wickedness of the agent. He says first, as appears from
what has been stated previously (1037-1038), that injury may occur in dealings among men in three ways:
in one way by ignorance and involuntarily, in another way voluntarily but without choice, and in a third
way voluntarily and with choice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1042. Those sins are committed through ignorance that are done by a man who does not know what he
is doing, nor against whom he acts, nor with what means, nor for what end even if he was aware of
performing an act. Thus a man thought that he landed a blow not with this instrument, e.g., a piked lance
but with a rounded one; or he thought that he struck not this man, viz., not his father but an enemy; or
he did not think he was about to strike for this objective but an objective was achieved he did not think
of, for example, when he intended to strike not to wound but to tap. The case is similar when ignorance,
exists in regard to the way a man landed a blow, mightily or lightly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1043. But on this point we must consider that when injury is inflicted unintentionally, i.e., contrary to
plan or intention, then an altogether unfortunate accident happens. For instance, a man means to brandish
a spear and instead throws it. But when someone inflicts injury not unintentionally, that is, not without
the intention of injuring but without malice in the sense that he does not mean to injure much or injure
such a person, then there is some sin, although not so great a one. A man sins when the principle of an
inordinate act is in his power in this that he intends to perform the act. But when the principle of
operation is entirely external so that it works contrary to the intention, then an unfortunate accident
occurs since fortune is an intellectual cause acting outside of reason, as is explained in the second book
of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 5, 196 b 10-197 a 8; St. Th. Lect. 8, 207-216).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1044. Then [2, b, ii], at &#8220;However, when,&#8221; he shows when there may be unjust action without wickedness
or injustice of the agent. He says that when a man inflicts injury knowingly but not with previous
counsel, i.e., without deliberation, then there is a kind of injustice, as there is in any action that a person
commits through anger and other passions-provided these passions are not natural and necessary to men,
like desire for food and drink in extreme necessity which excuses the taking of what belongs to another.
Therefore, those who injure others because of these passions sin and do an unjust thing and their acts are
unjust actions. Nevertheless by reason of this they are not unjust and evil because they do not inflict
injury from wickedness but from passion. Such people are said to sin from weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1045. At &#8220;But when injury&#8221; [2, b, iii] he shows when there may be unjust action with injustice on the part
of the agent. He says that when a man by deliberate choice causes injury to another, he is unjust and evil.
Such a one is said to sin out of sheer wickedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1046. Next [2, c], at &#8220;Therefore, it is,&#8221; he clarifies what has been said. Because the first of the three
things mentioned previously (which treats of what is done from ignorance) was commented on before
(1042-1043), in the beginning [2, c, i] he explains the second, which deals with what is done from
weakness or passion. Then [2, C, ii], at &#8220;If a man inflicts injury by choice etc.,&#8221; he explains the third,
which treats of what is done by deliberate choice. He says first that when people sin from anger they are
not evil or unjust because of this. Therefore we are well able to judge from this proof of previous
statements that what is done from anger is not considered to be done with premeditation. He proves this
afterwards, at &#8220;for it is the man&#8221; [i, x], by two reasons. The first is this, that it is not the man himself who
does something in anger that begins the process of injuring but the person who provoked him. So it does
not seem that the injury arose with premeditation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1047. Then [i, y], at &#8220;Besides, it is not,&#8221; he gives the second reason. He says that when a man inflicts
injury in anger there is no question whether he does the act or not but whether he does it justly, for by
anger some injustice is obvious, i.e., operates openly. And the angry man wishes the punishment to be
obvious but it seems to him that he is justly provoked. It is not the same thing with unjust dealings, like
theft and so forth in which there is doubt whether the act should have been done. One of the things must
be evil, for instance, giving or not giving; for we sin sometimes by omission, other times by transgression
unless we are excused by reason of forgetfulness, as when a person forgets to pay a debt to a creditor at
an agreed time. But people acting in anger admit the thing, or the fact, but doubt whether what they did
is unjust. This does not happen to those who act deviously by choice and are not ignorant that they act
unjustly. Wherefore, the insidious person judges that the man he injured suffers unjustly; but the angry
person does not think this. So it is evident that he who does an unjust thing in anger does not act with
premeditation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1048. At &#8220;If a man inflicts injury&#8221; [2, c, ii] he explains the third reason concerned with acts done by
deliberate choice. He says that if a man inflicts injury by deliberate choice, it is obvious that absolutely
speaking he acts unjustly, because he operates voluntarily. He who acts according to an injustice of this
kind is called unjust since this action is contrary to the proportional, i.e., against distributive justice, or
contrary to the equal, i.e., against commutative justice. In a similar way a man is called just when he acts
justly by deliberate choice. However, if he should act voluntarily and not by choice he will be called the
worker or doer of what is just.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1049. Then [B&#8217;], at &#8220;Some involuntary things,&#8221; he gives a division to explain things mentioned
previously. He says that some involuntary acts are venial, i.e., deserving of pardon, and others are not.
Those sins deserve pardon that men commit not only in ignorance, that is, when they have concomitant
ignorance, but on account of ignorance, viz., when ignorance is the cause so to speak-this happens to
those who are sorry when they become aware. But those sins do not deserve pardon that men commit not
on account of causative ignorance but in ignorance because of passion, which is neither natural nor
human nor according to right reason. In actions of this kind passion is the cause of ignorance and sin;
these have been more fully treated in the third book (406-424).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In regard to what is incidental the same holds for receiving as for doing, since clearly we take one for the
other in matters concerning justice and in justice alike. Acting unjustly is not the same as doing
something unjust, nor is suffering unjustly the same as suffering something unjust. Likewise, doing an
unjust thing and suffering an unjust thing are not the same. It is impossible to suffer unjustly without
someone doing what is unjust, or receive justice without someone doing what is just.</span></p>

golden armor for brass armor and a hundred oxen for nine oxen, suffers no injustice. It is in this man&#8217;s
power to give but not in his power to suffer injustice-there must be someone who inflicts the injustice.
Therefore it is obvious that suffering injustice is not voluntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1050. After the Philosopher has shown by what just actions a person may be called just or unjust, now
[II] he raises some doubts about the questions just discussed. He treats this point from two aspects. First
[A] he raises the doubts and solves them. Then [Lect. 15, B], at &#8220;Men are of the opinion etc.&#8221; (B. 1137
a 5), he refutes the errors of some philosophers about these subjects. The first part [A&#8217;] is divided into
two according to the two questions he answers. The second part begins at [Lect. 15, B&#8217;] &#8220;There are still
etc.&#8221; (B.1136 b 15). He handles the initial part under two headings. First [1] he proposes the question.
Then [2], at &#8220;Every doing of justice,&#8221; he follows up the question. He discusses the first point in a two-fold manner. First [1, a] he proposes the matter of the question. Next [1, b], at &#8220;Is it true or not etc.,&#8221; he
puts the questioning into form. in the first place the matter of the question is taken from material that was
settled earlier (1035-1040). Hence he says that someone can raise a doubt whether the suffering and
doing of injustice have been sufficiently discussed by reason of what has been said already. It was stated
(1035) that doing justice is voluntary. So it can be questioned whether this must be referred to suffering
injustice. In the second place the matter of the doubt is taken from the words of the poet Euripides who
somewhat unbecomingly introduced a character saying: &#8220;I killed my mother&#8212;to make the story short,
either I voluntarily killed her who wished to be put to death or else I killed her involuntarily.&#8221; In either
case we understand that the mother had expressed a wish to be killed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1051. Then [1, b], at &#8220;Is it true or not,&#8221; he puts the questioning into form. He considers this in two ways.
First [1, b, i] he proposes one question, viz., whether it is really proper to say that a man voluntarily
suffers injustice or whether this is untrue, but that every suffering of injustice is involuntary, as every
doing of injustice is voluntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1052. Second [1, b, ii], at &#8220;Is suffering injustice,&#8221; he proposes another question. The question is whether
every suffering of injustice is constituted in this way or in such a way that every suffering of injustice
is either voluntary or involuntary. As this question can be asked about doing injustice&#8212;whether every
such action is voluntary or whether some are voluntary and others involuntary&#8212;so in a similar way the
same question can be asked about the reception of justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1053. Next [2], at &#8220;Every doing of justice,&#8221; he follows up the question previously asked. He develops
this in a threefold fashion. First [2, a] he argues that every reception of justice is voluntary or every
reception is involuntary. Then [2, b], at &#8220;It seems unreasonable,&#8221; he argues that not every suffering of
injustice is voluntary. Last [2, c], at &#8220;Doing an injustice,&#8221; he argues that not every suffering of injustice
is involuntary. He argues in this way for the first point. Every doing of justice is voluntary, as is clear
from what has been pointed out (1035). But doing justice is the opposite of receiving justice. Therefore
it seems reasonable that receiving justice or injustice should be opposed similarly according to both, i.e.,
voluntary and involuntary, so that all of the one is voluntary and all of the other involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1054. At &#8220;It seems unreasonable&#8221; [2, b] he argues that not every suffering of injustice is voluntary. He
treats this point from three aspects. First [2, b, i] he argues for the proposition, saying it seems
unreasonable to hold that every suffering of injustice is voluntary. Obviously some people unwillingly
suffer injustice, hke those who are flogged or whose possessions are taken by others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1055. Second [2, b, ii], at &#8220;Wherefore, doubt can arise,&#8221; he asks a question on this point: whether
everyone who suffers injustice materially and incidentally can be said to suffer injustice formally and
in itself. Thus someone may readily object that the man who unwillingly suffers robberies or blows,
suffers injustice incidentally, nevertheless he is not, so to speak, simply a victim of injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1056. Last [2, b, iii], at &#8220;In regard to what is incidental&#8221; he answers the objection. He says that the same
holds for doing as for receiving. The reason is that in both cases it is possible to take one for the other:
to understand what is incidental about justice in a similar way to what is incidental about injustice. He
gives this explanation, that performing acts incidentally unjust is not the same as doing an act unjust in
itself. It was pointed out (1035-1036) that sometimes a person in ignorance does by chance what is
unjust, nevertheless, absolutely speaking, he does not act unjustly. Similarly, undergoing things that are
incidentally unjust is not the same as undergoing what is simply unjust. Likewise it is impossible that
these things are the same in the doing of justice and in receiving justice; and that the same reason holds
for the doing and receiving both in regard to just things and unjust things. He explains this afterwards
by the fact that it is not possible to suffer something just or unjust simply speaking because passion is
an effect of action. If then, a man does what is unjust incidentally and does not become unjust simply,
it follows that neither does he suffer injustice simply who suffers an unjust thing. The same argument
holds for justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1057. Then [2, c], at &#8220;Doing an injustice,&#8221; he argues against the idea that suffering injustice is
involuntary. First [c, i], he argues for the proposition. Second [c, ii], at &#8220;Perhaps the definition etc.,&#8221; he
solves the proposition. Concerning the initial point he offers two reasons. In regard to the first [i, x] of
these he presents three considerations. First [x, aa] he gives a definition of doing injustice, which was
defined previously (1035, 1045): doing injustice simply and in itself is simply the voluntary inflicting
of injury. By voluntary is meant that one knows who is injured, what inflicts the injury, and how, i.e.,
in what manner together with other circumstances of this kind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1058. Second [x, bb], at,&#8221;The incontinent person,&#8221; he argues from the definition given. It is obvious that
the incontinent person voluntarily injures himself, inasmuch as he does voluntarily what he knows is
harmful to him. If then suffering injustice resembles doing injustice, it follows that the person acting
voluntarily himself may suffer injustice from himself, so it is possible for someone to do injustice to
himself. Thus it follows that not every suffering of injustice is involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1059. Third [x, cc], &#8220;But this is one,&#8221; he asks an incidental question: whether in fact someone can do an
injustice to himself. But he takes up this question later (1091-1108).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1060. At &#8220;Moreover, it happens&#8221; [i, y] he gives the second reason. If it happens that anyone by reason
of incontinence is knowingly and willingly injured by another (for example, a man ensnared by love of
a prostitute allows himself to be robbed) then it is possible that a person may willingly suffer injustice.
So, not every suffering of injustice is involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">io6i. Then [c, ii], at &#8220;Perhaps the definition,&#8221; he gives the solution. He discusses this point from three
aspects. First [ii, x] he corrects the definition of doing injustice given above (1057), and from it he infers
the truth of the question. He says that the definition of doing injustice, stated without qualification, is not
correct. But the statement should be added that doing injustice is present when someone with a
knowledge of the circumstances inflicts injury on another against his will. From this it follows that
although a person voluntarily may be injured and suffer incidentally what is unjust; nevertheless, no one
voluntarily suffers injustice, absolutely speaking, because in itself doing injustice is to inflict harm on
another against his will.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1062. Next [ii, y], at &#8220;No one wants,&#8221; he answers the first reason. No one wishes with a complete will
to suffer injustice, not even the incontinent person, although he does things harmful to himself against
his will. Essentially he wills good, but by concupiscence he is drawn to evil. Aristotle proves this
statement from the fact that, since the will desires what appears good, no one wills what he does not think
is good. But the incontinent person in a passionless moment does not think what he does is good and
therefore he does not will it absolutely; nevertheless he does what he thinks he ought not to do, on
account of concupiscence which is in the sensitive appetite, the will being in the reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">io63. Last [ii, z], at &#8220;Anyone who gives,&#8221; he answers the second reason concerning the person who is
willingly injured by another. He says that a man does not suffer injustice absolutely speaking who
voluntarily gives what is his own, as Homer narrates [Iliad vi. 236] about an individual named Glaucus
that he gave Diomede golden armor for brass armor and a hundred oxen for nine oxen. Therefore this
type does not suffer injustice because it is in the man&#8217;s power to give what belongs to him. However,
suffering injustice is not in the power of him who suffers injustice, but there must be someone who does
the injustice. Consequently suffering injustice is involuntary, and doing injustice is voluntary because
the principle of action is in the agent&#8212;this belongs to the nature of a voluntary. However, the source of
suffering is not in the patient but in another&#8212;and this belongs to the nature of an involuntary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1064. He concludes by way of summary that suffering injustice obviously is involuntary.</span></p>

injustice nor is his judgment unjust but it resembles injustice, for legal justice differs from primary
justice. But if a person knowingly forms an unjust judgment, he acts covetously to obtain favor or avoid
punishment. Hence-just as if he shares in the injustice-the man, who judges unjustly for that purpose, has
more than his due; for in such cases the man who awards a field does not receive a field but silver.</span></p>

(immediately) in their power.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Similarly, some people think that no wisdom is needed to know what things are just and unjust because
it is not difficult to understand what the law says. However, these things are only incidentally just but
become truly just when done and distributed in a particular way. Now to know this way is a more
difficult task than to know the things that are healthful because there it is easy to know the virtue of
honey, wine, and hellebore, to know the effect of cautery and surgery, but how they ought to be
prescribed for health, for what patient, and when is as great an accomplishment as that of being a doctor. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">For this very reason it is thought also that the just man is not less able to do injustice but rather can do
any unjust thing: for example, he can have carnal intercourse, strike a blow, and a brave man can throw
away his shield, can turn and run away. However, perpetration of a cowardly action or of something
unjust is doing these things only incidentally, but the doing is absolute for one having the permanent
facility, just as healing and restoring to health do not consist in cutting or not cutting, in giving medicine
or not giving it, but in prescribing these things as they should be.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Just acts are found among people who participate in things good in themselves but have both defect and
excess of them. For some persons there is no excess in regard to such goods (possibly so with the gods).
For others, the hopelessly evil, no particle of these goods is useful but every one of them is harmful. In
still others the goods become harmful at a determined point; and this is human.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1065. After the Philosopher has then [2], at &#8220;If the first proposal etc.,&#8221; solved one doubt, now [B&#8217;] he
comes he follows it up. He says first that in to another. First [1] he proposes it, the matter of justice and
injustice two questions still remain which he wishes to treat in preference to others. The first of these is,
which of the two persons does an injustice in regard to distribution: he who gives to someone without
regard to worth or he who accepts? The second&#8212;Can a person do injustice to himself?&#8212;is a question
he asked before (1059) and resolves later (1091-1108).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1066. Then [2], at &#8220;If the first proposal,&#8221; he follows up the question previously asked. First [2, a] he
objects to the false part. Next [2, b], at &#8220;But it does not seem,&#8221; he solves it. Last [2, c], at &#8220;However it
is,&#8221; he determines the truth. He says first that if what was just said (1065) is true, viz., that the dishonest
distributor does injustice and not he who receives too much, something inappropriate seems to follow.
It can happen that a person knowingly and willingly gives more to another than to himself, and so it
seems that he may do injustice to himself a thing that is inappropriate. The reason is that moderate men
apparently do this, as they retain things of less value for themselves. It is characteristic of the virtuous
man that he belittles himself, i.e., accepts things of less value for himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1067. Next [b, i], at &#8220;But it does not seem,&#8221; he solves this by two reasons. The first is that sometimes it
is not entirely true that the distributor retains things of less value for himself. Although he keeps the less
valuable external goods for himself, he nevertheless has an abundant share of another good, viz., glory,
and of moral or honorable good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1068. At &#8220;Again we can answer&#8221; [b, ii] be gives the second reason proceeding from the definition of
doing justice given before (1061). To this an addition was made indicating that it is contrary to the will
of him who suffers. But the distributor suffers nothing contrary to his will. Consequently he does not
suffer injustice but only undergoes some damage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1069. Then [2, c], at &#8220;However it is obvious,&#8221; he determines the truth. He says [c, i] that obviously the
man who distributes more than one&#8217;s share does an injustice, yet this is not always true of him who
accepts too much but only when he works to bring about this object.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1070. Next [c, ii], at &#8220;Not the man in whom,&#8221; he proves the proposition by three reasons. The first [ii,
x] is that the man in whom the unjust thing exists is not said to do injustice, because in this way the one
who is injured would do injustice; but he does injustice who wills to do it&#8212;he is the principle of action.
This is the case of the person who distributes but not so with the recipient. Therefore the distributor does
injustice and not the receiver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1071. Aristotle gives the second reason at &#8220;Action is said&#8221; [ii, y], affirming that a man is said to act in
various ways. In one way he acts as a principal agent, and in another, as instruments act. In the latter way
it can be said that inanimate things, like stones, swords, or arrows cause death, and that the hand or the
servant of the one who commands brings about death. None of these, absolutely speaking, does injustice
although they are the means by which unjust actions are done. The reason is that doing injustice, since
it is voluntary, is attributable to the agent in whom the principle of action lies, as has been pointed out
(1063). But it is clear that in distribution the distributor holds the place of the principal agent while the
recipient holds the place of an instrument after the manner of one obeying. Hence it remains that the
distributor does the injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1072. At &#8220;Moreover, he has formed&#8221; [ii, z] he gives the third reason. He says that if a person by reason
of ignorance of legal justice wrongly judges, tic does not do injustice, absolutely speaking, nor is the
judgment by which his action is done unjust in itself; but it is unjust in a way because the thing judged
is unjust. Therefore we spoke of legal justice because one kind of justice is legal which can be unknown,
another is natural which cannot be unknown because it is impressed by nature on the human mind. But
if someone knowing legal justice judges unjustly, then he acts greedily, that is, unjustly either for the
sake of acquiring the favor of another or to avoid a penalty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1073. If a man wishes to share injustice in unfair portions, he who judges unjustly to curry someone&#8217;s
favor has more good than belongs to him. So he acts greedily, although he may not have more of that
good in which he injured another. The reason is that in such affairs a man who unjustly awarded a field
to someone obviously for profit, did not get the field but money. And so a distributor is situated in
distribution as a judge in exchanges. Therefore as a judge wrongly judging with full knowledge does an
injustice, so too does he who distributes unjustly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1074. Then [B], at &#8220;Men are of the opinion,&#8221; he refutes some errors. Regarding this he does two things.
First [B, 1] he refutes some false opinions concerned with one doing justice or injustice. Next [B, 2], at
&#8220;Just acts are found,&#8221; he shows in whom just and unjust acts exist. In regard to the first point he refutes
three false opinions. The first of these [1, a] concerns the facility in becoming unjust. He says that many
people are of the opinion that they are ready to do even injustice immediately. Hence they think that it
is easy to be habitually unjust. Certainly it is easy, and immediately in a man&#8217;s power, to do unjust things:
to have sexual intercourse with his neighbor&#8217;s wife, to strike his neighbor, to take money from the hand
of another, or to hand over money to have murder or some crime done. But that men should do actions
of this kind in such a way that they act promptly and with pleasure is not easily nor immediately in a
man&#8217;s power, but they come to this point through persistent habit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1075. Second [1, b], at &#8220;Similarly, some people,&#8221; he refutes a false opinion about the knowledge of just
and unjust things. He says some people think great wisdom is not needed for a man to discern just and
unjust acts because it is not difficult to understand the decrees of the law determining legally just acts.
However, such people are self-deceived because these acts simply considered are just only accidentally
inasmuch as it is an accident that such things are just. But they become genuinely just when in some way
they are performed and distributed (i.e., attributed) in some way to affairs and persons. But proper
adaptation to affairs and people is more laborious and difficult than knowing remedies in which the
whole art of medicine consists. There is a greater diversity among voluntary acts about which justice is
concerned than among the humors about which health is concerned. Also it is easy to know the virtue
of honey, wine, and hellebore, and the effect of cautery and surgery, but to prescribe these things for the
restoration of health in the right way, for the right person, and at the right time is as great an
accomplishment as being a doctor, for one who has this knowledge is a doctor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1076. Third [i, c], at &#8220;For this very reason, &#8220; he refutes a false opinion concerning facility in doing justice
and unjust things. He affirms that, on account of what has been said, people also are of the opinion that
the just man can do injustice as readily as any one else, because from the fact that he is just he knows not
less but more and can do any one of the things called unjust, like having sexual intercourse with another&#8217;s
wife, striking another, throwing away his shield in battle; and a man can attack anyone he pleases. But
they deceive themselves because the perpetration of cowardly actions and the doing of what is unjust is
doing these things only incidentally inasmuch as it happens that the acts are unjust, but to do what is
simply unjust is for someone to do these things in such a way that he is willing and prompt at it. So it is
in medicine-healing and restoring to health do not consist in operating or not operating, in prescribing
or not prescribing a drug, i.e., a laxative, but in a person prescribing them as he ought.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1077. Then [B, 2], at &#8220;Just acts are found,&#8221; he shows to whom they are attributable. We say that just acts
are attributable to the people among whom are found things simply and in them-selves desirable, like
riches and so on, although these persons (as is common among men) have excess and defect in this
matter. For some there is no excess in such things that are used most laudably, as becomes men perfect
in virtue and perhaps the gods (according to the error of people who hold that gods use things of this
nature). For others, viz., the very wicked and the incurably evil no particle of these goods is useful but
everything is harmful. For still others not everything is harmful but it becomes so at a certain fixed point.
Hence it is evident that justice is a human good because it regards the general condition of man.</span></p>

that the equitable&#8212;as something beyond the just&#8212;is praiseworthy. Either the just thing or the equitable
(which is other than the just) is not good. Or if both are good then they are the same. The doubt generally

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The reason for this is that every law is proposed universally, but it is not possible to deal with some
things in a universal way. Where the necessary exists we can speak universally but it is impossible to
apply this rightly where the law understands the application to be valid in the majority of cases, while
being clearly aware that a defect is present.</span></p>

JUSTICE. &#8212; 1085</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Nevertheless the law is good, for the defect is not in the law nor the making of it but in the nature of the
thing. And clearly the matter of human actions is such that they are not always done in the same way.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, when the law proposes something universally and a particular thing happens contrary to this,
then, where the legislator has left a gap and erred in speaking absolutely, it is right to correct what is
deficient. The legislator would have spoken on the point in this way if he had been present, and if he had
known he would have filled this gap in the law.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">For this reason what is equitable is just and is something more excellent than one kind of just thing, not
better than that which is absolute but better than that which errs by reason of being proposed absolutely.
This thing that is the equitable is the directing of the law where there is deficiency because of faulty
universal application. The reason why everything cannot be judged according to the law is that it is
impossible to make a law for certain cases. Hence there is need of passing judgment, for the rule of
indeterminate matter is itself flexible, like the leaden rule used by builders in Lesbos; just as that rule
conforms to the shape of the stone, and does not remain the same, so also the sentence is adapted to the
conditions. In this way then it has been made clear what the equitable is, that it is both the just and better
than the just thing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">From this it is obvious who the equitable man is. He is one who chooses and does the things spoken of;
he is not a zealous enforcer of justice in the worse sense, but a mitigator although he recognizes the law

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">And this habit of equity is a species of justice and not another kind of habit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1078. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of justice in general, he now begins to
consider equity which is a general directive of justice. First [I] he indicates his intention. Then [II], at
&#8220;When we stop to think etc.,&#8221; he proceeds with his proposition. He says first that following what has
been said, we should discuss equity that designates a certain habit and the equitable thing that is its
object. In the discussion we should declare how equity is related to justice and how its object, which is
called the equitable thing, is related to the just thing, the object of justice. In Greek <i>epiiches</i> is understood
as what is reasonable or becoming; it is derived from <i>epi</i> meaning &#8220;above&#8221; and <i>ikos</i> meaning &#8220;obedient,&#8221;
because by equity a person is obedient in a higher way when he follows the intention of the legislator
where the words of the law differ from it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1079. Then [II], at &#8220;When we stop to think,&#8221; he proceeds with his proposition. He discusses it under three
headings. First [II, A] he determines the object of equity. Second [II, B], at &#8220;From this it is obvious etc.,&#8221;
the subject of it. Last [II, C], at &#8220;And this habit etc.,&#8221; he determines the habit. He considers the initial
point in a twofold manner. First [A, 1] he raises a doubt; then [A, 2], at &#8220;Everything said is true,&#8221; he
solves it. He says first that if we look closely, it does not seem that the equitable thing is absolutely the
same as the just, because the equitable sometimes departs from what is legally just; nor does it seem to
be altogether different in species from what is just. He assigns a reason for these things: sometimes we
praise what is equitable and declare that it is well done. Likewise we praise the kind of man who does
it-we even call him a manly and perfect individual. So it is evident that, when we transfer praise to what
is equitable, or to a person, as if to a greater good, we show what is equitable as something better than
what is just. Hence the equitable - does not seem to be the same absolutely as the just thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1080. On the other hand (if we wish to follow reason) it seems inappropriate if what is equitable is
praiseworthy and something over and above the just. It seems necessary that either the just thing is not
desirable, i.e., good, or that if what is equitable is different from the just, it is not good because good (in
the law) is achieved in one way, as was pointed out in the second book (319-321); or it is necessary that
if both are good, they are identical. So he infers that a doubt arises about what is equitable on account
of the things just stated. On the one hand it seems that it is not the same inasmuch as it is praised as better
than the just thing, on the other it seems that it is the same as the just thing, for what is beyond the just
apparently is not good and praiseworthy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1081. Next [A, 2], at &#8220;Everything Said is true,&#8221; he solves the question raised. He handles this point in
two ways. First [2, a] he sets forth the truth. Then [2, b], at &#8220;What raises the doubt etc.,&#8221; he assigns the
reason. He says first that everything that has been said for either side of the doubt is in some way right,
and if correctly understood no opposition lies hidden there. It is true that what is equitable is one kind
of just thing and is better than another just thing because, as was noted before (1016-1017), justice which
citizens practice is divided into natural and legal. But what is equitable is better than what is legally just
but is contained under the naturally just. Consequently it is not said to be better than the just thing as if
it were some other kind of norm distinct from the genus of just things. Although both, viz., the legally
just thing and the equitable, are good, the equitable is better.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1082. At &#8220;What raises the doubt&#8221; [2, b] he assigns the reason, treating it in a threefold manner. First [b,
i] he assigns the reason for doubt. Second [b, ii], at &#8220;The reason for this etc.,&#8221; he indicates the reason for
the truth proposed. Third [b, iii], at &#8220;For this reason what is equitable etc.,&#8221; he infers the truth intended.
He says first that this is what raised the doubt: that the equitable is a just thing, yet it is not something
legal. But it is a certain directing of legal justice, for we said (1023) that it was contained under natural
justice from which legal justice has its origin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1083. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;The reason for this,&#8221; he assigns the reason for the truth proposed, i.e., why legal
justice has need of direction. He discusses this point from three aspects. First [ii, x] he points out a defect
in legal justice. Next [ii, y], at &#8220;Nevertheless the law,&#8221; he shows that this defect does not destroy the
rectitude of legal justice. Last [ii, z], at &#8220;Therefore, when,&#8221; he infers the necessity for direction. He says
first that the reason why legal justice has need of direction is that every law is proposed universally.
Since particulars are infinite, our mind cannot embrace them to make a law that applies to every
individual case. Therefore a law must be framed in a universal way, for example, whoever commits
murder will be put to death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1084. It is evident that our intellect can predicate something universally true about some things, in the
case of what is necessary where no defect can occur. But about other things it is not possible that
something true be predicated universally, in the case of what is contingent. Here even though something
is true in most instances, nevertheless it errs as we know in a few instances. And of such a nature are
human acts about which laws are framed. In, these things the legislator necessarily speaks in a universal
way on account of the impossibility of comprehending particulars; however, he cannot be correct in all
the situations for which he legislates since error arises in some few cases. For this reason the legislator
accepts what happens in most cases, and nevertheless he is not ignorant that defect is possible in some
cases. Thus the anatomist says that man has five fingers, although he knows that by a mistake of nature
it happens that man has more or less in rarer cases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">io85. Next [ii, y], at &#8220;Nevertheless the law,&#8221; he shows that the previously mentioned defect does not
destroy the rectitude of law or of legal justice. He says that, although a fault may be committed in some
cases by the observance of the law, nevertheless the law is good because that fault is not on the part of
the law (since it was made according to reason) nor on the part of the legislator (who legislated according
to the condition of the material), but the fault arises from the nature of the thing. Such is the nature of
human actions that they are not done always in the same way but are done otherwise in certain infrequent
instances. For example, the return of a deposit is in itself just and good, as it happens in most cases, but
in a particular situation it can be bad, for instance, if a sword is returned to a madman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1086. At &#8220;Therefore, when&#8221; [ii, z] he infers the necessity for directing legal justice. He says that when
the law proposes something in a universal way, and the observance is not beneficial in a special instance,
reason rightly dictates that a person should correct what is deficient in the law. Where the legislator
evidently left indeterminate a particular case (in which the law falls short) he is at fault, i.e., he proposed
a defective proposition in speaking absolutely or universally. The reason is that even the legislator
himself, had he been present where such a case happened, would have determined in this way and the
correction would have been made. Moreover, had he foreseen this from the beginning he would have put
it in the law. But he could not comprehend all particulars; in a certain city it was decreed under penalty
of death that strangers were not to climb the walls of the city for fear they would usurp the civil
government. But during an enemy invasion some strangers by climbing the walls defended the city from
the invaders. They do not deserve to be punished by death; it would be against the natural law to reward
benefactors with punishment. Therefore in this case legal justice must be directed by natural justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1087. Then [b, iii], at &#8220;For this reason what is equitable&#8221; he infers the truth intended, affirming that by
reason of what has been said it is clear what the equitable is. It is a just thing and it is better than one kind
but not better than what is naturally just that is laid down absolutely, that is, universally. Hence the nature
of the equitable is that it be directive of the law where the law is deficient for some particular case.
Indeed the law does fail in particular cases. The reason why not everything can be determined according
to the law is that the law cannot possibly be framed to meet some rare particular incidents, since all cases
of this kind cannot be foreseen by man. On account of this, after the enactment of the law, a decision of
the judges is required by which the universal statement of the law is applied to a particular matter.
Because the material of human acts is indeterminate, it follows that their norm, which is the law, must
be indeterminate in the sense that it is not absolutely rigid.</span></p>

that cannot easily be dressed by chisel so they may be arranged in an entirely correct position. Therefore
the builders there use a leaden rule. just as this leaden rule conforms to the shape of the stone and does
not stay in the same form, so the sentence of the judge must be adapted to things according to their
suitableness. In this way then he ends by way of summary that it is clear from the premises what the
equitable thing is, that it is something just which is better than one kind of just thing, viz., the legally just.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1089. Next [B], at &#8220;From this it is obvious,- he determines the subject of equity. He affirms that it is
evident from what has been proposed (1078-1088), who the equitable man is: he who chooses and does
the things which have been discussed. He lays down a certain characteristic of this kind of virtuous
person. He says that such a one is not <i>acribodikaios</i>, i.e., a zealous enforcer of justice in the worse sense,
for vengeance, like those who are severe in punishing, but rather like those who mitigate the penalties
although they may have the law on their side in punishing. The legislator does not intend punishments
in themselves but as a kind of medicine for offenses. Therefore the equitable person does not add more
punishment than is sufficient to prevent violations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1090. At &#8220;And this habit&#8221; [C] he determines the habit of virtue. He says that this habit, called equity, is
a particular species of justice and is not a habit different from legal justice; we said the same about its
object, for habits are known by reason of their objects.</span></p>

According to these concepts, one part of the soul has been divided as against the irrational part (irascible
and concupiscible). Looking at these, some people think that injustice to oneself is present because in
them it is possible to suffer something contrary to one&#8217;s own desire. Here a kind of injustice is found as
between master and slave. We have, then, finished the treatise on justice and the other moral virtues
according to the preceding plan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1091. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on justice in the proper sense, he now intends to treat
justice in the metaphorical sense. Because justice of this kind exists in things that relate to oneself,
therefore, he first [ I ] shows that no one, properly speaking, can do himself an injustice. Second [II], at
&#8220;By metaphor etc.,&#8221; he shows how this takes place in a metaphorical sense. He develops this point in a
twofold manner. First [A] he shows that no one can do himself an injustice nor suffer an injustice from
himself. Then [B], at &#8220;Obviously both are evil etc.,&#8221; he shows whether it is worse to do an injustice or
suffer an injustice. He considers the first under three aspects. Initially [A, A&#8217;] he suggests that a question
of this kind can be settled from what has been said before. Next [A, B&#8217;] at &#8220;There are certain just acts
etc.,&#8221; he proposes certain grounds on which it seems that a person can do himself an injustice. Last [A,
C&#8217;] at &#8220;But to whom? etc.,&#8221; he determines the truth. He says first that from the premises it can be made
clear whether a man may do an injustice to himself. He raised this question before (1059-1064). But here
he follows it up because of the connection it has with an understanding of justice taken in a metaphorical
sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1092. Then [A, B&#8217;] at &#8220;There are certain just acts,&#8221; he gives two reasons from which it seems that
someone can do himself an injustice. The first is this [ B&#8217;, 1 ]. Obviously from what has been said before,
the things that are just according to any virtue are ordered by law. Hence what is not ordered at all by law
does not seem to be just in terms of any virtue and hence is unjust. In no case does the law command a
man to take his own life. But those acts that the law does not command as just, it forbids as unjust. This
is not to be understood as if no mean exists between the command and the prohibition of the law, since
there are many acts that are neither commanded nor forbidden by the law but are left to man&#8217;s will, for
example, buying or not buying a particular thing. But this is to be understood in the sense that it is only
those things which are forbidden as unjust in themselves that the law in no case commands. So it seems
that to take one&#8217;s own life is of itself unjust, since the law never commands it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1093. At &#8220;Again, however&#8221; [B&#8217; 2] he gives the second reason, saying that one who injures another
contrary to the precept of the law (as when the law commands that an action be punished provided it is
not against a person defending himself, i.e., resisting injury inflicted on oneself by another), such a one,
I say, willingly does injustice. When I say &#8220;willingly,&#8221; it is understood the person should know what he
does, in what manner, and the other circumstances. But he who takes his own life because of anger acts
contrary to a good law in willing something the law does not permit. Therefore he does injustice.
Consequently it seems that a man can do himself an injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1094. At &#8220;But to whom&#8221; [A, C] he solves the previously mentioned doubt. First [C, 1] he presents and
confirms the solution. Second [C&#8217;, 2], at &#8220; This question,&#8221; he&#8217;,gives the root of the solution. He treats the
first point in two ways. Initially [1, a] he solves the doubt raised before, regarding legal justice. Second
[1, b], at &#8220;Besides, inasmuch etc.,&#8221; he solves the doubt regarding particular justice. On the initial point
he does two (three) things. First [a, i] he proposes the solution saying that the man who commits suicide
does some injustice. But we must consider against whom he acts unjustly. Certainly he does an injustice
to the state, which he deprives of a citizen, even if he does no injustice to himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1095. Next [a, ii], at &#8220;He voluntarily suffers,&#8221; he confirms the solution given; first [a, ii, x] in regard to
the fact that one does not do himself an injustice. He may willingly endure the slaying but no one
willingly suffers injustice, as was said before (1094). Therefore this person does not suffer an injustice
and does not do himself an injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1096. Then [a, ii, y], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he confirms the solution in regard to the injustice to the state-this by a certain sign. We see that the state imposes what punishment is possible, dishonor or censure on
the suicide; that it has his body dragged or left unburied. In this way we are given to understand that this
man committed injustice against the state.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1097. At &#8220;Besides, inasmuch&#8221; [1, b] he shows that no one does himself an injustice according to
particular justice. First [b, i] he proposes what he intends. He says that inasmuch as a person is called
unjust not as being completely perverse in evil but only as doing particular injustice, according to this
injustice it is not possible for a person to do injustice to himself. This particular injustice, which we
discussed before (913-926), is different from legal injustice. A man may be called unjust in some
measure not as being completely evil but as being partially evil, for example, someone is called cowardly
according to a particular evil. Hence neither according to particular injustice can anyone do injustice to
himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1099. Next [b, ii], at &#8220;Indeed something,&#8221; he proves the proposition by four reasons. The first [b, ii, w]
is that one who does injustice according to particular injustice has more than is due him, and he who
suffers injustice has less. If then someone could do injustice to himself, it would follow that something
could be taken from him and added to him at one and the same time-things that are opposites. Therefore
it is impossible for the same person to be the one doing injustice and suffering injustice from himself.
But justice and injustice necessarily implies more than one person.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1099. At &#8220;Again, doing injustice&#8221; [b, ii, x] he gives the second reason saying that doing injustice must
be voluntary and with-choice, and must be previous to suffering injustice. That man, who first has
suffered injustice and reacts against it according as the law allows, does not seem to do injustice, for
example, if he repossesses a thing taken from him. But if a person injures himself, he suffers and inflicts
the same act at the same time. Therefore he does not seem to do injustice to himself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1100. Then [b, ii, y], at &#8220;Moreover, he will,&#8221; he offers the third reason. Certainly a person voluntarily
does harm to himself. If then such a one suffers injustice from himself, it follows that suffering injustice
is a voluntary. This we disproved before (1094-1096).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1101. Next [b, ii, z], at &#8220;Besides, no one,&#8221; he gives the fourth reason. If we look at particular injustice,
that is, the species of particular injustice, it is apparent that no one does himself an injustice. One
particular species of injustice is fornication, i.e., adultery. But no man fornicates or commits adultery
with his own wife. No one is called a burglar&#8212;burglary belongs to another species of injustice&#8212;because
he breaks into his own home, nor a thief if he secretly takes his own goods. Obviously then it is not
possible to do oneself injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1102. At &#8220;This question&#8221; [C&#8217;, 2] he gives the principal root of the previously mentioned solution. He says
that this question about doing injustice to oneself is completely solved in accord with what was
determined before (1063, 1071, 1099) on the point that it is impossible to suffer any injustice voluntarily.
From this it clearly follows that no one unwillingly does injustice, since doing injustice is a voluntary,
as was pointed out previously (1063, 1071, 1099).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1103. Then [B], at &#8220;Obviously both,&#8221; he compares these two things with one another. In regard to the
comparison he takes up three points. First [B, A&#8217;] he shows that both of them are evil. Next [B, B&#8217;], at
&#8220;However, to do injustice etc.,&#8221; he shows that in itself it is worse to do injustice. Last [B, C&#8217;], at
&#8220;although nothing hinders etc.,&#8221; he shows that by chance the contrary can be true. He says first that both,
doing injustice and suffering injustice, are evil. He proves the statement from the fact that to suffer
injustice is to have less than the mean of justice requires. But the first, to do injustice, is to have more
than the measure of justice. Now the mean of justice, called the just thing, is related to exchanges and
distributions as the healthful is to medicine and the well-conditioned to gymnastics. Consequently, as in
medicine and gymnastics what is too much or too little is evil, so also in regard to justice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1104. Next [B, B&#8217;], at &#8220;However, to do injustice,&#8221; he shows that it is worse to do injustice than to suffer
injustice. This he proves from the fact that to do injustice is blameworthy and evil&#8212;a thing that is to be
understood either as complete and absolute evil (for instance, when someone does injustice not only
voluntarily but by choice) or &#8220;Coming close to complete evil (evident in the person who acts unjustly not
by choice but by anger or some other passion). It has been explained before (1041) that not every
voluntary accompanies injustice, because sometimes a man does an unjust act and nevertheless is not
unjust, although he is blameworthy. But a person&#8217;s suffering injustice is entirely without evil and
injustice, for he who suffers injustice can in no way be considered unjust or evil. But, obviously, that by
which a man is called evil is worse than that by which he is not called evil, an actual whiteness by which
a person is called white is whiteness in a greater degree than potential whiteness by which a person is
not called white. It follows then that suffering injustice is in itself less evil than doing injustice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1105. At &#8220;although nothing hinders&#8221; [B, C&#8217;] he shows that the contrary can be true by chance. He says
nothing prevents suffering injustice from being more evil by chance than doing injustice, as when a man
is provoked to do greater injustice by the fact that he suffers unjustly. But this is by chance, and art does
not care about what is by chance but judges only according to what is essential. Thus the art of medicine
calls pleurisy a dangerous and deadly abscess under the ribs, a worse ailment than a sore foot that
nevertheless can by chance be worse, for instance, when a man falls because of an injured foot and so
by accident is captured and slain by an enemy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">iio6. Next [II], at &#8220;By metaphor and likeness,&#8221; he shows of what nature metaphorical justice is. He says
that by a kind of metaphor and likeness, it is possible to have, not justice or injustice of the whole man
toward himself, but a certain species of justice among the parts of man. However, this is not justice in
the full sense but only the justice of a master or an administrator (viz., the head of a household), because
corresponding to these reasons of dominion and administration the rational part of the soul seems to be
distinguished from the irrational part, which is divided into irascible and concupiscible. The reason is
master of the irascible and concupiscible parts and governs them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1107. In view of such consideration some people think that a man&#8217;s justice extends to himself because,
by reason of these parts, he can suffer from his own desires, for instance, when he acts against reason out
of anger or concupiscence. Hence, among the parts a kind of justice and injustice is found, as between
one who commands and one who obeys. However, it is not genuine justice because it is not between two,
but it has a resemblance to justice inasmuch as the diversity in the soul is like the diversity between
persons.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1108. Finally, as a summary, he concludes that we have finished the treatise on Justice and the other
moral virtues according to the preceding plan. With this the teaching of the fifth book is completed.</span></p>
