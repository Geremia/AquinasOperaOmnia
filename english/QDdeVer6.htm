    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it has will as its genus, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. As Augustine says,’ predestination is the intention of being merciful.
    But intention belongs to the will. Consequently, predestination also belongs
    to the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Predestination seems to be the same as the eternal election referred to
    in the Epistle to the Ephesians (1:4): “He chose us in him before the
    foundation of the world”—because the chosen are the same as the
    predestinated. Now, according to the Philosopher, choice belongs rather to
    appetite than to intellect. Hence, predestination belongs more to the will
    than to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. But it was said that election comes before predestination and is not the
    same as it.—On the contrary, will comes after knowledge, not before it. But
    choice pertains to the will. If, therefore, choice comes before
    predestination, then predestination cannot belong to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. If predestination belonged to knowledge, then it would seem to be the
    same as foreknowledge; and thus whoever foreknew the salvation of a person
    would predestine him. Now, this is false; for the prophets foreknew the
    salvation of the Gentiles; yet they did not predestine it. Therefore.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Predestination implies causality. Now, causality does not have the nature
    of knowledge, but rather the nature of will. Consequently, predestination
    belongs more to the will than to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The will differs from a passive potency in this respect, that the latter
    refers only to effects taking place in the future, for we, cannot speak of
    passive potency in relation to things that are or have been, whereas the
    will extends equally to both present and future effects. Now, predestination
    has both present and future effects; for, as Augustine says: “Predestination
    is the preparation of grace in the present and of glory in the future.”
    Therefore, it belongs to the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Knowledge is not related to things in so far as they are made or to be
    made but in so far as they are known or to be known. Now, predestination is
    related to a thing as something that must be effected. Consequently, it does
    not belong to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. An effect receives its name from its proximate cause rather than from its
    remote cause. For example, we say that a man is begotten by a man, instead
    of saying by the sun, which also begets him. Now, preparation is the effect
    of both knowledge and will, but knowledge is prior to the will and more
    remote than it. Consequently, preparation belongs more to the will than to
    knowledge. But, as Augustine says: “Predestination is the preparation of
    someone for glory.” Therefore, predestination pertains rather to the will
    than to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. When many motions are ordered to only one term, then the entire
    co-ordinated complex of motions takes the name of the last motion. For
    example, in the drawing out of a substantial form from the potency of
    matter, the following order is had: first, alteration, then generation. But
    the whole is called generation. Now, when something is prepared, this order
    is had: first, movements of knowledge, then movements of the will.
    Consequently, the whole should be attributed to the will; therefore,
    predestination seems to be especially in the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. If he of two contraries is appropriated to something, then the other
    contrary is removed from it in the highest possible degree. Now, evil is
    appropriated especially to God’s foreknowledge, for we say that the damned
    are known beforehand. Consequently, His foreknowledge does not have good
    things as its object. Predestination, however, is concerned only with those
    good things that lead to salvation. Therefore, predestination is not related
    to foreknowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. When a word is used in its proper sense, it does not need a gloss. But;
    whenever the sacred Scripture speaks of knowledge of good, a gloss is added
    saying that this means approval. This is evident from the Gloss on the first
    Epistle to the Corinthians (8:3): “‘If any man love God, the same is known
    by him’—that is, he is approved by God”; and from the Gloss on the second
    Epistle to Timothy (2:19): “‘The Lord knoweth who are his’—that is, God
    approves him.” In its proper sense, therefore, knowledge is not related to
    good things. But predestination is related to good things. Therefore.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. To prepare belongs to a power that moves, for preparation is related to
    some work. But, as has been said, predestination is a preparation.
    Therefore, it belongs to a moving power and so to the will, not to
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. A reasoning power modeled upon another reasoning power imitates it. Now,
    in the case of the human reason, which is modeled upon the divine, we see
    that preparation belongs to the will, not to knowledge. Consequently, divine
    preparation is similar; and the conclusion is the same as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. Although the divine attributes are one reality, the difference between
    them is manifested in the difference in their effects. Consequently,
    something said of God should be reduced to that attribute to which this
    effect is appropriated. Now, grace and glory are the effects of
    predestination, and they are appropriated either to His will or His
    goodness. Therefore, predestination also belongs to His will, not to His
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The Gloss on the Epistle to the Romans (8:29), “For whom he foreknew, he
    also predestinates,” says: “Predestination is God’s foreknowledge and
    preparation of benefits...”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Whatever is predestined is known, but the opposite is not true.
    Consequently, what is predestined belongs to the class of things that are
    known; hence, it is included in the genus of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. A thing should be placed in the genus to which it always belongs, rather
    than in a genus which is not always proper to it. Now, the element of
    knowledge always belongs to predestination, because foreknowledge always
    accompanies it. The granting of grace, however, which takes place through
    the will, does not always accompany predestination, since predestination is
    eternal while the bestowal of grace takes place in time. Predestination,
    therefore, should be placed in the genus of knowledge rather than in that of
    will acts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The Philosopher places habits of knowing and doing among the intellectual
    virtues, for they belong more to reason than to appetite. This is clearly
    what he does in the case of art and prudence, as can be seen in his
    <i>Ethics.”</i> Now, predestination implies a principle of doing and of
    knowing, since, as is evident from the definition given, predestination is
    both foreknowledge and preparation. Predestination, therefore, belongs more
    to knowledge than it does to the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Contraries belong to the same genus. But predestination is the contrary
    of reprobation. Now, since reprobation belongs to the genus of knowledge,
    because God foreknows the malice of the damned but does not cause it, it
    seems that predestination also belongs to the genus of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <i>Destination</i> (from which <i>predestination</i> is derived) implies the
    direction of something to an end. For this reason, one is said to destine a
    messenger if he directs him to do something. And because we direct our
    decisions to execution as to an end, we are said to destine what we decide.
    For example, Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6:19) is said to have “destined” in his
    heart not to do “any unlawful things for the love of life.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, the particle <i>pre-,</i> when joined to a word, adds a relation to the
    future. Consequently, <i>to destine</i> refers to what is present, while
    <i>to predestine</i> can also refer to what is future. For two reasons,
    therefore, predestination is placed under providence as one of its parts,
    namely, because direction to an end, as pointed out in the preceding
    question,” pertains to providence, and because providence—even according to
    Cicero—includes a relation to the future. In fact, some define providence by
    saying that it is present knowledge bearing upon future event.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    On the other hand, predestination differs from providence in two respects.
    Providence means a general ordering to an end. Consequently, it extends to
    all things, rational or irrational, good or bad, that have been ordained by
    God to an end. Predestination, however, is concerned only with that end
    which is possible for a rational creature, namely, his eternal glory.
    Consequently, it concerns only men, and only with reference to those things
    that are related to salvation. Moreover, predestination differs from
    providence in a second respect. In any ordering to an end, two things must
    be considered: the ordering itself, and the outcome or result of the
    ordering, for not everything that is ordered to an end reaches that end.
    Providence, therefore, is concerned only with the ordering to the end.
    Consequently, by God’s providence, all men are ordained to beatitude. But
    predestination is also concerned with the outcome or result of this
    ordering, and, therefore, it is related only to those who will attain
    heavenly glory. Hence, providence, is related to the initial establishment
    of an order, and predestination is related to its outcome or result; for the
    fact that some attain the end that is eternal glory is not due primarily to
    their own power but to the help of grace given by God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, just as we said above that providence consists in an act of
    reason, like prudence, of which it is a part, because it belongs to reason
    alone to direct and to ordain, so now we say that predestination also
    consists in an act of reason, directing or ordering to an end. However, the
    willing of an end is required before there can be direction to an end,
    because no one directs anything to an end which he does not will. This is
    why the Philosopher says that a perfect prudential choice can be made only
    by a man of good moral character, because moral habits strengthen one’s
    affections for the end which prudence dictates. Now, the one who predestines
    does not consider in a general way the end to which his predestination
    directs him; he considers it, rather, according to the relation it has to
    one who attains it, and such a person must be distinct in the mind of the
    one predestining from those persons who will not achieve this end.
    Consequently, predestination presupposes a love by which God wills the
    salvation of a person. Hence, just as a prudent man directs to an end only
    in so far as he is temperate or just, so God predestines only in so far as
    He loves.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Another prerequisite of predestination is the choice by which he who is
    directed to the end infallibly is separated from others who are not ordained
    to it in the same manner. This separation, however, is not on account of any
    difference, found in the predestined, which could arouse God’s love; for, as
    we read in the Epistle to the Romans (9:11-13): “When the children were not
    yet born nor had done any good or evil... it was said... ‘Jacob I have
    loved, but Esau I have hated.’” Consequently, predestination presupposes
    election and love, and election presupposes love. Again, two things follow
    upon predestination: the attainment of the end, which is glory, and the
    granting of help to attain this end, namely, the bestowal of the grace that
    pertains to the call to be among the predestined. Predestination, therefore,
    has two effects: grace and glory.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The acts of the soul are such that a preceding act in some way is
    virtually contained in the act that follows. Since predestination
    presupposes love, an act of the will, the notion of predestination includes
    something that belongs to the will. For this reason, intention and other
    elements belonging to the will are sometimes put into its definition.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2.Predestination is not the same as election, but, as we said above, it
    presupposes election. This is why the predestined are the same as the elect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Since choice belongs to the will, and direction to the intellect,
    direction always precedes election if both have the same object. But if they
    have different objects, then there is no inconsistency in election’s coming
    before predestination, which implies the existence of direction. As election
    is taken here, however, it pertains to one who is directed to an end; and
    the acceptance of one who is to be directed toward an end comes before the
    direction itself. In the case stated, therefore, election precedes
    predestination.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Even though predestination is placed under the genus of knowledge, it
    adds something to knowledge and foreknowledge, namely, direction or an order
    to an end. In this respect, it resembles prudence, which also adds something
    to the notion of knowledge. Consequently, just as every person who knows
    what to do is not thereby prudent, so also not every one who has
    foreknowledge thereby predestines.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Even though causality does not belong to the notion of knowledge as such,
    it belongs to that knowledge which directs and orders to an end; and
    direction of this kind is not proper to the will but to the intellect alone.
    Similarly, understanding does not belong to the nature of a rational animal
    in so far as it is animal but only in so far as it is rational.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Knowledge is related to both present and future effects, just as the will
    is. On this,basis, therefore, it cannot be proved that predestination
    belongs more to one than to the other. Yet predestination, properly
    speaking, is related only to the future-as the prefix <i>pre-</i> indicates,
    because it implies an ordering to the future. Nor is it the same to speak of
    having an effect <i>in the present</i> and of having a present effect,
    because whatever pertains to the state of this life—whether it be present,
    past, or future—is said to be <i>in the present.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Even though knowledge as knowledge is not related to things in so far as
    they are to be made, practical knowledge is related to things under this
    aspect, and predestination is reduced to this type of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. In its proper sense, preparation implies a disposing of a potency for
    act. There are, however, two kinds of potencies: active and passive;
    consequently, there are two kinds of preparations, There is a preparation of
    the recipient, which we speak of when we say that matter is prepared for a
    form. Then there is a preparation of the agent, which we speak of when we
    say that someone is preparing himself in order to do something. It is this
    latter kind of preparation that predestination implies; for it asserts
    simply this, that in God there exists the ordering of some person to an end.
    Now, the proximate principle of ordering is reason, and, as is clear from
    above, its remote principle is will. Consequently, for the reason given in
    the difficulty, predestination is attributed more to reason than to will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. A similar answer should be given to the ninth difficulty.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Evil things are ascribed as proper to foreknowledge, not because they
    are more proper objects of foreknowledge than good things, but because good
    things in God imply something more than mere foreknowledge, while evil
    things have no such added implication. Similarly, a convertible term which
    does not signify an essence appropriates to itself the name of property,
    which belongs just as properly to the definition, because the definition
    adds a certain priority.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. A gloss does not always mean that a word has not been used in its proper
    sense. Sometimes a gloss is necessary merely to make specific what has been
    stated in a general way. This is why the gloss explains <i>knowledge</i> as
    meaning knowledge of approval.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. To prepare or direct belongs only to powers that move. But to move is
    not peculiar to the will. As is clear from <i>The Soul</i>, this is also a
    property of the practical intellect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. In so far as preparation made even in a human reason implies an ordering
    or directing to an end, it is an act proper to the intellect, not to the
    will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. When treating a divine attribute, we should not consider only its effect
    but also its relation to the effect; for, while the effects of knowledge,
    power, and will are the same, still, as the names of these attributes imply,
    their relations to them are not. Now, in so far as predestination is
    directive, the relation implied by predestination to its effect is more
    logically said to be a relation of knowledge than a relation of power or
    will. Consequently, predestination is reduced to a type of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1.-2.-4. We concede the other arguments presented here. One might reply to
    the second, however, by pointing out that not everything that is found in
    more things is thereby a genus, for it might be predicated of them as an
    accident.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Even though the granting of grace does not always accompany
    predestination, the will to grant grace always does.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Reprobation is directly opposed, not to predestination, but to election,
    for He who chooses accepts one and rejects another and this is called
    reprobation. Consequently, as the word itself shows,
    <i>reprobation</i> pertains more to the will. For to reprobate is, as it
    were, to reject—except that it might be said that to reprobate means the
    same as to judge unworthy of admittance. However, reprobation is said to
    belong to God’s foreknowledge for this reason, that there is nothing
    positive on the part of His will that has any relation to sin. He does not
    will sin as He wills grace. Yet reprobation is said to be a preparation of
    the punishment which God wills consequent to sin—not antecedent to it.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In his gloss on the verse in Romans (9:15), “I will have mercy on
        whom I will have mercy,” Ambrose writes as follows: “I will give mercy
        to him who I know will return with his whole heart to Me after his
        error. This is to give mercy to him to whom it should be given, and not
        to give it to one to whom it should not. Consequently, He calls him who
        He knows will obey, not him who He knows will disobey.”’ Now, to obey
        and to return to God with all one’s heart are meritofious; the opposite
        actions are demeritorious. Foreknowledge of merit or of demerit is
        therefore the cause of God’s intention of being merciful to some and of
        excluding others from His mercy. This is equivalent to predestination
        and reprobation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Predestination includes God’s will to save men. It cannot be said
        that it includes only His antecedent will, because, according to this
        will—as is said in the first Epistle to Timothy (2:4): “God wills all
        men to be saved”; hence, it would follow that all are predestined. It
        remains, therefore, that predestination includes only His consequent
        will. Now, “We are the cause,” as Damascene says, “of God’s consequent
        will,” according as we merit salvation or deserve damnation. Our merits
        foreknown by God are therefore the cause of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Predestination means primarily God’s will with respect to man’s
        salvation. But men’s merits are the cause of their salvation. Moreover,
        knowledge causes and specifies the act of the will, since that which
        moves the will is a desirable thing which is known. Consequently,
        foreknowledge of merits is a cause of predestination, since two of the
        things which foreknowledge contains cause the two things contained in
        predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Reprobation and predestination signify the divine essence while
        connoting an effect. There is no diversity, however, in the divine
        essence. Consequently, the difference between predestination and
        reprobation comes entirely from their effects. Now, effects are
        considered as caused by us. It is due to us, as cause, therefore, that
        the predestined are segregated from the reprobate, as takes place
        through predestination. Hence, the same must be said as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Taken in itself, the sun is in the same relation to all bodies that
        can be illuminated, even though all bodies cannot share its light
        equally. Similarly, God is equally related to all, even though all do
        not participate in His divine goodness in an equal measure, as the
        saints and philosophers say so often. Now, since the sun is in the same
        relation to all bodies, it is not the cause of the differences that we
        find in these bodies, namely, that some of them are dark and others
        bright. This is due, rather, to differences in the physical constitution
        of the bodies which affect their reception of sunlight. Similarly, the
        reason for this difference, namely, that some reach salvation and others
        are damned, or that some are predestined while others are rejected, is
        to be found not in God but in us. Consequently, our original thesis
        stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Good communicates itself. It belongs to the highest good, therefore,
        to communicate itself in the highest possible degree, that is, as much
        as each and every thing is capable of receiving it. Consequently, if it
        does not communicate itself to something, this is because that thing is
        not capable of receiving it. Now, according to the quality of his
        merits, a person is capable or not capable of receiving that salvation
        which predestination ordains. Foreknowledge of merits, therefore, is the
        reason wily some are predestined and others are not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Concerning the passage in Numbers (3:12), “1 took Levites...,” Origen
        writes: “Jacob, younger by birth, was judged to be the firstborn.
        Because what they intended to do was in their hearts, and this was clear
        to God before they were born or did any good or evil, It was said of
        them:‘Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated.’” Now, this love, the
        saints commonly explain, pertains to Jacob’s predestination.
        Consequently, God’s foreknowledge of the intention Jacob was going to
        have in his heart was the reason for his predestination. Thus, the same
        must be said as was said previously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Predestination cannot be unjust, since the ways of the Lord are
        always the ways of mercy and truth. Nor can there be any form of justice
        between God and men other than distributive justice. There is no place
        for commutative justice, since God, who needs none of our good things,
        receives nothing from us. Now, distributive justice rewards unequally
        only those that are unequal. But the only cause of inequality among men
        is difference in merit. Therefore, the reason why God predestines one
        man and not another is that He foreknows their different merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. As mentioned previously, predestination presupposes election. But a
        choice cannot be reasonable unless there is some reason why one person
        is to be preferred to another. Now, in the election we are speaking
        about, there can be no reason for the preference other than merits.
        Therefore, since God’s choice cannot be irrational, His election and,
        consequently, His predestination also must be caused by His
        foreknowledge of merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Commenting on that verse in the Prophecy of Malachi (1:2-3), “I have
        loved Jacob, but have hated Esau,” Augustine says that “the will of
        God,” by which He chose one and rejected the other “cannot be’ unjust,
        for it came from their hidden merits.” But the hidden merits can enter
        into an intention only in so far as they are foreknown. Consequently,
        predestination comes from foreknowledge of merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. As the use of grace is related to the final effect of predestination
        so the abuse of it is related to the effect of reprobation. Now, in the
        case of Judas, the abuse of grace was the reason for his reprobation,
        since he was made reprobate because he died without grace. Moreover, the
        fact that he did not have grace when he died was not due to God’s
        unwillingness to give it but to his unwillingness to accept it—as both
        Anselm and Dionysius point out. Consequently, the good use of grace by
        Peter or anyone else is the reason why he is elected or predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. One person can merit the first grace for another. For the same
        reason, it seems that he could merit for that other person a
        continuation of grace up to the end. Now, if one gets final grace, he is
        predestined. Consequently, predestination can be caused by merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. According to the Philosopher: “One thing is said to be prior to
        another when the sequence of their being cannot be reversed.” But God’s
        foreknowledge is related to predestination in this way, because God
        knows beforehand what He predestines, while He foreknows the evil which
        He does not predestine. Foreknowledge, therefore, is antecedent to
        predestination. But what is prior in any order is the cause of what is
        posterior. Consequently, foreknowledge is the cause of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The word <i>predestination is</i> derived from <i>sending</i> or
        <i>destining.</i> But knowledge precedes sending or destining, because
        no one can send a person without knowing him first. Knowledge,
        therefore, is prior also to predestination; hence, it seems that it is
        the cause of predestination. Consequently, our thesis stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Gloss on the following verse in the Epistle to the Romans (9:12),
        “Not of works, but of him that calleth was it said,” reads: “He shows
        that the words ‘I have loved Jacob, etc.,’ were due neither to any
        previous nor to any future merits.” And the Gloss on the verse, “Is
        there injustice with God?” (9:4), says: “Let no one say that God chooses
        one man and rejects another because He foresaw future works.”
        Consequently, it does not seem that foreknowledge of merits is the cause
        of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Grace is the effect of predestination but the principle of merit.
        Hence, foreknowledge of merits cannot possibly be the cause of
        predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the Epistle to Titus (3:5), the Apostle says: “Not by the works of
        justice which we have done but according to his mercy...” Predestination
        of one’s salvation, therefore, does not arise from foreknowledge of
        merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If foreknowledge of merits were the cause of predestination, then no
        one would be predestined who did not merit. But some predestined never
        merit, as is evidently the case of children. Consequently, foreknowledge
        of merits is not the cause of predestination.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is this difference between a cause and an effect—that whatever is
        the cause of the cause must be the cause of the effect, but the cause of
        the effect is not necessarily the cause of the cause. It is evident, for
        example, that the first cause produces its effect through a second
        cause, and so the second cause, in some way, causes the effect of the
        first cause, although it is not the cause of the first cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, we must distinguish two aspects of predestination, the eternal
        predestination itself and its twofold temporal effect, grace and glory.
        Glory has human acts as its meritorious cause, but grace cannot have
        human acts as its meritorious cause; human acts can act only as a
        certain material disposition to grace, inasmuch as through these acts
        men are prepared for the acceptance of it. It does not follow from this,
        however, that our acts, whether they precede or follow grace, are the
        cause of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, to discover the cause of predestination we must recall what we have
        said previously, namely, that predestination is a certain direction to
        an end, and this direction is brought about by reason, moved by the
        will. Consequently, a thing can be the cause of predestination if it can
        move the will. However, a thing can move the will in two ways, first, as
        something due, secondly, as something not due. Now, as something due, a
        thing can move the will in two ways, namely, either absolutely or on the
        supposition of something else. The ultimate end, which is the object of
        the will, moves absolutely; and it moves the will in such a fashion that
        the will cannot turn away from it. For example, as Augustine says, no
        man is capable of not willing to be happy. But that without which an end
        cannot be had is said to move as something due “on the supposition of
        something else.” If an end can be had, however, without a certain thing
        which contributes merely to the well-being of the end, then that thing
        does not move the will as something due. In this case, the will inclines
        to it freely; but when the will is already inclined to it freely, the
        will is thereby inclined to all the things without which it cannot be
        had, as to things that are due on the supposition of that which was
        first willed. For example, out of liberality a king makes a person a
        soldier; but, because one cannot be a soldier without a horse, on the
        supposition of the afore-mentioned liberality, giving the soldier a
        horse becomes due and necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, the end-object of the divine will is God’s own goodness, which does
        not depend on anything else. God needs nothing to help Him possess it.
        Consequently, His will is inclined first to make something freely, not
        something due, inasmuch as it is His goodness that is manifested in His
        works. But, supposing that God wishes to make something, it follows as
        something due from the supposition of His liberality that He make those
        things also without which those that He has first willed cannot be had.
        For example, if He wills to make a man, He must give him an intellect.
        But if there is anything which is not necessary for that which God
        wills, then that thing comes from God, not as something due, but simply
        as a result of His generosity. Now, the perfection of grace and glory
        are goods of this kind, because nature can exist without them inasmuch
        as they surpass the limits of natural powers. Consequently, the fact
        that God wishes to give grace and glory is due simply to His generosity.
        The reason for His willing these things that arise simply from His
        generosity is the overflowing love of His will for His end-object, in
        which the perfection of His goodness is found. The cause of
        predestination, therefore, is nothing other than God’s goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        According to these principles, a solution can be found to the
        controversy that has been taking place between certain groups. Some have
        asserted that everything comes from God’s simple pleasure, while others
        say that everything which comes from God is due. Both opinions are
        false. The former ignores the necessary order that exists between the
        things God causes, and the latter asserts that everything arises from
        God because of a natural necessity. A middle course must therefore be
        chosen so that it may be laid down that those things which are first
        willed by God come from His simple pleasure, but those that are required
        for this first class of things come as something due, although on the
        basis of a supposition. This “debt” does not, however, make God obliged
        to things but only to His own will; for what is said to come from God as
        something due is due simply in order that His will be fulfilled.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Divine providence ordains that grace bestowed be used as it should.
        Consequently, it is impossible for foreknowledge of this right use of
        grace to be the cause that moves God to give grace. The words of
        Ambrose, “I will give grace to him who I know will return to me with his
        whole heart,” cannot be understood as meaning that a perfect change of
        heart inclines God’s will to give grace but that His will ordains that
        the grace given be accepted by the person and that he be turned
        completely toward God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Predestination includes God’s consequent will, which is related in
        some way to that which we cause on our part, not by inclining the divine
        will to act, but by bringing about that effect for which His will has
        ordained grace or by bringing about that which, in a certain sense,
        disposes us for grace and merits glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. While it is true that knowledge moves the will, not every kind of
        knowledge does this but only knowledge of an end; and an end is an
        object moving the will. Consequently, it is because of His knowledge of
        His own goodness that God loves it; and, from this love, He wishes to
        pour out His goodness upon others. But it does not therefore follow that
        knowledge of merits is the cause of His will in so far as it is included
        in predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although the different formal characters of God’s attributes are
        drawn from the differences in their effects, it does not follow from
        this that these effects are the cause of His attributes. For the
        different formal characteristics of His attributes are not derived from
        our qualities as though our qualities caused them; rather, our qualities
        are signs that the attributes themselves are causes. Consequently, it
        does not follow that that which comes from us is the reason why one man
        is reprobated and another predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We can consider God’s relation to things in two ways. We can consider
        it only with respect to the first disposition of things that took place
        according to His divine wisdom, which established different grades of
        things. If only this is considered, then God is not related to all
        things in the same way. We can, however, consider His relation to things
        also according to the way in which He provides for them as already
        disposed. If His relation to them is considered in this manner, then He
        is related to all things in the same way, because He gives equally to
        all, according to the proportion He has made. Now, all that has been
        said to proceed from God, according to His will taken simply, belongs to
        the first disposition of things, of which preparation for grace is a
        part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It belongs to the divine goodness as infinite to give from its
        perfections whatever the nature of each thing requires and is capable of
        receiving. But this is not required for superabundant perfections such
        as grace and glory. Hence, the argument proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. God’s foreknowledge of what lay in the heart of Jacob was not the
        reason for His willing to give grace to him. Instead, the intention in
        Jacob’s heart was a good for which God ordained the grace to be given to
        him. It is for this reason that God is said to have loved him “because
        his heart’s intention was known by Him.” For God loved him in order that
        he might have such an intention in his heart or because He foresaw that
        his heart’s intention was a disposition for the acceptance of grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. It would be contrary to the nature of distributive justice if things
        that were due to persons and were to be distributed to them were given
        out unequally to those that had equal rights. But things given out of
        liberality do not come under any form of justice. I may freely choose to
        give them to one person and not to another. Now, grace belongs to this
        class of things. Consequently, it is not contrary to the nature of
        distributive justice if God intends to give grace to one person and not
        to another, and does not consider their unequal merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The election by which God chooses one man and reprobates another is
        reasonable. There is no reason why merit must be the reason for His
        choice, however, since the reason for this is the divine goodness. As
        Augustine says,” moreover, a justifying reason for reprobation [in the
        present] is the fact of original sin in man—for reprobation in the
        future, the fact that mere existence gives man no claim to grace. For I
        can reasonably deny something to a person if it is not due to him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Peter Lombard says that Augustine retracted that statement in a
        similar passage. But, if it must be sustained, then it should be taken
        as referring to the effect of reprobation and of predestination, which
        has a meritorious or disposing cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. God’s foreknowledge of this abuse of grace was not the reason why
        Judas was reprobated, unless we are considering only the consequences of
        this abuse—though it is true that God denies grace to no one who is
        willing to accept it. Now, the very fact that we are willing to accept
        grace comes to us through God’s predestination. Hence, our willingness
        cannot be a cause of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Although merit can be the cause of the effect of predestination, it
        cannot be the cause of predestination itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Although that with which the consequent cannot be interchanged is
        prior in some way, it does not always follow that it is prior as a cause
        is said to be prior; for, if this were true, then to be colored would be
        the cause of being a man. Consequently, it does not follow that
        foreknowledge is the cause of predestination.

        1. No cause whose effects can vary can be certain of its effects. But
        the effects of predestination can vary, for one who is predestined may
        not attain the effect of his predestination. This is clear from the
        commentary of Augustine on the words of the Apocalypse (3:1 1), “Hold
        fast that which thou hast, that no man take...” in which he says: “If
        one person will not receive glory unless another loses it, then the
        number of the elect is certain.”’ Now, from this it seems that one could
        lose and another receive the crown of glory, which is the effect of
        predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Human affairs fall under God’s providence as things in nature do.
        But, according to the ordering of God’s providence, only those natural
        effects that are produced necessarily by their causes proceed from them
        with certainty. Now, since the effect of predestination, man’s
        salvation, arises not necessarily but contingently from its proximate
        causes, it seems that the ordering of predestination is not certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If a cause has certitude with respect to some effect, that effect
        will necessarily follow unless there is something that can resist the
        power of the agent. For example, dispositions in bodies here below are
        sometimes found to resist the action of celestial bodies; and, as a
        consequence, these celestial bodies do not produce their characteristic
        effects, which they would produce were there not something resisting
        them. But nothing can resist divine predestination, because, as we read
        in the Epistle to the Romans (9:19): “Who resisteth his will?”
        Therefore, if divine predestination is ordered with certitude to its
        effect, its effect will necessarily be produced.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The answer was given that the certitude which predestination has of
        its effect presupposes the second cause.—On the contrary, any certitude
        based on the supposition of something is not absolute but conditional
        certitude. For example, it is not certain that the sun will cause a
        plant to bear fruit unless the generative power of the plant is in a
        favorable condition; and, because of this, the certitude of the sun’s
        producing this effect presupposes the power of the plant as though the
        latter were a second cause. Consequently, if the certitude of divine
        predestination includes the presupposition of a second cause, that
        certitude will not be absolute but merely conditional—like the certitude
        I have that Socrates is moving if he runs, and that he will be saved if
        he prepares himself. Therefore, God will have no more certitude about
        those who are to be saved than I have. But this is absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We read in Job (34:24): “He shall break in pieces many and
        innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.” In
        explanation of this passage, Gregory writes: “Some fall from the place
        of life, while others are given it.” Now, the place of life is that
        place to which men are ordained by predestination. Hence, one who is
        predestined can fall short of the effect of predestination; therefore,
        predestination is not certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. According to Anselm, predestination has the same kind of truth that a
        proposition about the future has. But a proposition about the future
        does not have certain and determinate truth. Such a proposition is open
        to correction—as is clear from that passage in Aristotle where he says:
        “One about to walk may not walk.” Similarly, therefore, the truth that
        predestination has does not possess certitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Sometimes one who is predestined is in mortal sin. This was clearly
        true of Paul when he was persecuting the Church. Now, he can stay in
        mortal sin until death or be killed immediately. If either happens,
        predestination will not obtain its effect. Therefore, it is possible for
        predestination not to obtain its effect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. But it was said that, when it is stated that one predestined may
        possibly die in the state of sin, the proposition is taken compositely
        and so is false; for its subject is taken as simultaneously having the
        determination <i>predestined.</i> But if its subject is taken without
        this determination, then the proposition is taken in a divided sense and
        is true. —On the contrary, with those forms which cannot be removed from
        the subject, it does not matter whether a thing is attributed to the
        subject with those qualifying determinations or without them. For
        example, taken either way, the following proposition is false: “A black
        crow can be white.” Now, predestination is the kind of form that cannot
        be removed from the one predestined. In the matter at hand, therefore,
        there is no room for the afore-mentioned distinction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. If what is eternal be joined to what is temporal and contingent, then
        the whole is temporal and contingent. Thus, it is clear that creation is
        temporal, even though its notion includes God’s eternal essence as well
        as a temporal effect. The same is true of a divine mission, which
        implies an eternal procession and a temporal effect. Now, even though
        predestination implies something eternal, it also implies a temporal
        effect. Therefore, predestination as a whole is temporal and contingent
        and, consequently, does not seem to have certitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. What can be or not be cannot have any certitude. But the fact that
        God predestines to salvation can be or not be. For just as He can, from
        all eternity, predestine and not predestine, so even now He can
        predestine and not predestine, since present, past, and future do not
        differ in eternity. Consequently, predestination cannot have any
        certitude.

        1. In explanation of that verse in the Epistle to the Romans (8:29),
        “Whom he foreknew, he also predestined,” the Gloss says: “Predestination
        is the foreknowledge and preparation of the benefits of God by which
        whoever are freed are most certainly freed.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If the truth of a thing is unshakable, it must be certain. But, as
        Augustine says: “The truth of predestination is unshakable.” Therefore,
        predestination is certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whoever is predestined has this predestination from all eternity. But
        what exists from all eternity cannot be changed. Predestination,
        therefore, is unchangeable and, consequently, certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As is clear from the Gloss mentioned above J predestination includes
        foreknowledge. But, as Boethius has proved, foreknowledge is certain.
        Therefore, predestination is also certain.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are two kinds of certitude: certitude of knowledge and certitude
        of ordination. Now, certitude of knowledge is had when one’s knowledge
        does not deviate in any way from reality, and, consequently, when it
        judges about a thing as it is. But because a judgment which will be
        certain about a thing is had especially from its causes, the word
        <i>certitude</i> has been transferred to the relation that a cause has
        to its effect; therefore, the relation of a cause to an effect is said
        to be certain when the cause infallibly produces its effect.
        Consequently, since God’s foreknowledge does not imply, in all cases, a
        relation of a cause to all the t1iings which are its objects, it is
        considered to have only the certitude of knowledge. But His
        predestination adds another element, because it includes not only His
        foreknowledge but also the relation of a cause to its objects, since
        predestination is a kind of direction or preparation. Thus, not only the
        certitude of knowledge, but also the certitude of ordination is
        contained in predestination. Now we are concerned only with the
        certitude of predestination; the certitude of knowledge, found also in
        predestination, has been explained in our investigation of God’s
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be known that, since predestination is a particular type of
        providence, not only its notion adds something to providence, but also
        its certitude adds something to the certitude of providence. Now, the
        ordering of providence is found to be certain in two respects. First, it
        is certain with relation to a particular thing, when God’s providence
        ordains things to some particular end, and they attain that end without
        failure. This is evident in the motions of celestial spheres and in all
        things in nature that act necessarily. Second, providence is certain in
        relation to things in general, but not in particular. For example, we
        see that the power of beings capable of generation and corruption
        sometimes falls short of the proper effects to which it has been ordered
        as its proper ends. Thus, the power that shapes bodies sometimes falls
        short of forming members completely. Yet, as we saw above when treating
        providence, these very defects are directed by God to some end.
        Consequently, nothing can fail to attain the general end of providence,
        even though it may at times fall short of a particular end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The ordering of predestination, however, is certain, not only with
        respect to its general end, but also with respect to a particular and
        determinate end. For one who is ordained to salvation by predestination
        never fails to obtain it. Moreover, the ordering of predestination is
        not certain with reference to a particular end in the way in which the
        ordering of providence is; for, in providence, the ordering is not
        certain with respect to a particular end unless the proximate cause
        necessarily produces its effect. In predestination, however, there is
        certitude with respect to an individual end even though the proximate
        cause, free choice, does not produce that effect except in a contingent
        manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, it seems difficult to reconcile the infallibility of
        predestination with freedom of choice; for we cannot say that
        predestination adds nothing to the certitude of providence except the
        certitude of foreknowledge, because this would be to say that God orders
        one who is predestined to his salvation as He orders any other person,
        with this difference, that, in the case of the predestined, God knows he
        will not fail to be saved. According to this position, one predestined
        would not differ in ordination from one not predestined; he would differ
        only with respect to [God’s] foreknowledge of the outcome. Consequently,
        foreknowledge would be the cause of predestination, and predestination
        would not take place by the choice of Him who predestines. This,
        however, is contrary to the authority of the Scriptures” and the sayings
        of the saints. Thus, the ordering of predestination has an infallible
        certitude of its own—over and above the certitude of foreknowledge.
        Nevertheless, the proximate cause of salvation, free choice, is related
        to predestination contingently, not necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This can be considered in the following manner. We find that an ordering
        is infallible in regard to something in two ways. First, an individual
        cause necessarily brings about its own effect because of the ordering of
        divine providence. Secondly, a single effect may be attained only as the
        result of the convergence of many contingent causes individually capable
        of failure; but each one of these causes has been ordained by God either
        to bring about that effect itself if another cause should fail or to
        prevent that other cause from failing. We see, for example, that all the
        individual members of a species are corruptible. Yet, from the fact that
        one succeeds another, the nature of the species can be kept in
        existence; and this is how God keeps the species from extinction,
        despite the fact that the individual perishes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A similar case is had in predestination; for, even though free choice
        can fail with respect to salvation, God prepares so many other helps for
        one who is predestined that he either does not fall at all or, if he
        does fall, he rises again. The helps that God gives a man to enable him
        to gain salvation are exhortations, the support of prayer, the gift of
        grace, and all similar things. Consequently, if we were to consider
        salvation only in relation to its proximate cause, free choice,
        salvation would not be certain but contingent; however, in relation to
        the first cause, namely, predestination, salvation is certain.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The word crown as used in the Apocalypse (3:11) may mean either the
        crown of present justice or the crown of future glory. No matter which
        meaning is taken, however, one person is said to receive the crown of
        another when that other person falls in the sense that the goods of one
        person help another, either by aiding him to merit or even by increasing
        his glory. The reason for this is that all the members of the Church are
        connected by charity in such a way that their goods are common.
        Consequently, one receives the crown of another when that other falls
        through sin and does not achieve the reward of his merits; and another
        person receives the fruits of the sinner’s merits, just as he would have
        benefited from the sinner’s merits had the latter persevered. From this,
        however, it does not follow that predestination is ever in vain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or it can be answered that one is said to receive the crown of another,
        not because the other lost a crown that was predestined for him, but
        because whenever a person loses the crown that was due to him because of
        the justice he possessed, another person is substituted in his place to
        make up the number of the elect—just as men have been substituted to
        take the place of the fallen angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A natural effect issuing infallibly from God’s providence takes place
        because of one proximate cause necessarily ordered to the effect. The
        ordering of predestination, however, is not made certain in this manner
        but in the manner described above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A celestial body, taken in itself, imposes a kind of determinism in
        its action on bodies here below. Consequently, its effect necessarily
        takes place, unless something resists it. But God does not act on the
        will in the manner of one necessitating; for He does not force the will
        but merely moves it, without taking away its own proper mode, which
        consists in being free with respect to opposites. Consequently, even
        though nothing can resist the divine will, our will, like everything
        else, carries out the divine will according to its own proper mode.
        Indeed, the divine will has given things their mode of being in order
        that His will be fulfilled. Therefore, some things fulfill the divine
        will necessarily, other things, contingently; but that which God wills
        always takes place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The second cause, which we must suppose as prerequisite for obtaining
        the effect of predestination, lies also under the ordering of
        predestination. The relationship between lower powers and the power of a
        superior agent is not one of predestination. Consequently, even though
        the ordering of God’s predestination includes the supposition of a human
        will, it nevertheless has absolute certitude, despite the fact that the
        example given points to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Those words of Job and Gregory should be referred to the state of
        present justice. If some fall from it, others are chosen in their place.
        From this, therefore, we cannot conclude to any uncertainty with
        reference to predestination; for those who fall from grace at the end
        were never predestined at all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The comparison Anselm makes holds good in this respect, that just as
        the truth of a proposition about the future does not remove contingency
        from a future event, so also the truth of predestination [does not take
        away the contingency of predestination]. But, in another respect, the
        comparison is weak. For a proposition about the future is related to the
        future in so far as it is future, and, under this aspect, it cannot be
        certain. As we pointed out previously, however, the truth of
        predestination and foreknowledge is related to the future as present,
        and, consequently, is certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. A thing can be said to be possible in two ways. First, we may
        consider the potency that exists in the thing itself, as when we say
        that a stone can be moved downwards. Or we may consider the potency that
        exists in another thing, as when we say that a stone can be moved
        upwards, not by a potency existing in the stone, but by a potency
        existing in the one who hurls it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, when we say: “That predestined person can possibly die in
        sin,” the statement is true if we consider only the potency that exists
        in him. But, if we are speaking of this predestined person according to
        the ordering which he has to another, namely, to God, who is
        predestining him, that event is incompatible with this ordering, even
        though it is compatible with the person’s own power. Hence, we can use
        the distinction given above; that is, we can consider the subject with
        this form or without it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Blackness and whiteness are, in a sense, examples of forms that exist
        in a subject said to be white or black. Consequently, nothing can be
        attributed to the subject, either according to potency or according to
        act, as long as blackness remains, if it is repugnant to this form of
        blackness. Predestination, however, is a form that exists, not in the
        person predestined, but in the one predestining, just as the
        <i>known</i> gets its, name from knowledge in the knower. Consequently,
        no matter how fixed predestination may remain in the order of knowledge,
        yet, if we consider only the nature [of the predestined], we can
        attribute something to it which is repugnant to the ordering of
        predestination. For, considered this way, predestination is something
        other than the man who is said to be predestined, just as blackness is
        something other than the essence of a crow, even though it is not
        something outside the crow, but, by considering only the essence of a
        crow, one can attribute to it something that is repugnant to its
        blackness. For this reason, as Porphyry says, one can think of a white
        crow. Similarly, in the problem being discussed, one can attribute
        something to a predestined person taken in himself which cannot be
        attributed to him in so far as he is predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Creation and mission imply the production of a temporal effect.
        Consequently, they affirm the existence of a temporal effect, and so
        must be temporal themselves, even though they include something eternal.
        Predestination, however, does not imply the production of a temporal
        effect—as the word itself shows—but only an ordering to something
        temporal, such as will, power, and all such attributes also imply. Since
        it does not affirm the actual existence of a temporal effect, which is
        also contingent, predestination is not necessarily temporal and
        contingent itself, because from eternity something can be unchangeably
        ordained to a temporal and contingent effect.

        10. Absolutely speaking, it is possible for God to predestine or not to
        predestine each and every person, and it is possible for Him to have
        predestined or not to have predestined. For, since the act of
        predestination is measured by eternity, it never is past and never is
        future. Consequently, it is always considered as issuing from His will
        as something free. Because of the supposition, however, certain things
        are impossible: He cannot predestine if He has predestined, and He
        cannot predestine if He has already not predestined—for God does not
        change. Hence, it does not follow that predestination can change.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No number is certain if something can be added to it. But something
        can be added to the number of the predestined, because Moses’ petition
        for such an increase is described in Deuteronomy (1:11) where he says:
        “The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands.” And
        the Gloss comments: “This number is fixed by God, who knows who belong
        to Him.” Now, unless such an addition were possible, Moses would have
        asked in vain. Consequently, the number of the predestined is not
        certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As we are prepared for grace through the disposition of natural
        perfections, so are we prepared through grace for the attainment of
        glory. Now, grace is found in whomsoever there is sufficient preparation
        of natural gifts. Similarly, then, glory will be found wherever grace is
        found. But one not predestined may, at one time, possess grace.
        Therefore, he will possess glory and so be predestined. Consequently,
        one not predestined may become predestined. In this way, the number of
        the predestined can be increased; hence, it is not certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If one who has grace is not to have glory, his loss of glory will be
        due to a failure either on the part of grace or on the part of the one
        giving glory. However, this loss cannot be due to a failure on the part
        of grace, for, in itself, it sufficiently disposes for glory; nor can it
        be due to a failure on the part of the one giving glory, for, on His
        part, He is ready to give it to all. Consequently, whoever has grace
        will necessarily have glory. Thus, one who is foreknown [as lost] will
        have glory and be predestined. Accordingly, our original argument
        stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whoever prepares himself sufficiently for grace, gets grace. But one
        foreknown [as lost] can prepare himself for grace. Therefore, it is
        possible for him to have grace. Whoever has grace, however, can
        persevere in it. So it seems that one who is foreknown [as lost] can
        persevere in grace up to the time of his death and thus become
        predestined. Consequently, the same must be said as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said, however, that God’s foreknowledge that a man will die
        without grace is necessary by conditional necessity, not by absolute
        necessity.—On the contrary, any necessity, which lacks a beginning and
        an end, and which is without succession, is not conditional but simple
        and absolute. Now, this is the kind of necessity that the necessity of
        foreknowledge is, because it is eternal. Therefore, it is simple and not
        conditioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. A number larger than any finite number is possible. But the number of
        the predestined is finite. Therefore, a larger number is possible, and
        the number of the predestined is not certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Since good communicates itself, infinite goodness should not impose a
        limit on its communication. Now, the divine goodness communicates itself
        to the predestined in the highest possible degree. Therefore, it does
        not belong to the divine goodness to establish a certain number of
        predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Like the creation of things, the predestination of men depends on the
        divine will. Now, God can make more things than He has made, because, as
        we read in Wisdom (12:18): “His power is at hand when He wills.”
        Similarly, He has not predestined so many men that He cannot predestine
        more; and so our original argument returns.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Whatever God was at one time able to do He still is able to do. But
        from eternity God was able to predestine one whom He did not predestine.
        Consequently, He is still able to predestine him, and so an addition can
        be made to the number of the predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. In the case of all powers not determined to one course of action,
        what can be can also not be. Now, the power of the one predestining with
        respect to the one to be predestined, and the power of the one
        predestined with respect to his obtaining the effect of predestination,
        belong to this class of powers, because the one predestining predestines
        by His will, and the one predestined obtains the effect of
        predestination by his will. Consequently, the predestined can be
        non-predestined, and the non-predestined can be predestined. Hence, the
        conclusion is the same as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. In commentary on that verse in Luke (5:6), “And their net broke,”
        the Gloss reads: “In the Church, the net of circumcision is broken, for
        not as many Jews enter as were preordained by God to life.”
        Consequently, since the number of the predestined can be diminished, it
        is not certain.

        1. Augustine says: “The number of the predestined is certain and can
        neither be increased nor diminished.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine says: “The heavenly Jerusalem, our mother, the City of God,
        will not be robbed of any of the number of its citizens nor will it
        reign with more than the predestined number.” Now, the citizens
        mentioned are the predestined. Consequently, the number of the
        predestined cannot be increased or decreased. Hence, it is certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whoever is predestined is predestined from eternity. But what exists
        from eternity is unchangeable, and what did not exist from eternity can
        never be eternal. Consequently, he who is not predestined cannot be
        predestined and, conversely, he who is predestined cannot be
        non-predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. After the resurrection, all the predestined will be in the highest
        heaven with their own bodies. Now, that place is finite, since all
        bodies are finite, and, as is commonly held, not even two glorified
        bodies can exist, simultaneously [in one place]. Consequently, the
        number of the predestined should be determinate.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Treating this question, some have distinguished, saying that the number
        of the predestined is certain if we mean number understood actively or
        formally, but not certain if we mean number understood passively or
        materially. For example, one could say that it is certain that one
        hundred have been predestined, but it is not certain who these one
        hundred are. The occasion for such a position seems to be the words of
        Augustine mentioned previously. Augustine seems to imply that one can
        lose and another receive the predestined crown without the number of the
        predestined at all varying. But, if those holding this opinion are
        speaking about certitude of predestination in its relation to the first
        cause, that is, to God who predestines, then the opinion is entirely
        absurd, because God Himself has definite knowledge of the number of the
        predestined, whether the number be taken formally or materially. He
        knows exactly how many and who are to be saved, and, with respect to
        both, His ordination is infallible. Consequently, with respect to both
        numbers, God has certitude, not only of knowledge, but also of
        ordination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the other hand, if we are speaking about the certitude that can be
        had about the number of the predestined from its relation to the
        proximate cause of man’s salvation (to which predestination is
        ordained), then our judgment about the formal number and the material
        number will not be the same. For, since the salvation of each individual
        has been produced through free choice as through its proximate cause, in
        some way the material number is subject to man’s will, which is
        changeable. Consequently, the material number in some way lacks
        certainty. But the formal number is not determined in any manner by
        man’s will, because by no kind of causality does the human will affect
        the number of the predestined taken as a whole. Consequently, the formal
        number remains completely certain. In this way the aforementioned
        distinction can be sustained, as long as we concede, without any
        qualifications, that both numbers are certain as far as God is
        concerned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be noted, moreover, that the number of the predestined is
        certain in this respect, that it cannot be increased or diminished. The
        number could be increased if one who was foreknown [as lost] could be
        predestined; but this would be contrary to the certainty of
        foreknowledge or of reprobation. Again, the number could be diminished
        if it were possible for one who is predestined to become
        non-predestined; but this would be contrary to the certainty of
        predestination. Thus, it is clear that the certitude about the number of
        the predestined is made up of two certitudes, the certitude of
        predestination and the certitude of foreknowledge or reprobation. These
        two certitudes differ, however; for, as has been said, the certitude of
        predestination is the certitude of knowledge and of direction to an end,
        while the certitude of foreknowledge is merely the certitude of
        knowledge. For God does not preordain the reprobate to sin as He ordains
        the predestined to merit.

        1. That quotation from Deuteronomy should be understood as referring,
        not to the number of the predestined, but to the number of those who are
        in the state of present justice. This is clear from the
        <i>Interlinear Gloss,</i> which adds: “In number and in merit.” Now,
        this number of those in present justice is both increased and
        diminished; but God’s appointment, which predefines this number, too, is
        never wrong, because it is He who decrees that there be more of these at
        one time and fewer at another. Or we could even answer that God defines
        a certain number in the manner of a judgment in harmony with inferior
        reasons, and this limitation can be changed; but He predestines another
        number in the manner of an election in harmony with superior reasons,
        and this limitation cannot be changed. For Gregory says: “He changes His
        judgment but never His election.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. No preparation disposes anything to have a perfection at a time other
        than its proper time. For example, his natural temperament may dispose a
        boy to be brave or wise—not, however, in the days of his childhood, but
        in the days of his manhood. Now, the time when one obtains grace is
        simultaneous with the time when nature is prepared. Consequently, no
        barrier can come between them. Thus, when the preparation of nature is
        found in a person, grace is also found in him. But the time when one
        obtains glory is not simultaneous with the time when he has grace.
        Consequently, a barrier can come between these two. For this reason, one
        who is foreknown to possess grace will not necessarily possess glory
        also.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That one who had grace is nevertheless deprived of glory is not due
        to failure either on the part of grace or on the part of Him who gives
        glory. It is due rather to a failure on the part of the recipient, in
        whom an impediment has arisen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. When we affirm that a person is foreknown [as lost], we thereby
        affirm that he will not have final grace; for, as we pointed out
        previously,” God’s knowledge is directed to future things as though they
        were present. Consequently, just as the condition of not having final
        grace cannot be reconciled with the condition of having final grace,
        even though the former condition is possible if taken by itself, so the
        condition of having final grace cannot be reconciled with the condition
        of being foreknown [as lost], even though the former condition is also
        possible if taken by itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The fact that such a thing known by God is not absolutely necessary
        comes, not from a defect in God’s knowledge, but from a defect in the
        proximate cause. On the other hand, the reason why this necessity is
        eternal—without beginning and end, and, as it were, without
        succession—comes from God’s knowledge, which is eternal, not from the
        proximate cause, which is temporal and changeable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Even though finite number as finite number does not prevent a larger
        number from existing, the impossibility may come from another source,
        namely, from the fixed character of God’s foreknowledge, which is
        apparent in the problem at hand. Similarly, when we consider the size of
        some natural thing, we see that a larger size cannot exist, not because
        of the nature of quantity, but because of the nature of the thing
        itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The divine goodness communicates itself only under the guidance of
        wisdom, for this is the best manner for its communication. Now, as we
        read in Wisdom (11:2 1), the ordering of God’s wisdom requires that all
        things be made according to “number, weight, and measure.” Consequently,
        that there be a definite number of predestined is in harmony with God’s
        goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. As is clear from what was said previously, while it may be granted
        with reference to a determined person that God, absolutely speaking, can
        predestine or not predestine him, nevertheless, supposing that God has
        predestined him, He cannot not predestine him. Nor is the opposite
        possible, because God cannot change. Consequently, it is commonly said
        that the following proposition, “God can predestine one who is not
        predestined or not predestine one who is predestined,” is false if taken
        in a composite sense, but true if taken in a divided sense. All
        statements, therefore, which imply that composite sense are absolutely
        false. Thus, we must not concede that the number of the predestined can
        be increased or diminished, because addition presupposes something which
        is increased, and subtraction, something which is diminished. For the
        same reason, we cannot concede that God can predestine more or fewer
        than He has already predestined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Furthermore, the example drawn from the making of things is not to the
        point; for making is a particular action terminating exteriorly in an
        effect, and the fact that God makes something first and does not make it
        later indicates no change in God but only in the effect. On the other
        hand, predestination, foreknowledge, and similar things are acts
        intrinsic to God; and no change can take place in them without a change
        taking place in God. Nothing, therefore, that implies a change in these
        acts should be granted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9-10. The answer to these arguments is clear, for they are based on an
        understanding of God’s power as absolute, not as modified by a
        supposition of predestination or non-predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. That Gloss should be understood as meaning this: the number of Jews
        entering is not as large as the total number of all those who have been
        preordained to life, for it is not only Jews who have been predestined.
        Or one could reply that the Gloss is not speaking about the
        preordination of predestination but about the preordination of
        preparation by which the Jews were disposed for life by means of the
        Law. Or, finally, one could reply that not as many Jews entered the
        early Church as are predestined, because, as we read in the Epistle to
        the Romans(11:25-26): “When the fulness of the Gentiles should come
        in... all Israel will be saved” in the Church at the end of time.

        salvation. But predestination pertains very much to salvation, since it
        is the cause of salvation. Consequently, through an unction they
        receive, all men are made certain of their predestination.

        2. It is consonant with God’s goodness, which does all things in the
        best possible way, to lead men to their reward in the best possible way.
        Now, the best possible way seems to be that each and every man be
        certain of his reward. Therefore, each and every person who is
        predestined is given assurance that he will come to his reward.
        Consequently, the same must be said as before.

        There is nothing inconsistent in the revelation to some person of the
        fact of his predestination; but, in view of His general law, it would be
        inconsistent if He revealed this to all the predestined for the
        following two reasons. The first reason may be found by considering
        those who are not predestined. Now, if all the predestined knew that
        they were predestined, then all those not predestined would know that
        they were not predestined from the very fact that they did not know if
        they were predestined. This would, in some way, lead them to despair.
        The second reason may be found by considering those who are predestined.
        Now, security is the mother of negligence; and if the predestined were
        certain, about their predestination, they would be secure about their
        salvation. Consequently, they would not exercise so great care in
        avoiding evil. Hence, it has been wisely ordained by God’s providence
        that men should be ignorant of their predestination or reprobation.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. When Scripture says that His unction teaches everything connected
        with salvation, this should be understood as referring to those things
        knowledge of which pertains to salvation, not to all those things which,
        in themselves, do pertain to salvation. And, although predestination
        itself is necessary for salvation, knowledge of predestination is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is not proper, when giving a reward, to give the person who is to
        receive it unconditional assurance. The proper way is to give
        conditional assurance to the one for whom the reward is being prepared,
        namely, that the re*ard will be given him unless he fails on his part.
        This kind of assurance is given to all the predestined through the
        infusion of the virtue of hope.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. One cannot know with any certainty that he is in the state of
        meriting, although he can know, by conjecture, that this is probably the
        case. For a habit never can be known except through its acts, and the
        acts of the infused supernatural virtues greatly resemble the acts of
        the acquired natural virtues. Consequently, it is not easy to be certain
        that acts of this kind have their source in grace, unless, by a special
        privilege, a person is made certain of it through a revelation.
        Moreover, he who is enrolled by the leader of an army for a secular
        struggle is given only conditional assurance of his reward, because one
        “is not crowned,—except he strive lawfully” (2 Timothy 2:5).

        2. When one thing has its effect whether another thing is present or
        not, the latter is no help to it. But predestination must have its
        effect, because it cannot fail whether prayers take place or not.
        Consequently, predestination is not helped by prayers.

        Now, in a natural body, a member does not acquire its perfection by
        means of another member. Consequently, the same is true [of members] in
        the mystical body. But the members of the mystical body receive their
        greatest perfection through the effects of predestination. Therefore,
        one man is not aided in obtaining the effects of predestination by the
        prayers of another.

        1. We read in Genesis (25:2 1): “Isaac besought the Lord for his wife
        because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.”
        As a result of this conception Jacob was born, who had been predestined
        from all eternity; and this predestination would never have been
        fulfilled had he not been born. But it was effected by the prayer of
        Isaac. Consequently, predestination is helped by prayers.

        2. In a certain sermon on the conversion of St. Paul, in which the Lord
        is represented as speaking to Paul, we read: “Unless Stephen, my
        servant, had prayed for you, I would have destroyed you.” The prayers of
        Stephen, therefore, freed Paul from reprobation; and so through these
        prayers he was predestined. Hence, we conclude as before.

        3. One can merit the first grace for someone. For the same reason,

        That predestination can be helped by the prayers of the saints can be
        understood in two ways. First, it can mean that the prayers of the
        saints help one to be predestined. This, however, cannot be true of
        prayers, either as they exist in their own proper condition, which is
        temporal while predestination is eternal, or as they exist in God’s
        foreknowledge, because, as explained above, foreknowledge of merits is.
        not the cause of predestination, whether the merits be one’s own or
        those of another. On the other hand, that predestination is furthered by
        the prayers of the saints can mean that their prayers help us obtain the
        effect of predestination as an instrument helps one in finishing his
        work. The problem has been considered in this way by all those who have
        studied God’s providence over human affairs. Their answers, however,
        have been different.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Attending only to the immutability of God’s decrees, some4have declared
        that prayer, sacrifice, and similar actions help in no way at all. This
        is said to have been the opinion of the Epicureans, who taught that all
        things happened necessarily because of the influence of celestial
        bodies, which they called gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others said that sacrifices and prayers help to this extent, that they
        change the preordination made by those who have the power to determine
        human acts. This is said to have been the opinion of the Stoics, who
        taught that all things are ruled by certain spirits whom they called
        gods; and, even though something had been pre-established by them,
        according to the Stoics, such a prearrangement could be changed by
        placating their souls through prayers and sacrifices. Avicenna seems to
        have fallen into this error, too; for he asserts that all human actions
        whose principle is the human will can be reduced to the wills of
        celestial souls. He thought that the heavenly bodies had souls, and,
        just as a heavenly body influences a human body, so, according to him,
        the celestial souls influence human souls. In fact, what takes place in
        things here below is according to the notions of these celestial souls.
        Consequently, he thought that sacrifices and prayers helped these souls
        to conceive what we wished to take place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These theories, however, are opposed to the Faith. For the first
        destroys freedom of choice; the second, the certainty of predestination.
        Consequently, we must answer the problem differently, and must say that,
        while God’s predestination never changes, prayers and other good works
        are nevertheless effective in obtaining the effect of predestination.
        Now, when considering any order of causes, we must consider not only the
        order of the first cause to the effect but also the order of the second
        cause to the effect and the order of the first cause to the second
        cause, since the second cause is ordered to an effect only through the
        direction of the first cause. For, as is clear from <i>The Causes</i>,
        the first cause gives to the second cause the power of influencing the
        effect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I say, therefore, that the effect of predestination is man’s salvation,
        and this comes from it as from its first cause. It can have, however,
        many other proximate and, as it were, instrumental causes, which are
        ordered by divine predestination for man’s salvation, as tools are used
        by a craftsman for completing a product of his craft. Consequently, the
        effect of God’s predestination is not only that an individual person be
        saved but also that he be saved by certain prayers or certain merits.
        Gregory also said this: “What holy men effect by their prayers is
        predestined to be obtained by prayer.” Consequently, Boethius says: “If
        we pray well, our prayers cannot be without effect.”

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. There is nothing that can check the ordering of predestination.
        Consequently, predestination cannot be impeded. Many things, however,
        are related to the ordering of predestination as intermediate causes;
        and these are said to further predestination in the manner described.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. From the fact that it is predestined that a certain man will be saved
        because of certain prayers, these prayers cannot be omitted without
        detriment to his predestination. The same is true of man’s salvation,
        which is the effect of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument proves that prayer does not help predestination by
        being, as it were, its cause. This we concede.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The effects of predestination, which are grace and glory, are not, as
        it were, basic perfections but secondary perfections. Now, even though
        the members of a natural body do not help each other in acquiring their
        basic perfections, they nevertheless do help each other to acquire their
        secondary perfections. There is, moreover, a member in the body which,
        having been formed first, helps in the formation of other
        members—namely, the heart. Consequently, the argument proceeds on a
        false assumption.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We concede this argument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Paul was never reprobated according to the disposition made by divine
        election, because this is unchangeable. He was reprobated, however,
        according to a [provisional] judgment of God in harmony with lower
        causes, a judgment which sometimes changes. It follows, therefore, not
        that prayer was the cause of predestination, but that it furthered only
        the effect of predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although predestination and final grace are interchangeable, it does
        not necessarily follow that whatever is the cause of final grace in any
        manner whatsoever is also the cause of predestination. This is clear
        from what has been said previously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although Trajan was in the place of the damned, he was not damned
        absolutely; for he was predestined to be saved by the prayers of
        Gregory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We concede the fifth argument.
