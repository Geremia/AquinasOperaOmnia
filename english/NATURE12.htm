      <strong>12.1 Five arrangements of motion and rest in the universe</strong>
      (Book 8, Lessons 5-6)
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle proposes five possibilities for the distribution of motion and
      rest in the universe and rejects four of them:
    </p>
    <p>1) That all things be always at rest and nothing ever in motion.</p>
    <p>2) That all things be always in motion and nothing at rest.</p>
    <p>
      That some things are in motion and others at rest, in any of three ways:
    </p>
    <p>
      3) that the things that are in motion are always in motion and those at
      rest always at rest, and nothing at one time in motion an at another time
      in rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      4) that all things are apt to be in motion and to rest and that nothing is
      either always in motion or always at rest,
    </p>
    <p>
      5) that certain things are always immobile and never in motion, others are
      always mobile and never at rest; still others may be in motion at one time
      and at rest at another.
    </p>
    <p>Aristotle omits two more possibilities:</p>
    <p>
      6) that certain things are always immobile and never in motion, while all
      others may be in motion at one time and at rest at another,
    </p>
    <p>
      7) that certain things are always in motion, while all others may be in
      motion at one time and at rest at another.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The first possibility, maintained by Zeno, Parmenides and Melissus, is
      against all evidence and challenges the first principles of natural
      philosophy. Now an error that affects all beings and all sciences is not
      to be reproved by the philosopher of nature but by the metaphysician, who
      considers first principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) The second possibility represents the opinion of Heraclitus, who said
      that all things are always in motion. It is also against the evident
      principles of natural science to say that there is no such thing as rest
      in the universe. But it is less evident that there is no motion than that
      there is no rest. For there are some motions so weak and insignificant
      that they can be scarcely noticed; for that reason it is easy to suppose
      that something is at rest when it really is not. But great and strong
      motions cannot be concealed; hence it cannot be said that the senses are
      deceived in perceiving motion as they are in perceiving rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heraclitus was led to his doctrine as a result of considering growth. For
      he observed that a person grows a small amount in one year and, supposing
      that growth is continuous, he believed that in each part of that year he
      was increased with respect to part of that quantity; and yet that increase
      is not sensed, because it comes in a small portion of time. He reasoned,
      therefore, that the same thing happens in other things which seem to be at
      rest. Aristotle argues on the contrary that some growth is in spurts:
      nutriment slowly disposes the organism and at the right time a rapid
      multiplication of cells takes place; the same thing could be said of any
      motion of alteration. Besides, each of these motions has a final term,
      whether of growth or alteration, when the mobile rests in what it has
      reached. As for local motion, rest in a terminal (such as on the ground)
      is obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) The third possibility is likewise against sense observation, that some
      things alternate between motion and rest. It also excludes compulsory
      motion, which is contrary to the natural rest of a thing, and generation
      and corruption, which suppose an alternation between existence and
      non-existence. Also it destroys all motion that goes from one term to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      (4) The fourth view, that all things are apt to be in motion and to rest
      and that nothing is either always in motion or always at rest, can be
      refuted by establishing the existence of an immobile first mover, which is
      what Aristotle attempts to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12.2 "Whatever is moved is moved by another."</strong> (Book 7,
      Lesson 1)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is obvious that some things are moved by another, whenever the
      principle of motion is from without, such as in pushing, pulling, heating
      etc. This is termed "compulsory" motion. What is not obvious is how
      something which has within itself a principle of motion is moved by
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where anything moves itself, it is by reason of one part moving another,
      since mover and moved are mutually opposite as act to potency, as when an
      animal walks by movement of its legs (cf. Book 8, Lessons 10-11). If we
      ask further what moves the legs, we ultimately come to the brain, where
      the motor centre controlling the nerves and muscles is directed by the
      knowledge and desire of the animal's soul. What is impossible is that a
      solid whole should move itself, because something cannot be in act
      (imparting motion) and in potency (receiving motion) at the same time
      under the same aspect.
    </p>
    <p><strong>12.3 Gravitational movement</strong> (Book 8, Lessons 7-8)</p>
    <p>
      What of gravitational motion, which is not compulsory but natural? First,
      gravitational fall is not self-motion, since self-motion is proper to
      animate bodies which can start or stop their motion and move one way or
      another according to appetite, whereas heavy bodies, as such, are not
      animate and must fall if there is no impediment, and they must fall down.
      More fundamentally, gravitational fall applies to solid continuous bodies
      (without flexible limbs), where there can be no division between moving
      and moved parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand gravitation, we must consider the different senses of "being
      in potency": One can be in potency to knowledge before he has learned
      something. But after he has learned it, but has another potency to think
      about what he has learned; to activate this potency (which is virtually in
      act) he needs no outside agent, but simply has to think, unless he is
      prevented by other occupations or by sickness or by his will. On the other
      hand, if he were not impeded and still could not think, then he would not
      be in the habit of science but in its contrary, namely ignorance.
      Likewise, the nature of the heavy is to have an aptitude to be down.
      Hence, to ask why a heavy thing is moved downward is exactly the same as
      to ask why it is heavy. Consequently, the generator is the
      <em>per se</em> mover of the heavy, whereas the remover of obstacles is a
      <em>per accidens</em> mover. The gravitational motion of heavy things is
      natural, because they have in themselves the principle of their motion,
      not indeed a moving or active principle but a passive one, which is a
      potency to such-and-such an act.
    </p>
    <p><strong>12.4 Magnetism and projection</strong> (Book 7, Lesson 3)</p>
    <p>
      A magnet moves a piece of iron from a distance through an electric field
      set up in the medium encompassing it and the iron. The earth has a similar
      magnetic field that affects a compass; so does the electric motor. Thus
      magnetism operates by altering the molecular structure of the iron it
      affects and in this way pulls it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projection, however, Aristotle explains as a reverberation between the
      projectile and the air: the projectile pushing the air and the air coming
      from behind and pushing the projectile. In Book 8, Lesson 8, however,
      Thomas says: "When a ball rebounds from a wall, it is moved
      <em>per accidens</em> by the wall but <em>per se</em> by the one who first
      threw it. For it was not the wall but the thrower that gave it the
      <strong>impetus</strong> for motion, but it was
      <em>per accidens</em> that, being prevented by the wall from continuing
      according to its <strong>impetus</strong>, it rebounded into a contrary
      motion, the original <strong>impetus</strong> remaining." Again in
      <em>De potentia</em> (q.3, a.11, ad 5) Thomas says: "An instrument is
      understood to be moved by the principal agent as long as it retains the
      power of the principal agent impressed in itself; thus an arrow is moved
      by the archer as long as the power of the archer's impulse remains." Thus
      Thomas introduces the modern notion of impetus, which is a form, similar
      to heaviness (or knowledge in the above comparison) which accounts for the
      projectile's motion. This is an accidental form that acts in a similar way
      to natural heaviness, but is transient in that can be corrupted by
      resistance (or friction).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus everything moved is moved by another, but not always here and now,
      because both natural movement (whether gravitational or living self-motion
      from a soul power) and compulsory (as in a projectile) last in the mobile
      after the generator or mover has conferred on it a virtual motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12.5 There is no infinite series of moved movers</strong> (Book 7,
      Lesson 2)
    </p>
    <p>
      We must keep in mind that in a series of moved movers, the last thing
      (which is simply moved) and the moved movers are being moved together,
      like coaches in a train, and the motion of each mobile is one and finite.
      Therefore there is a finite time for the motion of the whole series.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could be argued that the motion of an infinite series would have to be
      infinite and therefore take place in an infinite time, since finitude and
      infinitude of mobiles, motions and time are correlative. But this argument
      is not conclusive, since it is possible that there be an infinite motion
      in finite time, so long as the motion is not one and the same but other
      and other, namely, as an infinite number of things are being moved. For
      there is nothing to prevent an infinite number of things from being moved
      at once in finite time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter argument could be made efficacious if we assumed that the
      infinite number of moved movers were not separate mobiles, but one
      continuous mobile; in that case its motion would be infinite. One could
      object that it is impossible to the specific natures of most things for
      them be joined together in one enormous continuous body. Yet there is
      nothing opposed to this in the generic nature of a body. So the argument
      holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gives another argument (Book 8, Lesson 9): It has been shown that
      whatever is being moved is being moved by another. But that by which it is
      moved is itself either moved or not moved; and if it is moved, it is
      either moved by another or not. But if there is something which is moved
      by another, it is necessary to come to a first that is not moved by
      another. This is because in an infinite series there is no first. But if
      the first does not act, the last does not act, and there will be no mover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the process from a first mover, we can see that in a series of
      instruments moved by the hand, none of them would be active without the
      influence of the first.
    </p>
    <p><strong>12.6 A first unmoved mover</strong> (Book 8, Lesson 12-13)</p>
    <p>
      If a mover is the first of a series, it necessarily follows that it not be
      moved by another <em>per se</em>, although it is possible it be moved by
      another <em>per accidens</em>, as by removing an impediment (like taking
      off the breaks).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for there to be a series of moved movers according to one
      motion where the first mover of this series is moved according to another
      motion. Thus a series of pistons belts and rods can move the wheels of a
      car, all according to local motion, but the pistons are driven by
      combustion of fuel, which is alteration and substantial change. But since
      the different kinds of motion, even when the series branches into another
      kind of motion it cannot be infinite. It is possible in a series to revert
      to the first kind of motion, but not in a circle to the same numerical
      starting point. Thus the combustion in a motor is controlled by the local
      motion of the driver's foot on the accelerator, and the motion begins with
      the driver's will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if we examine carefully such shifting between one species of motion
      and another, we find that we do not have a single series of moved movers
      in <em>per se</em> dependence on a first. Rather, at one step a mover may
      really be a <em>per accidens</em> cause of the subsequent movement. Thus
      the sending of fuel into the carburator is an accidental cause of
      combustion, since it merely supplies a condition for the natural motion of
      combustion. Aristotle uses the example of the motion of an animal, which
      can be traced <em>per se</em> to its soul, but <em>per accidens</em> to
      many external environmental factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convergence of accidental causes assures the continued cycle of
      generation and corruption in the world, but Aristotle looks beyond these
      to a cause to account for the generation and perishing of things being
      continued forever. He says that this cause cannot be something itself
      perishable, since what does not exist forever cannot be the cause of what
      is forever perpetual and necessary. Accordingly, therefore, it is manifest
      that if there are a million principles that are movers and immobile, and
      if there are many things that move themselves, of which some perish and
      others come to be, and among these some are mobile and some movers,
      nevertheless there must be something above all of them that by its power
      contains all the things which would be the cause of the continual change
      affecting them by which they sometimes are and sometimes are not and
      through which these latter are the cause of coming-to-be and of motion for
      others, and these for yet others. For every generator is a cause of
      generation to the thing generated, but it is from some imperishable first
      principle that perishable generators possess the characteristic of being
      causes of generation. If, therefore, the motion through which some things
      at one time exist and at another do not is perpetual, as has been
      postulated, and a perpetual effect cannot exist except from a perpetual
      cause, then necessarily, the first mover is perpetual, if it is one; and
      if there are more than one first mover, they too are perpetual.
    </p>
    <p>
      One perpetual principle ought to be posited rather than many, since finite
      principles ought to be preferred to infinite, and one first principle
      rather than many. For if the same effects happen or follow from positing
      finite principles as from positing infinite principles, one should assume
      that the principles are finite, and if one suffices that is better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12.7 The first mover is perpetual and wholly unmoved</strong>
      (Book 8, Lesson 13)
    </p>
    <p>
      If some principle is an immobile mover, yet moved
      <em>per accidens</em> (as a soul moved with a body), it cannot cause a
      continuous and perpetual motion. For the reason that animals do not always
      move is that they are moved <em>per accidens</em> (by environment). But it
      has been shown that the motion of the universe must be continuous and
      perpetual. Therefore, the first moving cause in the whole universe must be
      not be moveable even <em>per accidens</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle has thus far argued for the immobility of the first mover from
      the perpetuity of motion in general. Now he tries to show that there is a
      single, continuous perpetual motion, which accounts for and is prior to
      all earthly generation and corruption. That he finds possible only in
      circular motion (Lessons 14-20), specifically in the motion of the stars
      and other heavenly bodies, which he supposed rotated daily around the
      earth as well as moving in some other elliptical paths. He argues (Lesson
      13) that motion and rest occur on earth because of the differing positions
      that the sun (mainly) has with regard to the earth.
    </p>
    <p><strong>12.8 Analysis of the argument thus far</strong></p>
    <p>
      Aristotle has argued that in any series of moved movers we must come to a
      first unmoved mover. Any essentially subordinated series we can think of
      terminates either at a natural principle, such as the soul of an animal
      and the form of heaviness in any body, or at a quasi-natural principle
      such as impetus in a projectile, which is a power for motion comparable to
      heaviness, except that it is transient. Aristotle and Thomas are clear
      that natural motion, by definition, comes from an internal principle and
      not from any outside cause. Any dependence of an essentially subordinated
      series of movers on further causality is by way of accidental
      subordination, such as the chicken-from-the-egg series. Such dependency on
      a generator or an imparter of impetus goes into the past and can go on
      infinitely with no first mover.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, can Aristotle maintain that this series of perpetual generation
      (on the assumption of the eternity of the world, as explained above)
      depends on an unmoved mover? Aristotle is not looking back into the past
      to account for the continuity of generation but for a mover here and now.
      In discussing both animal motion and the continuity of generation, he
      shows that all natural motion on the earth depends on environmental
      conditions. He does not enumerate them here, but they are the alternations
      of seasons, night and day, heat and cold, rain and dryness, wind etc.
      These are not causes, but conditions of natural motion, and in that sense
      accidental; nevertheless they are indispensable conditions for life and
      motion on this planet. Principally, these conditions boil down to the
      sun's alteration of the earth by heat and light and the local motion of
      the earthto correct Aristotleputting it at varying exposures to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle thought that the first motion responsible for all the other
      motions in the universe was that of the sphere of the "fixed stars"
      (embedded in the invisible sphere), which seems to rotate around the earth
      by an even and regular perpetual motion. This motion drags the spheres of
      the sun, moon and planets which, in addition, have their own proper motion
      which makes them deviate from the regular pattern of the fixed stars. The
      motion of each of these spheres, he says, but particularly the "first
      motion" of the fixed stars, requires an unmoved mover. Why is that? He
      goes on to explain:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >12.9 The first mover must have infinite power and be immaterial</strong
      >
      (Book 8, Lessons 21-23)
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle argues that it is impossible for anything of finite power to
      cause motion for an infinite time. But infinite power cannot exist in a
      magnitude (i.e. anything material). That is because any magnitude is
      finite and its power must therefore be limited. To the objection that an
      infinite power must move with infinite speed, Aristotle replies than any
      power which is not in a magnitude acts through an intellect, which can
      freely control its output to a finite speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle repeats that projectile motion cannot be perpetual and is not
      even continuous (although it appears to be) because the air set in motion
      in turn pushes the projectile and so on by a bouncing process called
      <em>antiperistasis</em>, until the motion dies out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then goes on to conclude that the mover of the "first motion" is
      immaterial, intellective and one. Thomas concludes: "And thus does the
      Philosopher in his general consideration of natural things terminate at
      the first principle of the whole of nature, Who is the One above all
      things, the ever blessed God. Amen."
    </p>
    <p><strong>12.10 Critique of this argument</strong></p>
    <p>
      Thomas' conclusion that this first mover is God jumps over Aristotle's
      further development of this argument in <em>Metaphysics XII</em>, where he
      maintains that the efficient mover of the first motion (maybe the soul of
      the star sphere) is itself moved by a completely separate intelligence in
      the order of final causality, i.e. as an object of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle had no idea of impetus or of the corresponding idea of inertia,
      which explains why, once the earth was set in motion, it keeps on spinning
      on its axis and rotating around the sun indefinitelyuntil what negligible
      resistance it encounters in the rarefied place called space eventually
      stops it. Just as a satellite requires energy to be put in space, but once
      it is there keeps on going without any more fuel, so the earth (and other
      planets and heavenly bodies in their own paths) goes on its way without
      any need of refuelling or additional push. Thus, if we graft the notion of
      impetus onto the Aristotelian system, there is no need to posit a
      spiritual mover of infinite power to explain heavenly motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere does Thomas disagree with Aristotle's argument. Even though we saw
      above that he ventured the concept of impetus, he never applied it to the
      motion of heavenly bodies. Thus he never questioned the assumption that,
      given the eternity of heavenly motion, there must be an immaterial mover
      of infinite power. And if, according to Christian faith, the world had a
      beginning in time, for all the more reason must there be an immaterial
      creator of infinite power. That is why he said that the way of proving
      God's existence by motion is "more manifest" (<em>Summa theologiae</em>,
      I, q. 2, a. 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas does, however, speak of different "ways" of proving the existence
      of God. These are not so much different proofs, but they look at different
      aspects of the potentiality and mobility of things, showing their
      dependence on an immaterial agent. In these ways Thomas never for once
      doubts Aristotle's universe or his "proofs", but his perspective goes
      beyond them to more solid ground.
