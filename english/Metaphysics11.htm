        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 1059a 18-1060a 2
      </p>
      <p>
        899. That wisdom is a science of principles, then, is evident from the
        first chapters (45-143) of this work, in which problems were raised
        concerning the statements of other philosophers about the principles of
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        900. But one might raise the question whether wisdom must be understood
        to be one science or many (181, 190). For if it is one, then the
        objection might be raised that one science always deals with contraries;
        but principles are not contraries. And if it is not one but many, what
        kind of sciences must they be assumed to be (190-197)?
      </p>
      <p>
        901. Further, one might raise the question whether it is the office of
        one science or of many to study the principles of demonstration? For if
        it is the office of one science, why should it be the office of this
        science rather than of another? And if it is the office of many, what
        kind of sciences must these be admitted to be (198-201)?
      </p>
      <p>
        902. Further, there is the question whether it is the office of wisdom
        to deal with all substances or not (182)? And if not with all, it is
        difficult to say with what kind it does deal. But if there is one
        science of all substances, the problem arises how one science can deal
        with many subjects (202-204).
      </p>
      <p>
        903. Again, there is the question whether this science is a
        demonstration of substances alone, or also of accidents (184, 205-207);
        for if it is a demonstration of accidents, it is not a demonstration of
        substances. But if there is a different science of accidents, what is
        the character of each, and which of the two is wisdom? For a
        demonstrative science of accidents is wisdom; but that which deals with
        primary things is the science of substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        904. But the science which we are seeking must not be assumed to be the
        one which deals with the causes mentioned in the <i>Physics</i>. For it
        does not deal with the final cause, because such is the good, and this
        is found in the sphere of practical affairs and in things which are in
        motion. And it is the first thing which causes motion (for the end is
        such a nature); but there is no first mover in the realm of immobile
        things (192).
      </p>
      <p>
        905. And in general there is the question whether the science which is
        now being sought is concerned with sensible substances, or whether it is
        not concerned with these but with certain others (183). For, if it deals
        with other substances, it must be concerned with either the separate
        Forms or with the objects of mathematics. Now it is evident that
        separate Forms do not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        906. But nevertheless even if one were to assume that these separate
        Forms exist, the problem would arise why the same thing should not be
        true of the other things of which there are Forms as is true of the
        objects of mathematics. I mean that they place the objects of
        mathematics between the Forms and sensible things as a kind of third
        class of entities besides the Forms and the things which exist here. But
        there is no third man or horse over and above man-in-himself and
        horse-in-itself and singular men and horses.
      </p>
      <p>
        907. If, however, the situation is not as they say, with what kind of
        things must the mathematician be assumed to deal? For he is not
        concerned with the things which exist here, because none of these are
        the kind of things which the mathematical sciences study. Nor is the
        science which we are now seeking concerned with the objects of
        mathematics; for no one of these is capable of existing separately. Nor
        does it deal with sensible substances, for these are corruptible
        (208-219).
      </p>
      <p>
        908. And in general one might raise the question to what science it
        belongs to consider the problem about the matter of the mathematical
        sciences (627). It is not the office of the philosophy of nature, for
        this science is wholly concerned with things which have in themselves a
        principle of rest and of motion. Nor is it the office of the science
        which investigates demonstration and scientific knowledge, for it is
        about this class of things that it makes its investigations. It follows,
        then, that it pertains to the philosophy which we have proposed to
        investigate these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        909. And one might raise the question whether the science which is now
        being sought must deal with the principles which are called elements by
        some thinkers (184). But all men suppose these to be present in
        composite things. And it would seem rather that the science which is now
        being sought ought to deal with universals, for every intelligible
        nature and every science is of universals and not of extremes (228), so
        that in this way they would deal with the primary genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        910. And these would become being and unity; for these most of all might
        be thought to contain all existing things and to be principles in the
        highest degree, because they are first by nature; for when they have
        been destroyed, everything else is destroyed, since everything is a
        being and one. But if one supposes them to be genera, then inasmuch as
        it is necessary for differences to participate in them, and no
        difference participates in a genus, it would seem that they must not be
        regarded either as genera or as principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        911. Further, if what is more simple is more of a principle than what is
        less simple, and the ultimate members resulting from the subdivision of
        different genera are more simple than the genera themselves (for these
        members are indivisible, whereas genera are divided into many different
        species), it would seem that species are principles to a greater degree
        than genera. But since species are involved in the destruction of their
        genera, genera are like principles to a greater degree; for whatever
        involves something else in its destruction is a principle of that thing
        (229-234). These and other such points, then, are the ones which cause
        difficulties.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2146. Because the particular sciences disregard certain things which
        should be investigated, there must be a universal science which examines
        these things. Now such things seem to be the common attributes which
        naturally belong to being in general (none of which are treated by the
        particular sciences since they do not pertain to one science rather than
        to another but to all in general) and to the separate substances, which
        lie outside the scope of every particular science. Therefore, in
        introducing us to such knowledge, Aristotle, after he has investigated
        these attributes, begins to deal particularly with the separate
        substances, the knowledge of which constitutes the goal to which the
        things studied both in this science and in the other sciences are
        ultimately directed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in order that a clearer understanding of the separate substances may
        be had, Aristotle first (899:C 2146) makes a summary of the points
        discussed both in this work and in the Physics’ which are useful for
        knowing the separate substances. Second (1055:C 2488), he investigates
        the separate substances in themselves (in the middle of the following
        book: “Since there are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he summarizes the
        points which act as a preface to the study of substances. In the second
        (1023:C 2416) he restates the things that pertain to the study of
        substances (at the beginning of the following book: “The study here”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He prefaced his study of substances by doing three things. First, he
        raised the questions given in Book 111, which he now restates under the
        first point of discussion. Second (924:C 2194), he expressed his views
        about the things that pertain to the study of this science. These are
        given in Book IV and are restated here under the second point of
        discussion (“Since the science”). Third (963:C 2268), he drew his
        conclusions about imperfect being, i.e., accidental being, motion, and
        the infinite, about which he had partly established the truth in Books
        II (152:C 299) and VI (543-59:C 1171-1244) of this work, and partly in
        Book III of the <i>Physics</i>; and he gives a summary restatement of
        these under the third point of discussion (“Since the term being”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. First, he raises a question about
        the study of this science; and second (912:C 2173), about the things
        established in this science (“Further, there is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he asks in what way
        the study of this science is concerned with principles and substances.
        Second (904: C 2156), he asks with what principles and what substances
        it deals (“But the science”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he raises questions
        about the study of the principles of this science; and second (902:C
        2152), about this science’s study of substances (“Further, there is the
        question”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first point (899) he does three things. First, he
        assumes that the inveselgations of this science are concerned with
        principles. He says that it is evident from Book I (45-143:C 93-272), in
        which he argued against the statements that other philosophers have made
        about the first principles of things, that wisdom is a science of
        principles. For it was shown in the Prologue to this work that wisdom
        considers the highest and most universal causes, and that it is the
        noblest of the sciences.
      </p>
      <p>2147. <span style="font-weight: bold">But one might</span> (900).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he raises a question about the study of the principles by this
        science which is called wisdom. He says that one can ask whether wisdom,
        which considers principles, must be one science or many.
      </p>
      <p>
        2148. However, if we say that it is one, this seems to be inconsistent,
        because many of the things studied in one science are contraries, since
        one contrary is the basis for knowing the other, and thus both
        contraries seem to fall under one art. But since the principles of
        things are many, they are not contraries, otherwise they could not be
        combined in one subject. Hence, wisdom, which is concerned with
        principles, does not seem to be one science. And if it is not one
        science but many, it is impossible to state what these sciences are.
      </p>
      <p>
        2149. Now the truth of the matter is that, while wisdom is one science,
        it considers many principles inasmuch as they are reduced to one genus,
        because contraries fall under one science since they belong to one
        genus.
      </p>
      <p>
        2150. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, one might</span> (901).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he raises a question about the study which this science makes of
        the principles of demonstration. He says that it is still a problem
        whether the study of the principles of demonstration (for example, every
        whole is greater than one of its parts, and the like) belongs to the
        study of one science or many. If one claims that such a study belongs to
        one science, it seems difficult to explain why it belongs to this
        science rather than to another, since all sciences make common use of
        these principles. But if one claims that it belongs to many sciences, it
        seems difficult to give many sitch sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        2151. Now the truth of the matter is that there is one science which is
        chiefly concerned with these principles, and this is the one which
        investigates the common terms involved in these principles, such as
        being and non-being, whole and part, and the like; and the other
        sciences receive such principles from this science.
      </p>
      <p>
        2152. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, there is</span> (902).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he raises questions about this science's study of substances; and
        there are two of these. First, he asks whether or not this science
        considers all substances. If one claims that it does not, it is
        difficult to indicate what substances it does consider and what not. And
        if one claims that it considers all substances, the question remains how
        one and the same science can deal with many substances, since each
        science treats of one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        2153. The truth is that, although this science deals especially with the
        separate substances, it does treat all substances inasmuch as all belong
        to one common class of essential being.
      </p>
      <p>2154. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, there is</span> (903).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he asks whether there is demonstration only with regard to
        substances or also with regard to accidents; for, if demonstration,
        properly speaking, were concerned with accidents, there would be no
        demonstration with regard to substances, since it is the function of
        demonstration to infer the essential accidents of substances. But if one
        claims that there is one demon. strative science of substances and an.
        other of essential accidents, the question remains as to which science
        each of these is, and whether each is worthy of the name of wisdom. For,
        on the one hand, it does seem that the science which deals with
        accidents is wisdom, because demonstration is properly concerned with
        accidents, and demonstrative science is the most certain. Thus it seems
        that wisdom, which is a demonstrative science, deals with accidents But,
        on the other hand, it seems to deal with substances; for since
        substances are the primary kind of being, it seems that the science
        which treats of them is the primary science.
      </p>
      <p>
        2155. Now the truth is that wisdom considers both substances and
        accidents inasmuch as they have being in common, which constitutes the
        subject of wisdom; but its demonstrations are concerned chiefly with
        substances, which are the primary kind of essential beings, and of these
        it demonstrates the accidents.
      </p>
      <p>2156. <span style="font-weight: bold">But the science</span> (904).</p>
      <p>
        Then he raises more specific questions about the study of this science.
        First (904:C 2156), he asks about the substances which this science
        considers; and second (909:C 2166), about the principles which it
        considers (“And one might”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first point he raises four questions. The first (904)
        has to do with the causes of sensible substances. He says that it does
        not seem that we should hold that the science which we are seeking is
        concerned with the four classes of causes discussed in the
        <i>Physics</i>, because it seems to deal especially with the final
        cause, which is the most important of all. But this science does not
        seem to deal with “the final cause,” or goal, because an end or goal has
        the nature of the good. Now the good relates to operations and to things
        which are in motion. Hence in the case of immovable things, such as the
        objects of mathematics, nothing is demonstrated by way of the final
        cause. It is also evident that the end is what first moves a thing, for
        it moves the efficient cause. But there does not seem to be a first
        cause of motion in the case of immovable things.
      </p>
      <p>
        2157. Now the truth of the matter is that this science considers the
        classes of causes mentioned, especially the formal and final cause. And
        furthermore, the end, which is the first cause of motion, is altogether
        immovable, as will be shown below (1069:C 2526).
      </p>
      <p>2158. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (905).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he raises a question about the study of sensible substances. He
        asks whether this science is concerned with sensible substances or not.
        For if it is concerned with them, it does not seem to differ from the
        philosophy of nature. But if it is concerned with other substances, it
        is difficult to state what these substances are. For it must deal with
        either “the separate Forms,” i.e., the Ideas, which the Platonists
        posited, or with the objects of mathematics, which some supposed to
        exist as an intermediate class of things between the Ideas and sensible
        substances, for example, surfaces, lines, figures and the like. But it
        is evident from the previous books that “separate Forms do not exist,”
        i.e., separate Ideas; and so he immediately raises the question about
        the objects of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        2159. Now the true answer to this question is that this science deals
        with sensible substances inasmuch as they are substances, but not
        inasmuch as they are sensible and movable; for this latter belongs
        properly to the philosophy of nature. But the proper study of this
        science has to do with substances which are neither Ideas nor separate
        mathematical entities but primary movers, as will be seen below (1055:C
        2488).
      </p>
      <p>
        2160. <span style="font-weight: bold">But nevertheless</span> (906).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he raises a third difficulty as a secondary issue. For, since he
        had said that there are evidently no separate Forms, he poses the
        question whether the objects of mathematics are separate. First, he
        shows that they are not. For if one claims that there are separate Forms
        and separate mathematical entities over and above sensible substances,
        why is not the same thing true of all things which have Forms as is true
        of the objects of mathematics? So that just as the objects of
        mathematics are assumed “ to be intermediate between the separate Forms
        and sensible substances as a third class of things over and above the
        separate Forms and the singular things which exist here (for example, a
        mathematical line over and above the Form of a line and the perceptible
        line), in a similar fashion there should be a third man and a third
        “horse over and above man-in-himself and horse-in-itself” (i.e., the
        ideal man and the ideal horse, which the Platonists called Ideas) and
        individual men and horses. But the Platonists did not posit
        intermediates in such cases as these but only in that of the objects of
        mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>2161. <span style="font-weight: bold">If, however</span> (907).</p>
      <p>
        Then he argues on the other side of the question; for, if the objects of
        mathematics are not separate, it is difficult to indicate the things
        with which the mathematical sciences deal. For they do not seem to deal
        with sensible things as such, because no lines and circles such as the
        mathematical sciences investigate are found in sensible things. It seems
        necessary to hold, then, that there are certain separate lines and
        circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        2162. Now the truth of the matter is that the objects of mathematics are
        not separate from sensible things in being but only in their
        intelligible structure, as has been shown above in Book VI (537:C 1162)
        and will be considered below (919:C 2185).
      </p>
      <p>
        2163. And since he had interjected as a secondary issue this difficulty
        about the separateness of the objects of mathematics because he had said
        that forms evidently are not separate, therefore when he says, “Nor is
        the science which we are now seeking concerned with the objects of
        mathematics,” he returns to the main question that was raised, namely,
        with what kind of substances this science deals. And since he had shown
        that it does not deal with separate Forms (for there are no separate
        Forms), he now shows by the same reasoning that it does not deal with
        the objects of mathematics; for neither are they separate in being. And
        it does not seem to deal with sensible substances, because these are
        destructible and in motion.
      </p>
      <p>2164. The true answer to this question is the one given above.</p>
      <p>
        2165.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general one might</span> (908).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives a fourth difficulty by asking to what science it belongs
        “to consider the problems about the matter of the mathematical
        sciences,” i.e., to investigate the things with which the mathematical
        sciences are concerned. This does not pertain to the philosophy of
        nature, because it is wholly concerned with those things which have in
        themselves a principle of rest and of motion and are called natural
        beings. Therefore he does not examine this problem. Similarly, the
        investigation of this problem does not seem to belong to that science
        which is called mathematical, which has as its aim the demonstration and
        knowledge of mathematical entities; for this kind of science presupposes
        matter of this sort or a subject of this sort, and some science does
        investigate this subject. It follows, then, that it is the business of
        this philosophical science to consider the things of which the
        mathematical sciences treat.
      </p>
      <p>2166. <span style="font-weight: bold">And one might</span> (909).</p>
      <p>
        Then he asks what kind of principles this science investigates. In
        regard to this he raises three questions. First, he asks whether this
        science studies the principles which are called elements by some
        thinkers. This question seems to refer to the common supposition that
        principles of this kind are present in, i.e., intrinsic to, the
        composite, so that in order to know composite things these principles
        must be known. But from another point of view it seems that this science
        is concerned with more universal things, because every intelligible
        nature and every science seems to be “of universals and not of
        extremes,” i.e., not about the particular things in which the division
        of common genera terminates. Thus it seems that this science has to do
        especially with the first genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        2167. But the truth is that this science deals chiefly with common
        attributes, yet without making the common factors principles in a
        Platonic sense. However, it does consider the intrinsic principles of
        things—matter and form.
      </p>
      <p>2168. <span style="font-weight: bold">And these would</span> (910).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he raises the second problem. For, on the one hand, it seems
        that unity and being are principles and genera, because these most of
        all seem to contain all things within their general ambit. And they seem
        to be principles because they are first by nature; for when they are
        destroyed, other things are too; for everything is a being and one.
        Hence, if being and unity are destroyed, everything else is destroyed,
        but not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        2169. But, on the other hand, it seems that unity and being are not
        genera, and therefore they are not principles if genera are principles.
        For no difference participates actually in a genus, because difference
        is derived from form and genus from matter; for example, rational is
        taken from intellective nature, and animal from sensory nature. Now form
        is not included actually in the essence of matter, but matter is in
        potentiality to form. And similarly difference does not belong to the
        nature of a genus, but a genus contains differences potentially. And for
        this reason a difference does not participate in a genus, because, when
        I say “rational,” I signify something having reason. Nor does it belong
        to the intelligibility of rational that it should be animal. Now that is
        participated in which is included in the intelligibility of the thing
        which participates; and for this reason it is said that a difference
        does not participate in a genus. But there cannot be any difference
        whose intelligibility does not contain unity and being. Hence unity and
        being cannot have any differences. Thus, they cannot be genera, since
        every genus has differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        2170. Now the truth of the matter is that unity and being are not genera
        but are common to all things analogically.
      </p>
      <p>
        2171. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if what</span> (911).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he raises the third question. The problem now is whether genera are
        principles to a greater degree than species. First, he shows that
        species are principles to a greater degree than genera; for what is more
        simple is a principle to a greater degree. But species seem to be more
        simple, for they are the indivisible things in which the formal division
        of a genus terminates. But genera are divided into many different
        species, and therefore species seem to be principles to a greater degree
        than genera. But in view of the fact that genera constitute species, and
        not vice versa, genera seem to be principles to a greater degree; for
        the intelligible structure of a principle is such that, when it is
        destroyed, other things are destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        2172. Now the truth is that universals are principles, namely, of
        knowing; and thus genera are principles to a greater degree because they
        are simpler. The reason why they are divided into more members than
        species are is that they contain more members potentially. But species
        contain many members actually. Hence they are divisible to a greater
        degree by the method of dissolving a composite into its simple
        constituents.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        912. Further, there is the question whether or not we must posit the
        existence of something besides singular things; and if not, then the
        science which we are now seeking must deal with these things. But they
        are infinite in number. And what exists apart from singular things are
        genera and species; but the science which we are now seeking deals with
        neither of these. The reason why this is impossible has already been
        stated (909-911).
      </p>
      <p>
        913. And in general the problem is whether one must suppose that there
        is some substance which is separable from sensible substances (i.e., the
        things which exist here and now), or that the latter are beings and the
        things with which wisdom deals. For we seem to be looking for another
        kind of substance, and this constitutes the object of our study: I mean,
        to know whether there is something which is separable in itself and
        belongs to no sensible thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        914. Further, if there is another kind of substance apart from sensible
        substances, from what kind of sensible substances must it be assumed to
        be separate? For why should we suppose that it exists apart from men and
        from horses rather than from other animals or non-living things
        generally? Yet to devise various eternal substances equal in number to
        sensible and corruptible ones would seem to be unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        915. But if the principle we are now seeking is not separable from
        bodies, what could be more of a principle of things than matter? Yet
        matter does not exist actually but only potentially; and thus it would
        seem rather that the specifying principle or form is a more important
        principle than matter. But the form is corruptible [according to some];
        and so in general there is no eternal substance which is separate and
        exists of itself. But this is absurd; for such a principle and substance
        seems to exist and is sought by almost all accomplished thinkers as
        something that exists. For how will there be order in the world if there
        is not a principle which is eternal, separable and permanent (235-246)?
      </p>
      <p>
        916. Again, if there is some substance and principle of such a nature as
        that now being sought, and this one principle belongs to everything and
        is one and the same for both corruptible and eternal things, the
        question arises why it is, if this principle is the same for all, that
        some of the things which come under it should be eternal and some not;
        for this is absurd. But if all corruptible things have one principle,
        and eternal things another, we shall face the same problem if the
        principle of corruptible things is eternal; for if it is eternal, why
        are not the things which fall under this principle also eternal? But if
        it is corruptible, it in turn must have some other principle, and this
        again must have another, and so on to infinity (250-265).
      </p>
      <p>
        917. But on the other hand, if one were to posit those principles which
        are thought to be the most unchangeable, namely, being and unity, then,
        first, if each of these does not signify a particular thing or a
        substance, how will they be separable and exist of themselves? Yet the
        eternal and primary principles for which we are looking must be such.
        But if each of these does signify a particular thing or a substance, all
        beings will be substances; for being is predicated of all things, and
        unity is predicated of some. But it is false that all beings are
        substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        918. Again, how can the statement of those be true who say that unity is
        the first principle and a substance, and who generate number as the
        first thing produced from the unit and matter and say that it is
        substance? For how are we to understand that the number two and each of
        the other numbers composed of units is one? For they say nothing about
        this, nor is it easy to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        919. But if someone maintains that lines and what is derived from these
        (I mean surfaces) are the first principles of things, these are not
        separable substances but sections and divisions; the former of surfaces,
        and the latter of bodies (and points are the sections and divisions of
        lines); and further they are the limits of these same things. And all of
        these exist in other things, and none are separable.
      </p>
      <p>
        920. Again, how are we to understand that the unit and the point have
        substance. For every substance is generated but not the point; for the
        point amounts to a division (266-283).
      </p>
      <p>
        921. There is also the problem that, while every science must be about
        universals and about such and such a universal, a substance is not a
        universal but is rather a particular and separable thing. Hence, if
        there is a science of principles, how are we to understand substance to
        be a principle (288-293) ?
      </p>
      <p>
        922. Again, the question arises whether or not there is any principle
        apart from the concrete whole? And by this I mean the matter and what is
        joined to it. For if not, then everything that is in matter is
        corruptible. But if there is some principle, it must be the specifying
        principle or form. Therefore it is difficult to determine in what cases
        this exists apart and in what not; for in some cases it is evident that
        the form is not separable, for example, in that of a house (235-247).
      </p>
      <p>
        923. Again, there is the question whether principles are the same
        specifically or numerically? For if they are the same numerically, all
        things will be the same (248-249).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2173. Having raised a question about the study of this science,
        Aristotle now raises a question about the things which are considered in
        this science. He does this, first (912:C 2173), with regard to
        substances; and second (916:C 2180), with regard to principles (“Again,
        if”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first issue he raises two questions. First, he asks
        whether or not it is necessary to posit the existence of something else
        in reality over and above singular things. Now if one claims that it is
        not, then it seems to follow that the science which we are now
        investigating must be concerned with singular things. But this seems to
        be impossible, because singular things are infinite in number, and the
        infinite is unknowable. And if one claims that it is necessary to posit
        the existence of something apart from singular things, they must be
        genera or species; and then this science would deal with genera and
        species. First, he explains why this is impossible; for it seems that
        neither genera nor species are principles, yet this science deals with
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        2174. The truth of the matter is that in reality there are only singular
        things, and that anything else exists only in the consideration of the
        intellect, which abstracts common attributes from particular ones.
      </p>
      <p>2175. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (913).</p>
      <p>
        Then he states the second question: whether there is some substance
        which exists apart from sensible substances existing here and now. This
        question must be raised here because, if there is nothing apart from
        sensible substances, only sensible substances are beings. And since
        wisdom is the science of beings, wisdom must be concerned only with
        sensible substances, even though we seem in this science to be looking
        for some other separate reality. It belongs to this science, then, to
        investigate whether or not there is something apart from sensible
        substances. And whichever alternative is taken, another question arises.
      </p>
      <p>
        2176. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if there</span> (914).
      </p>
      <p>
        He therefore poses the question which seems to arise if one claims that
        there is something separate from sensible substances. The question is
        whether this separate thing exists apart from all sensible substances or
        only apart from some. And if only apart from some, it is hard to explain
        why we should posit a separate substance apart from some sensible
        substances and not from others. For there does not seem to be any reason
        why there should be a separate man and a separate horse apart from the
        men and horses we perceive by the senses, and why this should not be
        true also of other animals and other non-living things. But if there is
        some separate substance apart from all sensible substances, it follows
        that we must posit the existence of certain separate substances which
        are eternal and equal in number to sensible and corruptible substances.
        Thus, just as there is a corruptible man, in a similar way there would
        be an incorruptible man, and the same with horse and ox, and also with
        other natural bodies. This seems to be absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        2177. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if the principle</span> (915).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he raises another question which seems to follow if there is no
        substance separate from sensible substances. This question asks what the
        first principle is, whether matter or form; for sensible substances are
        composed of these two principles. For at first glance it seems that
        nothing can be more of a principle of things than matter, which is the
        first subject and always continues to exist, as the first philosophers
        of nature claimed. Yet it would seem that matter cannot be a principle,
        because it is not an actuality but a potentiality. Hence, since
        actuality is naturally prior to potentiality, as has been pointed out in
        Book IX (785:C 1856), the specifying principle or form, which is an
        actuality, seems to be this principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        2178. But it seems that form cannot be a principle because a sensible
        form appears to be corruptible. If a sensible form were the first
        principle, then, it would seem to follow that there would be no eternal
        substance, separable and existing of itself. But this is clearly absurd
        because some such principle, eternal and separate, and some such
        substance, is sought by [almost all] the famous philosophers. This is
        reasonable, for there would not be a perpetual order of things in the
        world if there were no separate and eternal principle which causes
        things to be perpetual.
      </p>
      <p>
        2179. The true answer to this question is that there are certain
        substances which are separate from sensible substances; and these are
        not the Forms of sensible things, as the Platonists claimed, but the
        primary movers, as will be shown below (1056:C 2492).
      </p>
      <p>2180. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if there</span> (916).</p>
      <p>
        Then he raises the question about principles. First, he asks what kinds
        of principles there are; second (917:C 2182), what they are (“But on the
        other hand”); and third (918:C:2184), how they are related to one
        another (“Again, how can”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly asks (916) whether or not, if there is some separate
        substance and principle such as we are now seeking, it is the principle
        of all things, corruptible and incorruptible. Now if there is such a
        principle of all things, the question arises why some of the things
        which come from the same principle are eternal and some ire not. But if
        there is one principle for corruptible things and another for
        incorruptible ones, there remains the question why, if the principle is
        eternal the things coming from it are not themselves eternal. But if the
        principle of things is corruptible, and every corruptible thing is
        capable of being generated, and everything capable of being generated
        has a principle, it follows that the corruptible principle will have a
        principle, and that this will have another, and so on to infinity, as
        has been made clear above in Book II (153:C 301).
      </p>
      <p>
        2181. The truth of the matter is that the first principle of all things
        is incorruptible, and that some things are corruptible because of their
        great distance from that principle. These are the things in which
        generation and corruption are caused by an intermediate cause which is
        incorruptible as regards its substance but changeable as regards place.
      </p>
      <p>
        2182.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But on the other hand</span> (917).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he asks what the principles of things are. First, he examines the
        opinions of those men who claimed that the principles are unity and
        being because these are the most unchangeable. For no matter how a thing
        varies, it always remains one.
      </p>
      <p>
        2183. But the opinion of these men gives rise to two questions. The
        first is whether unity and being signify a particular thing, i.e., a
        substance; for, if they do not, they cannot be separable and exist of
        themselves. But we are looking for such principles which are eternal and
        exist separately. Yet if they do signify a particular thing or
        substance, it follows that all things are substances, and that nothing
        is an accident; for being is predicated of any existing thing at all,
        and unity is predicated of some. Now there are some things which involve
        multiplicity in their being, and the different ways in which unity is
        predicated truly of these is clear enough. But it is false that all
        things are substances; and therefore it seems that unity and being do
        not signify substance.
      </p>
      <p>2184. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, how can</span> (918).</p>
      <p>
        The second question or problem which he raises runs as follows: those
        who maintain that unity, or the unit, is the principle and substance of
        things say that number is generated as a first product from the unit and
        matter. And this, i.e., number, they call substance. But evidently this
        is not true, because, if a number is composed of the unit and matter, it
        must be something one, just as what is composed of a living principle
        and matter must be something living. But in what way is the number two
        or any other number, which is composed of units, one, as the Platonists
        claimed? This is not easy to explain, inasmuch as it can be said that
        they neglected to account for this as though it were easy to understand.
      </p>
      <p>2185. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if someone</span> (919).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he examines another opinion about the principles of things. For
        sonic claimed that “lines and what is derived from them,” namely,
        surfaces, are principles, because they held that bodies are composed of
        surfaces, and surfaces of lines. But it is clear that such things are
        not separate substances which exist of themselves; for such things are
        sections and divisions: lines being sections and divisions of surfaces,
        surfaces of bodies, and points of lines. They are also the limits of
        these things, i.e., points are the limits of lines, and so forth; for a
        point, which is at the extremity of a line, is the limit of a line. Now
        what is signified as actually within a line is a section of the line.
        The same thing is true of, a line in relation to a surface, and of a
        surface in relation to a body; for it is evident that limits and
        sections are entities which exist in other things as their subjects.
        Hence they cannot exist apart. Lines and surfaces, then, are not
        principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        2186. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, how are we</span> (920).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he introduces another argument. He says that it cannot be
        understood that the unit and the point have a substance, because
        substance begins to exist only by way of generation. But when a line is
        actually divided, the division itself is a point.
      </p>
      <p>
        2187. The correct answer to these questions is that neither units nor
        lines nor surfaces are principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        2188.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">There is also the problem</span> (921).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the question about unity and being and dimensions he now raises
        the question about substances. First, he asks whether substances are
        principles. The answer seems to be that they are not; for every science
        is concerned with universals and with “such and such a universal,” i.e.,
        some definite universal subject. Now a substance is not included among
        universals, but is rather a particular thing which exists of itself.
        Hence it seems that there is no science of substances. But a science is
        concerned with principles. Therefore substances are not principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        2189. The truth is that, although universals do not exist of themselves,
        it is still necessary to consider universally the natures of things
        which subsist of themselves. Accordingly, genera and species, which are
        called second substances, are put in the category of substance; and of
        these there is scientific knowledge. And certain things which exist of
        themselves are principles; and these, because they are immaterial,
        pertain to intelligible knowledge, even though they surpass the
        comprehension of our intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        2190. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, the question</span> (922).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he asks whether or not there is any “principle apart from the
        concrete whole,” i.e., the natural whole or composite. He explains that
        by concrete whole he means matter, or the thing composed of matter. For
        if there is no principle apart from the composite of matter and form,
        and those principles which are said to be in matter are corruptible, it
        follows that nothing is eternal. And if there is some principle apart
        from the composite, it must be the specifying principle or form. Then
        the question arises in which cases the form is separate and in which it
        is not. For it is obvious that in some cases the form is not separate;
        the form of a house, for example, is not separate from matter. It was
        for this reason that the Platonists did not posit Ideas or Forms of
        artificial things, because the forms of such things are actualities
        which cannot exist of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        2191. The correct answer to this question is that there is some
        principle apart from matter, and this is not the form of sensible
        things.
      </p>
      <p>2192. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, there is</span> (923).</p>
      <p>
        He now asks how the principles of all things are related to one another:
        whether they are the same numerically or only specifically. For, if they
        are the same numerically, it follows that all things -are the same
        numerically. But if they are not the same numerically, this difference
        will have to be accounted for.
      </p>
      <p>
        2193. The truth is that, if one is speaking of the extrinsic principles
        of things, they are the same numerically, since the first principle of
        all things is an agent and final cause. But the intrinsic principles of
        things-matter and form-are not the same numerically but only
        analogically, as will be shown below (1049-54:C 2474-87).<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        924. Since the science of the philosopher treats of being as being in
        general and not of some part of it, and the term being is used in many
        senses and not merely in one, it follows that, if being is used
        equivocally and not with a common meaning, being does not fall under one
        science (for such terms do not have a common class). But if the term is
        used according to one common meaning, being will fall under one science.
      </p>
      <p>
        925. Therefore the term seems to be used in the way mentioned, like the
        terms medical and healthy; for each of these is used in many senses. Now
        the term is used in each of these ways because of some kind of
        reference. Thus the former is used in reference to the science of
        medicine; the latter, to health; and still another, to something else;
        yet in each case the term is referred to the same thing. For both a
        discussion and a knife are called medical: the one because it comes from
        the science of medicine, and the other because it is useful to it. The
        same is true of the term healthy; for one thing is called healthy
        because it is a sign of health, and another because it produces it. The
        same is true of other terms. Hence the same thing is true of every
        instance of being; for each thing is called a being because it is either
        a modification or a state or a disposition or a motion or something else
        of this kind which belongs to being as being.
      </p>
      <p>
        926. And since every being is referred to something one and common, each
        of the contrarieties may also be referred to the primary differences and
        contrarieties of being,.whether the primary differences are plurality
        and unity, likeness and unlikeness, or any others; for these have been
        considered (304).
      </p>
      <p>
        927. And it makes no difference whether an existing thing is referred to
        being or to unity. For even if they are not the same but different, they
        are nevertheless interchangeable; for what is one is somehow a being,
        and what is a being is somehow one.
      </p>
      <p>
        928. Now since it is the office of one and the same science to study all
        contraries, and one of each pair involves privation (though one might be
        puzzled how some contraries are predicated privatively, i.e., those
        which have an intermediate, as just and unjust), in all such cases it is
        necessary to hold that the privation of the one is not the privation of
        the whole notion of the other, but only of the last species. For
        example, if a man is just because of some habitual tendency to obey the
        laws, the unjust man will not always be deprived of the perfection
        completely but will fail to obey the laws in some respect; and in this
        respect privation will belong to him. The same holds true in other
        cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        929. Now the mathematician in a sense studies things which are gotten by
        taking something away; for he speculates by removing from things all
        sensible qualities, such as heaviness and lightness, hardness and its
        contrary, and also heat and cold and other sensible contrarieties, and
        leaves only the quantified and the continuous (some things being such in
        one, some in two, and some in three dimensions). And he studies the
        properties of the quantified and the continuous as such and not in any
        other respect. And of some he considers the relative positions and
        attributes, and of others the commensurability and incommensurability,
        and of others the ratios; yet we claim that there is only one science of
        all these things, namely, geometry. The same holds true of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        930. For an investigation of the attributes of being as being, and of
        the contrarieties of being as being, belong to no other science than
        [first] philosophy; for one would not assign to the philosophy of nature
        the study of things insofar as they are beings but rather insofar as
        they participate in motion. For dialectics and sophistry are concerned
        with the accidents of existing things, but not as beings, nor do they
        deal with being as being. It follows, then, that it is the philosopher
        who speculates about the things which we have mentioned, insofar as they
        are beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        931. And since every being is referred to some one common meaning, which
        is used in many senses, and the same applies to contraries (for they are
        referred to the primary differences and contrarieties of being), and
        such things can fall under one science, the difficulty which was stated
        at the beginning of this work (900-904) is solved in this way. I mean
        the question how there can be one science of things which are many and
        different in genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2194. Having raised the foregoing questions, Aristotle now begins to
        assemble the things that belong to the consideration of this science.
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (924:C 2194) he indicates
        the things which this science considers. In the second (956:C 2247) he
        compares this science with the others (“Every science”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two members. First, he shows that it is
        the office of this science to consider all beings; and second (932:C
        2206), that it has to consider the principles of demonstration (“And
        since the mathematician”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In considering the first part he does two things. First, he shows that
        all things are somehow reduced to one. Second (929:C 2202), he shows
        that the study of this science extends to all things insofar as they are
        somehow reduced to some one thing (“Now the mathematician”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first part he does two things. First, he shows that in
        view of the goal of our present study it is necessary to ask whether all
        things are somehow reduced to one. He says that, since the science of
        philosophy treats being as being in such a way as to consider being in
        terms of its universal character and not merely in terms of the
        intelligible character of any particular being, and since the term being
        is used in many senses and not just in one, if the many senses of being
        were purely equivocal without any common meaning, not all beings would
        fall under one science, because they would not in any way be reduced to
        one common class. And one science must deal with one class of things.
        But if the many senses of being have one common meaning, all beings can
        then fall under one science. Hence, in order to answer the question that
        was raised as to whether this science is one even though it treats many
        different things, we must consider whether or not all beings are reduced
        to some one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        2195. <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore the term</span> (925).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that all things are reduced to some one thing. In treating
        this he does two things. First (925:C 2195), he explains his thesis.
        Second (928:C 2200), he clears up a point that might present a
        difficulty (“Now since”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. In the first he shows that all
        things are reduced to one. In the second (92-7:C 219q), he explains what
        this one thing is to which all things are reduced (“And it makes no
        difference”) -
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part he does two things. First, he shows that all
        beings are reduced to one common being; and second (926:C 2198), that
        all contrarieties are reduced to one contrariety (“And since every”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (925), that the term being is used in the way
        mentioned above; i.e., it is used of many things according to some
        common meaning. He makes this clear by means of two examples: the terms
        medical and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        2196. For both of these terms are used variously, yet in such a way that
        they are reduced or referred to some one thing. The term medical is used
        in many ways inasmuch as it is referred in one sense to a medicine and
        in another to something else. And similarly the term healthy is used in
        many ways inasmuch as it is referred in one sense to health and in
        another to something else. Yet in both cases the various senses have
        reference to the same thing, though in different ways. For example, a
        discussion is called medical because it comes from the
      </p>
      <p>
        science of medicine, and a knife is called medical because it is an
        instrument that is used by the same science. Similarly one thing is
        called healthy because it is a sign of health, as urine, and another
        because it causes health, as a medication. The same applies to other
        terms which are used in a similar way.
      </p>
      <p>
        2197. It is evident that terms which are used in this way are midway
        between univocal and equivocal terms. In the case of univocity one term
        is predicated of different things with absolutely one and the same
        meaning; for example, the term animal, which is predicated of a horse
        and of an ox, signifies a living, sensory substance. In the case of
        equivocity the same term is predicated of various things with an
        entirely different meaning. This is clear in the case of the term dog,
        inasmuch as it is predicated both of a constellation and of a certain
        species of animal. But in the case of those things which are spoken of
        in the way mentioned previously, the same term is predicated of various
        things with a meaning that is partly the same and partly
        different—different regarding the different modes of relation, and the
        same regarding that to which it is related; for to be a sign of
        something and to be a cause of something are different, but health is
        one. Terms of this kind, then, are predicated analogously, because they
        have a proportion to one thing. The same holds true also of the many
        ways in which the term being is used; for being in an unqualified sense
        means what exists of itself, namely, substance; but other things are
        called beings because they belong to what exists of itself, namely,
        modifications or states or anything else of this kind. For a quality is
        called a being, not because it has an act of existence, but because a
        substance is said to be disposed by it. It is the same with other
        accidents. This is why he says that they belong to a being (or are of a
        being). It is evident, then, that the many senses of the term being have
        a common meaning to which they are reduced.
      </p>
      <p>2198. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since</span> (926).</p>
      <p>
        Next he shows that all contrarieties are reduced to one first
        contrariety. Since all beings are reduced to one common meaning, and the
        contrarieties of beings, which are opposite differences, are in
        themselves a natural consequence of beings, it follows that
        contrarieties must be reduced to some primary contrariety, whatever it
        may be, whether it is plurality and unity, likeness and unlikeness, or
        whatever else are primary differences of beings. And contrarieties of
        this kind have to be considered in the science which establishes what is
        true about beings.
      </p>
      <p>2199. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it makes</span> (927).</p>
      <p>
        Then he indicates what this common thing is to which all things are
        reduced. He says that it makes no difference whether things are reduced
        to being or to unity; for if it is said that being and unity are not the
        same conceptually but differ inasmuch as unity adds the note of
        indivisibility to being, none the less it is evident that they are
        interchangeable; for everything that is one is somehow a being, and
        everything that is a being is somehow one; because, just as a substance
        is a being properly and of itself, so too it is one properly and of
        itself. The way in which unity is related to being has been explained
        above in Book IV (301-04:C 548-60) and in Book X (832:C 1974).
      </p>
      <p>2200. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since</span> (928).</p>
      <p>
        Then he removes a difficulty. He says that, since all contraries are
        investigated by one science (and the most cogent reason seems to be that
        in each pair of contraries one contrary is used privatively, and this is
        known from its opposite term), the difficulty arises how contraries
        which have an intermediate can be predicated as privations, since in the
        case of opposites which are privatively opposed there is no
        intermediate.
      </p>
      <p>
        2201. The answer to this must be that in the case of such contraries one
        opposite is not posited as a privation removing all the intelligible
        notes of the other but as the privation of the last species inasmuch as
        it detracts from the complete intelligible constitution of the whole
        species. For instance, if someone is said to be just because he
        habitually obeys the laws, he will not always be said to be unjust, as
        if he were deprived of the entire notion of justice, which would be the
        case if he obeyed the laws in no way—but rather because he fails to obey
        them in some respects. Hence the privation of justice will be found in
        him to the extent that he falls short of the perfection of justice. It
        is for this reason that he can be in an intermediate state, because not
        everyone who lacks justice is completely deprived of it but only of some
        part of it. And this intermediate state is one that differs in degree.
        The same holds true of other contraries. The privation of sight,
        however, is said to consist in the total lack of sight, and therefore
        there is no intermediate state between blindness and sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        2202.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the mathematician</span> (929).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that the investigations of this science extend to all
        beings insofar as they are reduced to one thing. In treating this he
        makes a tripartite division. First, he shows by an example from geometry
        that it is the office of one science to consider all things which are
        reduced to being. He says that the science of mathematics studies “those
        things which are gotten by taking something away,” i.e., abstract
        things. It makes this abstraction, not because it supposes that the
        things which it considers are separate in reality from sensible things,
        but because it considers them without considering sensible qualities.
        For the science of mathematics carries on its investigations by removing
        from the scope of its study all sensible qualities, such as lightness,
        heaviness, hardness, softness, heat and cold, and all other sensible
        qualities, and retains as its object of study only the quantified and
        the continuous, whether it is continuous in one dimension, as a line, or
        in two, as a surface, or in three, as a body. And it is primarily
        interested in the properties of these inasmuch as they are continuous
        and not in any other respect; for it does not consider the properties of
        surface inasmuch as it is the surface of wood or of stone. Similarly it
        considers the relationships between its objects. And in considering
        figures it also studies their accidents, and how quantities are
        commensurable or incommensurable, as is clear in Book X of Euclid, “and
        their ratios,” or proportions, as is clear in Book V of the same work.
        Yet there is one science of all these things, and this is geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
        2203. Now what was true for the mathematician is also true for the
        philosopher who studies being. He passes over a study of all particular
        beings and considers them only inasmuch as they pertain to being in
        general. And though these are many, there is nevertheless a single
        science of all of them inasmuch as all are reduced to one thing, as has
        been pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        2204. <span style="font-weight: bold">For an investigation</span> (930).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he indicates what science it is that considers the
        above-mentioned things. He says that the study of the attributes of
        being as being does not belong to any other science but only to this
        branch of philosophy. If it did belong to another science, it would
        mostly seem to belong to the philosophy of nature or to dialectics,
        which seemingly are the most common of the sciences. Now according to
        the opinion of the ancient philosophers who did not posit any substances
        other than sensible ones, it would seem to be the philosophy of nature
        that is the common science. In this way it would follow that it is the
        function of the philosophy of nature to consider all substances, and
        consequently all beings, which are reduced to substance.-But dialectics
        would seem to be the common science, and also sophistry, because these
        consider certain accidents of beings, namely, intentions and the notions
        of genus and species and the like. It follows, then, that it is the
        philosopher who has to consider the above-mentioned things, inasmuch as
        they are accidents of being.
      </p>
      <p>2205. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since every</span> (931).</p>
      <p>
        Third, from what has been said, he draws his thesis as his chief
        conclusion. He says that, since being is used in many senses in
        reference to some one thing, and since all contrarieties are referred to
        the first contrariety of being, such things organized in this way can
        fall under one science, as has been pointed out. Thus he solves the
        question previously raised: whether there is one science of things which
        are many and generically different.<br /></p

      <p>
        932. And since the mathematician uses the common axioms in a particular
        way, it must be the office of first philosophy to study principles of
        this kind. For the axiom or principle that “when equals are subtracted
        from equals the remainders are equal” is common to all quantities. But
        mathematics, assuming [principles of this kind], makes a study of some
        part of the quantified as its proper subject matter, for example, lines
        or angles or number or some of the other kinds of quantity. Yet it does
        not consider them inasmuch as they are beings but inasmuch as each is
        continuous in one, two or three dimensions. Philosophy, however, does
        not investigate those things which are in some part of matter insofar as
        each has some attribute, but it considers each of these particular
        things from the standpoint of being insofar as it is being.
      </p>
      <p>
        933. Now what applies in the case of the science of mathematics is also
        true of the philosophy of nature; for the philosophy of nature studies
        the attributes and principles of beings inasmuch as they are moved, not
        inasmuch as they are beings. But, as we have said, the primary science
        considers these attributes and principles insofar as their subjects are
        beings, and not in any other respect. For this reason it is necessary to
        hold that this science and the science of mathematics are parts of
        wisdom (319-23; 900-01).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2206. Having shown how the investigations of this science are concerned
        with beings and with the attributes which belong to being as being, the
        Philosopher now shows how the investigations of this science are
        concerned with the first principles of demonstration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (932:C 2206) he shows that
        it is the office of this science to consider these first principles of
        demonstration. In the second (934:C 2211) he draws his conclusions about
        one principle of demonstration which is prior to the others (“There is a
        principle”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (932:C 22o6), he
        clarifies his thesis by considering the science of mathematics; and
        second (933:C 2209), by considering the philosophy of nature (“Now what
        applies”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first part he uses the following argument: all the common axioms
        which are used by the particular sciences in a way peculiar to
        themselves and not in their common aspect belong to the consideration of
        this science. But the first principles of demonstration are used by the
        science of mathematics and by other particular sciences in a way
        peculiar to themselves. Therefore an investigation of these principles
        insofar as they are common belongs to the science which considers being
        as being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2207. He accordingly says that, since the mathematician uses “the common
        axioms in a particular way,” i.e., insofar as they are adapted to his
        subject matter, it must be the function of first philosophy to consider
        such principles in their common aspect. For these principles are taken
        as principles of the sciences insofar as they are adapted to some
        particular subject matter. He clarifies his statement by an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        2208. The principle that “when equals are subtracted from equals the
        remainders are equal” is common to all instances of quantity which admit
        of equality and inequality. But the science of mathematics presupposes
        principles of this kind in order to make a special study of that part of
        quantity which constitutes its proper subject matter; for there is no
        mathematical science which considers the attributes common to quantity
        as quantity, because this is the work of first philosophy. The
        mathematical sciences rather consider those attributes which belong to
        this or to that quantity; for example, arithmetic considers the
        attributes that belong to number, and geometry considers those that
        belong to continuous quantity. Thus the arithmetician uses the
        above-mentioned principle only inasmuch as it has to do with numbers,
        and the geometer uses it inasmuch as it has to do with lines and with
        angles. The geometer, however, does not consider this principle inasmuch
        as it relates to beings as beings but inasmuch as it relates to being as
        continuous, whether it is continuous in one dimension, as a line; or in
        two, as a surface; or in three, as a body. But first philosophy does not
        study the parts of being inasmuch as each has certain accidents; but
        when it studies each of these common attributes, it studies being as
        being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2209. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now what applies</span> (933).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he makes the same thing clear by considering the philosophy of
        nature. He says that what applies in the case of the science of
        mathematics is also true of the philosophy of nature; for while the
        philosophy of nature studies the attributes and principles of beings, it
        does not consider beings as beings but as mobile. The first science, on
        the other hand, deals with these inasmuch as they are being, and not in
        any other respect. Hence, the philosophy of nature and the science of
        mathematics must be parts of first philosophy, just as any particular
        science is said to be a part of a universal science.
      </p>
      <p>
        2210. The reason why common principles of this kind belong to the
        consideration of first philosophy is this: since all first self-evident
        propositions are those of which the predicate is included in the
        definition of the subject, then in order that propositions may be
        self-evident to all, it is necessary that their subjects and predicates
        should be known to all. Common notions of this type are those which are
        conceived by all men, as being and non-being, whole and part, equal and
        unequal, same and different, and so on. But these belong to the
        consideration of first philosophy; and therefore common propositions
        composed of such terms must belong chiefly to the consideration of first
        philosophy.<br /></p

      <p>
        934. There is a principle in existing things about which it is
        impossible to make a mistake, but of which one must always do the
        contrary, I mean acknowledge it as true, namely, that the same thing
        cannot both be and not be at one and the same time; and the same is also
        true of other things which are opposed in this way (326-328).
      </p>
      <p>
        935. And while there is no demonstration in the strict sense of such
        principles, one may employ an argument <i>ad hominem</i>; for it is
        impossible to construct a syllogism from a more certain principle than
        this one. But this would be necessary if there were demonstration of it
        in the strict sense (329-330).
      </p>
      <p>
        936. Now anyone who wants to prove to an opponent making statements
        opposite to one’s own that he is wrong must take some such principle
        which is the same as this one—that the same thing cannot both be and not
        be at the same time—but apparently is not the same. For this will be the
        only method of demonstration that can be used against one who says that
        opposite statements can be truly made about the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        937. Accordingly, those who are to join in some discussion must
        understand each other to some extent. And if this does not happen, how
        will they join in a common discussion? Therefore each of the terms used
        must be understood and must signify something, and not many things but
        only one. But if a term does signify many things, it must be made clear
        to which of these it refers. Hence, one who says that this is and is
        not, totally denies what he affirms, and thus denies that the term
        signifies what it signifies. But this is impossible. Hence, if to be
        this has some meaning, the contradictory cannot be said to be true of
        the same subject (332-340).
      </p>
      <p>
        938. Again, if a term signifies something and this is affirmed truly, it
        must necessarily be so; and what is necessarily so cannot not be. Hence
        opposite affirmations and negations cannot be true of the same subject
        (337-338).
      </p>
      <p>
        939. Again, if the affirmation is in no way truer than the negation, it
        will not be truer to say that something is a man than to say that it is
        not a man. And it would also seem that it is either more or not less
        true to say that a man is not a horse than to say that he is not a man.
        Hence one will also be right in
      </p>
      <p>
        saying that the same thing is a horse; for it was assumed that opposite
        statements are equally true. Therefore it follows that the same thing is
        a man and a horse, or any other animal (343-345). Hence, while there is
        no demonstration in the strict sense of these principles, there is still
        a demonstration ad hominem against one who makes these assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        940. And perhaps if one had questioned Heraclitus himself in this way,
        he would quickly have forced him to admit that opposite statements can
        never be true of the same subjects. But he adopted this view without
        understanding his own statement (328). And in general if what he said is
        true, not even this statement will be true—I mean that the same thing
        can both be and not be at one and the same time. For just as when they
        are separated the affirmation will not be truer than the negation (346),
        in a similar way when both are combined and taken together as though
        they were one affirmation, the negation will not be truer than the whole
        statement regarded as an affirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        941. Again, if it is possible to affirm nothing truly, even this
        statement-that no affirmation is true-will be false (396-397). But if
        there is a true affirmation, this will refute what is said by those who
        raise such objections and completely destroy discussion.

      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 6</p>
      <p>
        942. The statement made by Protagoras is similar to those mentioned; for
        he said that man is the measure of all things, meaning simply that
        whatever appears so to anyone is just as it appears to him. But if this
        is true, it follows that the same thing is and is not, and is good and
        evil, and that other statements involving opposites are true; because
        often a particular thing appears to be good to some and just the
        opposite to others, and that which appears to each man is the measure.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2211. Having shown that a study of the common principles of
        demonstration belongs chiefly to the consideration of this philosophical
        science, the Philosopher now deals with the first of these principles
        (934:C 2212). For just as all beings must be referred to one first
        being, in a similar fashion all principles of demonstration must be
        referred to some principle which pertains in a more basic way to the
        consideration of this philosophical science. This principle is that the
        same thing cannot both be and not be at the same time. It is the first
        principle because its terms, <i>being</i> and <i>non-being</i>, are the
        first to be apprehended by the intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        2212. This part is divided into two members. In the first (934:C 2211)
        he establishes the truth of this principle. In the second (936:C 22T4)
        he rejects an error (“Now anyone who”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In reference to the first part he does two things regarding this
        principle. First, he says that in regard to beings there is a principle
        of demonstration “about which it is impossible to make a mistake” (i.e.,
        so far as its meaning is concerned), but of which we “must always do the
        contrary,” namely, acknowledge it as true. This principle is that the
        same thing cannot both be and not be at one and the same time, granted
        of course that the other conditions which it is customary to give in the
        case of a contradiction are fulfilled, namely, in the same respect, in
        an unqualified sense, and the like. For no one can think that this
        principle is false, because, if someone were to think that
        contradictories may be true at the same time, he would then have
        contrary opinions at the same time; for opinions about contradictories
        are contrary. For example, the opinion that “Socrates is sitting” is
        contrary to the opinion that “Socrates is not sitting.”
      </p>
      <p>2213. <span style="font-weight: bold">And while</span> (935).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he says that, while there cannot be demonstration in the strict
        sense of the above-mentioned principle and other similar ones, one may
        offer an argument <i>ad hominem</i> in support of it. That it cannot be
        demonstrated in the strict sense he proves thus: no one can prove this
        principle by constructing a syllogism from some principle which is
        better known. But such would be necessary if that principle were to be
        demonstrated in the strict sense. However, this principle can be
        demonstrated by using an argument <i>ad hominem</i> against one who
        admits some other statement, though less known, and denies this one.
      </p>
      <p>2214. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now anyone who</span> (936).</p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the opinion of those who deny this principle; and this
        is divided into two parts. First (936:C 2214), he argues against those
        who deny this principle. Second (943:C 2225), he shows how one can meet
        this opinion (“Now this difficulty”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (936:C 2214), he argues
        against those who unqualifiedly deny this principle. Second (940:C
        2221), he turns his attention to certain particular opinions (“And
        perhaps”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the method of
        arguing against this error. He says that in arguing against an opponent
        who claims that contradictory propositions may be true, anyone who wants
        to show that this opinion is false ought to take some such principle
        which is the same as this one—that the same thing cannot both be and not
        be at the same time—but apparently is not the same. For, if it were
        evidently the same, it would not be admitted by an opponent. Yet if it
        were not the same, he could not prove his thesis, because a principle of
        this kind cannot be demonstrated from some principle which is better
        known. Hence, it is only in this way that a demonstration can be made
        against those who say that contradictories may be true of the same
        subject, namely, by assuming as a premise what is in fact the same as
        the conclusion but apparently is not.
      </p>
      <p>2215. <span style="font-weight: bold">Accordingly</span> (937).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he begins to argue dialectically against the above-mentioned
        error; and in regard to this he gives three arguments, First, he argues
        as follows: if two men are to join in a discussion in such a way that
        one may communicate his view to the other in a dispute, each must
        understand something that the other is saying. For if this were not the
        case, no statement would be understood by both of them; and thus an
        argument with an opponent would be pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
        2216. However, if one of them is to understand what the other is saying,
        each of the terms used must be understood according to its proper
        meaning and must therefore signify some one thing and not many things.
        And if it should signify many, it will be necessary to make clear which
        of the many things it signifies; otherwise one would not know what the
        other person means.
      </p>
      <p>
        2217. Now granted that a term signifies one thing, it is evident that
        one who says both that <i>this is</i> and that <i>this is not</i>, for
        example, that Socrates is a man and that he is not a man, denies the one
        thing which he attributed to Socrates, namely, that he is a man, when he
        adds that he is not a man; and thus he denies what he first signified.
        Hence it follows that a word does not signify what it signifies. But
        this is impossible. Consequently, if a term signifies some definite
        thing, the contradictory cannot be truly affirmed of the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        2218. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if a term</span> (938).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs as follows: if a term
        signifies some attribute, and the attribute signified by the term is
        truly affirmed of the same subject of which the term is first
        predicated, this attribute must belong to the subject of which the term
        is predicated so long as the proposition is true. For this conditional
        proposition, “If Socrates is a man, Socrates is a man,” is clearly true.
        Now every true conditional proposition is a necessary one. Hence, if the
        consequent is true, the antecedent must be true. But what is, cannot
        sometimes not be, because to be necessary and to be incapable of not
        being are equivalent. Therefore so long as the proposition “Socrates is
        a man” is true, the proposition “Socrates is not a man” cannot be true.
        Thus it is evident that opposite affirmations and negations cannot be
        true of the same subject at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        2219.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if the affirmation</span> (939).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the third argument, which is as follows: if an affirmation
        is not truer than the negation opposed to it, one who says that Socrates
        is a man does not speak with greater truth than one who says that
        Socrates is not a man. But it is evident that one who says that a man is
        not a horse speaks either with greater or with no less truth than one
        who says that a man is not a man. Hence, according to this argument, he
        who says that a man is not a horse will speak with equal or no less
        truth. But if contradictory opposites are true at the same time, for
        example, if the proposition “Man is not a horse” is true, and the
        proposition “Man is a horse” is also true, then it follows that a man is
        a horse and also any other animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        2220. But because someone could criticize the foregoing arguments on the
        grounds that the things assumed in them are less known than the intended
        conclusion, he therefore answers this by saying that no one of the
        foregoing arguments is demonstrative in the strict sense, although there
        can be an argument <i>ad hominem</i> against an opponent who gives this
        argument, because the things assumed must be admitted to be true even
        though they are less known, absolutely than what he denies.
      </p>
      <p>2221. <span style="font-weight: bold">And perhaps</span> (940).</p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the above error by considering certain particular
        thinkers. He does this, first (940:C 2221), with regard to Heraclitus;
        and second (942:C 2224), with regard to Protagoras (“The statement”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Heraclitus posited two things: first, that an affirmation and a
        negation may be true at the same time (and from this it would follow
        that every proposition, affirmative as well as negative, is true); and
        second, that there may be an intermediate between affirmation and
        negation (and from this it would follow that neither an affirmation nor
        a negation can be true). Consequently every proposition is false.
      </p>
      <p>
        2222. First (940:C 2222), he raises an argument against Heraclitus’
        first position; and second (941:C 2223), against his second position
        (“Again, if it is possible”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (940), that by giving an argument
        <i>ad hominem</i> in this way one may easily bring even Heraclitus, who
        was the author of this statement, to admit that opposite propositions
        may not be true of the same subject. For he seems to have accepted the
        opinion that they may be true of the same subject because he did not
        understand his own statement. And he would be forced to deny his
        statement in the following way: if what he said is true, namely, that
        one and the same thing can both be and not be at one and the same time,
        it follows that this very statement will not be true; for if an
        affirmation and a negation are taken separately, an affirmation is not
        truer than a negation; and if an affirmation and a negation are taken
        together in such a way that one affirmation results from them, the
        negation will not be less true of the whole statement made up of the
        affirmation and the negation than of the opposite affirmation. For it is
        clearly possible for some copulative proposition to be true, just as for
        some simple proposition; and it is possible to take its negation. And
        whether the copulative proposition be composed of two affirmative
        propositions, as when we say “Socrates is sitting and arguing,” or of
        two negative propositions, as when we say “It is true that Socrates is
        not a stone or an ass,” or of an affirmative proposition and a negative
        proposition, as when we say “It is true that Socrates is sitting and not
        arguing,” nevertheless a copulative proposition is always taken to be
        true because one affirmative proposition is true. And he who says that
        it is false takes the negation as applying to the whole copulative
        proposition. Hence he who says that it is true that man is and is not at
        the same time, takes this as a kind of affirmation; and that this is not
        true is the negation of this. Hence, if an affirmation and a negation
        are true at the same time, it follows that the negation which states
        that this is not true, i.e., that an affirmation and a negation are true
        at the same time, is equally true. For if any negation is true at the
        same time as the affirmation opposed to it, every negation must be true
        at the same time as the affirmation opposed to it; for the reasoning is
        the same in all cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        2223.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if it is possible</span> (941).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he introduces an argument against the second position of
        Heraclitus: that no affirmation is true. For if it is possible to affirm
        that nothing is true, and if one who says that no affirmation is true
        does affirm something, namely, that it is true that no affirmation is
        true, then this statement will be false. And if some affirmative
        statement is true, the opinion of people such as those who oppose all
        statements will be rejected. And those who adopt this position destroy
        the whole debate, because if nothing is true, nothing can be conceded on
        which an argument may be based. And if an affirmation and a negation are
        true at the same time, it will be impossible to signify anything by a
        word, as was said above (937:C 2215), and then the argument will cease.
      </p>
      <p>2224. <span style="font-weight: bold">The statement</span> (942).</p>
      <p>
        Here he considers the opinion of Protagoras. He says that the statement
        made by Protagoras is similar to the one made by Heraclitus and by
        others who claim that an affirmation and a negation are true at the same
        time. For Protagoras says that man is the measure of all things, i.e.,
        according to the intellect and the senses, as has been explained in Book
        IX (753:C 1800), as if the being of a thing depended upon intellectual
        and sensory apprehension. And one who says that man is the measure of
        all things merely says that whatever appears so to anyone is true. But
        if this is maintained, it follows that the same thing both is and is not
        and is both good and evil at the same time. The same thing is also true
        of other opposites, because often something seems to be good to some and
        just the opposite to others, and the way in which things seem or appear
        is the measure of all things according to the opinion of Protagoras; so
        that, inasmuch as a thing appears, to that extent it is true.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        943. Now this difficulty may be solved by considering the origin of this
        view.
      </p>
      <p>
        944. For it seems to have arisen in some cases from the opinion of the
        philosophers of nature, and in others from the fact that not all men
        apprehend the same thing in the same way, but something appears pleasant
        to some and the opposite to others (352).
      </p>
      <p>
        945. For the view that nothing comes from non-being but everything from
        being is a doctrine common to nearly all those who have dealt with
        nature. Thus, since the not-white comes from what is actually white, and
        not from the not-white, should the not-white have come to be, what
        becomes not-white will have come to be from what is not not-white. Hence
        whiteness must come from non being according to them, unless the white
        and the not-white are the same. But it is not hard to solve this
        difficulty; for we have stated in our physical treatises in what sense
        things which come to be come from non-being, and in what sense they come
        from being (355-356).
      </p>
      <p>
        946. But it is also foolish to occupy oneself equally with both opinions
        and with the fanciful statements of those who argue against themselves,
        because i is evident that one or the other of them must be wrong. This
        is clear from the facts of sensory perception; for the same thing never
        appears sweet to some and the opposite to others unless in some the
        organ of the sense which distinguish the above-mentioned savors has been
        impaired or injured. And such being the case, some must be taken as the
        measure and the others not. And I say that th same thing applies in the
        case of good and evil, of beautiful and ugly, and o other attributes of
        this kind. For to maintain this view is not different from maintaining
        that what appears to those who push their finger under their eye an make
        one object appear to be two must therefore be two because it appears to
        be so many, and yet that it must be one because to those who do not move
        their eye the one object appears to be one (369-375).
      </p>
      <p>
        947. And in general seeing that things here are subject to change and
        never remain the same, it would be unfitting to base our judgment of the
        truth on this. For in pursuing the truth one must start with those
        things which are always the same and never undergo a single change. Such
        things are those which contain the world; for they do not appear at one
        time to be such and at another different but they are always the same
        and admit of no change (365).
      </p>
      <p>
        948. Further, if there is motion, there is also something that is moved;
        and everything is moved from something and to something. Therefore that
        which is moved must be in that from which it is moved, and yet not be in
        it; and it must be moved to this and come to be in it; but
        contradictories cannot be true at the same time, as they claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        949. And if things here are in a state of continuous change and motion
        as regards quantity, and one were to suppose this even though it is not
        true, why should they not be permanent as regards quality? For the view
        that contradictories may be predicated of the same subject seems to be
        based largely on the assumption that the quantity of bodies does not
        remain constant; and for this reason they say that the same thing is and
        is not four cubits long. But a thing’s substance involves quality, and
        this is of a determinate nature, whereas quantity is of an indeterminate
        nature (365).
      </p>
      <p>
        950. Further, when a physician orders them to take some particular food,
        why do they take it? For why is this particular food bread rather than
        not bread? Hence it would make no difference whether they ate it or not.
        But they take the food prescribed as though they know the truth about it
        and that it is the food prescribed. Yet they should not do this if there
        is no nature which remains fixed in the sensible world, but everything
        is always in a state of motion and flux (349).
      </p>
      <p>
        951. Again, if we are always undergoing change and never remain the
        same, what wonder is it if to us, as to those who are ill, things never
        appear the same? For to them also, since they are not in the same
        condition as when they were well, sensible qualities do not appear to be
        the same; yet sensible things themselves need not for this reason
        undergo any change, but they cause different, and not the same,
        impressions in those who are ill. And perhaps the same thing must happen
        to those who are well if the above-mentioned change takes place (950).
        However, if we do not change but always remain the same, there will be
        something permanent (357-359).
      </p>
      <p>
        952. Hence, in the case of those who raise the foregoing difficulties as
        a result of reasoning, it is not easy to meet their arguments unless
        they assume something and do not demand a reason for it; for every
        argument and demonstration comes about in this way. For those who admit
        nothing destroy discussion and reasoning in general, and thus there is
        no reasoning with such men. But in the case of those who are puzzled by
        the usual problems, it is easy to meet them and to reject the arguments
        which cause their difficulty. This becomes clear from what has been said
        above (943-951).
      </p>
      <p>
        953. It is evident from these considerations, then, that opposite
        statements cannot be verified of the same subject at one time (353;
        376-377), nor can contrary ones, because every contrariety involves
        privation. This becomes clear if we reduce the definitions of all
        contraries to their principle (382). Similarly no intermediate can be
        predicated of one and the same subject. For if the subject is white,
        those who say that it is neither white nor black are wrong, for it then
        follows that it is white and is not white; for the second of the two
        terms which we have combined is true of it, and this is the
        contradictory of white (383-391).
      </p>

        954. One cannot be right, then, in holding the views either of
        Heraclitus (940) or of Anaxagoras; and if this were not so it would
        follow that contraries would be predicated of the same subject. For when
        Anaxagoras says that there is a part of everything in everything else,
        he says that nothing is sweet any more than it is bitter, and so on with
        any of the other pairs of contraries, since everything is present in
        everything else, not potentially, but actually and separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        955. And similarly all statements cannot be true or all false, both
        because of many other difficulties which might be brought forward on the
        basis of this position, and because, if all statements are false, anyone
        who says this will not speak the truth; and if all are true, it will not
        be false to say that all are false (392).

      <p>
        2225. Having argued against those who claim that contradictories may be
        verified of the same subject at the same time, the Philosopher now shows
        how these men can be persuaded to abandon this theory. His discussion is
        divided into two parts. In the first (943:C 2225) he explains his
        thesis. In the second (953:C 2243) he draws a corollary from what has
        been said (“It is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two members. In the first he explains how
        it is possible in some cases to deal with the above-mentioned theory. In
        the second (952:C 2241) he indicates in what cases it can be refuted and
        in what not (“Hence, in the case”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first (943) he does three things. First, he describes
        the way in which the foregoing theory can be disqualified in some cases.
        He says that the above-mentioned difficulty which led some people to
        adopt the position that contradictories may be verified of the same
        subject at the same time can. be dispelled if one considers its source.
      </p>
      <p>2226. <span style="font-weight: bold">For it seems</span> (944).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives two sources of this position. He says that this
        position seems to have arisen in some cases from the opinion of the
        philosophers of nature, who claimed that nothing comes to be from
        non-being, and in others from the fact that not all men make the same
        judgments about the same things, but something appears pleasant to some
        and just the opposite to others. For if one were to believe that
        whatever appears is true, it would follow from this that opposites are
        true at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>2227. <span style="font-weight: bold">For the view</span> (945).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he shows how the abovementioned position might follow from the
        two sources just given; and he points out how it may be dealt with.
        First, he shows how it might follow from the opinion of the philosophers
        of nature; and second (946:C 2227), from the belief that every
        appearance is true (“But it is also foolish”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (945), that the doctrine common to nearly all
        of the thinkers who have dealt with nature is that nothing comes to be
        from non-being, but everything from being. It is clear that something
        becomes not-white from what is actually white; but what is not-white
        does not come from what is not-white. Further, it is also evident that
        what is not-white comes from what is not not-white. Consequently, it is
        evident that what is not not-white becomes not-white, just as what is
        not-black becomes black. It is clear, then, that that from which the
        not-white comes to be is the white, and it is not not-white. This cannot
        be understood in the sense that the not-white is entirely non-being,
        because it would then seem to follow that something comes to be from
        non-being absolutely. For example, if we were to say that fire comes
        from what is not-fire, there would be the question how they think that
        that from which fire comes to be is entirely not-fire. For it would then
        seem to follow, according to them, that something comes to be from
        non-being. Hence they claimed that fire lay hidden in that from which
        fire comes to be, as is evident from the opinion of Anaxagoras, which is
        given in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>. Similarly, they believed that, if
        something comes to be not-white from what is not not-white, the
        not-white must have preexisted in that from which it comes to be, as has
        been explained. Thus it would follow, according to them, that that from
        which the not-white comes to be is both white and not-white at the same
        time, unless it is assumed that something comes to be from non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2228. But this difficulty is not hard to solve, as the Philosopher
        points out; for it has been explained in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i> how a thing comes to be from being and how from nonbeing;
        for it has been stated that something comes to be from what is a
        nonbeing in act, though it is incidentally a being in act. But it comes
        to be properly from matter, which is in potency; for it is accidental to
        the process of making that the matter from which a thing comes to be
        should be the subject of form and of privation. Thus it is not necessary
        that that from which a thing comes to be should be at the same time both
        a being and a nonbeing in act, but that it should be of itself in
        potency both to being and to non-being, i.e., both to form and to
        privation.
      </p>
      <p>
        2229.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is also foolish</span> (946).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the foregoing opinion inasmuch as it might be derived
        from the other source, i.e., from the view that every appearance is
        judged to be true. First, he rejects this source; and second (947:C
        2232), its cause (“And in general”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (946), that, just as it is foolish to think
        that contradictories may be verified of the same subject at the same
        time, so too “it is also foolish to occupy oneself with,” i.e., to
        accept, both of the foregoing opinions of the philosophers who argue
        against themselves; for it is obvious that one or the other of them must
        be in error.
      </p>
      <p>
        2230. This is evident from the facts of sensory perception; for the same
        thing never appears sweet to some and bitter to others, unless in some
        the sense organ and the power which discriminates between savors, has
        been impaired or injured. But since this does happen in some cases,
        “some must be taken as the measure,” i.e., the judgment of those whose
        senses are not impaired in this way must be taken as the rule and
        measure of truth. But this should not be understood to apply to those
        whose senses are impaired.
      </p>
      <p>
        2231. And what is evident in the case of sensory perception must also be
        said to apply in the case of good and evil, of beautiful and ugly, and
        of all attributes of this kind which are apprehended by the intellect.
        For if some conceive a thing to be good and others evil, the judgment of
        those whose intellect has not been impaired by some bad habit or by some
        bad influence or by some other cause of this kind must be the norm. For
        if someone were to hold that it is not less fitting to believe the one
        group rather than the other, this would not differ in any way from
        saying that things are as they appear “to those who push their finger
        under their eye,” i.e., who move their eye with their finger, and
        thereby make one thing appear as two, and say that it must be two
        because it appears to be so many, and again that it must be one because
        it appears to be one to those who do not move their eye with their
        finger. For it is obvious that we must base our judgment about the
        oneness of things on the judgment which the eye makes when it does not
        receive some strange impression, and not on the judgment which it makes
        when it receives such an impression. Now a man judges one visible object
        to be two because the form of the visible object is made to appear as
        two to the organ of vision when it is moved; and this double impression
        reaches the organ of the common sense as though there were two visible
        objects.
      </p>
      <p>2232. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (947).</p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the basis of the position that every appearance is true.
        For some held this because they thought that all things are in a state
        of continuous flux, and that there is nothing fixed and determinate in
        reality; and thus it would follow that a thing is such only when it is
        seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        2233. He therefore presents five arguments against this position. He
        says, first, that it is altogether unfitting to base our judgment about
        the whole truth on the fact that these sensible things which are near or
        close to us are undergoing change and are never permanent. But the truth
        must be based rather on those things which are always the same and never
        undergo any change as regards their substance, though they do appear to
        be subject to local motion. For such things are those “which contain the
        world,” i.e., the celestial bodies, to which these corruptible bodies
        are compared as things that have no quantity, as the mathematicians
        prove. Now the celestial bodies are always the same and do not at one
        time appear to be such and at another different, for they admit of no
        change which affects their substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        2234. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if there</span> (948).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument against this position. The argument
        runs thus: if there is motion in these lower bodies, there must be
        something that is moved, and it must also be moved from something and to
        something. Hence that which is moved must already be in that from which
        it is moved and yet not be in it, and this must be moved to something
        else and be continuously coming to be in it. Thus some definite
        affirmation, as well as some negation, must be true. And it will not be
        necessary that a contradiction be true of the same subject, b6cause
        according to this nothing would be moved. For if the same thing might be
        at the extreme to which it is moved and not be at it, there would be no
        reason why a thing which has not yet reached an extreme should be moved
        thereto, because it would already be there.
      </p>
      <p>2235. <span style="font-weight: bold">And if things</span> (949).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the third argument; and with a view to making this clear it
        should be borne in mind that, when Heraclitus saw that a thing increased
        in size according to some definite and very small quantity over a long
        period of time (for example, a year), he thought that some addition
        would be made in any part of that time, and that it would be
        imperceptible because of the very small quantity involved. And because
        of this he was led to believe that all things, even those which seem to
        be static, are also being moved continuously by an imperceptible motion,
        and that after a long time their motion would become apparent to the
        senses. But his opinion about increase is false; for increase does not
        take place continuously in such a way that something grows in any part
        of time, but a body is disposed to increase during some time and then
        grows, as Aristotle makes quite clear in Book VIII of the
        <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2236. Hence he says that, if the bodies around us here are in a
        continuous state of flux and motion as regards quantity, and one wishes
        to admit this even though it is not true, there is no reason why a thing
        cannot be unchanging as to its quality. For the opinion that
        contradictories are true of the same subject at the same time seems to
        be based largely on the assumption that the quantitative aspect of
        bodies does not remain constant; and thus some thought that the same
        thing is and is not four cubits long. But a thing’s substance is defined
        in terms of some quality, i.e., some form; and quality is of a
        determinate nature in things, although quantity is of an indeterminate
        nature because of change, as has been pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        2237.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, when a physician</span> (950).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the fourth argument, which runs thus: if there is nothing
        fixed in the world as regards being or non-being, why do they take this
        kind of bread which the physician prescribes and not that? For according
        to the position given above, why is this bread rather than not-bread? He
        implies that the answer cannot be in the affirmative any more than in
        the negative. And thus it would make no difference whether one ate the
        bread or did not. But we see that they take the bread which the
        physician prescribes, implying that they form a true judgment about
        bread itself, and that this kind of bread is really the one which the
        physician prescribes. Yet this would not be the case if no nature
        remained fixed in the sensible world but all things are always in a
        state of motion and flux.
      </p>
      <p>2238. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if we</span> (951).</p>
      <p>
        Then he presents the fifth argument: since the above-mentioned position
        assumes that there is no fixed truth in things because of the continuous
        change which they undergo, if the truth is identical with appearance it
        is necessary to say that we men, who make judgments about other things,
        are either in motion or are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        2239. For if we are always undergoing change and never remain the same,
        it is not surprising that things never appear the same to us; and this
        is the case with those who are ill. For since they have been changed and
        are not in the same state as when they were well, the sensible qualities
        which they perceive by way of the senses will not seem the same to them
        as they did before they became ill. For to those whose sense of taste
        has been impaired sweet things seem bitter or tasteless; and the same is
        true of other sensible qualities. Yet sensible qualities themselves are
        not changed for this reason, but they cause different impressions in
        those who are ill because their senses are differently disposed.
        Therefore, if we men, who are continuously undergoing change, make
        different judgments about other things, this should not be attributed to
        things but to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        2240. However, if we are not changing but always remain the same, there
        will therefore be something permanent in the world and consequently some
        fixed truth about which we can make positive judgments. For we make
        judgments not only about other things but also about human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        2241. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence, in the case</span> (952).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he indicates who can be disabused of the above opinion and who can
        not. He says that, if those who adopt the foregoing opinions do so not
        because of any reasoning, in the sense that they do not assume anything
        because they are obstinate, and do not inquire into the reasons for the
        things that they say but stubbornly adhere to the opinions which they
        hold, it is not easy for them to give up an opinion of this kind. For
        every argument and every demonstration comes about in this way, namely,
        by admitting the truth of some statement and investigating the reason
        for it. But those who admit nothing destroy discussion and every
        rational argument; and thus no appeal of reason can be addressed to them
        whereby they can be dislodged from their error.
      </p>
      <p>
        2242. But if there are any who are perplexed because of certain
        deficiencies (for example, because they do not understand some things
        well), it is easy to dispel such an error by removing the difficulties
        which puzzle them. This is evident from the previous discussion in which
        he deals with the difficulties that could lead to the above-mentioned
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p>2243. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is evident</span> (953).</p>
      <p>
        Then he draws three corollaries from what has been said. First, it is
        evident from the foregoing discussion that opposite statements cannot be
        verified of the same subject at one and the same time. Consequently it
        is clear from this that contraries cannot be verified of the same
        subject at the same time. And this is true because every contrariety
        involves privation; for one of two contraries is always a priv4on. This
        becomes evident if one wishes to reduce the definitions of contraries to
        their first principle; for contained in the notion of black is the
        privation of white. Since a privation, then, is a kind of negation
        having a determinate subject, it is evident that, if contraries were
        true of the same subject, both an affirmation and a negation would have
        to be true of the same subject at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        2244. Now, it is not only impossible for two contraries to be true of
        the same subject at the same time, but it is also impossible for an
        intermediate to be predicated of one and the same subject of which one
        of two extremes is predicated; for from what has been said in Book X
        (880-86-.C 2101-10 it is evident that an intermediate between contraries
        involves the privation of both extremes, whether it is designated by one
        word or by many or is nameless. Hence an intermediate between white and
        black, such as red or yellow, contains in its definition the fact that
        it is neither white nor black. Therefore, if one says that some subject
        is red when it is really white, he is saying at the same time that it is
        neither white nor black. Hence he is in error; for it would follow that
        that subject is both white and not white at the same time; because if it
        is true that that subject is neither white nor black, the other part of
        the copulative proposition may be verified of the same subject, and this
        is the contradictory of being white. Thus it follows that, if an
        intermediate and an extreme are true of the same subject,
        contradictories must be true of the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>2245. <span style="font-weight: bold">One cannot</span> (954).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the second corollary. He concludes that, if an affirmation and
        a negation are not true at the same time, neither the opinion of
        Heraclitus nor that of Anaxagoras is true. That this is so regarding the
        opinion of Heraclitus is evident from what has been said. Hence he shows
        that the same thing applies with respect to the opinion of Anaxagoras.
        He says that, if Anaxagoras’ opinion is not false, it follows that
        contraries may be predicated of the same subject, and therefore that
        contradictories may also be predicated of the same subject. This is
        shown as follows. Anaxagoras claimed that anything at all comes to be
        from anything at all, and everything which comes to be comes from
        something. Hence he was not compelled to maintain that something comes
        to be from nothing, and thus he claimed that everything is present in
        everything else. Therefore, since he posited that there is a part of
        everything in everything else (for example, a part of flesh in bone, and
        a part of whiteness in blackness, and <i>vice versa</i>), it follows
        that the whole is no more sweet than bitter. The same holds true of
        other contrarieties. And this is so if a part of anything is present in
        any whole not only potentially but actually and separately. And he added
        this because whatever comes to be from something else must pre-exist in
        it potentially and not actually. Hence contraries must preexist in the
        same subject potentially and not actually. This does not mean that
        contraries exist separately in something, because the potency for
        contraries is the same. But Anaxagoras did not know how to distinguish
        between potency and actuality.
      </p>
      <p>2246. <span style="font-weight: bold">And similarly</span> (955).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the third corollary. He concludes from what has been said that
        both opinions are false, i.e., the opinion of those who said that all
        statements are true, and the opinion of those who said that all are
        false. This is evident because of the many difficult and serious
        conclusions which result from these opinions which have been brought
        together here and above in Book IV (332402:C 611-748); and especially
        “because if all statements are false,” he who says that every statement
        is false makes a statement and thus does not speak the truth. And
        similarly if all statements are true, he who says that all are false
        will not say what is false but will speak the truth. And for this reason
        the position of one who claims that all statements are true is
        destroyed.<br /></p

        knowable objects which comes within its scope; for example, medicine and
        gymnastics do this, and so does each of the other sciences, productive
        as well as doctrinal. For each of these marks off for itself some class
        of things and occupies itself with this as with something that is real

        957. And each of the sciences mentioned somehow assumes the quiddity in
        some class of things and tries to prove the rest, with greater or lesser
        certainty. Some derive the quiddity from sensory perception, and some by
        assuming it from some other science. Hence from such a process of
        induction it becomes evident that there is no demonstration of the
        substance and of its quiddity.
      </p>
      <p>
        958. Now since there is a science of nature, it is evident that it must
        differ from both the practical and the productive sciences. For in the
        case of a productive science the source of motion is in the maker and
        not in the thing made, and it is either the art or some kind of potency.
        And similarly in the case of a practical science the motion is not in
        the thing done but rather in the agents. But the science of the
        philosopher of nature is concerned with things which have a source of
        motion in themselves. It is evident from these considerations, then,
        that the philosophy of nature must be neither practical nor productive
        but speculative; for it must fall in one of these classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        959. And since it is necessary that each one of the sciences have some
        knowledge of the quiddity and must use it as a starting point, we must
        not fail to consider how the philosophy of nature should define things,
        and how it should consider the intelligible structure of the substance:
        whether in the same way as the term snub or rather as the term concave.
        For of these the notion of snub includes the matter of the object, but
        that of concave is expressed without matter. For snubness comes into
        being in a nose, and for this reason its intelligible structure includes
        matter; for snub is a concave nose. It is evident, then, that the
        intelligible structure of flesh and of eye and of the other parts of the
        body must always be given along with matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        960. And since there is a science of being as being and as separable,
        one must consider whether this science should be held to be the same as
        the philosophy of nature or rather a science distinct from it. The
        philosophy of nature deals with things which have a principle of motion
        in themselves, and mathematics is speculative and is concerned with
        things which are permanent but are not separable. Therefore there is a
        science distinct from both of these, which treats of what is separable
        and immovable; that is to say, if there is some such substance, and I
        mean one which is separable and immovable, as we shall attempt to prove
        (1055-76). And if there is some such nature among existing things, this
        will exist somewhere and will be divine, and it will be the primary and
        highest principle. It is evident, then, that there are three classes of
        speculative science: the philosophy of nature, mathematics and theology.
      </p>
      <p>
        961. The class of speculative sciences, then, is the highest, and of
        these the last mentioned is highest of all. For it is concerned with the
        noblest of beings, and each science is said to be higher or lower by
        reason of its proper object.
      </p>
      <p>
        962. However, one might raise the question whether the science of being
        as being is universal or not. For each of the mathematical sciences
        deals with some one determinate class of things, but a universal science
        is common to all. If, then, natural substances are the primary beings,
        the philosophy of nature must be the primary science. But if there is
        another nature and substance which is separable and immovable, the
        science which treats of this must be different from and prior to the
        philosophy of nature, and must be universal because it is prior (902).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2247. Having shown with what things this science is concerned, here the
        Philosopher compares this science with the others. In regard to this he
        does three things. First (956:C 2247), he indicates what is proper to
        the particular sciences. Second (958:C 2252), he shows how the
        particular sciences differ from one another (“Now since”). Third (960:C
        2259), he compares this science with the others (“And since there is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first member of this division he does two things,
        insofar as there are two characteristics which he says pertain to the
        particular sciences. He accordingly says, first (956), that every
        particular science seeks certain principles and causes of the proper
        object of knowledge which comes within its scope. He says certain
        principles and causes because not every science considers every class of
        cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        2248. He gives as an example the science of medicine, whose object is
        health, and the art of gymnastics, whose object is physical exercise
        directed to the well-being of the body. The same thing holds true of any
        of the other sciences, whether they are “productive,” i.e., practical,
        or “doctrinal,” i.e., theoretical; because each of these particular
        sciences marks off and takes as its own some determinate class of being
        inasmuch as it confines itself to that class and deals with it alone.
        For it is concerned with that class of being as a certain kind of being,
        though not as being. But to consider this, namely, being as being,
        belongs to a science which differs from all of the particular sciences.
      </p>
      <p>2249. <span style="font-weight: bold">And each</span> (957).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives another characteristic of the particular sciences. He
        says that each of the above-mentioned particular sciences somehow
        assumes the quiddity in whatever class of things is considered. Hence it
        has been stated at the beginning of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> that
        it is necessary to assume both the existence and quiddity of the
        subject. And having assumed this, i.e., the quiddity, which every
        science uses as a middle term to demonstrate certain things, such as
        properties and the like, it tries to demonstrate these with greater or
        lesser certainty; because some sciences have a more certain method of
        demonstrating, as the mathematical sciences, and others a less certain
        one, as the natural sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        2250. And since he had said that other sciences somehow assume the
        quiddity, he therefore adds that some sciences derive the quiddity from
        sensory perception inasmuch as they acquire a knowledge of a thing’s
        essence from sensible accidents, and that others derive the quiddity by
        assuming it from other sciences, as particular sciences from universal
        ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        2251. Thus it is evident that in the particular sciences there is no
        demonstration of the substance or the quiddity of a thing. Hence both of
        the things with which the particular sciences do not concern themselves,
        i.e., a consideration of the substance or being and its quiddity,
        pertain to a universal science.
      </p>
      <p>2252. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since</span> (958).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how the particular sciences differ from one another. First
        (958:C 2252), he shows how the philosophy of nature differs from the
        productive sciences; and second (959:C 2256), how the mathematical
        sciences differ from the philosophy of nature (“And since it is
        necessary”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (958), that, since there is a particular
        science of nature, it must be different “from the practical,” i.e., from
        the sciences which govern activity and from those which govern
        production; for every practical science is either a science of action or
        a science of production.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        2253. In order to understand this difference we must consider a
        distinction which was made above in Book IX (790:C 1864), namely, that
        to act and to make differ; for to act is said properly of an operation
        which remains in the agent and does not pass over into some external
        matter, for instance, to understand and to perceive and so on. But to
        make or produce is said of an operation which passes over into some
        external matter which is changed, for example, to heat and to cut and
        the like. Hence there is a science of activity by which we are
        instructed how to perform correctly those operations which are called
        actions; and moral science is such. But that science by which we make
        something correctly is a productive science. The art of carpentry and
        the like belong to this class.
      </p>
      <p>
        2254. Now the philosophy of nature differs from each of these sciences
        which govern operations; for the productive sciences do not have a
        principle of motion in the thing made but in the maker, and this
        principle is either the art, which is a directive principle, or some
        potency which is the principle executing the work. Similarly “the
        practical sciences,” i.e., those governing activity, do not have a
        principle of motion in that upon which the activity is exercised but
        rather in the agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        2255. But those things which belong to the consideration of the
        philosophy of nature have their principles of motion in themselves,
        since nature is a principle of motion in the thing in which it exists.
        It is evident, then, that the philosophy of nature is a science neither
        of action nor of production but is speculative. For the philosophy of
        nature must fall into one of these classes, i.e., active, productive or
        speculative science. Hence, if it is a science neither of action nor of
        production, it follows that it must be speculative.
      </p>
      <p>2256. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since</span> (959).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how the mathematical sciences differ from the philosophy
        of nature. He says that, since each of the sciences must somehow come to
        know the quiddity and must use this as a starting point with a view to
        demonstrating, the sciences must be distinguished on the basis of a
        different method of defining. Hence in order to understand how the
        philosophy of nature differs from the other sciences we must not neglect
        to consider the method which the philosophy of nature uses in defining
        things, and how the definition should be considered in the philosophy of
        nature; that is, whether a thing should be defined in the way that snub
        is or in the way that concave is.
      </p>
      <p>
        2257. Now the definition of snub includes sensible matter, but that of
        concave does not; for since snubness is found only in a definite
        sensible matter, because it is found only in a nose, the intelligible
        structure of snub must therefore include sensible matter; for snub is
        defined thus: snub is a concave nose. Sensible matter, however, is not
        included in the definition of concave or curved. Hence, just as sensible
        matter is included in the definition of snub, so too it must be included
        in the definition of flesh and of eye and of the other parts of the
        body. The same holds true of other natural beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        2258. The difference between the philosophy of nature and mathematics is
        taken from this, because the philosophy of nature deals with those
        things whose definitions include sensible matter, whereas mathematics
        deals with those things whose definitions do not include sensible
        matter, although they have being in sensible matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        2259. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since there is</span> (960).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he compares this science with the other particular sciences; and in
        regard to this he does three things. First (960:C 2259), he compares
        this science with the different particular sciences in reference to the
        way in which their objects are separate from matter. Second (961:C
        2265), he compares them from the viewpoint of nobility (“The class of
        speculative sciences”). Third (962:C 2265), he compares them from the
        viewpoint of universality (“However, one”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (960), that there is a science of being
        insofar as it is separable; for it is the office of this science not
        only to establish the truth about being in common (and this is to
        establish the truth about being as being) but also to establish the
        truth about things which are separate from matter in being. Hence it is
        necessary to consider whether this science whose function is to consider
        these two things is the same as the philosophy of nature or differs from
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        2260. That it differs from the philosophy of nature he makes clear as
        follows: the philosophy of nature is concerned with things which have a
        principle of motion in themselves; therefore natural things must have a
        definite matter, because only that which has matter is moved. But
        mathematics studies immovable things; for those things whose
        intelligible structure does not include sensible matter must likewise
        not have motion in their intelligible structure, since motion is found
        only in sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        2261. But those things which mathematics considers are not separable
        from matter and motion in being but only in their intelligible
        structure. Hence the science which treats that kind of being which is
        separable from matter and from motion and is immovable in every respect
        must be one which differs both from mathematics and from the philosophy
        of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        2262. He says here, “if there is some such substance” apart from
        sensible substances which is immovable in every respect. He says this
        because the existence of some such substance has not yet been proved,
        although he intends to prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
        2263. And if there is some such nature among existing things, i.e., one
        which is separable and immovable, it is necessary that “such a nature
        exist somewhere,” i.e., that it be attributed to some substance. And
        whatever has this nature must be something that is divine and the
        highest of all; because the simpler and more actual a being is, the
        nobler it is and the more it is prior and a cause of other things. Thus
        it is evident that the science which considers separate beings of this
        kind should be called the divine science and the science of first
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        2264. From this he again concludes that there are three classes of
        speculative science: the philosophy of nature, which considers things
        that are movable and have sensible matter in their definition;
        mathematics, which considers immovable things that do not have sensible
        matter in their definition yet exist in sensible matter; and theology,
        which considers beings that are entirely separate from matter.
      </p>
      <p>2265. <span style="font-weight: bold">The class</span> (961).</p>
      <p>
        Next he compares this science with the others from the viewpoint of
        nobility. He says that the speculative sciences are the noblest, because
        of all the sciences the speculative seek knowledge for its own sake,
        whereas the practical seek knowledge for the sake of some work. And
        among the speculative sciences there is one that, is highest, namely,
        theology, since a science which deals with more noble beings is itself
        more noble; for a science is more noble in proportion to the greater
        nobility of its object.
      </p>
      <p>
        2266. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, one might</span> (962).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he compares this science with the others from the viewpoint of
        universality. He says that one might raise the question whether or not
        the science which deals with separate beings must be held to be a
        universal science of being as being; and that it must be such he shows
        by a process of elimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        2267. For it is evident that the foregoing sciences which deal with
        operations are not universal sciences, and he therefore omits them. In
        the case of the speculative sciences it is evident that every
        mathematical science is concerned with some one determinate class of
        things. But a universal science deals with all things in common. No
        mathematical science, then, can be the one which treats all beings in
        common. Regarding the philosophy of nature it is evident that, if
        natural substances, which are perceptible and movable, are the primary
        beings, the philosophy of nature must be the primary science; because
        the order of the sciences corresponds with that of their subjects, as
        has been stated already (961:C 2265). But if there is a different nature
        and substance over and above natural substances, which is separable and
        immovable, there must be a science which differs from the philosophy of
        nature and is prior to it. And because it is first, it must be
        universal; for it is the same science which treats of primary beings and
        of what is universal, since the primary beings are the principles of the
        others.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 8: 1064b 15-1065b 4
      </p>
      <p>
        963. Since the term being in its unqualified sense has many meanings,
        and one of these is the accidental, it is first necessary to consider
        this sense of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        964. Now it is evident that none of the traditional sciences are
        concerned with the accidental. The science of building does not consider
        what will happen to the occupants of a house, for example, whether they
        will dwell there unhappily or in the opposite way; nor is the art of
        weaving or of shoemaking or of cooking concerned with it. But each of
        these sciences considers only what is proper to itself, and this is its
        particular end.
      </p>
      <p>
        965. Further, no science considers a man insofar as he is a musician or
        also a grammarian; nor does any science consider the quibble that “when
        one who is a musician has become a grammarian he will be both at the
        same time, although he was not so before; but that which is and has not
        always been, must have come to be; and therefore he must have at the
        same time become both a musician and a grammarian.” None of the known
        sciences are concerned with this except sophistry, and thus Plato was
        not wrong in saying that sophistry is concerned with non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        966. That it is impossible to have a science of the accidental will be
        evident to those who are trying to learn what the accidental is.
        Accordingly, we say of all things that some are always and of necessity
        (not necessity in the sense of what is done by force but with the
        meaning used in matters of demonstration); others are for the most part;
        and others are neither for the most part nor always and of necessity,
        but are such as occur by chance. For example, there might be cold
        weather during the dog days, but this occurs neither always and of
        necessity nor for the most part, though it might happen sometimes. Hence
        the accidental is what occurs, but neither always and of necessity nor
        for the most part. What the accidental is, then, has been stated; and it
        is evident that there is no science of it. For every science deals with
        what is always or for the most part, but the accidental belongs to
        neither of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        967. It is also evident that there are no causes and principles of
        accidental being such as there are of essential being; for if there
        were, everything would be of necessity. For if one thing exists when
        another does, and this again when something else does, and if this last
        thing is not a matter of chance but exists of necessity, then that of
        which it was the cause will also exist of necessity, and so on right
        down to the last thing said to be caused. But this was assumed to be
        accidental. Hence everything will be of necessity, and the possibility
        of anything happening by chance or being contingent and of coming to be
        or not coming to be will be entirely removed from the sphere of things
        which are generated. And if the cause is assumed not to exist but to be
        something which is coming to be, the same results will follow; for
        everything will come to be of necessity. For tomorrow’s eclipse will
        occur if something else does, and this again if some other thing occurs,
        and the latter if still another thing occurs. And if time is subtracted
        in this way from the limited time between the present and tomorrow, we
        shall at some point reach something which exists now. Therefore, since
        this exists, everything which comes after it will occur of necessity, so
        that everything will occur of necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        968. Regarding being in the sense of what is true and accidental being,
        the former depends upon the combination which the mind makes and is a
        modification of it. It is for this reason that it is not the principles
        of this kind of being that are sought but of that which exists outside
        the mind and is separable; and the latter kind of being is not necessary
        but indeterminate (and by this I mean the accidental); and the causes.
        of this kind of being are indeterminate and unordered (543-59).
      </p>
      <p>
        969. And that for the sake of which something exists is found both in
        things which come to be by nature and in those which are a result of
        mind. It is luck when one of these comes about accidentally; for just as
        a being is either essential or accidental, so also is a cause. And luck
        is an accidental cause of those things which come to be for some end as
        a result of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        970. And for this reason both luck and mind are concerned with the same
        thing; for there is no choice without mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        971. However, the causes from which some lucky result comes to be are
        indeterminate; and for this reason luck is uncertain for human knowledge
        and is an accidental cause, although in an absolute sense it is a cause
        of nothing.

        972. There is good or bad luck when the result is good or bad, and
        prosperity or misfortune when this occurs on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        973. And since nothing accidental is prior to things which are
        essential, neither are accidental causes prior. Therefore, if luck or
        chance is the cause of the heavens, mind and nature are prior causes.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2268. After having restated in a summary way the points that were
        discussed before with regard to this science’s field of study, here the
        Philosopher begins to summarize the things that were said about
        imperfect being both in Book VI (543-559:C 1171-1244) of this work and
        in the <i>Physics</i>. He does this, first (963:C 2268), with regard to
        accidental being; and second (974:C 2289), with regard to motion (“One
        thing”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first member of this division he does two things. First,
        he states the things that have been said about accidental being. Second
        (969:C 2284), he states those that pertain to an accidental cause (“And
        that for the sake”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (963), he points out
        what he intends to do. He says that, since, “being in its unqualified
        sense,” i.e., taken in general, has many meanings, of which one is the
        accidental (as when we say, for example, that the musician is white),
        and these have been explained above in Book V (435-39:C 885-97), we
        ought to consider accidental being before we deal with essential being,
        so that when this kind of being has been disposed of we may speak in a
        more positive way of essential being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2269. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it is evident</span> (964).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he proceeds to carry out his plan; and in regard to this he does
        two things. First (964:C 2269), he shows that the consideration of
        accidental being belongs to no science. Second (968:C 2283), he excludes
        both this kind of being and the being which signifies the truth of a
        proposition from this science’s field of study (“Regarding being”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first he does two things. First, he shows that no
        science considers accidental being; and second (966:C 2276), that none
        can do so (“That it is impossible”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (964), he shows by a
        process of elimination that no science considers accidental being. He
        says that no one of the sciences treated by us is concerned with the
        accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        2270. Now accidental here does not mean something in one of the
        categories of accidents, in the sense that whiteness is an accident; for
        there are many sciences which deal with accidents of this kind, because
        such accidents have a certain species of themselves and certain
        determinate causes in their subject. And they are called accidents
        because they do not have being of themselves but exist in something
        else.—But here accidental means what happens accidentally; for example,
        it is accidental that a musician is white. For accidents of this kind do
        not have any species or any determinate cause. And no science is
        concerned with this kind of being. He proves this by induction.
      </p>
      <p>
        2271. For the art of building does not consider what happens
        accidentally to the occupants of the house which it builds, whether they
        happen to experience some unhappiness there or live there “in the
        opposite way,” i.e., happily; for this is accidental to a house.
        Similarly, the art of weaving does not consider what happens to those
        who use the cloth which has been woven; nor does the art of shoemaking
        consider what happens to those who use shoes; nor does the art of
        cooking consider what happens to the food, for example, whether someone
        uses too much of it or just what is necessary. But each of these
        sciences considers only what is proper to itself, i.e., its subject and
        the properties of its subject. This is the goal of any science.
      </p>
      <p>
        2272. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, no science</span> (965).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives the reason why no science considers things which are
        accidental. It is because the accidental is not a being in the proper
        sense but is rather a non-being inasmuch as it is not essentially and
        properly one; for one and being are convertible. Now every science deals
        with being, and therefore it follows that no science is concerned with
        the accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        2273. Hence he says that a musician is also a grammarian, but not
        inasmuch as he is a musician. And if it happens that one who is a
        musician becomes a grammarian, he has become both at the same time,
        i.e., both a grammarian and a musician, although he was not so before.
        But if some being exists now and was not always a being, it must have
        come to be. Therefore, if “a musician grammarian” is a kind of being,
        since it did not always exist it must have become both at the same time,
        i.e., both a musician and a grammarian, because any being admits of some
        generation. Hence, since these have not come to be at the same time, it
        is evident that this whole—a musician-grammarian—is not one being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2274. Nor should it be urged that matter, which is ungenerated, has
        existence prior to the generation of substances; for it is not the form
        that properly comes to be but the composite, as has been proved in Book
        VII (611:C 1423). Now matter does not have prior existence as an actual
        being but only as a potential one. But here the musician has actual
        prior existence. Therefore, since he who was a musician has become a
        grammarian, only a grammarian has come to be, and not the whole-a
        grammarian musician. Hence this whole is not one being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2275. For this reason no science that is truly a science and attains
        certainty is concerned with accidental being. Only sophistry deals with
        it; and it uses the accidental as though it were something of itself in
        order to deceive. From this there arises the fallacy of accident, which
        is most effective in deceiving even those who are wise, as is stated in
        Book I of the <i>Sophistical Refutations</i>. Hence Plato was not wrong
        in saying that sophistry is concerned with non-being, because it deals
        with the accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        2276.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">That it is impossible</span> (966).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that it is impossible for any science to consider accidental
        being, and he does this in two ways. First, he proceeds from the
        definition of accidental being. He says that, if we consider what
        accidental being is, it will be evident that there can be no science of
        it. With a view to proving his point he makes a tripartite division. He
        says that of things which are said to be there are some which are always
        and of necessity (not necessity in the sense of force, but in the sense
        used in demonstrations, as when we say that a triangle necessarily has
        three angles equal to two right angles; for we use the term necessary in
        this way to mean what cannot be otherwise). There are others which are
        for the most part; for example, a man is born with five fingers on each
        hand. This does not happen always, since it does happen that some are
        born with six fingers, but it does happen for the most part. And there
        are others which are neither always and of necessity nor for the most
        part but are such as occur by chance; for example, “there might be cold
        weather during the dog days,” i.e., during the days of the dog-star.
        This occurs neither always and of necessity nor for the most part,
        though even this kind of being sometimes occurs. But since it happens
        rarely, and not always and of necessity or for the most part, it is
        called accidental being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2277. For things which occur either always or for the most part are such
        that one is the cause of the other or both are referred to one cause
        which is the proper cause of each. And they occur in both ways. If a
        cause produces its effect without fail, the effect will be one that is
        said to be of necessity. But if a cause can fail because of some
        obstacle, the effect will be one that occurs for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
        2278. But if it so happens in the case of two things that one is not the
        cause of the other and there is no single common proper cause which
        links them together, they will seldom be combined. Such is the case, for
        example, when we say “the musician builds”; for the cause of building is
        not the art of music but that of building, which differs completely from
        the art of music. The same thing is true of the previous example; for
        excessive heat during the dog days is a result of the sun moving closer
        to the earth; but that there should be cold weather at this time is a
        result of some other cause, such as Saturn’s being somehow connected
        with the sun. Hence, if there is cold weather during the dog days, which
        are caused by the sun, this is accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        2279. It is evident, then, that the accidental is what occurs neither
        always nor for the most part. But every science is concerned with what
        occurs either always or for the most part, as has been proved in Book I
        of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. Thus it is clear that there can be no
        science of the accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        2280. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is also evident</span> (967).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, with a view to making the same point he says that accidental
        being has no causes and principles such as essential being has; and thus
        there can be no science of it, since every science is concerned with
        principles and causes.’He proves this as follows: if accidental being
        should have proper causes, everything would happen of necessity; for
        essential beings have a cause such that when it is placed the effect
        necessarily follows. And if there were some cause from which an effect
        did not follow of necessity but only for the most part, this would be a
        result of some obstacle, which can be accidental. If, then, accidental
        being had a necessary proper cause, so that when this cause is placed
        its effect necessarily follows (although perhaps it is not necessary to
        place it), the result would be that everything happens of necessity. He
        proves this as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        2281. Let us suppose that something past or present is the cause of a
        future effect, and that this cause has already been placed. But when the
        cause has been placed, as you say, the effect necessarily follows.
        Therefore, if this past or present thing which has already been placed
        is the cause of this future effect, and this in turn is the cause of
        another, the effect will follow not in just any way at all but
        necessarily. For once the cause has been placed, that whose cause has
        been placed will necessarily follow, and so on right down to the last
        thing caused. But this was assumed to be accidental. Therefore that
        which was assumed to be accidental will happen of necessity.
        Consequently, everything will happen of necessity; and “the possibility
        of anything happening by chance,” i.e., any fortuitous event, “or being
        contingent,” i.e., being accidental, and “of coming to be or not coming
        to be,” i.e., the possibility of anything being or not being, or being
        generated or not being generated, will be completely removed from the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        2282. But because one can meet this argument by saying that the cause of
        future contingent events has not yet been placed as either present or
        past but is still contingent and future, and that for this reason its
        effects are still contingent, he therefore throws out this objection
        (“And if the cause”). He points out that the same unreasonable
        conclusion follows if it is held that the cause of future contingent
        events is not something that already exists in the present or in the
        past but is something that is coming to be and is future, because it
        will follow that everything happens of necessity, as has been stated
        before. For if that cause is future, it must be going to be at some
        definite time, tomorrow say, and must be quite distinct from the
        present. Therefore, if an eclipse, which is the proper cause of certain
        future events, will occur tomorrow, and everything that occurs is a
        result of some cause, tomorrow’s eclipse must occur “if something else
        does,” i.e., because of something that existed before, and this in turn
        because of something else. Thus by always anticipating or subtracting
        causes some part of the time between the present moment and the future
        eclipse will be removed. And since that time is limited, and every
        limited thing is used up when some part of it is removed, we shall
        therefore reach at some point some cause which exists now. Hence, if
        that cause is already posited, all future effects will follow of
        necessity; and thus everything will occur of necessity. But since this
        is impossible, it is therefore evident that things which are accidental
        have no determinate cause from which they necessarily follow once it has
        been placed. Everything that can be said about this has been given in
        Book VI (543-552:C 1171-90).
      </p>
      <p>2283. <span style="font-weight: bold">Regarding being</span> (968).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that accidental being and the being which signifies the
        truth of a proposition must be omitted from this science. He says that
        there is one kind of being, “being in the sense of what is true,” or
        being as signifying the truth of a proposition, and it consists in
        combination; and there is accidental being.’ The first consists in the
        combination which the intellect makes and is a modification in the
        operation of the intellect. Hence the principles of this kind of being
        are not investigated in the science which considers the kind of being
        that exists outside of the mind and is separable, as has been stated.
        The second, i.e., accidental being, is not necessary but indeterminate.
        Hence it does not have a related cause but an infinite number of causes
        that are not related to one another. Therefore this science does not
        consider such being.
      </p>
      <p>
        2284.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And that for the sake</span> (969).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he summarizes the things that have been said about an accidental
        cause, or luck, in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>. There are four points.
        First, he states what it is; and with a view to investigating this he
        prefaces his remarks with the statement, “And that for the sake of
        which,” i.e., what exists for the sake of some end, is found both in
        those things which exist by nature and in those which are a result of
        mind. This is evident in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>. He adds that
        luck is found in those things which occur for the sake of some end, but
        that it is accidental. For just as we find both essential being and
        accidental being, so too we find essential causes and accidental causes.
        Luck, then, is an accidental cause “of those things which come to be for
        the sake of some end,” i.e., some goal, not by nature but by choice. For
        example, when someone chooses to dig in a field in order to plant a tree
        and thereupon discovers a treasure, we say that this is accidental
        because it is unintended. And this happens by luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        2285. <span style="font-weight: bold">And for this reason</span> (970).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows in what instances luck exists. He says that, since
        there is choice only where there is mind or thought, luck and thought
        must be concerned with the same thing. Hence luck is not found in those
        things which lack reason, such as plants, stones and brute animals, or
        in children who lack the use of reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        2286. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, the causes</span> (971).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he shows that luck is uncertain. He says that there are an
        infinite number of causes by which something can happen by luck, as is
        evident in the examples given; for one can find a treasure by digging in
        the earth either to plant something or to make a grave or for an
        infinite number of other reasons. And since everything infinite is
        unknown, luck is therefore uncertain for human knowledge. And it is
        called an accidental cause, although absolutely and of itself it is the
        cause of nothing.
      </p>
      <p>2287. <span style="font-weight: bold">There is good</span> (972).</p>
      <p>
        Fourth, he explains why luck is said to be good or bad. He points out
        that luck is said to be good or bad because the accidental result is
        good or bad. And if the accidental result is a great good, it is then
        called prosperity; and if a great evil, it is then called misfortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        2288. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since nothing</span> (973).
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifth, he shows that luck is not the primary cause of things; for
        nothing that is accidental is prior to things that are essential. Hence
        an accidental cause is not prior to a proper cause. Thus, if luck and
        chance, which are accidental causes, are the causes of the heavens, mind
        and nature, which are proper causes, must be prior causes.<br /></p

        <span style="font-weight: bold">The Definition of Motion</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 9: 1065b 5-1066a 34 1
      </p>
      <p>
        974. One thing is actual only, another potential, and others both actual
        and potential; and of these one is a being, another a quantity, and
        another one of the other categories. Motion is not something apart from
        things themselves; for a thing is always changed according to the
        categories of being, and there is nothing that is common to these and in
        no one category. And each belongs to all its members in a twofold way,
        for example, this particular thing; for sometimes this is the form of a
        thing and sometimes its privation. And with regard to quality, one thing
        is white and another black; and with regard to quantity, one is perfect
        and another imperfect; and with regard to motion in space, one thing
        tends upwards and another downwards, or one is light and another heavy.
        Hence there are as many kinds of motion and change as there are of
        being.
      </p>
      <p>
        975. Now since each class of things is divided by potentiality and
        actuality, I call motion the actualization of what is potential as such.
      </p>
      <p>
        976. That our account is true becomes evident as follows: when the
        buildable in the sense in which we call it such actually exists, it is
        being built; and this is the process of building. The same is true of
        learning, walking, healing, dancing and bereaving. And motion occurs
        when something is in this very act, and neither before nor after.
        Motion, then, belongs to what is potential when it is actual and is
        engaged in activity, not inasmuch as it is itself, but inasmuch as it is
        movable.
      </p>
      <p>
        977. And by the phrase inasmuch as I mean this: bronze is potentially a
        statue, but the actuality of bronze inasmuch as it is bronze is not
        motion; for to be bronze and to be some potentiality are not the same.
        If they were absolutely the same in meaning, the actuality of bronze
        would be a kind of motion; but they are not the same. This is evident in
        the case of contraries; for the potentiality of being healed and that of
        being ill are not the same, because being). healed would then be the
        same as being ill. But it is the subject which is both healed and ill,
        whether it be moisture or blood, that is one and the same. And since
        they are not the same, just as color and the visible object are not the
        same, it is the actualization of what is potential insofar as it is
        potential that is motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        978. That motion is this, and that a thing is being moved when it is
        actual in this way, and neither before nor after, is evident. For each
        thing is capable of being at one time actual and at another not, for
        example, the buildable as buildable; and the actualization of the
        buildable as buildable is the process of building. For the actuality is
        either the process of building or this particular house. But when the
        house exists, it will no longer be buildable; but what is being built is
        what is buildable. Therefore the process of building must be its
        actualization; and the process of building is a kind of motion. The same
        reasoning also applies to other motions.
      </p>
      <p>
        979. That this account is true is evident from what others say about
        motion, and because it is not easy to define it otherwise. For one
        cannot place it in another class.
      </p>
      <p>
        980. This is evident from what some say; for they call it otherness and
        inequality and non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        981. However, no one of these is necessarily moved, and change is not to
        these or from these anymore than to or from their opposites.
      </p>
      <p>
        982. The reason for putting motion in this class is that it seems to be
        something indefinite; and the principles in one of the columns of
        opposites (60) are indefinite because they are privative, for no one of
        them is either a this or such or any of the other categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        983. The reason why motion seems to be indefinite is that it cannot be
        identified either with the potentiality or with the actuality of
        existing things; for neither what is capable of having a certain
        quantity nor what actually has it is necessarily being moved. And motion
        seems to be an actuality, but an incomplete one; and the reason for this
        is that the potentiality of which it is the actuality is incomplete.
        Hence it is difficult to grasp what motion is; for it must be put under
        privation or under potentiality or under simple actuality; but none of
        these appear to be possible. It remains, then, that it must be as we
        have said, i.e., both an actuality and a non-actuality as explained,
        which is difficult to see but capable of existing.’
      </p>
      <p>
        984. That motion belongs to the thing moved is evident; for it is the
        actualization of the thing moved by what is capable of causing motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        985. And the actuality of what is capable of causing motion is no other
        than this; for it must be the actuality of both.
      </p>
      <p>
        986. And a thing is capable of causing motion because of its power, but
        it is a mover because of its activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        987. But it is on the thing moved that it is capable of acting. Thus the
        actuality of both alike is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        988. And it is one just as the distance from one to two and that from
        two to one are the same, and just as what goes up and what comes down
        are the same, although their being is not one. The same applies in the
        case of the mover and the thing moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2289. Having settled the issue about accidental being, the Philosopher
        now states his views about motion; and this is divided into three parts.
        First (974:C 2289), he deals with motion in itself; second (989:C 2314),
        with infinity, which is a property of motion and of other continuous
        things (“The infinite”); and third (1005:C 2355), with the division of
        motion into its species (“Everything which is changed”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. First, he explains what motion is;
        and second (984:C 2308), he points out what the subject of motion is
        (“That motion”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he prefaces his
        discussion with some points which are necessary for defining motion.
        Second (975:C 2294), he defines’ motion (“Now since each”). Third (979:C
        2299), he proves that the definition of motion is a good one (“That this
        account”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first member of this division he gives four points from
        which he infers a fifth. The first is that being is divided by actuality
        and by potentiality. He says that one kind of being is actual only, such
        as the prime mover, which is God; another is potential only, such as
        prime matter; and others are both potential and actual, as all
        intermediate things. Or by the phrase <i>actual only</i> he means what
        already has a form completely, as what is now completely white; and by
        <i>potential only</i>, what does not have a form, as what is not white
        in any way; and by <i>potential and actual</i>, what does not yet have a
        form completely but is being moved to a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        2290. The second point is that being is divided by the ten categories,
        as is implied when he says that there is one kind of being which exists
        of itself, i.e., substance, and another is quantity, and another is
        quality, and so on for the other categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        2291. The third point is that motion does not have a distinct nature
        separate from other things; but every form insofar as it is in a state
        of becoming is an imperfect actuality which is called motion. For to be
        moved to whiteness is the same as for whiteness to begin to become
        actual in a subject; but it need not be in complete actuality. This is
        his meaning in saying that motion is not something apart from things
        themselves; for everything which is being changed is being changed
        according to the categories of being. And just as the ten categories
        have nothing in common as their genus, in a similar way there is no
        genus common to all the kinds of motion. Hence motion is not a category
        distinct from the others but is a natural concomitant of the other
        categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        2292. The fourth point is that a thing is found in any genus in two
        ways, namely, perfectly and imperfectly; for example, in the genus of
        substance one thing has the character of a form, and another the
        character of a privation; and in the genus of quality there is one thing
        which is perfect, as a white thing, which has a perfect color, and
        another which is imperfect, as a black thing, which is imperfect in the
        genus of color. And in the genus of quantity one thing is perfect, and
        this is called “great,” and another is imperfect, and this is called
        “small”; and in the genus of place, in which “motion in space” is found,
        i.e., local motion, one thing tends upwards and another downwards, or
        one is light and another heavy inasmuch as that is called light which
        actually rises upwards, and that heavy which actually sinks downwards;
        and one of these has the character of something perfect and the other
        the character of something imperfect. The reason is that all the
        categories are divided by contrary differences; and one contrary always
        has the character of something perfect, and the other the character of
        something imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        2293. From these four points he infers a fifth, namely, that there are
        as many kinds of motion and change as there are of being. He does not
        say this because there is motion in every genus of being, but because,
        just as being is divided by actuality and potentiality and by substance
        and accident and the like, and in terms of perfect and imperfect, so
        also is motion. This follows from his assertion that motion is not
        something apart from things. The way in which change and motion differ
        will be explained below.
      </p>
      <p>2294. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since each</span> (975).</p>
      <p>
        Next, he defines motion. First, he gives its definition, saying that,
        since in each genus of being, being is divided by potentiality and
        actuality, motion is said to be the actualization of what is potential
        insofar as it is such.
      </p>
      <p>
        2295. <span style="font-weight: bold">That our account</span> (976).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he explains the definition which has been given; and in regard
        to this he does two things. First (976:C 2295), he explains what was
        given in the definition with regard to the subject of motion; and second
        (978:C 2297), what was given as the genus of motion (“That motion is
        this”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first member of this division he does two things.
        First, he explains the part of the definition, <i>what is potential</i>;
        and second (977:C 2296), the part, <i>insofar as it is such</i> (“And by
        the phrase”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (976), that it is evidently true from this
        that motion is as we have described it to be. For it is clear that the
        term <i>buildable</i> signifies something in potentiality, and that the
        potentiality in question is presented as being brought to actuality by
        what is designated as being built; and this actuality is called the
        <i>process of building</i>. The same thing is also true of other
        motions, such as walking, altering, and the like. And a thing is said to
        be being moved when it is coming to be such and such actually and has
        been such and such potentially, and neither before nor after. If this is
        so, then, it follows that motion belongs to a thing in potentiality when
        it is being brought to actuality; and by this I mean that it is being
        brought to actuality insofar as it is movable; for a thing is said to be
        movable because it is in potentiality to motion. Hence a potentiality of
        this kind is being brought to actuality when it is actually being moved;
        but what is potential “inasmuch as it is itself,” i.e., in reference to
        what it actually is and in itself, does not have to be brought to
        actuality by motion. For it actually is this before it begins to be
        moved. And neither is it being brought to actuality by motion insofar as
        it is in potentiality to the terminus of motion, because so long as it
        is being moved it still remains in potentiality to the terminus of
        motion. But a thing is being brought from potentiality to actuality by
        motion only in the case of that potentiality which is signified when a
        thing is said to be movable, i.e., capable of being moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        2296. <span style="font-weight: bold">And by the phrase</span> (977).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he explains a phrase which was given in the definition of motion,
        namely, insofar as it is such, or inasmuch as it i’s of this kind. With
        a view to making this clear he says that bronze is in potentiality to
        being a statue, and thus the subject bronze and bronze in potentiality
        to being a statue are the same, although they are not the same in their
        meaning; for the concept of bronze as bronze and that of bronze insofar
        as it has some potentiality are different; and this is what he means
        when he says that to be bronze and to be some potentiality are not the
        same. For if they were the same in their meaning, then just as motion is
        an actuality of bronze insofar as it is bronze in potentiality, in a
        similar way motion would be the actuality of bronze insofar as it is
        bronze. But bronze and the potentiality of bronze do not have the same
        meaning. This is evident in the case of the potentiality for contraries,
        because the potentiality “of being healed and that of being ill” do not
        have the same meaning; for the concept of a potentiality is derived from
        that of the actuality. Hence, if the potentiality of being healed and
        that of being ill were the same in meaning, it would follow that being
        healed and being ill are the same. But this is impossible. Therefore the
        potentiality for each of two contraries is not the same in meaning,
        although it is the same in subject. For it is the same subject which can
        be healed or be ill; and whether that subject is any one at all of the
        humors in the animal’s body, or the blood, which is more natural and
        proper to the life and nourishment of the animal, it can be a cause of
        its being healed or being ill. Since, then, the potentiality of being
        healed and that of being ill are not the same in meaning, it is evident
        that neither of these is the same as its subject in meaning, because any
        two things which are essentially the same as some third thing are
        themselves essentially the same. Hence, since bronze and bronze in
        potentiality to being a statue are not the same in meaning, just as
        color and the visible object are not the same, the phrase insofar as it
        is such must be added to the statement that motion is the actualization
        of what is potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        2297. <span style="font-weight: bold">That motion is this</span> (978).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he explains the term which was given as the genus in the definition
        of motion. That motion is this is evident, he says, because the said
        motion then exists “when it” (the actuality of what is potential) “is
        actual in this way,” and neither before nor after. For obviously every
        movable thing can be at one time in a state of actualization and at
        another not; for the buildable as buildable at one time is in a state of
        potentiality and at another time is in a state of actualization. He says
        “the buildable as buildable” because the matter of a house is in
        potentiality to two things, namely, to the form of a house, and to the
        process of being built. And it is possible for it at one time to be in a
        state of potentiality to both and at another to be in a state of
        actuality. But the potentiality which the matter of a house has for
        being built is signified by the term <i>buildable</i>. Therefore the
        buildable as buildable becomes actual when it is being built; and thus
        the process of building is the actuality of the buildable as buildable.
      </p>
      <p>
        2298. He proves this as follows: the matter of a house is in
        potentiality to only two actualities, namely, the act of building the
        house and the form of the house. But the term <i>buildable</i> signifies
        a potentiality belonging to the matter of the house. Therefore, since
        there is some actuality corresponding to every potentiality, the
        potentiality signified by the term buildable must correspond to one of
        these two actualities, namely, either to the form of the house or to the
        act of building. But the form of the house is not the actuality of the
        buildable as buildable, because when the form of the house develops, the
        house is no longer buildable but is already built. But the buildable is
        in a state of actuality when the house is actually being built.
        Therefore the act of building must be the actuality of the buildable.
        Now the act of building is a kind of motion; and thus motion is the
        actuality of the buildable. The same explanation holds for all other
        motions. It is evident, then, that motion is the actuality of what is
        potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        2299. <span style="font-weight: bold">That this account</span> (979).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he proves that the definition given is a good one. First, he gives
        a general proof. He says that it is evident that this definition of
        motion is a good one if we consider what others have said about motion
        when they defined it; and also because it cannot easily be defined in a
        different way. For it cannot be put in any other class than in that of
        actuality.
      </p>
      <p>2300. <span style="font-weight: bold">This is evident</span> (980).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he states what others have said about motion. He says that some
        have said that motion is otherness, others inequality, and others
        non-being. And perhaps they spoke of it thus because the thing being
        moved gradually loses its initial state, and so long as it is being
        moved it is always in different states and comes closer to its goal.
      </p>
      <p>2301. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, no one</span> (981).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he shows that the definitions given above are not suitable ones;
        for they do not fit motion so far as its subject is concerned, i.e., the
        thing moved. For if motion were non-being or inequality or otherness, it
        would follow that every non-being or whatever is other or unequal is
        moved, but it is not necessary that any of these should be moved. Hence
        motion is not as they have described it to be. The same thing is also
        apparent with regard to the termini of motion, which are the limits from
        which and to which there is motion. For motion is not to non-being or
        inequality or otherness rather than to their opposites, nor is motion
        from these rather than from their opposites. For there can be motion
        from nonbeing to being and vice versa, and from otherness to likeness,
        and from inequality to equality and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>2302. <span style="font-weight: bold">The reason</span> (982).</p>
      <p>
        Fourth, he shows why some defined motion in the foregoing way. He says
        that the reason why they put motion in the above-mentioned class is that
        motion seems to be something indefinite, and things which are privative
        are indefinite. Hence they assumed that motion is a kind of privation.
      </p>
      <p>
        2303. It should also be noted, as has been pointed out in Book I (60:C
        127) of this work, that the Pythagoreans posited two orders of things,
        and in one of these, which they called the order of good things, they
        placed things which seem to be perfect, for example, light, right, male,
        rest, and the like; and in the other order, which they listed under
        evil, they placed darkness, left, female, motion and the like. And they
        said that all such things are indefinite and privative because no one of
        them seems to signify “either a this,” i.e., substance, “or such,” i.e.,
        quality, or any of the other categories.
      </p>
      <p>2304. <span style="font-weight: bold">The reason why</span> (983).</p>
      <p>
        Fifth, he points out why motion is placed in the class of the
        indefinite. The reason for this, he says, is that motion can be placed
        neither in the class of the potential nor in that of the actual; for if
        it were placed in the class of the potential, it would follow that
        whatever is in potentiality to something, for example, to have some
        quantity, would be moved to that quantity. But this is not necessary,
        because, before a thing begins to be moved to some quantity, it is in
        potentiality to that quantity. Moreover, it is not being moved when it
        already actually has that quantity to which it was in potentiality, but
        the motion has then already been terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        2305. But motion must be a kind of actuality, as has been proved above
        (975:C 2294), although it is an imperfect one. The reason for this is
        that the thing of which it is the actuality is imperfect, and this is a
        possible or potential being; for if it were a perfect actuality, the
        whole potentiality for some definite actuality which is in the matter
        would be eliminated. Hence perfect actualities are not actualities of
        something in potentiality but of something in actuality. But motion
        belongs to something that is in potentiality, because it does not
        eliminate the potentiality of that thing. For so long as there is
        motion, the potentiality for that to which it tends by its motion
        remains in the thing moved. But only the previous potentiality for being
        moved is eliminated, though not completely; for what is being moved is
        still in potentiality to motion, because everything which is being moved
        will be moved, because of the division of continuous motion, as is
        proved in Book VI of the <i>Physics</i>. It follows, then, that motion
        is the actuality of what is potential; and thus it is an imperfect
        actuality and the actuality of something imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        2306. It is because of this that it is difficult to grasp what motion
        is; for it seems necessary to place motion either in the class of
        privation, as is evident from the definitions given above, or in the
        class of potentiality, or in that of simple and complete actuality—none
        of which may be moved. It follows, then, that motion is as we have
        described it to be, namely, an actuality, and that it is not called a
        perfect actuality. This is difficult to grasp, although it can
        nevertheless be true, because when this is admitted nothing untenable
        follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        2307. Some have defined motion by saying that it is the gradual passage
        from potentiality to actuality. But they erred, because motion must be
        given in the definition of a passage, since it is a kind of motion.
        Similarly, time is placed in the definition of the gradual, and motion
        in the definition of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        2308. <span style="font-weight: bold">That motion belongs</span> (984).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he explains what the subject of motion is. First, he shows that it
        is the thing moved; because every actuality is found in the thing whose
        actuality it is. But motion is the actuality of the movable by what is
        capable of causing motion. Hence it follows that motion is found in the
        movable or thing moved; and that it is the actualization of this is
        clear from the above discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2309. <span style="font-weight: bold">And the actuality</span> (985).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows how motion is related to a mover; and he gives two
        points, namely, that motion is the actuality of what is capable of
        causing motion, and that the actuality of the thing capable of causing
        motion and that of the thing moved do not differ; for motion must be the
        actuality of both.
      </p>
      <p>
        2310.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And a thing is capable</span> (986).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he proves the first of these two points, namely, that motion is
        the actuality of what is capable of causing motion. For the actuality of
        a thing is that by which it becomes actual. But a thing is said to be
        capable of causing motion because of its power of moving, and it is said
        to be a mover because of its activity, i.e., because it is actual.
        Hence, since a thing is said to be a mover because of motion, motion
        will be the actuality of what is capable of causing motion.
      </p>
      <p>2311. <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is</span> (987).</p>
      <p>
        Fourth, he proves the second of these points, namely, that the actuality
        of what is capable of causing motion and the actuality of what is
        capable of being moved are one and the same motion. He does this as
        follows: it has been stated that motion is the actuality of what is
        capable of causing motion inasmuch as it causes motion; and a thing is
        said to be movable inasmuch as motion is caused in it; but the thing
        capable of causing motion causes that motion which is found in the thing
        moved and not a different one. This is what he means when he says that
        it is on what is movable that the mover is capable of acting. It
        follows, then, that the actuality of the mover and that of the thing
        moved are one and the same motion.
      </p>
      <p>2312. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is one</span> (988).</p>
      <p>
        Fifth, he clarifies this by an example. He says that the distance from
        one to two and from two to one are the same, although they differ
        conceptually; and for this reason the distance is signified differently,
        namely, by the terms double and half. Similarly, the path of an ascent
        and that of a descent are one, but they differ conceptually; and for
        this reason some are called ascenders and others descenders. The same
        applies to a mover and to the thing moved; for the actuality of both is
        essentially one motion, although they differ conceptually. For the
        actuality of a mover functions as that from which motion comes, whereas
        the actuality of the thing moved functions as that in which motion
        occurs. And the actuality of the thing moved is not that from which
        motion comes, nor is the actuality of the mover that in which motion
        occurs. Hence the actuality of the thing causing motion is called
        action, and that of the thing moved is called undergoing or suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
        2313. But if action and undergoing are essentially the same thing, it
        seems that they should not be different categories. However, it should
        be borne in mind that the categories are distinguished on the basis of a
        different way of predicating; and thus inasmuch as the same term is
        differently predicated of different things, it belongs to different
        categories; for inasmuch as place is predicated of a thing that locates,
        it belongs to the genus of quantity, but inasmuch as it is predicated
        denominatively of the located thing it constitutes the category where.
        Similarly, inasmuch as motion is predicated of the subject in which it
        is found, it constitutes the category of undergoing; but inasmuch as it
        is predicated of that from which it comes, it constitutes the category
        of action.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        989. The infinite is either what cannot be spanned because it is not
        naturally fitted to be spanned (just as the spoken word is invisible);
        or what is imperfectly spanned; or what is spanned with difficulty; or
        what is not actually spanned, although it admits of being spanned or of
        having a terminus.
      </p>
      <p>
        990. Further, a thing may be infinite either by addition or by
        subtraction or by both.
      </p>
      <p>
        991. That the infinite should be a separate entity and be perceptible is
        impossible. For if it is neither a continuous quantity nor a plurality,
        and is a substance and not an accident, it will be indivisible; for what
        is divisible is either a continuous quantity or a plurality. But if it
        is indivisible, it is not infinite, except in the sense in which the
        spoken word is invisible. But people do not use the term in this sense,
        nor is this the sense of the infinite which we are investigating, but
        the infinite in the sense of what cannot be spanned.
      </p>
      <p>
        992. Further, how can the infinite exist of itself if number and
        continuous quantity, of which the infinite is an attribute, do not exist
        of themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
        993. Again, if the infinite is an accident, it cannot, inasmuch as it is
        infinite, be an element of existing things, just as the invisible is not
        an element of speech although the spoken word is invisible.’ It is also
        evident that the infinite cannot be actual; for any part of it which
        might be taken would be infinite, since infinity and the infinite are
        the same if the infinite is a substance and is not predicated of a
        subject. Hence it is either indivisible, or if it is divisible, the
        parts into which it is divided are infinite in number. But it is
        impossible that the same thing should be many infinites; for, just as a
        part of air is air, so too a part of the infinite must be infinite if
        the infinite is a substance and principle. Therefore it cannot be
        divided into parts, and so is indivisible. But this cannot apply to the
        actually infinite, for it must be a quantity. Hence it is an accidental
        attribute. But if this is so, then, as we have said, it cannot be it
        that is a principle, but that of which it is an accident, for example,
        air or the even This investigation, then, is universal.
      </p>
      <p>
        994. That the infinite does not exist in sensible things is made clear
        as follows: if it is the nature of a body to be bounded by surfaces,
        then no body, whether it is perceptible or intelligible, can be
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        995. Nor can there be any separate and infinite number; for a number or
        that which has a number is numerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        996. This is evident from the following argument drawn from nature: the
        infinite can be neither composite nor simple. It cannot be a composite
        body if the elements are limited in number; for the contraries must be
        equal, and no one of them must be infinite; for if the active power of
        one of two elemental bodies is inferior to that of the other, the finite
        body will be destroyed by the infinite body. And that each should be
        infinite is impossible, because a body is what is extended in all
        directions, and the infinite is what is extended without limit; so if
        the infinite is a body, it must be infinite in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        997. Nor can the infinite be a single simple body: neither, as some say,
        something apart from the elements, from which they generate these (for
        there is no such body apart from the elements, because everything can be
        dissolved into that of which it is composed; but there does not appear
        to be anything apart from the simple bodies), nor fire, nor any of the
        other elements. For unless some of them are infinite, the whole, even
        though it is finite, could not be or become any one of them, as
        Heraclitus says that all things at one time become fire. The same
        reasoning also applies to “the one,” which the philosophers of nature
        posited as an entity over and above the elements (997). For everything
        is changed from a contrary, for example, from hot to cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        998. Again, a sensible body is somewhere, and the place of the whole and
        that of a part (of the earth, for example) is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        999. Hence, if the infinite is composed of like parts, it will be
        immovable or will always be undergoing motion. But this is impossible.
        For why should it be moved upwards rather than downwards or in some
        other direction? For example, if it were a clod of earth, where would it
        move to or where remain at rest? For the place of the body naturally
        fitted to this will be infinite. Will it then occupy the whole place?
        And how will it do this? And what then will be its place of rest and of
        motion? For if it rests everywhere, it will not be in motion. And if it
        is moved everywhere, it will not be at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        1000. And if the whole is composed throughout of unlike parts, their
        places will also be unlike. And, first, the body of the whole will be
        one only by contact; and, second, the parts will be either finite or
        infinite in species. But they cannot be finite, for some would then be
        infinite and some not (if the whole is infinite), for example, fire or
        water. But such an infinite element would necessitate the destruction of
        contrary elements (996). But if the parts are infinite and simple, their
        places will be infinite, and the elements will be infinite in number.
        And since this is impossible, their places will be finite and the whole
        finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1001. And in general there cannot be an infinite body and a place for
        bodies if every sensible body has either heaviness or lightness; for it
        will tend either to the center or upwards. But the infinite-either the
        whole or a half of it-is incapable of any of these motions. For how can
        you divide it? Or how can one part tend upwards and another downwards,
        or one part tend to the extreme and another to the center?
      </p>
      <p>
        1002. Further, every sensible body is in a place, and there are six
        kinds of place, but these cannot pertain to an infinite body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1003. And in general if a place cannot be infinite, neither can a body
        be infinite; for to be in a place is to be somewhere, and this means to
        be either down or up or in some one of the other places, and each of
        these is a limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        1004. And the infinite is not the same in the case of continuous
        quantity, of motion, and of time, as though it were a single reality;
        but the secondary member is said to be infinite inasmuch as the primary
        one is; for example, motion is said to be infinite in reference to the
        continuous quantity in which it is moved or altered or increased, and
        time is said to be such in reference to motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2314. Having given his views about motion, here the Philosopher deals
        with the infinite, which is an attribute of motion and of any quantity
        in general. In regard to this he does three things. First (989:C 2314),
        he distinguishes the various senses in which the term infinite is used.
        Second (991:C 2322), he shows that the actually infinite does not exist
        (“That the infinite”). Third (1004:C 2354), he explains how the infinite
        is found in different things (“And the infinite”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains the
        different senses in which the term infinite is used; and second (990:C
        2319), the various senses in which things are said to be potentially
        infinite (“Further, a thing”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (989) part it should be borne in mind that every
        finite thing may be spanned by division. Hence the infinite, properly
        speaking, is what cannot be spanned by measurement; and therefore the
        term infinite is used in the same number of senses as the term
        untraversable.
      </p>
      <p>
        2315. Now each of these is used in four ways. First, the infinite or
        untraversable means what cannot be spanned by measurement because it
        does not belong to the class of things which are naturally fitted to be
        spanned; for example, we say that the point or the unit or something
        which is not a quantity and is not measurable is infinite or
        untraversable; and in this sense the spoken word is said to be invisible
        because it does not belong to the class of things which are visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        2316. Second, the infinite or untraversable means what has not yet been
        spanned although it has begun to be spanned. This is his meaning in
        saying “what is imperfectly spanned.”
      </p>
      <p>
        2317. Third, the infinite or untraversable means what is spanned with
        difficulty. Thus we may say that the depth of the sea or the height of
        the sky is infinite, or that any long distance is immeasurable or
        untraversable or infinite, because it surpasses our powers of
        measurement although in itself it is capable of being spanned.
      </p>
      <p>
        2318. Fourth, the infinite or untraversable means what belongs to the
        class of things which are naturally fitted to be spanned, or to have
        some limit set to them, but are not actually spanned; for example, if a
        line is limitless. This sense of the infinite is the true and proper
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        2319. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, a thing</span> (990).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he explains the various senses in which things are said to be
        potentially infinite. He says that in one sense a thing is said to be
        infinite by addition, as a number; for it is always possible to add a
        unit to any number, and in this respect number is capable of infinite
        increase.
      </p>
      <p>
        2320. In another sense a thing is said to be infinite by subtraction or
        division inasmuch as a continuous quantity is said to be infinitely
        divisible.
      </p>
      <p>
        2321. In a third sense it is possible for a thing to be infinite from
        both points of view; for example, time is said to be infinite both as
        regards division, because it is continuous, and as regards addition,
        because it is a number. It is in a similar way that the infinite is
        found in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2322. <span style="font-weight: bold">That the infinite</span> (991).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that the actually infinite does not exist; and in regard
        to this it should be noted that the Platonists held that the infinite is
        separate from sensible things and is a principle of them, whereas the
        philosophers of nature held that the infinite exists in sensible things,
        not in the sense that it is a substance, but rather in the sense that it
        is an accident of some sensible body. He therefore shows, first (991:C
        2322), that the infinite is not a separate entity; and second (994:C
        2327), that the actually infinite does not exist in sensible things
        (“That the infinite does not”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In treating the first member of this division he gives three arguments.
        The first is as follows: if the infinite is a substance which exists of
        itself and is not an accident of some subject, the infinite must lack
        continuous quantity and plurality, because continuous quantity and
        number constitute the subject of the infinite. But if it lacks
        continuous quantity and plurality, it must be indivisible, because
        everything divisible is either a continuous quantity or a plurality. But
        if it is indivisible, it is infinite only in the first sense of the
        term, as a spoken word is said to be invisible. However, we are not
        investigating this sense of the term here, nor did they use the term in
        this sense; but we are considering the fourth sense, i.e., what is
        untraversable. Therefore, all things considered, if the infinite were an
        independently existing substance, it would not be truly infinite. This
        position destroys itself in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        2323. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, how can</span> (992).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs thus: infinity is an
        attribute of number and of continuous quantity. But number and
        continuous quantity are not things which have separate existence, as has
        been shown in Book I (122:C 239) and will be shown below (993:C 2324).
        Therefore much less is the infinite a separate substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        2324.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if the infinite</span> (993).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which runs as follows. Let us suppose
        that the infinite is either a substance which is separate from sensible
        things or an accident belonging to some separate subject, for example,
        to continuous quantity or to number-which are separate according to the
        Platonists. Now if the infinite is assumed to be an accident, it cannot
        be the infinite as infinite that is a principle of existing things, but
        rather the subject of the infinite; just as what is invisible is not
        said to be a principle of speech, but the spoken word, although the
        spoken word is invisible in this sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        2325. And if the infinite is assumed to be a substance and is not
        predicated of a subject, it is also evident that it cannot be actually
        infinite; for it is either divisible or indivisible. But if the infinite
        itself as infinite is a substance and is divisible, any part of it which
        might be taken would necessarily be infinite; because infinity and the
        infinite are the same “if the infinite is a substance,” i.e., if
        infinity expresses the proper intelligible structure of the infinite.
        Hence, just as a part of water is water and a part of air is air, so too
        any part of the infinite is infinite if the infinite is a divisible
        substance. We must say, then, that the infinite is either indivisible or
        divisible into many infinites. But many infinite things cannot possibly
        constitute one finite thing; for the infinite is not greater than the
        infinite, but every whole is greater than any of its parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        2326. It follows, then, that the infinite is indivisible. But that any
        indivisible thing should be actually infinite is impossible, because the
        infinite must be a quantity. Therefore it remains that it is not a
        substance but an accident. But if the infinite is an accident, it is not
        the infinite that is a principle, but the subject of which it is an
        accident (as was said above), whether it be air, as some of the natural
        philosophers claimed, or the even, as the Pythagoreans claimed. Thus it
        follows that the infinite cannot be both a substance and a principle of
        beings at the same time. Last, he concludes that this investigation is a
        general one which goes beyond the study of natural things.
      </p>
      <p>
        2327.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">That the infinite does not exist</span>
        (994).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he proves that the actually infinite does not exist in sensible
        things. First (994:C 2327), he proves this by probable arguments; and
        second (996:C 2330), by arguments drawn from nature (“This is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (994), that it is obvious that the actually
        infinite is not found in sensible things; and he proves two points.
        First, he says that there is no infinite body in the sensible world, for
        it is the nature of a body to be bounded by surfaces. But no body with a
        definite surface is infinite. Therefore no body is infinite, “whether it
        be perceptible,” i.e., a natural body, “or intelligible,” i.e., a
        mathematical one.
      </p>
      <p>
        2328. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor can there be</span> (995).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows in the following way that there is no infinite number
        in sensible things. Every number and everything which has a number is
        numerable. But nothing numerable is infinite, because what is numerable
        can be spanned by numeration. Therefore no number is infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        2329. Now these arguments do not pertain to natural philosophy, because
        they are not based on the principles of a natural body but on certain
        principles which are common and probable and not necessary. For anyone
        who would claim that a body is infinite would not maintain that its
        surface has limits, for this characteristic belongs to the nature of a
        finite body. And anyone who would claim that there is an infinite
        multitude would not hold that it is a number, because number is
        multitude measured by one, as has been explained in Book X (875-C 2090).
        But nothing measured is infinite.
      </p>
      <p>2330. <span style="font-weight: bold">This is evident</span> (996).</p>
      <p>
        Next, he proves that the actually infinite does not exist within
        sensible things, by using arguments drawn from nature. He does this,
        first (996:C 2330), with reference to the active and passive powers of
        bodies; and second (998:C 2339), with reference to place and the thing
        in place (“Again, a sensible body”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now active and passive powers, Place and thing in place are proper to
        natural bodies as such; and therefore he says that these arguments are
        drawn from nature. He accordingly says, first (996), that, if a body is
        perceptible and infinite, it wilt be either a simple body or a composite
        body or compound.
      </p>
      <p>
        2331. First, he shows that a composite body cannot be infinite, if we
        assume that simple bodies, which are the elements of composite bodies,
        are finite in number. He proves this as follows: either all the elements
        must be infinite in quantity, or one must be infinite and the others
        finite, otherwise an infinite body could not be composed of elements
        which are finite in number.
      </p>
      <p>
        2332. But that one of the elements should be infinite and the rest
        finite is impossible; because in the case of a compound contraries must
        somehow be equalized in order that the compound may be preserved in
        being, for otherwise that contrary which exceeds the others will destroy
        them. But if one contrary is infinite and the rest finite, no equality
        will be established, since there is no proportion between the infinite
        and the finite. A compound, then, could not exist, for the infinite
        element would destroy the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        2333. And since someone might say that a body which is finite in
        quantity has greater power, and that equality is achieved in this way
        (for example, if someone were to say that in a cornpound air is infinite
        and fire finite), he therefore adds that, even if we suppose that the
        active power of one body which is assumed to be infinite falls short of
        the active power of any one of the others, because these are assumed to
        be finite, the finite element will be destroyed by the infinite one; for
        a finite body must have a finite power, and then finite fire will have a
        finite power. Hence, if from infinite air a portion of air equal to the
        fire is taken out, its power will be less than that of the whole
        infinite air, but proportioned to the power of fire. Let us suppose,
        then, that the power of fire is a hundred times greater than that of
        air. Hence, if we take away a hundredfold of air from infinite air it
        will be equal to fire in power; and thus the whole infinite air will
        have a greater infinite power than fire and will destroy it. It is
        impossible, then, that one element of a compound should be infinite and
        the rest finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        2334. Similarly, it is impossible that all should be infinite, because a
        body is what is extended in every dimension. But the infinite is what is
        infinite in dimension. Hence an infinite body must have an infinite
        dimension in every direction. But two bodies cannot be in the same
        place. Therefore two infinite bodies cannot be combined into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        2335. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor can the infinite</span> (997).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves that the infinite cannot be a simple body. There
        cannot be a simple body apart from the elements, from which all of them
        are generated, as some claimed air to be, because each thing is
        dissolved into the elements of which it is composed. But we see that
        compounds are dissolved only into the four elements; and therefore there
        cannot be a simple body apart from the four elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        2336. Nor can fire or any of the other elements be infinite, because no
        element could possibly exist except the one which is infinite, since it
        would fill every place. Again, if there were some finite element it
        would have to be changed into that infinite element because of the very
        great power of the latter; just as Heraclitus claimed that at some time
        all things must be changed into the element fire because of its very
        great power.
      </p>
      <p>
        2337. And the same argument therefore applies to the one simple body
        which the natural philosophers posited as an entity over and above the
        elements themselves; for it would have to be opposed to the other
        elements as a kind of contrary, since according to them there is change
        from that one body alone into the others. But every change in things is
        from one contrary to another. Therefore, since one of two contraries
        destroys the other, it follows that, if that body which is supposed to
        exist apart from the elements is infinite, it will destroy the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        2338. The philosopher omits the celestial body here, because, while it
        is something apart from the four elements, it is not contrary or
        repugnant to them in any way, nor are these bodies naturally derived
        from it. For the philosophers of nature who posited an actually infinite
        body did not attain any knowledge of this fifth essence or nature. Yet
        in <i>The Heavens</i> Aristotle proves that even a celestial body, which
        moves circularly, is not actually infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        2339.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, a sensible body</span> (998).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he proves that a sensible body is not infinite; and he does this by
        means of arguments based upon place and a thing in place. He gives three
        arguments. As a sort of preamble to the first he considers two points
        necessary for its development. The first is that every sensible body is
        in a place. He emphasizes <i>sensible</i> in order to distinguish this
        kind of body from a mathematical one, to which place and contact are
        attributed only figuratively.
      </p>
      <p>
        2340. The second point is that the natural place of a whole and that of
        a part are the same, i.e., the place in which it naturally rests and to
        which it is naturally moved. This is clear, for instance, in the case of
        earth and of any part of it, for the natural place of each is down.
      </p>
      <p>
        2341.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence, if the infinite</span> (999).
      </p>
      <p>
        After giving these two points he states his argument, which runs as
        follows. If a sensible body is assumed to be infinite, either its parts
        will all be specifically the same, as is the case with bodies having
        like parts, such as air, earth, blood, and so on, or they will be
        specifically different.
      </p>
      <p>
        2342. But if all of its parts are specifically the same, it will follow
        that the whole will always be at rest or always in motion. Each one of
        these is impossible and incompatible with the facts of sensory
        perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        2343.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For why should it</span> (<i>ibid.</i>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that the other alternative has to be accepted; for it has
        already been assumed that the natural place of a whole and that of a
        part are the same. And it is evident that every body is at rest when it
        is in its natural place, and that it naturally moves to its natural
        place when it is outside of it. If, then, the whole place occupied by a
        body having an infinite number of like parts is natural to it, this
        place must be natural to each part, and thus the whole and each of its
        parts will be at rest. But if it is not natural to it, the whole and
        each of its parts will then be outside their proper place; and thus the
        whole and any part of it will always be in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2344. For it cannot be said that some part of a place is natural to the
        whole and to its parts, and that some part of a place is not; because,
        if a body were infinite and every body were in a place, its place would
        also have to be infinite. But in infinite place there is no dividedness
        by reason of which one part of it is the natural place of the body and
        another is not, because there must be some fixed proportion and distance
        between a place which is natural and one which is not, and this cannot
        apply to an infinite place. This is what he means when he says that an
        infinite body or one of its parts will not be moved downwards rather
        than upwards or in some other direction, because in an infinite place it
        is impossible to find any fixed proportion between these parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        2345. He gives an example of this. If we assume that the earth is
        infinite, it will be impossible to give any reason why it should be in
        motion or at rest in one place rather than in another, because the whole
        infinite place will be equally fitted by nature to the infinite body
        which occupies this place. Hence, if some part of a place is naturally
        fitted to a clod of earth, the same will apply to another part; and if
        one part is not naturally fitted to a Place, neither will another be.
        If, then, an infinite body is in a place, it will fill the whole of that
        infinite place. Yet how can it be at rest and in motion at the same
        time? For if it rests everywhere, it will not be in motion; or if it is
        in motion everywhere, it follows that no part of it will be at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        2346. <span style="font-weight: bold">And if the whole</span> (1000).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the Philosopher examines the other alternative, namely, the
        supposition that the whole is not composed of like parts. He says that
        it follows, first, that, if “the body of the whole,” i.e., of the
        universe, is composed of specifically unlike parts, it will be one only
        by contact, as a pile of stones is one. But things specifically
        different, such as fire, air and water, cannot be continuous; and this
        is not to be one in an absolute sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        2347. Again, if this whole is composed of parts which are specifically
        unlike, they will be either infinite in species, i.e., so that the
        different parts of the whole are infinite in species; or they will be
        finite in species, i.e., so that the diversity of species found among
        the parts amount to some fixed number.
      </p>
      <p>
        2348. But that the elements cannot be finite in species is clear from
        what was proposed in the preceding argument; for it would be impossible
        for an infinite whole to be composed of parts which are finite in
        number, unless either all parts were infinite in quantity, which is
        impossible, since an infinite body must be infinite in any of its parts,
        or at least unless some part or parts were infinite. Therefore, if a
        whole were infinite and its parts were different species infinite in
        number, it would follow that some of them would be infinite and some
        finite in quantity—for example, if one were to assume that water is
        infinite and fire finite. But this position introduces corruption among
        contraries, because an infinite contrary would destroy other contraries,
        as has been shown above (996:C 2332). Therefore they cannot be finite in
        number.
      </p>
      <p>
        2349. But if the parts of the universe were infinite in species, and
        these must be assumed to be simple, it would follow that places would be
        infinite and that the elements would be infinite. But both of these are
        impossible; for since each simple body has a place naturally fitted to
        it which is specifically different from the place of another body, if
        there were an infinite number of simple bodies which are different in
        species, it would also follow that there are an infinite number of
        places which are different in species. This is obviously false; for the
        species of places are limited in number, and these are up and down, and
        so on. It is also impossible that the elements should be infinite in
        number, because it would then follow that they would remain unknown; and
        if they were unknown, all things would be unknown. Therefore, if the
        elements cannot be infinite, places must be finite, and consequently the
        whole must be finite.
      </p>
      <p>2350. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (1001).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument. He says that, since every sensible
        body has a place, it is impossible for any sensible body to be infinite,
        granted the assumption that every sensible body has heaviness and
        lightness-which would be true according to the opinion of the ancient
        natural philosophers, who claimed that bodies are actually infinite.
        Aristotle, however, is of the opinion that there is a sensible body
        which does not have heaviness or lightness, namely, a celestial body, as
        he proved in <i>The Heavens</i>. He introduces this circumstantially, as
        admitted by his opponents, but not in the sense that it is unqualifiedly
        true. If every sensible body, then, is either heavy or light and some
        sensible body is infinite, it must be heavy or light; and therefore it
        must be moved upwards or towards the center; for a light thing is
        defined as one that rises upwards, and a heavy thing as one that tends
        towards the center. But this cannot apply to the infinite, either to the
        whole of it or to a part; for the center of a body is found only when a
        proportion is established between the boundaries by dividing the whole.
        But the infinite cannot be divided according to any proportion; and
        therefore neither up and down nor boundary and center can be found
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        2351. This argument must be understood to apply even if one assumes that
        there is a third kind of body which is neither heavy nor light; for such
        a body is naturally moved around the center, and this could not be the
        case with an infinite body.
      </p>
      <p>
        2352.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, every sensible body</span>
        (1002).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Philosopher now gives the third argument, which runs thus: every
        sensible body is in a place. But there are six kinds of place: up and
        down, right and left, before and behind; and it is impossible to
        attribute these to an infinite body, since they are the limits of
        distances. Thus it. is impossible that a place should be attributed to
        an infinite body; and therefore no sensible body is infinite. However,
        in saying that there are six kinds of place he does not mean that these
        places are distinguished because of the elements (for their motions are
        distinguished merely in terms of up and down) but only because, just as
        up and down are out of the question so far as an infinite body is
        concerned, so are all the other differences of place.
      </p>
      <p>
        2353. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general if</span> (1003).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the fourth argument, which is as follows. Every sensible body
        is in a place; but it is impossible for a place to be infinite; and
        therefore it is impossible for a body to be infinite. The way in which
        it is impossible for a place to be infinite he proves thus: whatever has
        a common term predicated of it must also have predicated of it any of
        the things which fall under that common term; for example, whatever is
        an animal must belong to some particular species of animal, and whatever
        is man must be some particular man. Similarly, whatever occupies an
        infinite place must be “somewhere,” i.e., it must occupy some place. But
        to occupy some place is to be up or down or to be in some one of the
        other kinds of place. However, none of these can be infinite because
        each is the limit of some distance. It is impossible, then, that a place
        should be infinite, and the same applies to a body.
      </p>
      <p>
        2354. <span style="font-weight: bold">And the infinite</span> (1004).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how the potentially infinite is found in different things.
        He says that it is found in continuous quantity, in motion, and in time,
        and it is not predicated of them univocally but in a primary and a
        secondary way. And the secondary member among them is always said to be
        infinite inasmuch as the primary member is; for example, motion is said
        to be infinite in reference to the continuous quantity in which
        something is moved locally or increased or altered; and time is said to
        be infinite in reference to motion. This must be understood as follows:
        infinite divisibility is attributed to what is continuous, and this is
        done first with reference to continuous quantity, from which motion
        derives its continuity. This is evident in the case of local motion
        because the parts of local motion are considered in relation to the
        parts of continuous quantity. The same thing is evident in the case of
        the motion of increase, because increase is noted in terms of the
        addition of continuous quantity. However, this is not as evident in the
        case of alteration, although in a sense it also applies there; because
        quality, which is the realm of alteration, is divided accidentally upon
        the division of continuous quantity. Again, the intensification and
        abatement of a quality is also noted inasmuch as its subject, which has
        continuous quantity, participates in some quality to a greater or lesser
        degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        And motion is referred to continuity, and so is a continuous time; for
        since time in itself is a number, it is continuous only in a subject,
        just as ten measures of cloth are continuous because the cloth is
        continuous. The term infinite, then, must be used of these three things
        in the same order of priority as the term continuous is.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        1005. Everything which is changed is changed either accidentally, as
        when we say that a musician walks; or it is changed without
        qualification because something belonging to it is changed, as what is
        changed in some of its parts; for example, the body is said to be healed
        because the eye is. And there is some primary thing which is moved of
        itself, and this is what is essentially movable.
      </p>
      <p>
        1006. The same division applies to a mover, for it causes motion either
        accidentally or in some part of itself or essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        1007. And there is a primary mover and something which is moved. And
        there is also a time in which it is moved, and something from which it
        is moved, and something to which it is moved. But the forms and
        modifications and place to which things in motion are moved are
        immovable, as science and heat. Heat is not motion, but heating is.
      </p>
      <p>
        1008. Now change which is not accidental is not found in all things, but
        between contraries and between their intermediates and between
        contradictories. We may be convinced of this by induction. Whatever is
        changed is changed either from a subject to a subject, or from a
        non-subject to a non-subject, or from a subject to a non-subject, or
        from a non-subject to a subject. And by subject I mean what is expressed
        by an affirmative term. Hence there must be three changes; for to go
        from a non-subject to a non-subject is not change, because, since the
        limits are neither contraries nor contradictories, there is no
        opposition (1008).
      </p>
      <p>
        1009. The change from a non-subject to a subject which is its
        contradictory is generation; and if it is unqualified, it is generation
        in an unqualified sense, and if in a part, partial generation; and the
        change from a subject to a non-subject is destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        1010. If non-being has several different meanings, then neither that
        which involves a combination or separation of terms, nor that which
        refers to potentiality and is opposed to being in an unqualified sense,
        is capable of being moved (for what is not-white or not-good can be
        moved only accidentally, since what is not-white may be a man). But
        non-being in an unqualified sense cannot be moved in any way, because it
        is impossible for non-being to be moved. And if this is so, generation
        cannot be motion, because non-being is generated. For even if it is most
        certainly generated accidentally, it will still be true to say that what
        is generated in an unqualified sense is non-being. The same argument
        applies to rest. These are the difficulties, then, which result from
        this view. And if everything moved is in a place, though non-being is
        not in a place, it would have to be somewhere. Nor is destruction
        motion; for the contrary of motion is motion or rest, but the contrary
        of destruction is generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1011. And since every motion is a kind of change, and the three changes
        are those described (1008), and of these those which refer to generation
        and destruction are not motions, and these are changes between
        contradictories, only change from a subject to a subject must be motion.
        And the subjects are either contraries or their intermediates—for
        privation is given as a contrary—and they are expressed by an
        affirmative term, for example, naked or toothless or black.

      <p>
        2355. Having explained what motion is, and having dealt with the
        infinite, which is a certain attribute of motion, here the Philosopher
        establishes the truth about the parts of motion. This is divided into
        two parts. In the first (1005:C 2355) he distinguishes the parts of
        motion; and in the second (1021:C:2404) he explains the connection
        between motion and its parts (“Things which are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into three members, corresponding to the three
        divisions which he makes in motion, although one of these is included
        under the other as a subdivision of the preceding division.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he divides motion with
        regard to the thing moved; and second (ioo6:C 2358), with regard to a
        mover (“The same division”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (1005), that a thing may be changed in three
        ways. In one way a thing may be changed only accidentally, as when
        something is said to be changed because the thing to which it belongs is
        changed, whether it belongs to it as an accident to a subject, as when
        we say that a musician walks, or as a substantial form to matter, as the
        soul belongs to the body which is moved; or as a part is said to be
        moved when the whole is moved, or also as something contained is moved
        when its container is moved, as a sailor is said to be in motion when
        his ship is in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2356. In a second way a thing is said to be changed without
        qualification because some part of it is changed, as those things which
        are moved in some part; for example, the body of a man is said to be
        healed because the eye is; and this is to be moved essentially but not
        in the first instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        2357. In a third way a thing is said to be moved primarily and of
        itself; as when some whole is moved in its totality, for example, when a
        stone is moved downwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        2358. <span style="font-weight: bold">The same division</span> (1006).
      </p>
      <p>
        He then gives the same division with regard to a mover; for a thing is
        said to be a mover in three ways. First, a thing is said to cause motion
        accidentally; as when a musician builds.
      </p>
      <p>
        2359. Second, a thing is said to be a mover in regard to some one of its
        parts; as when a man strikes and injures someone with his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        2360. Third, a thing is said to be a mover essentially; as when fire
        heats and a physician heals.
      </p>
      <p>2361. And there is (1007).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives a second division of motion or change, and in regard to
        this he does three things. First (1007:C 2361), he prefaces his
        discussion with certain points which are necessary for an understanding
        of the division of motion. Second (1008:C 2363), he divides motion (“Now
        change”). Third (1009:C 2366), he explains the division of change (“The
        change”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that there are five things found in every change. First,
        there is a primary mover; second, something which is moved; third, a
        time during which the motion takes place, because every motion occurs in
        time; fourth, a starting point from which motion begins; and fifth, a
        terminus to which the motion proceeds. However, motion or change is not
        divided into species either on the basis of the mover or of the thing
        moved or of time, because these are common to every change; but it is
        divided on the basis of the starting point from which it begins and the
        terminus to which it proceeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        2362. He therefore explains the last two, saying that “the forms,” i.e.,
        specifying principles, “modifications,” i.e., qualities, and “place,”
        are limits of motion, because those things which are movable are moved
        with respect to these. He uses the term forms, because of generation;
        modifications, because of alterations; and place, because of local
        motion. He gives examples of modifications by using science and heat.
        And because it might seem to some that heat is the sam6 as alteration,
        and then it would follow that heat is motion and not a limit or terminus
        of motion, he therefore says that heat is not motion but heating is.
      </p>
      <p>2363. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now change</span> (1008).</p>
      <p>
        Then, passing over two parts of the first division, he takes the third,
        namely, change which is neither accidental nor in a part, and subdivides
        it according to its limits. He says that change which is not accidental
        is not found between just any limits whatever; but its limits must
        either be contraries, as change from white to black, or intermediates,
        as change from black to red and from red to gray; or there is change
        between contradictories, as from white to not-white, and vice versa. He
        says nothing of privative opposites because they are found between
        contradictories and contraries and are understood to come under these.
      </p>
      <p>
        2364. He shows by induction that change takes place only between the
        above-mentioned limits; for the limits of change admit of four possible
        combinations: first, when both limits are affirmative or positive terms,
        as when something is said to be changed from white to black, and this
        change he describes as one from subject to subject; second, when both
        limits are negative terms, as when something is said to be changed from
        not-white to not-black, or in his words, from non-subject to
        non-subject; third, when the starting point from which change begins is
        a positive term and the terminus to which it proceeds is a negative one,
        as when a thing is said to be changed from white to not-white, or as he
        says, from subject to non-subject; fourth, when the starting point of
        change is a negative term and the terminus to which it proceeds is a
        positive one, as when a thing is said to be changed from not-white to
        white, or as he says, from a non-subject to a subject. He explains the
        meaning of the term subject which he had used, as what is signified by
        an affirmative or positive term.
      </p>
      <p>
        2365. Now one of these four combinations is useless; for there is no
        change from a non-subject to a non-subject, because two negative terms,
        such as not-white and not-black, are neither contraries nor
        contradictories since they are not opposites; for they can be affirmed
        truly of the same subject because there are many things which are
        neither white nor black. Hence, since change is between opposites, as is
        proved in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>, it follows that there is no
        change from a non-subject to a non-subject. Therefore there must be
        three kinds of change, two of which relate to contradiction and the
        other to contrariety.
      </p>
      <p>2366. <span style="font-weight: bold">The change</span> (1009).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows what these three changes are; and in regard to this he
        does three things. First, he shows that generation and destruction are
        two of these. Second (1010:C 2368), he shows that neither of these is
        motion (“If non-being”). Third (1011:C 2375), he draws his conclusion as
        to which change is called motion (“And since every”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (1009), that of the three changes mentioned
        above, that which is from a non-subject to a subject, or between
        contradictory terms, is called generation. And this is twofold; for
        there is change either from non-being in an unqualified sense to being
        in an unqualified sense (generation in an unqualified sense), and this
        occurs when a movable subject is changed substantially; or there is
        change from non-being to being, not in an unqualified sense but in a
        qualified one, for example, change from not-white to white (generation
        in a qualified sense).
      </p>
      <p>
        2367. But that change which proceeds from a subject to a non-subject is
        called destruction; and in this change we also distinguish between
        destruction in an unqualified sense and in a qualified one, just as we
        did in the case of generation.
      </p>
      <p>2368. <span style="font-weight: bold">If non-being</span> (1010).</p>
      <p>
        Then the Philosopher shows that neither of these changes is motion.
        First (1010:C 2368), he shows that this is true of generation; and
        second (<i>ibid.</i>), that it is true of destruction (“Nor is
        destruction”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (1010), that the term <i>non-bring</i> is
        used in the same number of senses as <i>being</i> is. One meaning is the
        combination and separation found in a proposition; and since this does
        not exist in reality but only in the mind, it cannot be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        2369. Being and non-being are used in another sense with reference to
        actuality and potentiality. That which is actual is a being in an
        unqualified sense, but that which is potential only is a non-being. He
        therefore says that even that sort of non-being which is a being
        potentially but not actually cannot be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        2370. He explains why he had said that actual non-being is opposed to
        being in an unqualified sense, when he adds “for what is not-white.” For
        potential being, which is opposed to actual being and is not being in an
        unqualified sense, can be moved, because what is not not-white actually
        or not-good actually can be moved, but only accidentally. For what is
        moved is not the not-white itself, but the subject in which this
        privation is found, and this is an actual being. For that which is not
        white may be a man, but that which is an actual non-being in an
        unqualified sense, i.e., in substance, cannot be moved at all. Now if
        all of these statements are true, I say, it is impossible for non-being
        to be moved. And if this is the case, generation cannot be motion,
        because non-being is generated. For generation, as has been pointed out
        (1009:C 2366), proceeds from non-being to being. Hence, if generation in
        an unqualified sense were motion, it would follow that non-being in an
        unqualified sense would be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        2371. But one can raise an objection to this process of reasoning by
        saying that non-being is generated only accidentally; for “the subject
        of generation,” i.e., a being in potentiality, is generated essentially.
        But non-being signifies privation in a matter. Hence it is generated
        only accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        2372. <span style="font-weight: bold">For even if</span> (<i>ibid.</i>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he refutes this objection. He says that, even if a being is
        generated only accidentally, nevertheless it is true to say that what is
        generated in an unqualified sense is non-being. And of each of these it
        is true to say that it cannot be moved. Similarly it cannot be at rest,
        because non-being in an unqualified sense is neither in motion nor at
        rest. These are the untenable results if one maintains that generation
        is motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2373. In order to show that nonbeing is not moved, he adds that
        everything which is moved is in a place because local motion is the
        first of all motions, whereas non-being in an unqualified sense is not
        in a place; for [were it moved] it would then be somewhere. Hence it
        cannot be moved; and therefore generation is not motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2374.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor is destruction</span>
        (<i>ibid.</i>).
      </p>
      <p>
        From these considerations he further shows that destruction is not
        motion; for the only thing that is opposed to motion is motion or rest.
        But destruction is opposed to generation. Therefore, if destruction were
        motion, generation would have to be either motion or rest. But this
        cannot be true, as has been shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        2375.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And since every motion</span> (1011).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next he shows which change is said to be motion. He says that every
        motion is a kind of change. But there are only three changes, and two of
        these, which involve contradictories, i.e., generation and destruction,
        are not motion. It follows, then, that only change from a subject to a
        subject is motion. And since the subjects between which motion takes
        place must be opposed to each other, they must be contraries or
        intermediates; for even though a privation is expressed by an
        affirmative term, such as naked, toothless, and black, it is regarded as
        a contrary, because privation is the primary contrariety, as has been
        pointed out in Book X (852:C 2049). And he says that black is a
        privation not in an unqualified sense but inasmuch as it participates
        deficiently in the nature of its genus.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 12: 1068a 8-1068b 25
      </p>
      <p>
        1012. If the categories are divided into substance, quality, place,
        action, passion, relation and quantity, there must be three kinds of
        motion, namely, of quality, of quantity and of place.
      </p>
      <p>
        1013. There is no motion of substance, because substance has no
        contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        1014. Nor is there motion of relation; for it is possible that, when one
        of two relative things has undergone a change, the other may be truly
        referred to under a new term even though it has not been changed in any
        way. Hence the motion of these relative things will be accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        1015. Nor is there motion of agent or of patient as of mover and thing
        moved, because there is no motion of motion or generation of generation.
        There are two ways in which there might be motion of motion. First,
        motion might be of the subject moved, as a man is moved because he is
        changed from white to black. Thus motion might be heated or cooled or
        might change its place or might increase. But this is impossible, for
        change is not a subject. Or, second, some other subject might be changed
        from change to some other form of being, as a man might be changed from
        sickness to health. But this is possible only accidentally; for every
        motion is a change from one thing to something else. The same applies to
        generation and destruction; although the opposites involved in these
        changes are different from those of motion. Therefore a man changes at
        the same time from health to sickness, and from this change itself to
        another. And it is evident that, if a man has become ill, he will be
        changed into something else whatever it may be (for he can come to
        rest); and further this will always be to some opposite which is not
        contingent; and that change will be from something to something else.
        Hence, its opposite will be becoming healthy; but this will happen
        accidentally; for example, there is a change from recollection to
        forgetting, because the subject to which forgetting belongs is changed,
        sometimes to a state of knowledge and sometimes to one of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1016. Further, the process will go on to infinity if there is change of
        change and generation of generation. Therefore, if the latter comes to
        be, the former must also; for example, if generation in an unqualified
        sense at one time was coming to be, that which is coming to be something
        was also coming to be. Hence that which was coming to be in an
        unqualified sense did not yet exist, but there was something which was
        coming to be, or which has already come to be. Therefore, if this also
        at one time was coming to be, then at that time it was not coming to be
        something. However, since there is no first term in infinite things,
        neither will there be a subsequent one. Hence it is impossible for
        anything to come to be or be moved or be changed in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1017. Further, of the same thing of which there is contrary motion and
        rest there is also generation and destruction. Hence when that which is
        coming to be becomes that which is coming to be, it is then being
        destroyed; for it is not destroyed as soon as it is generated or
        afterwards; for that which is being destroyed must be.
      </p>
      <p>
        1018. Further, there must be some matter underlying the thing which is
        coming to be or being changed. What then will it be that becomes motion
        or generation in the same way that a body or a soul or something else of
        this kind is alterable? Further, what is the thing to which motion
        proceeds; for motion must be of this particular thing from this to that,
        and yet the latter should not be a motion at all. In what way then is
        this to take place? For there can be no learning of learning, and
        therefore no generation of generation (1008-9).
      </p>
      <p>
        1019. And since there is no motion of substance or of relation or of
        action or of passion, it follows that there is motion of quality, of
        quantity and of location; for each of these admits of contrariety. By
        quality I mean, not that which comes under the category of substance
        (for even difference is quality), but the passive power in virtue of
        which a thing is said to be acted upon or to be incapable of being acted
        upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        1020. The immovable is what is totally incapable of being moved, or what
        is moved with difficulty over a long period of time or begins to be
        moved slowly, or what is naturally fit to be moved but is not capable of
        being moved when it is so fit, and where, and in the way in which it
        would naturally be moved. And this is the only kind of immobility which
        I call rest; for rest is contrary to motion. Hence it will be the
        privation of what is receptive of motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2376. Having divided change into generation, destruction and motion,
        here he subdivides the other member of this division, Le, motion, on the
        basis of the categories in which it takes place. In regard to this he
        does two things. First (1012:C 2376), he indicates the categories in
        which motion can be found. Second (1020:C 2401), he explains the
        different senses in which the term immovable is used (“The immovable”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he sets forth his
        thesis. Second (1013:C 2378), he proves this (“There is no motion”).
        Third (1019:C 2399), he draws his main conclusion (“And since”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (1012), that, since the categories are
        divided into substance, quality and so on, and since there cannot be
        motion in the other categories, there are therefore three categories of
        being in which motion can be found; that is, quality, quantity and
        location, for which he substitutes the term place, because location
        merely signifies being in a place; and to be moved with respect to place
        is merely to be moved with respect to one’s location. For motion with
        respect to place is not attributed to a subject in which place inheres
        but to the thing in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        2377. Now it should be noted that he seems to omit three categories,
        namely, temporal situation (<i>quando</i>), posture and accoutrement;
        for since temporal situation signifies being in time, and time is the
        measure of motion, the reason why there is no motion in the category of
        temporal situation or in that of action and of passion, which signify
        motion itself under special aspects, is the same. And posture adds
        nothing to location except a definite arrangement of parts, which is
        nothing else than a definite relationship of parts to each other. And
        accoutrement implies the relation of one clothed to his clothing. Hence
        the reason why there does not seem to be motion with respect to posture
        and to accoutrement and to relation seems to be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        2378. <span style="font-weight: bold">There is no motion</span> (1013).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, he proves his thesis; and in regard to this he does three things.
        First (1013:C 2378) he shows that there is no motion with respect to
        substance; second 0014:C 2385), that there is no motion with respect to
        relation (“Nor is there motion”); and third (1015:C 2386), that there is
        no motion with respect to action and passion (“Nor is there motion of
        agent”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly proves, first (1013), that there cannot be motion with
        respect to substance because motion is a change from subject to subject.
        Therefore the two subjects between which there is motion are either
        contraries or intermediates. Hence, since nothing is contrary to
        substance, it follows that there cannot be motion with respect to
        substance, but only generation and destruction, whose limits are opposed
        to each other as contradictories and not as contraries, as has been
        stated above (1009:C 2366).
      </p>
      <p>
        2379. Now it seems that his statement that “substance has no contrary”
        is false, because fire clearly appears to be contrary to water, and
        because Aristotle had proved in Book I of <i>The Heavens</i> that the
        heavens are not destructible since they do not have a contrary, whereas
        other bodies, which are corruptible, have a contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
        2380. Hence some said that there is nothing contrary to the whole
        composite substance because the subject of contraries must be one; but
        nothing prevents a substantial form from having a contrary. For they
        said that heat is the substantial form of fire. But this cannot be true,
        because substantial forms are not perceptible of themselves. And again
        it is evident that in other bodies heat and cold are accidents. But what
        belongs to the category of substance cannot be an accident in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        2381. Others have said that heat and cold are not the substantial forms
        of fire and water, but that their substantial forms are contraries
        differing in degree, and are, so to speak, intermediate between
        substance and accidents. But this is wholly unreasonable; for, since
        form is the principle of a species, if the forms of fire and of water
        are not truly substantial, neither are fire and water true species in
        the category of substance. It is impossible, then, that there should be
        an intermediate between substance and accidents, because they belong to
        different categories, and between such things an intermediate does not
        fall, as has been shown above in Book X (881:C 2102); and also because
        the definitions of substance and accident have no intermediate. For a
        substance is a being of itself, whereas an accident is not a being of
        itself but has being in something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        2382. It is necessary then to say that substantial forms cannot be
        contraries, because contraries are extremes of a certain definite
        distance, and in a sense they are continuous, since motion is i one
        contrary to another. In those categories, then, in which no such
        continuous and definite distance is found, it is impossible to find a
        contrary, as is clear in the case of numbers. For the distance between
        one number and another does not mean continuity but the addition of
        units. Hence number is not contrary to number, nor similarly is figure
        contrary to figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        2383. The same thing applies to substances because the intelligible
        structure of each species consists in a definite unity. But since form
        is the basis of difference, if substantial forms are not contrary to
        each other, it follows that contrariety cannot be found between
        differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        2384. It is necessary to say, then, that a substantial form, considered
        in itself, constitutes a species in the category of substance; but
        according as one form implies the privation of another, different forms
        are the principles of contrary differences. For in one respect a
        privation is a contrary, and living and non-living, rational and
        irrational, and the like are opposed in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        2385.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor is there motion of relation</span>
        (1014).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, he shows that there is no motion in the proper sense in the
        category of relation except accidentally. For just as a thing is moved
        accidentally when motion takes place in it only as a result of something
        else being moved, in a similar way motion is said to be accidental to a
        thing when it takes place in it only because something else is moved.
        Now we find this in the category of relation; for unless something else
        is changed, it is not true to say that change occurs in relation; for
        example, the unequal comes from the equal only when there has been
        change in quantity. Similarly the like comes from the unlike only when
        there has been a change in quality. Thus we see that one of two relative
        things is said to be changed when change affects the other one of them;
        for example, a thing which is unmoved of itself changes from left to
        right when some other thing changes its place. Hence it follows that
        there is motion in the category of relation only accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        2386.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor is there motion of agent</span>
        (1015).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that motion does not occur with respect to either action
        or passion. He proves this by four arguments, of which the first is as
        follows: action and passion constitute motion and designate it. If,
        then, motion were to occur in action and in passion, it would follow
        that there would be motion of motion and generation of generation and
        change of change. But this is impossible. Therefore it is also
        impossible that there should be motion in action and in passion. That it
        is impossible for motion to be moved he proves thus: there are two ways
        in which there might be motion of motion: first, there might be motion
        of motion as of a subject which is moved, or, second, as of the limit of
        motion. And motion might be the subject of motion, as we say that there
        is motion of a man because a man is moved since he is changed from white
        to black. In a similar way motion would be moved, and would either be
        heated or cooled, or changed with respect to place, or increase. But
        this is impossible; because motion cannot be the subject of heat or of
        cold or of similar attributes. It follows, then, that there cannot be
        motion of motion if motion is regarded as a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        2387. But neither can there be motion of motion as of a limit, some
        other subject being changed from one species of change to another, as a
        man might be changed from sickness to health; for this is possible only
        accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        2388. Hence he shows next that it is impossible for motion to be moved
        essentially because every motion is a change from one thing to something
        else. Similarly generation and destruction are a change from one thing
        to something else, even though in their case the limits of change are
        not opposed to each other as they are in that of motion, as has been
        said above (1008:C 2363). If, then, there is change from one change to
        another, as from becoming sick to some other process of change, it will
        follow that, while a thing is being changed from health to sickness, it
        is being changed at the same time from that change to another; because,
        while one of the limits of a change is arising, a change from one limit
        to another occurs. Thus if two processes of change are the limits of one
        change, it follows that while the original change is occurring, a change
        into another takes place. And so at the same time that a thing is being
        moved from health to sickness it will be being changed from becoming
        healthy to some other change.
      </p>
      <p>
        2389. But this seems to be true only inasmuch as one change succeeds
        another. And it is possible that any other change may succeed this one
        by which something is being moved from health to sickness, for example,
        becoming white or becoming black or change of place or any other change.
        Hence it is evident that, if someone is becoming ill because he is being
        moved from health to sickness, he can be changed from this change to any
        other. Nor is this surprising, because he can even be changed from this
        change to a state of repose; for it is possible that someone might come
        to rest after this change.
      </p>
      <p>
        2390. But since every change is “always to an opposite which is not
        contingent,” i.e., an opposite which cannot be true at the same time as
        the opposed term, it follows that, if there is a change from change to
        change, it will always be to an opposite change, which he calls not
        contingent. And that change in which the transition takes place will
        have to be from one thing to something else. Hence the transition from a
        change of becoming ill will only be to the opposite change, which is
        called becoming healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        2391. And so two contrary positions seem to follow, namely, that an
        opposite change passes from one change to any other, and only to its
        opposite. And from this it further follows that, at the same time that
        something is being changed to one of its opposites, it is also being
        changed to a change as if it were another opposite. This seems to be
        impossible, for it would follow that nature inclines to opposite effects
        at the same time. Hence it cannot be that anything is changed
        essentially from one change to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        2392. But this can happen accidentally; for example, a person may change
        from recollection to forgetfulness because the subject is changed,
        sometimes in relation to one extreme and sometimes to the other-not that
        it may be the mover’s intention that at the same time that he is being
        changed to one extreme he is at the same time intending to move to the
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        2393.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, the process</span> (1016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs thus: if there is change
        of change, as limit of limit, or generation of generation, one change
        must be reached only by another change, as one quality is reached only
        by a preceding alteration; and thus it will be possible to reach that
        preceding change only by a prior change, and so on to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        2394. But this cannot be the case, because, if it is assumed that there
        are an infinite number of changes related in such a way that one leads
        to the other, the preceding must exist if the following does. Let us
        suppose that there is a particular instance of the generation of a
        generation in an unqualified sense, which is the generation of
        substance. Then, if the generation in an unqualified sense sometimes
        comes to be, and again if the coming to be of generation in an
        unqualified sense itself at one time came to be, it will follow that
        that which is coming to be in an unqualified sense did not yet exist,
        but there was generation in one respect, namely, the very generation of
        the process of generation. And if this generation also came to be at
        some time, since it is not possible to have either an infinite regress
        or any first term among infinite things, it is impossible ever to come
        to any first process of generation. But if the preceding member in a
        series does not exist, there will be no succeeding member, as has been
        pointed out above, and the consequence will be that “there will not be a
        subsequent one,” i.e., one which follows it. It follows, then, that
        nothing can come to be or be moved or be changed. But this is
        impossible. Hence change of change is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        2395.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, of the same thing</span> (1017)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the third argument, which is as follows. Contrary motions,
        and rest and motion, and generation and destruction, belong to the same
        subject, because opposites are suited by nature to come to be in the
        same subject. Therefore, if some subject is being changed from
        generation to destruction, at the same time that it is being generated
        it will be undergoing change leading to destruction, which is to be
        changed into non-being; for the terminus of destruction is non-being,
        Now what is being changed into non-being is being destroyed. Hence it
        follows that a thing is being destroyed at the same time that it is
        being generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        2396. But this cannot be true; for while a thing is coming to be it is
        not being destroyed, nor is it corrupted immediately afterwards. For
        since destruction is a process from being to nonbeing, that which is
        being destroyed must be. And thus there will have to be an intermediate
        state of rest between generation, which is a change to being, and
        destruction, which is a change to non-being. Hence there is no change
        from generation to destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        2397.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, there must be</span> (1018).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the fourth argument, which runs as follows. In everything
        that is being generated two things must be present: first, the matter of
        the thing which is generated, and, second, that in which the generation
        is terminated. If, then, there is generation of generation, both
        generation and motion will have to have some matter, such as an
        alterable body or a soul or something of this kind. But it is impossible
        to assign matter of this kind to generation and to motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        2398. Similarly, there must also be something in which the process of
        change is terminated, because some part, namely, the matter of the thing
        generated, must be moved from one attribute to another, and that in
        which motion is terminated cannot be motion but is the terminus of
        motion. For of the kind of change which we call learning there is not
        some other learning which is terminated in it, which is a learning of
        learning. Hence there is nothing to conclude but that there is no
        generation of generation.
      </p>
      <p>2399. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since</span> (1019).</p>
      <p>
        Here he draws as his conclusion his main thesis. He says that, since
        there cannot be motion either in the category of substance or in that of
        relation or in that of action and passion, it follows that motion
        belongs to quality, quantity and location; for in these categories there
        can be contrariety, which stands between the termini of motion, as has
        been pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
        2400. But since quality is sometimes used to mean substantial form, he
        adds that, when there is said to be motion in quality, it is not
        understood to signify substance, in view of the fact that substantial
        difference is predicated as something qualitative; but it refers to the
        kind of quality by which something is said to be acted upon or to be
        incapable of this. For there is alteration, properly speaking, only in
        terms of susceptible qualities, as is proved in Book VII of the
        <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>2401. <span style="font-weight: bold">The immovable</span> (1020).</p>
      <p>
        Then he explains the different senses in which the term
        <i>immovable</i> is used; and he gives three of these. First, the
        immovable means what is completely incapable of being moved; for
        example, God is immovable.
      </p>
      <p>
        2402. Second, it means what can be moved with difficulty, as a huge
        boulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        2403. Third, it means what is naturally fit to be moved but cannot be
        moved when it is fit, and where, and in the way in which it is fit to be
        moved. And only this kind of immobility is properly called <i>rest</i>,
        because rest is contrary to motion. Hence rest must be the privation of
        motion in what is susceptible of motion.<br /></p

        1021. Things which are in one primary place are
        <i>together in place</i>, and those which are in different places are
        <i>separate</i>, and those whose extremities are together are
        <i>in contact</i>. And an <i>intermediate</i> is that at which something
        continuously changing according to its nature naturally arrives before
        it reaches the limit to which it is changing. That is
        <i>contrary in place</i> which is most distant in a straight line. That
        is <i>subsequent</i> which comes after a starting point (the order being
        determined by position or form or in some other way) and has nothing in
        the same genus between itself and that which it follows; for example,
        lines in the case of a line, and units in the case of a unit, or a house
        in the case of a house. But there is nothing to prevent something else
        from coming between. For that which follows something is subsequent and
        comes after something else; for one does not follow two, nor does [the
        first day of] the new moon follow the second. Again, what is subsequent
        and in contact is <i>contiguous</i>. And since every change is between
        opposites, and these are contraries and contradictories, and since there
        is no intermediate between contradictories, it is evident that an
        intermediate is between contraries. The <i>continuous</i> has something
        of the nature of the contiguous; and I call two things continuous when
        both have the same extremity in which they are in contact and are
        uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        1022. It is evident, then, that the continuous belongs to those things
        from which one thing results in virtue 6f their contact. And it is
        evident that the subsequent is the first of these; for things which are
        subsequent are not necessarily in contact, but what is in contact is
        subsequent. But if it is in contact it is not necessarily continuous.
        And in things in which there is no contact there is no natural
        coherence. The point, then, is not the same as the unit; for contact
        belongs to the former but not to the latter, but only successiveness,
        and there is an intermediate between the former but not between the
        latter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        2404. He explains the terms which apply to motion, especially local
        motion. First (T021:C 2404), he explains them. Second (1022:C 2413), he
        draws a corollary from his remarks (“It is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (1021), that things which are “in one primary
        place,” i e., a proper place, are said to be <i>together in place</i>;
        for if some things are in one common place, they are not for this reason
        said to be together, for then all things which are contained in the
        circumference of the heavens would be said to be together.
      </p>
      <p>
        2405. Things which are in different places are said to be
        <i>separate</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2406. And those whose extremities are said to touch one another are said
        to be <i>in contact</i>; for example, two bodies whose surfaces are
        joined.
      </p>
      <p>
        2407. And an <i>intermediate</i> between two things is that at which it
        is natural for something that continuously changes to arrive before it
        reaches its limit; for example, if there is continuous motion from
        <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, the thing being changed first arrives at
        <i>b</i> before it reaches <i>c</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2408. Again, that which is most distant in a straight line is
        <i>contrary in place</i>; for that which is most distant cannot be
        measured by a curved line, because an infinite number of unlike sections
        of circles can be drawn between two points, but there can be only one
        straight line between two points. Now a measure must be definite and
        fixed. And that which is most distant as to place admits of being above
        and below, which are the extremity and the center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        2409. That is said to be <i>subsequent</i> which comes after some
        starting point, whether the order is determined by position or by form
        or in some other way; for example, two comes after one. And there must
        also be nothing of the same genus between that which is subsequent and
        that which it follows, as lines are subsequent to a line and units to a
        unit and a house to a house. But nothing prevents something of another
        genus from being an intermediate between two things one of which follows
        the other; for example, there may be one intermediate horse between two
        houses. In order to make the above distinction clear he adds that what
        is said to follow something must be subsequent and come after something.
        For one does not come after two, since it is first; nor does the first
        day of the new moon follow the second, but the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        2410. Then he says that the <i>contiguous</i> means what is subsequent
        and in contact with something else-for example, if two bodies are so
        related that one touches the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        2411. Then he says that, since every change is between opposites, and
        the opposites between which there is change are either contraries or
        contradictories, as has been shown (1008:C 2363), and since there is no
        intermediate between contradictories, it is evident that there is an
        intermediate only between contraries; for that which is intermediate is
        between the limits of a motion, as is clear from the definition given
        above. His introduction of this is timely; for since he said that those
        things are subsequent between which there is no intermediate, it was
        fitting that he should indicate between what things it is possible to
        have an intermediate.
      </p>
      <p>
        2412. Then he shows what the continuous is. He says that the continuous
        adds something to the contiguous; for there is continuity when both of
        those things which are in contact and together have one and the same
        extremity, as the parts of a line are continuous in relation to a point.
      </p>
      <p>2413. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is evident</span> (1022).</p>
      <p>
        Then he draws three corollaries from what has been said. The first is
        that continuity belongs to those things from which one thing naturally
        results in virtue of their contact; and this is because the continuous
        requires identical extremities.
      </p>
      <p>
        2414. The second corollary is that, of these three things—the
        subsequent, the contiguous and the continuous—the first and most common
        is the subsequent; for not everything that is subsequent is in contact,
        but everything which is in contact is subsequent or consecutive. For
        things which are in contact are arranged according to their position,
        and no one of them is an intermediate. Similarly, the contiguous is
        prior to and more common than the continuous, because, if a thing is
        continuous, there must be contact. For what is one must be together,
        unless perhaps plurality is understood in the phrase
        <i>being together</i>. For in that case the continuous would not involve
        being in contact. But the continuous must involve contact in the way in
        which something one is together. Yet if there is contact it does not
        follow that there is continuity; for example, if certain things are
        together it does not follow that they are one. But in things in which
        there is no contact “there is no natural coherence,” i.e., natural
        union, which is a property of the continuous.

        2415. The third corollary is that the point and the unit are not the
        same, as the Platonists claimed when they said that the point is the
        unit having position. That they are not the same is evident for two
        reasons: first, because there is contact between points but not between
        units, which only follow each other; second, because there is always
        some intermediate between two points, as is proved in Book V of the
        <i>Physics</i>. But it is not necessary that there should be an
        intermediate between two units.
