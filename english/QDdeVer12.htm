    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it is not a habit, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. As the Commentator says, a habit is that by which one performs an
    activity when he wants to. But the prophet cannot make use of prophecy when
    he wants to, as is clear of Eliseus in the fourth Book of Kings (3:14, 15),
    who, on being questioned by the king, could not give him an answer without
    calling the minstrel, so that the hand of the Lord might come upon him.
    Therefore, prophecy is not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Whoever has a cognitive habit can consider the subject matter of that
    habit without receiving anything from another. For one who needs an
    instructor for this does not yet have the habit. But a prophet cannot
    examine the subject matter of prophecy unless each event is revealed to him.
    Hence, in the fourth Book of Kings (4:27) Eliseus said of the woman whose
    son was dead: “Her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and
    hath not told me.” Therefore, prophecy is not a cognitive habit. Nor can it
    be a different habit, for prophecy belongs to cognition.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. It was said that the prophet needs a habit to be able to know those
    things which are divinely shown him.—On the contrary, divine speech is more
    efficacious than human speech. But no habit is needed for one to understand
    from human speech that something will take place. Therefore, there seems
    much less need of a habit to perceive the revelation by which God speaks to
    the prophet.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. A habit suffices for the knowledge of the whole subject matter of that
    habit. But by the gift of prophecy one is not taught everything that can be
    prophesied. For, as Gregory says and proves by examples: “Sometimes the
    spirit of prophecy inspires the mind of the one prophesying for present
    events and not at all for the future, and sometimes touches it for the
    future and not for the present.” Therefore, the gift of prophecy is not a
    habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. It was said that the subject matter of the gift of prophecy is not
    everything which can be prophesied but only that for the revelation of which
    the gift is given.—On the contrary, an inpouring can be limited only by that
    which gives it or by that which receives it. But the one receiving the
    inpouring of the gift of prophecy imposes no limitation to prevent it from
    extending to everything which can be prophesied, for the human intellect is
    capable of knowing all that can be prophesied. Nor is it limited by the one
    who gives it, for His liberality is infinite. Therefore, the gift of
    prophecy extends to everything which can be prophesied.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The affective part of the soul is so constituted that the one influx of
    grace frees the soul from all guilt. Therefore, the intellective part, also,
    is such that the influx of the one light of prophecy will cleanse the soul
    from all ignorance of things that can be prophesied.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. A freely given habit is more perfect than an acquired habit. But an
    acquired habit extends to many acts. Therefore, if prophecy is a freely
    given habit, it, too, will extend not to only one of the things which can be
    prophesied, but to all of them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. If we had one habit for each conclusion, those habits would not be joined
    together in the habit of one complete science, unless the conclusions had
    somz connection in so far as they are deduced from the same principles. But
    future contingents of this sort and other things which prophecy concerns, do
    not have any interconnection, as the conclusions of a single science have.
    Therefore, it follows that, if prophecy is a habit, and if the gift of
    prophecy extends to only one of the things prophesied, there will be in one
    prophet as many habits of prophecy as there are things which he knows can be
    prophesied.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. It was said that the habit of prophecy, once infused, extends to all that
    can be prophesied, but still a new revelation is needed to disclose certain
    species.—On the contrary, the infused habit of prophecy ought to be more
    perfect than the habit of an acquired science, and the prophetic light ought
    to be more perfect than the natural light of the agent intellect. But with
    the power of the light of the agent intellect and with the habit of a
    science, plus the added assistance of the power of imagination, we can form
    as many species as we need for the actual consideration of those things to
    which the habit extends. Therefore, if a prophet has a habit, he can do this
    much more readily without a new disclosure of any species.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. As the Gloss reads: “Prophecy is a divine inspiration, which announces
    the outcomes of things with immutable truth. But inspiration does not
    signify a habit, but an act. Therefore, prophecy is not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. According to the Philosopher seeing is a kind of passivity. Therefore,
    sight is a passive operation. But prophecy is a kind of sight, for,
    according to the first Book of Kings (9:9): “He that is now called a
    prophet, in times past was called a seer.” Therefore, prophecy is not a
    habit, but rather a passive operation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. According to the Philosopher, a habit is “a quality which is hard to
    change.” But prophecy is easily changed, since it does not remain in the
    prophet at all times but only now and then. As the Gloss on Amos (7:4), “ am
    not a prophet,” says: “The spirit does not give prophecy to the prophets at
    all times, but only now and then. And when they are enlightened, they are
    rightly called prophets.” Gregory also says: “Sometimes the spirit of
    prophecy fails prophets and it is not always at the service of their minds,
    for, when they do not have it, they know that it is a gift when they do have
    it.” Therefore, prophecy is not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. According to the Philosopher, there are three things in the soul: powers,
    habits, and passive operations. But prophecy is not a power, for, then,
    everyone would be a prophet, since the powers of the soul are common to all.
    Similarly, it is not a passive operation, for they exist only in the
    sensitive part of the soul, as is said in the <i>Physics.</i> Therefore, it
    is a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    21. Everything which is known is known through some habit. But the prophet
    knows the things which he declares; he does not know them, however, by
    reason of a natural or an acquired habit. Therefore he knows them by some
    infused habit, which we call prophecy.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. If prophecy is not a habit, this is so only because the prophet can. not
    see everything else which can be prophesied, unless he receives a new
    inspiration. But this does not prevent it from being a habit, for one who
    has a habit of common principles cannot consider the particular conclusions
    of some particular science unless he receives in addition some habit of the
    particular science. Therefore, there is nothing to prevent prophecy from
    being a common habit, which still demands a new revelation for the knowledge
    of the individual things to be prophesied.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Faith is the habit of everything which must be believed, yet one who has
    the habit of faith does not immediately have distinct knowledge of each
    matter of belief, but needs instruction to know the articles of faith
    distinctly. Therefore, although prophecy is a habit, there still is need of
    divine revelation, as a kind of speech, for the prophet to know distinctly
    what is to be prophesied.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As is said in the Gloss: Prophecy is called sight, and the prophet is called
    seer.” This is clear from the first Book of Kings (9:9), as was mentioned
    earlier.” Still, not every sight can be called prophecy, but
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    only the sight of those things which are far beyond our ordinary knowledge.
    As a result, the prophet is said to be not only one who
    <i>speaks from afar</i> (<i>procul fans</i>), that is, one who announces,
    but also one who <i>sees from afar</i> (<i>procul videns</i>), from the
    Greek <i>phanos,</i> which is an appearing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, since everything which is revealed is revealed under some light, as
    can be seen in Ephesians (5:13), those things which are revealed to man
    beyond the ordinary course of knowledge must be made manifest by a higher
    light. This is called the prophetic light and by receiving it one is made a
    prophet.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, we must bear in mind that a thing can be received in someone in two
    ways. In one, it is received as a form which remains in the subject; in the
    other, it is received after the manner of a transient impression. Thus,
    pallor exists as a quality in one who has this color naturally or from some
    serious accident, but exists as a transient impression in one who suddenly
    turns white from some fear. Similarly, physical light is in the stars as a
    quality of the stars, since it is a form remaining in them. But it is in air
    as a transient impression, since air does not retain light, but only
    receives it by being placed in the path of a shining body.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, in human understanding there is a light which is a quality or
    permanent form, namely, the essential light of the agent intellect, by
    reason of which our soul is called intellectual. But the prophetic light in
    the prophet cannot be this. For whoever knows certain objects by means of
    intellectual light, which has become a property in him, existing there as a
    form, must have stable knowledge of those things. And this cannot be unless
    he sees them in a principle in which they can be known. For, as long as the
    things known are not reduced to their principles, the knowledge is not
    established as certain, but is apprehended by him as having some
    probability, inasmuch as it has been spoken by others. Hence, for each thing
    he must receive word from others. Thus, if someone did not know how to
    deduce the conclusions of geometry from the principles, he would not have
    the habit of geometry, but would apprehend whatever he knew of the
    conclusions of geometry as one who believes his teacher. Hence, he would
    have to be instructed on each point, for he would not be able securely to
    proceed from some points to others without making a resolution to first
    principles.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, God Himself is the principle in which we can know future contingents
    and other things which exceed natural knowledge and with which prophecy
    deals. Hence, since the prophets do not see God’s essence, they cannot know
    the things which they see prophetically by a light which is a kind of
    habitual form inhering in them, but they have to be taught each thing
    individually. Thus it is that the prophetic light must not be a habit, but
    must exist in the soul of the prophet in the manner of a transient
    impression, as the light of the sun exists in the air. And, as the light
    remains in the air only when the sun is shining, so the previously mentioned
    light remains in the mind of the propliet only when it is actually being
    divinely inspired.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    And thus it is that the saints, when they talk about prophecy, speak of it
    as a transient impression and call it an inspiration or a kind of touch by
    which the Holy Spirit is said to touch the heart of the prophet. They also
    speak of prophecy with other words of this kind. And thus it is clear that,
    as far as the prophetic light is concerned, prophecy cannot be a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But we must remember that in bodily things, after something has undergone a
    transient impression, even after the impression has left, it is rendered
    more apt to undergo the impression, as water, once warmed, is warmed more
    easily afterwards when it has become cold, and a man, after he has been sad
    many times, is saddened more easily. Hence, the mind, when it has been under
    the influence of a divine inspiration, even after that inspiration has gone,
    remains more fit to receive it again, just as the mind remains more devout
    after devout prayer. It is for this reason that Augustine says: “Lest the
    mind which begins to grow lukewarm from cares and occupations become
    altogether cold and its fire die out completely, unless it is frequently
    enkindled, at set hours we call our mind back to the business of prayer.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Hence, the mind of the prophet, after it has received a divine inspiration
    one or more times, remains more apt to receive the inspiration again, even
    after the actual inspiration has ceased. And this aptitude can be called the
    habit of prophecy, just as Avicenna says that in us habits of science are
    nothing but certain aptitudes of our soul ordained for the reception of the
    illumination of the agent intelligence and the intelligible species flowing
    forth from it into our soul. However, it cannot properly be called habit,
    but an aptitude or disposition by reason of which one is called a prophet
    even when he is not actually being inspired. Nevertheless, lest an argument
    be built on the strength of the word, habit, we will uphold both sides and
    answer both sets of reasons.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The definition given fits habit in the strict sense, and in this sense
    the previously mentioned aptitude of prophesying cannot be called a habit.
    Nevertheless, taken in this way, the aptitude of our soul to receive
    something from the agent intelligence can also be called a habit, according
    to Avicenna, for in his opinion that reception is natural. Thus, according
    to him, one who has an aptitude has the power to receive when he so wishes,
    for a natural influx does not fail when the matter is disposed. But the
    influx of prophecy depends on the divine will alone; hence, it is not in the
    power of a prophet to use prophecy, no matter how great an aptitude he has
    for it in his mind.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. If prophetic light existed in the mind as a habit of knowledge about
    things to be prophesied, a prophet would not need new revelation to know
    anything that can be prophesied. But he does need new revelation, because
    that light is not a habit. The aptitude itself to perceive the light is like
    a habit and without this light things to be prophesied cannot be known.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Beyond the perception of the divine speech by which God talks interiorly
    to the prophet, and which is nothing but the enlightening of his mind, no
    habit is needed to perceive interiorly what has been said. But an aptitude
    seems to have a greater effect toward the perception of this speech, the
    more noble the speech is and the more its perception surpasses the natural
    powers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The solution to the fourth difficulty is clear from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The prophetic light, once infused, does not give knowledge of all that
    can be prophesied, but only of those things for the knowledge of which it is
    given. This limitation does not come from lack of power in the giver, but
    from the ordination of His wisdom, which distributes to each as He wishes.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. All mortal sins have this in common, that through any one of them man is
    separated from God. Hence, grace, which joins man to God, frees him from
    every mortal sin, but not from every venial sin, for venial sins do not
    separate him from God. But things which can be prophesied have a connection
    among themselves only in the order of God’s wisdom. Hence, one can be seen
    without another by those who do not see divine wisdom completely.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. An infused habit is more perfect than an acquired habit according to its
    genus, namely, by reason of its origin and by reason of the object which it
    is given to attain, which is higher than that to which an acquired habit is
    ordained. But nothing prevents an acquired habit from being more perfect in
    the manner in which it is possessed or perfected. Thus, it is clear that
    through the infused habit of faith we do not see the matters to be believed
    as perfectly as we see the conclusions of the sciences through the acquired
    habit of a science. Similarly, although the prophetic light is infused,
    still it does not exist as perfectly in us as the acquired habits. This also
    attests to the dignity of infused habits, for, since they are so excellent,
    human weakness cannot fully possess them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. The reasoning would conclude correctly if the light with which the mind
    of the prophet is flooded were a habit, but not if we hold that this habit
    or quasi habit is an aptitude for perceiving the aforesaid light, since this
    one thing could render a man apt to be enlightened about anything.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. We will treat later of the way in which the species have to be formed
    anew for prophetic revelation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Although inspiration does not signify a habit, it cannot be proved from
    this that prophecy is not a habit. For it is customary to define habits
    through their acts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. According to the Philosopher, to see can be taken in two ways: actually
    and habitually. Hence, sight can mean the act or the habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Prophetic light is not a quality which is hard to change, but something
    transient. It is in this sense that the authoritative citations mentioned
    speak. But that aptitude which remains for perceiving the illumination again
    is not easily changed; in fact, it remains a long time unless there is a
    great change in the prophet, through which such an aptitude is taken away.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Since acts arise completely from habits, they are therefore reduced to
    habit in that division of the Philosopher. Or they are also reduced to
    passive operations, since passive operations are acts of the soul, as to be
    angry or to desire.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But prophecy, in so far as it refers to the sight of the prophet, is an act
    of the mind; in so far as it refers to the light, which is received suddenly
    and in a passing manner, it is like a passive operation, inasmuch as a
    reception in the intellective part is called a passive operation, for to
    understand is a kind of passivity, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Or it can be said that, if the members of the division are taken strictly,
    that division of the Philosopher does not adequately comprehend everything
    which is in the soul, but only that which relates to moral matters, about
    which the Philosopher is thinking, as is clear from the examples with which
    he there explains himself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Not everything which is known is known by some habit, but only that of
    which we have perfect knowledge. For there are in us imperfect acts, which
    do not come from habits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In the demonstrative sciences there are certain general things in which
    particular conclusions are contained virtually, as it were in embryo. Hence,
    one who has the habit of those general things is only in remote potency to
    the particular conclusions, and this potency needs a mover to reduce it to
    act. But in things to be prophesied there is no such connection requiring
    that some knowledge be deduced from other prior knowledge in such a way that
    one possessing the knowledge involved in the prior habits would possess in a
    confused way the knowledge involved in the subsequent habits. Hence, the
    argument does not follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Our understanding is perfected in different ways by prophecy and by
    faith. For prophecy perfects understanding in itself, and thus it is
    necessary that the prophet be able to see distinctly those things for which
    he has the gift of prophecy. But faith perfects our understanding in the
    affective order, for the act of faith is an act of the understanding
    commanded by the will. Hence, through faith the understanding is only
    prepared to assent to those things which God orders to be believed. It is
    for this reason that faith is likened to hearing, but prophecy to sight. And
    thus it is not necessary for one who has the habit of faith to know all the
    matters of belief distinctly, as one who has the habit of prophecy must know
    distinctly all that is to be prophesied.

        It seems that it does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Prophecy is “the inspiration which announces the outcomes of things
        with immutable truth.” But the outcomes of things are called future
        contingents, and the conclusions of the demonstrative sciences do not
        concern matters of this sort. Therefore, there cannot be prophecy about
        such things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Jerome says that prophecy is “a sign of divine foreknowledge.” But
        foreknowledge refers to the future. Since, therefore, futures,
        especially future contingents, which prophecy seems mainly to deal with,
        cannot be the conclusions of any science, it seems that prophecy cannot
        deal with conclusions scientifically knowable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Nature does not provide superfluities nor fail in necessary matters.
        Much less does 6od, whose activity is most wisely disposed. But to know
        the conclusions of the demonstrative sciences man has another way than
        prophecy, namely, through self-evident principles. Therefore, if things
        of this sort were known through prophecy, it would seem to be
        superfluous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A different manner of generation is an indication of diversity of
        species. Thus, as the Commentator says, mice begotten from seed cannot
        be of the same species as mice begotten from decaying matter. But men
        naturally reach conclusions of the demonstrative sciences from
        self-evident principles. Therefore, if there are some men who receive
        knowledge of the demonstrative sciences in another way, as through
        prophecy, they will be of another species and will be called men
        equivocally, which seems absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The demonstrative sciences deal with those things which relate
        indifferently to every time. But prophecy does not have a similar
        relation to every time, in fact, “sometimes the spirit of the prophets
        stirs the heart of a prophet for the present and not for the future, and
        sometimes just the opposite,” as Gregory says. Therefore, prophecy does
        not deal with those things about which there is scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The mind of the prophet and the mind of anyone else do not relate in
        the same way to those things which are known through prophecy. But in
        things which are known through demonstration the judgment of the prophet
        and of anyone else who knows it is the same, and neither is preferred to
        the other, as Rabbi Moses says. Therefore, prophecy does not deal with
        those things which are known through demonstration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We believe the prophets only in so far as they are inspired by the
        spirit of prophecy. But we have to give belief to those things written
        in the books of the prophets even though they treat of conclusions of
        scientific knowledge, as in Psalms (135:6): “Who established the earth
        above the waters,” and whatever else there is of this sort. Therefore,
        the spirit of prophecy inspires the prophets even about conclusions of
        the sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As the grace of miracles relates to the performance of deeds which
        are beyond the power of nature, so the gift of prophecy relates to the
        knowledge of things which surpass natural knowledge. But through the
        grace of miracles there take place not only things which nature cannot
        do, as to give sight to the blind and to raise the dead, but also things
        which nature can do, as to cure those with fevers. Therefore, through
        the gift of prophecy one can know not only those things to which natural
        knowledge does not extend, but also things to which natural knowledge
        does extend, and conclusions of the sciences are among these latter.
        Thus, it seems that prophecy can treat of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In all things which exist for the sake of an end the matter is
        determined according to the exigency of the end, as is clear in the
        <i>Physics</i>. But the gift of prophecy is given for the use of the
        Church, as is clear in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (12:7): “And
        the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.” The
        letter adds many examples among which prophecy is numbered. Therefore,
        all those things the knowledge of which can be useful for salvation are
        the matter of prophecy, whether they are past, or future, or even
        eternal, or necessary, or contingent. But those things which cannot
        pertain to salvation are outside the matter of prophecy. Hence,
        Augustine says: “Although our authors knew what shape heaven is, [the
        spirit] wants to speak through them only that which is useful for
        salvation. And to the Gospel of St. John (16:13), “But when he, the
        Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth,” the Gloss adds:
        “necessary for salvation.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, I say necessary for salvation, whether they are necessary for
        instruction in the faith or for the formation of morals. But many things
        which are proved in the sciences can be useful for this, as, for
        instance, that our understanding is incorruptible, and also those things
        which when considered in creatures lead to admiration of the divine
        wisdom and power. Hence, we find that mention of these is made in Holy
        Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, we should bear in mind that, since prophecy is knowledge of
        things which are far away, it does not have the same relation to all the
        things we have mentioned. For some things are far from our knowledge
        because of the things themselves and some are such because of something
        in us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Future contingents are beyond us because of the things themselves, for
        they are unknown because they lack existence, since they neither exist
        in themselves nor are determined in their causes. But the things beyond
        us because of something in us are those which we have difficulty knowing
        because of our own inadequacy and not because of the things themselveg,
        since they are the most knowable and the most perfect beings, such as
        things which are intelligible by nature, and especially things which are
        eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, what belongs to a thing in itself belongs to it more truly than
        that which belongs to it by reason of something else. Hence, since
        future contingents are more truly beyond our knowledge than anything
        else, they seem, therefore, to belong especially to prophecy. And they
        pertain to it so much that, in the definition of prophecy, they are
        given as the special matter of prophecy. Thus: “Prophecy is a divine
        inspiration which announces the outcomes of things with immutable
        truth.” And even the name of prophecy seems to be taken from this. Thus,
        Gregory says: “Prophecy is so called because it predicts the future.
        When it speaks of the present or the past, it loses the character of its
        name.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, among those things which are beyond us because of something in us
        there is likewise a difference which we must consider some things are
        beyond us because they surpass all human knowledge, as that God is three
        and one, and other such things. These are not conclusions of the
        sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some things, however, are beyond us because they surpass the knowledge
        of some men, but not human knowledge simply. In this class there are
        those things which the educated know through demonstration, but which
        the uneducated do not grasp with natural knowledge, although they are
        sometimes elevated to them by divine revelation. These things do not
        belong to prophecy simply, but with reference to men of this type. Thus,
        conclusions which are demonstrated in the sciences can belong to
        prophecy.
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The outcomes of things are put in the definition of prophecy as the
        most proper matter of prophecy, but not as the whole matter of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Similarly, prophecy is called a sign of foreknowledge by reason of
        its principal matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although conclusions of the sciences can be known in another way than
        through prophecy, it is not superfluous for them to be shown by
        prophetic light, for through faith we cling more firmly to what the
        prophets say than we do to the demonstrations of the sciences. And in
        this, too, the grace of God is praised and His perfect knowledge is
        shown forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Natural causes have determinate effects, since their powers are
        finite and limited to one type of effect. Therefore, it is necessary
        that those things which are brought into being by different natural
        causes according to different ways of generation be specifically
        different. But, since the divine power is infinite, it can without the
        work of nature produce effects specifically the same as those which
        nature produces. Hence, if those things which can be known naturally are
        divinely revealed, it does not follow that those who receive knowledge
        in a different way are specifically different.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although prophecy sometimes concerns things which are separated as
        belonging to different divisions of time, it sometimes concerns those
        things which are true for all times.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Rabbi Moses does not mean that a revelation could not be made to a
        prophet of those things which are known through demonstration, but that,
        as soon as they are known by a demonstration, it makes no difference
        whether there is prophecy about them or not.

        It seems that it is, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The cognition of one who is awake is preferable to that of one who is
        sleeping. But it is natural for people who are asleep to foresee the
        future, as is clear in the divinations of dreams. Therefore, with much
        greater reason some can see the future naturally while awake. But this
        is the office of the prophet. Therefore, one can naturally be a prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that the cognition of one who is awake is better for
        judgment, but the cognition of one who is asleep is better for
        reception.—On the contrary, the cognoscitive power can judge of
        something in so far as it receives its species. Therefore, judgment
        follows reception and, where the reception is better, the judgment is
        also more perfect. Thus, if one who is asleep is better in receiving, he
        ought also to be better in judging.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Our understanding is hampered in sleep only from without, namely in
        so far as it depends on sense. But the judgment of our understanding
        does not depend on sense, since the operation of our understanding
        depends on sense in so far as it receives from sense. But judgment
        follows reception. Therefore, the judgment of our understanding is not
        hampered in sleep. Hence, the distinction given seems to be of no
        importance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. What belongs to something because it is kept free from something else
        belongs to it by reason of its nature, just as brightness, which is
        natural to iron, comes to it because the iron is kept free from rust.
        But, as Augustine shows by many examples, it belongs to the soul to see
        the future in so far as it is cut off from the senses of the body.
        Therefore, it seems natural for the human soul to foresee the future.
        Thus, we conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Gregory says: “Sometimes the very power of souls foresees something
        by its subtlety, for sometimes souls about to leave the body know
        through revelation things to come.” But the things which the soul can
        see because of its subtlety it sees naturally. Therefore, the soul can
        naturally know future things, and so naturally have prophecy, which
        consists especially in foreknowledge of the future.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It was said that the futures which the soul foresees by natural
        knowledge are those which have fixed causes in nature, but that prophecy
        deals with other futures.—On the contrary, those things which depend on
        free will do not have fixed causes in nature. But those things which the
        soul foresees from its subtlety depend altogether on free will, as is
        clear from the example of Gregory, who tells of a man who, when he was
        sick and his burial in a certain church had been arranged for, arose as
        he neared death, dressed, and predicted that he wanted to go by the
        Appian Way to the Church of St. Sixtus. When he died a short while
        later, as his funeral procession was going out along the Appian Way,
        they suddenly decided to bury him in the Church of St. Sixtus, since it
        was a long way to the church where they were supposed to bury him. And
        they did this without knowing what he had said. As Gregory adds, he
        would not have been able to predict this if the power and subtlety of
        his soul had not foreseen what would happen to his body. Therefore, man
        can naturally foresee those futures which are independent of non-free
        causes. The same conclusion follows as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. From natural causes we cannot perceive the meaning of those things
        which do not take place naturally. But astrologers perceive the meanings
        of prophecies from the movements of the heavenly bodies. Therefore,
        prophecy is natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. In natural science the philosophers discuss only those things which
        can happen naturally. But Avicenna discusses prophecy. Therefore,
        prophecy is natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. For prophecy, as Avicenna says, only three things are needed:
        clearness of intelligence, perfection of the imaginative power, and
        power of soul so that external matter obeys it. But these three things
        can be had naturally. Therefore, one can naturally be a prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. But it was said that our understanding and imagination can naturally
        be brought to the point where they have foreknowledge of natural future
        events, but that prophecy does not deal with these. On the contrary,
        those things which depend on lower causes are said to be natural. But
        Isaiah (38:1) foretold that Ezechias would die, and lie did this on the
        basis of [the expected outcome of ] the order of created causes, as the
        Gloss on that passage states. Therefore, prophecy is the foreknowledge
        of natural future events.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. To the things which are brought into existence divine providence
        grants the possession of those things without which they could not be
        preserved in existence, as in the human body it put members with which
        food can be taken and digested, without which mortal life would not be
        maintained. But the human race cannot be maintained without society, for
        one man is not sufficient unto himself in the necessities of life.
        Hence, man is “naturally a political animal,” as is said in the
        <i>Ethics.</i> But society cannot be maintained without justice, and
        prophecy is the rule of justice. Therefore, human nature is endowed with
        the ability naturally to arrive at prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. In any class there is that which is most perfect in that class. But
        among men the most perfect is the prophet, who transcends the others in
        that which is higher in man, his intellect. Therefore, man can naturally
        arrive at prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The properties of God are farther from the properties of creatures
        than the properties of future things are from present things. But man
        can reach the knowledge of God by natural knowledge through the
        properties of creatures, according to Romans (1:20): “For the invisible
        things of him, from the creation of the world,...” Therefore, from the
        things which now exist man can arrive at the knowledge of future things.
        Thus, he can be a prophet naturally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. It was said that future things are more remote in knowledge although
        God is more remote in being.—On the contrary, the principles of being
        and of knowing are the same. Therefore, that which is more remote in
        being is more remote in knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Augustine distinguishes9 three kinds of goods: “insignificant,
        important, and ordinary.” But prophecy is not numbered among the
        insignificant goods, for the goods of this sort are bodily goods. Nor is
        it classed among the most important goods, for these are those by which
        we live rightly and which no one can abuse. And this does not seem to
        fit prophecy. Therefore, it remains that prophecy belongs to the
        ordinary goods, which are the natural goods of the soul. Thus, prophecy
        seems to be natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Boethius says that in one sense all that “can act or be acted upon”
        is called nature. But for someone to be a prophet he must undergo some
        spiritual change, which consists in the reception of the prophetic
        light, as was said above. Therefore, it seems that prophecy is natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. If to act is natural for the agent and to receive is natural for
        that which is acted upon, the act of receiving must be natural. But it
        is natural for God to infuse the perfection of prophecy into men. For by
        His very nature He is good, and it is natural for the good to
        communicate itself. Likewise, it is natural for the human mind to
        receive things from God, since its nature is made up only of those
        things which it receives from God. Therefore, the reception of prophecy
        is natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. There is a natural active potency corresponding to every natural
        passive potency. But in the human soul there is a natural potency for
        the reception of the light of prophecy. Therefore, there is also some
        natural active potency through which one is brought to the act of
        prophecy. Therefore, it seems that prophecy is natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        19. Naturally, man has more perfect knowledge than other animals. But
        some animals are naturally prescient of those future things which
        especially concern them. This is clear of ants, who have foreknowledge
        of future rains, and of some fishes, which foretell future storms.
        Therefore, man, also, ought to be naturally prescient of those things
        which concern him. Thus, it seems that man naturally can be a prophet.

        1. In the second Epistle of St. Peter (1:21) is said: “For prophecy came
        not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke,
        inspired by the Holy Spirit.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That which depends on an external cause does not seem to be natural.
        But prophecy depends on an external cause, for the prophets read in the
        mirror of eternity. Therefore, it seems that prophecy is not natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Those things which are in us naturally are within our power. “But it
        was not in the power of a prophet to possess the spirit of predicting
        the future,” as is clear from the Gloss on the second Epistle of St.
        Peter (1:19): “We have the more firm prophetical word.” Therefore,
        prophecy is not natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Things which are natural happen as the more common occurrence. But
        prophecy exists in very few men. Therefore, it is not natural.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A thing is called natural in two ways. In one it is so called because
        its active principle is natural, as it is natural for fire to be borne
        aloft. It is so called in another way when nature is the source not of
        any of its dispositions whatever, but of those which are a necessity for
        such a perfection. In this way, the infusion of the rational soul is
        called natural, inasmuch as through the activity of nature the body is
        given a disposition which is a necessity for the reception of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some, then, were of the opinion that prophecy is natural in the first
        sense, for they said: “The soul had in itself a power of divination,” as
        Augustine relates. But in the same place he rejects that, for, if that
        were so, then the soul would be able to have foreknowledge of the future
        whenever it so wished. And this is clearly false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Furthermore, the falsity of this is manifest because the nature of the
        human mind cannot naturally be the source of any knowledge to which it
        cannot arrive by means of self-evident principles, which are the prime
        instruments of the agent intellect. It cannot arrive at a knowledge of
        future contingents from these principles, except, perhaps, by studying
        some natural signs, as the doctor foresees that health or death will
        come, or a meteorologist foresees the storm or fair weather. But such
        knowledge of future things is not ascribed to divination or prophecy,
        but to technical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, some. have said that prophecy is natural in the second sense. For
        nature can bring man to such a state that he will have to receive
        foreknowledge of futures through the action of some higher cause.
        Indeed, this opinion is true of a certain type of prophecy, but not,
        however, of that type which the Apostle numbers among the gifts of the
        Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And so, to see the difference between these types we should keep in mind
        that, before they exist, future contingents pre-exist in two ways, that
        is, they are contained in the divine foreknowledge and in the created
        causes, by whose power they will be brought into existence. In these two
        the futures pre-exist in a doubly different manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first difference is this, that all that pre-exists in created causes
        pre-exists in the divine foreknowledge, but not conversely. For God
        holds within Himself the principles which will determine some future
        things without infusing them into created things. An example of this is
        the principles which will determine those things which happen
        miraculously by the divine power alone, as Augustine says.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second is this, that some things pre-exist in created causes
        changeably, since the power of the cause which is directed to bringing
        about such an effect can be hindered by some event. But all future
        things are in the divine foreknowledge unchangeably, for futures are
        objects of the divine foreknowledge not only as regards the order of
        their causes to those futures, but also as nards the outcome of that
        order or the event.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, there are two ways in which foreknowledge of the future can
        be caused in the human mind. One is derived from the preexistence of
        futures in the divine mind. It is this prophecy that is called a gift of
        the Holy Spirit, and it is not natural. For those things which are
        executed by the divine power without natural intermediary causes are not
        said to be natural, but miraculous. Now the revelation of futures of
        this sort takes place without intermediary natural causes, for they are
        not revealed in so far as the principles which determine future things
        exist in created causes, but in so far as they exist in the divine mind,
        from which they flow into the mind of the prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second way it is derived from the power of created causes, in so
        far as certain movements can be impressed on the human imaginative
        power, for instance, by the power of the heavenly bodies, in which there
        pre-exist some signs of certain future events. And, in so far as it is
        natural for the human understanding, as inferior, to receive instruction
        from the illumination of the separated intellects, and to be raised up
        to the knowledge of other things, prophecy can be called natural in the
        sense which was mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this natural prophecy differs in three ways from that about which we
        are now speaking. It differs, first, in this, that the prophecy of which
        we speak gets its foreknowledge of future things immediately from God,
        although an angel can be an intermediary, inasmuch as he acts in virtue
        of the divine light. But natural prophecy is due to the proper activity
        of second causes. Second, it differs in this that natural prophecy
        extends only to those future things which have determinate causes in
        nature, but the prophecy of which we speak relates indifferently to all
        things. Third, they differ in this, that natural prophecy does not
        foresee infallibly, but predicts those things which are true for the
        most part, whereas the prophecy which is a gift of the Holy Spirit
        foresees the future infallibly. Hence, it is called a sign of the divine
        foreknowledge, since it foresees with that infallibility with which
        future things are foreseen by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This threefold difference can be noted in the definition of Cassiodorus.
        The first difference is in the word “divine”; the second is in the
        general phrase, “outcomes of things”; and the third in the words, “which
        announces with immutable truth.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But two of the differences, the first and second, remain in prophecy in
        so far as it deals with things which are necessary, as those which can
        be known with scientific knowledge. For by natural prophecy man does not
        receive immediately from God the knowledge of the things which are known
        scientifically, but gets it through the mediation of second causes, and
        through the activity of second causes acting with their natural power.
        Nor, again, does such knowledge extend to things which are necessary,
        but only to those which can be known through first principles. For the
        power of the light of the agent intellect does not extend any farther
        and is not naturally elevated to other things as divine prophecy is
        raised to certain things which are beyond natural knowledge, such as
        that God is three and one and other things of this sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this matter the third difference has no place, for both kinds of
        prophecy give the prophet knowledge of necessary conclusions of this
        kind as unchangeably and certainly as if they were known through the
        principles of demonstration. Furthermore, the mind of man is elevated by
        both prophecies so that it understands in a way similar to the separated
        substances, who understand the principles and the conclusions with the
        utmost certainty in a simple intuition without deducing one from the
        other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, both prophecies differ from dreams and visions, in so far as we
        call a dream an apparition which comes to a man who is asleep and a
        vision one which comes to a man who is awake but carried out of his
        senses, because in both the dream and the simple vision the soul is
        fettered completely or partially by phantasms which are seen in such a
        way that the soul completely or partially clings to them as to things
        which are true. But, although in both prophecies some phantasms may be
        seen in sleep or in a vision, the soul of the prophet is not under the
        control of those phantasms, but knows through the prophetic light that
        the objects which it sees are not things, but likenesses of them with
        some meaning. And it knows their meaning for, as is said in Daniel
        (10:1): “There is need of understanding in a vision.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus it is clear that natural prophecy is midway between dreams and
        divine prophecy. Hence it is that a dream is said to be a part of or an
        instance of natural prophecy, as also, that natural prophecy is an
        imperfect likeness of divine prophecy.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. There are two things to be considered in knowledge: reception and
        judgment about that which is received. Accordingly, in the matter of
        judgment the cognition of one who is awake is preferable to that of one
        who is asleep, for the judgment of one who is awake is free, whereas the
        judgment of one who is asleep is fettered, as is said in
        <i>Sleeping and Wakefulness</i>. But the cognition of one who is asleep
        is preferable for reception, because internal impressions from external
        movements can be received better when the senses are at rest. This is so
        whether they come from the separated substances or from the heavenly
        bodies. Thus we can understand in this sense that which is said of
        Balaam in Numbers (24:16): “who falling,” that is, sleeping, “hath his
        eyes opened.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Judgment does not depend only on the reception of the species, but
        also on the examination of the matter to be judged with reference to
        some principle of knowledge, just as we judge about conclusions by
        analyzing them back to principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, when the exterior senses are bound in sleep, the interior
        powers are, as it were, free from the bustle of the external senses and
        can better perceive the internal impressions made on the understanding
        or the imagination by a divine or angelic light, or by the power of the
        heavenly bodies, or by anything else, just as it seems to one who is
        asleep that he is eating something sweet when thin phlegm flows across
        his tongue. But, since the senses are the first source of our knowledge,
        we must in some way reduce to sense everything about which we judge.
        Hence, the Philosopher says” that the sensible visible thing is that at
        which the work of art and nature terminates, and from which we should
        judge of other things. Similarly, he says that the senses deal with that
        which is outermost as the understanding deals with principles. He calls
        outermost those things which are the term of the resolution of one who
        judges. Since, then, in sleep the senses are fettered, there cannot be
        perfect judgment so that a man is deceived in some respect, viewing the
        likenesses of things as though they were the things themselves. However,
        it sometimes does happen that one who is asleep knows that some of these
        are not things, but the likenesses of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The judgment of our understanding does not depend on sense in such a
        way that the act of understanding takes place by means of a sensible
        organ. However, it does need the senses as that which is last and
        outermost to terminate its analysis.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Some have held that the rational soul “has within itself some power
        of divination,” as Augustine says. But he himself rejects this in that
        same place, for, if this were so, the soul would be prepared to foresee
        futures when it so desired. And this is obviously false. For the soul at
        times sees the future when it is carried out of its senses, not because
        this belongs to it by reason of its natural power, but because it is
        thus rendered more fit to perceive the impressions of those causes which
        can give some foreknowledge of the future.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Subtlety of soul, which Gregory says is a cause of foreknowledge of
        futures, should be taken to mean that aptitude of the soul to receive
        something from the separated substances, not only in the order of grace,
        in so far as things are revealed to holy people by angels, but also in
        the order of nature, in so far as lower intellects in the order of
        nature are naturally fitted to receive perfection from the higher
        intellects, and in so far as human bodies are subject to the impressions
        of the heavenly bodies, in which there is a provision for some future
        events. The soul by its subtlety foresees these events through certain
        likenesses left in the imagination by the impression of the heavenly
        bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although free choice is not subject to natural causes, natural causes
        sometimes do facilitate or hinder the things which are done by free
        choice, as in the case mentioned rain or excessive heat could engender
        weariness in those who were carrying the bier, so that they would not
        carry it to the assigned place. And we could get foreknowledge of these
        happenings by means of the heavenly bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Since human bodies are under the influence of the heavenly bodies,
        from the movements of the heavenly bodies we can perceive some
        indication of any disposition of the human body. Since, therefore, a
        certain constitution or disposition of the human body is a kind of
        prerequisite for natural prophecy, it is not inappropriate that an
        indication of natural prophecy be received from the heavenly bodies. But
        no indication of the prophecy which is a gift of the Holy Spirit is thus
        received.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Those philosophers who have treated of prophecy were not able to
        treat of the prophecy about which we are now speaking, but only of
        natural prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. One of those three things cannot naturally belong to the soul,
        namely, that it have such power that external matter would be under its
        control, since, as Augustine says: “The matter in bodies is not subject
        to the arbitrary will even of the angels themselves.” Thus, on this
        point, what Avicenna or any other philosopher says cannot be held. The
        other two things which the objection deals with, in so far as they arise
        naturally in man, can cause natural prophecy, but not the prophecy of
        which we are talking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Although only those things which fall under the influence of natural
        causes can be revealed through natural prophecy, nevertheless, not only
        other things but those, too, can be known through divine prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The society of men, in so far as it is ordained to eternal life as
        its end, can be preserved only through the justice of faith, of which
        prophecy is the source. Hence, Proverbs (29:18) says: “When prophecy
        shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad.” But, since this end
        is supernatural, the justice, which is ordained to this end, and the
        prophecy, which is its source, will both be supernatural. But the
        justice through which human society is ruled in its ordination to the
        civil good can be had adequately through natural principles implanted in
        man. Hence, it is not necessary for prophecy to be natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. By reason of the nobility of man there can be found in the human
        race a perfection so becoming that it could be produced only by a
        supernatural cause. But irrational creatures are not capable of such
        perfection. Therefore, it is not necessary that that which is most
        perfect in the human race should be obtained by the power of nature.
        This is necessary only for that which is most perfect according to the
        order of nature, not for that which is most perfect according to the
        order of grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. A thing can be known in two ways: with reference to its existence,
        and to its quiddity. But, since the properties of creatures from which
        we get our knowledge are extremely remote from the properties of God,
        thence it is that we cannot have quidditative knowledge of God. However,
        since creatures depend on God, by looking at creatures we can know that
        God exists. But, since the things which now exist do not depend on
        future things, but do have similar properties, we cannot therefore know
        from present things whether certain future things will follow from them.
        However, we can know what their nature and properties will be if they
        should exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. God is more remote from creatures than one creature is from another
        in His manner of existing, but not in the relation which exists between
        the principle of existing and that which has existence from such a
        principle. Therefore, by means of creatures we can know that God exists,
        but we cannot know His quiddity. It is just the opposite with the
        knowledge of future contingents by means of present or past things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Prophecy is classified among the greatest goods, since it is a free
        gift. For, although it does not act as an immediate principle of
        meritorious action to make one live properly, the whole of prophecy is
        directed to the virtuous life. Nor, again, does one misuse prophecy in
        such a way that the misuse itself is an act of prophecy, as when someone
        misuses a natural power. For one who uses prophecy to seek gain or the
        favor of men has, indeed, a good act of prophecy, which is to know
        hidden things and to announce them, but the abuse of this good is an act
        of cupidity or some other vice. Nevertheless, although one does not
        misuse prophecy as a principle of action, he does misuse it as an
        object. In a similar way, those who are proud of their virtues misuse
        them, although the virtues are counted among the greatest goods.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. We do not say that something is natural if it comes from nature
        taken in any sense, but taken in the third meaning which Boethius gives
        it there, namely, inasmuch as nature is “the principle of motion” and
        rest in the thing in which it is, and the essential, not the accidental,
        principle. Otherwise it would be necessary to say that all activities,
        receptions, and properties are natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. To communicate His goodness is natural for God in the sense that it
        is in harmony with His nature and not in the sense that He communicates
        it because of some necessity of His nature. For such communication is
        made by the divine will in keeping with the order of wisdom which
        distributes Hi’s goods to all in an orderly way. It is also natural for
        a creature to receive from God not any goodness, but that which belongs
        to its nature, as to be rational belongs to man but not to a stone or an
        ass. Hence, if some perfection is received in man by reason of divine
        power, it is not necessary for it to be natural to man when it exceeds
        what is due to human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. In human nature there is a passive potency for the reception of
        prophetic light, which is not natural but only obediential, like the
        potency which is in physical nature for those things which happen
        miraculously. Hence, it is not necessary to have a natural active
        potency corresponding to such a passive potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        19. Brute animals can be prescient only of those future events
        concerning them which depend on the movement of the heavens. And by the
        impressions of the heavens their imagination is stirred to do something
        which is an appropriate sign of the future. This kind of imprint has
        more place in brutes than in men because, as Damascene says, brutes “are
        more acted upon than acting.”Hence, they follow the impressions of the
        heavenly bodies completely. Man, however, who has free will, does not
        act in this way. Nor should a brute be called prescient of the future on
        this account, although a sign of some future event can be drawn from its
        activity. For it does not act to give any sign of the future, as though
        it knew the reason for its activity; rather, it is led on by a natural
        instinct.

        It seems that it is, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Every perfection which in its reception must conform to the
        disposition of the receiver requires some definite disposition in the
        receiver. But prophecy is such a perfection, as is clear from Amos
        (1:2), “The Lord will roar from Sion,” on which the Gloss says: “It is
        natural, he says, for all who want to compare one thing to another to
        use comparisons taken from those things which they have experienced and
        among which they have been brought up. For example, sailors compare
        their enemies to storms, and loss to shipwreck. And shepherds liken
        their fear to the roaring of a lion, and call their enemies lions,
        bears, and wolves. Thus, the prophet, who was a shepherd, likens the
        fear of God to the roaring of a lion.” Therefore, prophecy requires some
        definite disposition in human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Perfection of the imagination is needed for prophecy, since prophecy
        operates through the sight of imagination. But to have perfection of the
        power of imagination its organ must be in good condition and properly
        disposed. Therefore, a natural disposition is needed for prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A natural hindrance is stronger than one which comes from without.
        But some passions which are aroused from without interfere with
        prophecy. Thus, Jerome says: “At that time when the marital act is
        performed the presence of the Holy Spirit will not be given, even though
        the one who fulfills the duty of procreation seems to be a prophet.” Nor
        is this due to guilt, for there is no guilt in the marital act, but to
        the passion of the concupiscence connected with it. Therefore, an
        indisposition of the natural constitution is a much greater hindrance,
        tending to make it impossible for one to become a prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Nature has an ordination to grace as grace has to glory. But the
        perfection of grace in one who would arrive at glory is a prerequisite
        for glory. Therefore, a natural disposition is prerequisite for prophecy
        and the other free gifts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The contemplation in prophecy is higher than that in acquired
        scientific knowledge. But the contemplation in acquired scientific
        knowledge is hindered if the natural constitution lacks the proper
        disposition, for some are so unfit by reason of their natural
        constitution that they can hardly, if ever, progress far enough to
        acquire scientific knowledge. Therefore, if the natural constitution
        lacks the proper disposition, it is a much greater hindrance to the
        contemplation in prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As is said in Romans (13:1): “The things which are from God have
        order in them.” But the gift of prophecy is from God. Therefore, He
        dispenses it in an orderly manner. But there would be no orderly
        distribution if it were given to someone who had not the proper
        disposition to possess it. Therefore, prophecy requires a natural
        disposition.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. That which depends solely on the free choice of the giver does not
        require any disposition in the receiver. But prophecy is such a gift, as
        is clear from the first Epistle to the Corinthians (12:11), which, after
        it has listed prophecy and other gifts of the Holy Spirit, adds: “But
        all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to everyone
        as he will.” And the Gospel of St. John (3:8) says: “The Spirit
        breatheth where he will.” Therefore, a natural disposition is not needed
        to have prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Apostle says in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (1:27-28):
        “The weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the
        strong. And the base things of the world and things that are not, that
        he might bring to naught things that are.” Therefore, no disposition in
        the subject is a necessary prerequisite for the gifts of the Holy
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        31. Gregory says: “The Holy Spirit fills the boy harpist and makes him a
        prophet; He fills the shepherd who is railing at the sycamore trees and
        makes him a prophet.”Therefore, the gift of prophecy does not require
        any disposition in him to whom it is given, but its bestowal depends on
        the divine will alone.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are two things to be considered in prophecy: the gift of prophecy
        itself, and the use of such a gift once received.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The gift itself of prophecy, which exists beyond the capacity of man, is
        given by God and not through the power of some created cause, although
        natural prophecy is produced in us by the power of some created cause,
        as has been said earlier.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But between the operation of a creature and that of God there is this
        difference, that, to bring about an effect, God’s activity does not need
        matter or any material disposition, for by His activity He produces not
        only the form but also the matter. However, He does not make the form
        without matter or without a disposition, but He can make matter and form
        together in one operation, or He can transform the matter, however
        unfit, to the proper disposition which is needed for the perfection
        which He gives. This is clear in resuscitation of a dead man, for the
        dead body is altogether unfit to receive the soul. Yet by the one divine
        action the body receives the soul and the disposition for the soul. But
        matter and the disposition of the matter are required for the activity
        of a creature, for a created power cannot make whatever it wishes from
        anything.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear, then, that natural prophecy requires the proper disposition
        of the natural constitution, but the prophecy which is the gift of the
        Holy Spirit does not need this. However, it does require that the
        natural disposition which is suitable for prophecy be given with the
        gift of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the use of any prophecy is within the power of the prophet. It is in
        keeping with this that the first Epistle to the Corinthians (14:3 2)
        says: “And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.”
        Therefore, one can prevent himself from using prophecy. And the proper
        disposition is a necessary requirement for the proper use of prophecy,
        since the use of prophecy proceeds from the created power of the
        prophet. Hence, a definite disposition is also required.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Certain dispositions are unconnected with prophecy, and these are not
        changed in the prophet by the divine activity, but prophecy proceeds in
        harmony with these dispositions. For it is indifferent to prophecy,
        whether the thing prophesied be represented under one likeness rather
        than another. However, God takes away from the prophet the dispositions
        which oppose prophecy and gives, him the dispositions which are
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Perfection of the imagination is needed for prophecy, but it is not
        necessarily needed beforehand. For God Himself, who infuses the gift of
        prophecy, can improve the constitution of the organ of the imaginative
        power, as He can make blear eyes see clearly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3 Strong passions of this sort draw the attention of reason completely
        to themselves and, consequently, withdraw it from the study of spiritual
        things. Therefore, strong passions of anger or sorrow or pleasure hinder
        the use of prophecy in one who has received the gift of prophecy. Thus,
        the unfitness of the natural constitution would be a hindrance, unless
        it were somehow remedied by the divine power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The application of the proposed likeness is limited to this, that as
        grace is added to nature, so glory is added to grace. But there is no
        likeness in all respects, for grace merits glory, but nature does not
        merit grace. Therefore, the merit of grace is prerequisite for glory,
        but the disposition of nature is not prerequisite for the reception of
        grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In some sense, acquired scientific knowledge is caused by us. But it
        is not in our power to improve the constitution of the organs of the
        soul, as it is within the divine power, which infuses the gift of
        prophecy. So, they are not alike.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The gift of prophecy is dispensed by God in a most orderly way. The
        orderly distribution of this gift also entails conferring it at times on
        those who seem least disposed for it, so that it will thus be attributed
        to the divine power and, as the first Epistle to the Corinthians (1:29)
        says: “That no flesh should glory in his sight.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In Wisdom (7:27) we read: “Through prophecies [she] conveyeth herself
        into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.” But only
        those who have moral goodness are the friends of God. As the Gospel of
        St. John (14:2 3) says: “If anyone love me, he will keep my word.”
        Therefore, one who does not have moral goodness is not appointed a
        prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Prophecy is a gift of the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not
        dwell in a sinner. As Wisdom (1:5) says: “For the Holy Spirit of
        discipline will flee from the deceitful.” Therefore, the gift of
        prophecy cannot exist in a sinner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That which one cannot put to an evil use cannot exist in a sinner.
        But no one can put prophecy to an evil use for, since the act of
        Prophecy is from the Holy Spirit, if someone put it to an evil use, sin
        and the Holy Spirit would be causes of the same act. And this cannot be.
        Therefore, prophecy cannot exist in a sinner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Philosopher says: “If prophecy through dreams comes from God, it
        is unfitting for Him to give it to any but the best men.” But it is
        clear that the gift of prophecy is from God alone. Therefore, it is
        unfitting to say that it is given to any but the best men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Plato says that it belongs to that which is best to produce what is
        best. But prophecy is more suitable in a good man than in a bad one.
        Therefore, since God is best, He will never give the gift of prophecy to
        evil men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. We find a likeness of the divine activity in the activity of nature.
        Hence, Dionysius compares3 the divine goodness to the light of the sun,
        because of the similarity of their effects. But natural activity gives
        more perfections to the things which are more disposed, as the more
        permeable bodies receive more light from the sun. Therefore, since the
        good man is more disposed to receive the gift of prophecy than the evil
        man, it seems that it should be given much more to good men than to evil
        men. But it is not given to all good men. Therefore, it should not be
        given to any evil man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Grace is given to elevate nature. But nature should be elevated more
        in good men than in evil men. Therefore, the grace of prophecy should be
        given to good men rather than to evil men. We conclude as before.

        2. In the Gospel of St. Matthew (7:22), this statement is put in the

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whoever does not have charity is evil. But prophecy can exist in one
        who does not have charity, as is clear from the first Epistle to the
        Corinthians (13:2)which says: “And if I should have knowledge and should
        know all mysteries... and have not charity... Therefore, prophecy can
        exist in a sinner.

        Man’s goodness consists in charity, through which he is united to God.
        Therefore, whatever can exist without charity, can be found
        indifferently in good men and in evil men. For the divine goodness is
        held in high esteem chiefly for this, that it uses both good and evil
        men to implement its designs. Therefore, it gives to both good and evil
        those gifts which do not have a necessary dependence on charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, prophecy does not have any necessary connection with charity for
        two reasons. First, because prophecy is in the understanding and charity
        is in the affections. But the understanding has priority over the
        affections, and, thus, prophecy and the other perfections of the
        understanding do not depend on charity. And for this reason faith,
        prophecy, knowledge, and everything else of this sort can exist in good
        men and in evil men.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second reason is that prophecy is given to a person for the profit
        of the Church and not for himself. But it does happen that someone who
        is not good in himself and united to God by charity can be of profit to
        the Church in some fashion. Thus, prophecy, the working of miracles,
        ecclesiastical ministries, and all the other things of this sort, which
        contribute to the benefit of the Church, are sometimes found apart from
        charity, which alone makes men good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, we must bear in mind that some of the sins by which charity is
        lost hinder the use of prophecy, and some do not. For, since sins of the
        flesh draw the mind entirely away from things spiritual, by the very
        fact that one is given to sins of the flesh he is rendered unfit for
        prophecy. For the mind must have supreme competence in things spiritual
        to have the revelation of prophecy. But spiritual sins do not to the
        same extent interfere with the mind’s competence in spiritual things.
        Therefore, it happens that one who is a slave to spiritual sins, but not
        to those of the flesh, or even to the endless cares of this life, which
        withdraw the mind from its spiritual competence, can be a prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And, therefore, Rabbi Moses says that entanglement in the pleasures and
        cares of this world is a sign that one is a false prophet. And this
        agrees with what we read in the Gospel of St. Matthew (7:15): “Beware of
        false prophets,” and a little later (7:16): “By their fruits you shall
        know them.” The Gloss on this passage reads that this must be understood
        of those sins “which are in plain sight,” and the foremost of these are
        the sins of the flesh, for spiritual sins lie hidden within.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Wisdom enters the soul in two ways. In one way, it so enters that the
        very wisdom of God dwells in the soul. This makes the man holy and a
        friend of God. In the other way, it enters only in its effects. In this
        way it does not have to make the man holy or a friend of God. It is in
        this second way that it enters the minds of the evil men whom it makes
        prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although prophecy is a gift of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is
        not given with the gift of prophecy, but only with the gift of charity.
        Hence, the reasoning does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. There is never an evil use of prophecy in the sense that the act
        itself of prophecy, in so far as it comes from prophecy, is evil. For,
        when someone directs the act of prophecy toward some evil end, the act
        itself of prophecy is good and comes from the Holy Spirit, but the
        direction of that act toward an improper end does not come from the Holy
        Spirit, but from the perverse will of man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Philosopher intends to say that those things which are given by
        God depend on the will of the giver, and this will cannot be
        unreasonable. Hence, if the foreknowledge of the future which takes
        place in dreams were from God, some discrimination would appear in its
        infusion. But there is no discrimination there, since such divination
        takes place in anybody, and this shows that divination of dreams comes
        from nature. But we find discrimination in the gift of prophecy, for it
        is not given to everybody, even though they have this or that
        disposition, but only to those whom the divine will chooses.
        Nevertheless, these are not apt subjects or the best subjects simply in
        themselves. They are, however, apt subjects in so far as they perform
        the function of the prophet to the extent which the divine wisdom judges
        to be fitting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That God is best appears in this, that He knows how to make good use
        not only of good men, but also of evil men. Hence, if he makes evil
        prophets perform the good functions of prophecy, this in no wise
        detracts from His supreme goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Not every good man is more fit to become a prophet than every sinner.
        For some who lack charity have minds more fit to perceive spiritual
        things, since they are free from carnal affections and wordly cares and
        are gifted with a natural clarity of understanding. And, on the other
        hand, some who have charity are occupied with worldly business, are busy
        begetting children, and do not have a naturally acute understanding.
        Therefore, because of these and similar conditions, the gift of prophecy
        sometimes is given to some evil men and denied to some good men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Through the grace of prophecy man’s nature receives an elevation
        ordained not directly to the participation of glory, but to the utility
        of others. However, in good men, nature rather receives an elevation
        ordained to the obtaining of glory from the grace which makes its
        recipient pleasing to God. Hence, the reasoning does not follow.

        1. The Gloss on Isaiah (38:1), “Take order with thy house,” says:
        “Prophets read in the book of the foreknowledge of God, in which all
        things are written.” But the book of the foreknowledge of God seems to
        be nothing else but the mirror of eternity, in which all the forms of
        things shine forth from eternity. Therefore, the prophets see in the
        mirror of eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that the prophets are not said to read in the book of
        foreknowledge or see in the mirror of eternity in a material sense, as
        if they saw the mirror or the book itself, but in a causal sense, for
        their knowledge of prophecy is derived from that book or mirror. On the
        contrary, the prophets are said to see in the mirror of eternity or in
        the book of foreknowledge in this sense, that a kind of privileged
        knowledge is attributed to these prophets. But no privilege of knowledge
        is signified by saying that some knowledge is derived from the eternal
        mirror or from the book of divine foreknowledge, since all human
        knowledge is derived from that source, as Dionysius clearly shows.
        Therefore, the prophets are not said to see in the mirror of eternity in
        the sense that they derive knowledge from it, but in the sense that when
        they see the mirror itself, they see other things in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Nothing can be seen except where it is. But future contingent things,
        according to the unchangeable truth with which they are seen by the
        prophets, exist only in the divine foreknowledge. Therefore, the
        prophets see them only in the foreknowledge of God. Thus, we reach the
        same conclusions as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 It was said that future contingent things are indeed in God as their
        source, but flow thence through certain species to the human mind, where
        they are seen by the prophet.—On the contrary, whatever is received in a
        thing exists there according to the manner of that which receives it and
        not according to its own manner. But the mind of the prophet is
        changeable. Therefore, future contingent things cannot be received in it
        in their unchanging truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That which is proper to the divine knowledge can be known only in
        God. But to know futures is proper to God, as is clear from Isaiah
        (41:23): “Shew the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall say
        that ye are gods.” Therefore, future contingent things can be seen by
        the prophets only in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Avicenna says that sometimes the mind of man is elevated so high that
        it is united to the world of foreknowledge.But the human mind has its
        highest elevation in the knowledge of prophecy. Therefore, it seems that
        it is so united to the world of foreknowledge that future things are
        seen in the very foreknowledge of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. As the philosophers tell us, the end of human life is the union of
        man’s mind with a higher world, which is the world of the intelligible
        substances. But it would hardly fit in with what we know if man did not
        reach his end. Therefore, at some time man’s mind will be united
        with.the intelligible substances, the highest of which is the divine
        essence, in which everything shines forth. Therefore, the prophet, who
        among men has the mind which receives the loftiest elevation, will have
        his mind united with the divine essence, which seems to be the mirror of
        eternity. The same conclusions follow as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If there should be two mirrors, one higher and the other lower, and
        the likenesses come into the lower from the higher, one who sees the
        species in the lower mirror is not said to see them in the higher,
        although his sight is in a way derived from the higher mirror. But the
        species of future things come into the mind of the prophet from the
        divine mind, as into a lower mirror from a higher mirror. Therefore, the
        fact that the prophet sees in his own mind species received from the
        divine mind does not force us to say that he sees them in the divine
        mind, but rather in his own mind. But his own mind is not the mirror of
        eternity, but a mirror dependent on time. Therefore, if the prophets see
        only in their own minds, as has just been said, we should not say that
        they see in the mirror of eternity, but in a mirror which is dependent
        on time, although derived from the eternal mirror.

        9. But it was said that someone is said to see not only in the thing
        illumined by the sun, but also in the sun itself, in so far as he sees
        by reason of the illumination of the sun.—On the contrary, the
        likenesses of visible things do not exist in the sun, yet this seems to
        pertain to the nature of a mirror. Therefore, it seems that to see
        something in the sun does not mean the same as to see it in a mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The sight by which we see God as the object of beatitude is more
        lofty than that by which we see Him as an intentional likeness of
        things, for the former makes one blessed, and the latter does not. But a
        man living in this life can be raised up to see God as the object of
        beatitude by a loftier elevation, namely, that by which the mind is
        altogether transported out of the senses, as happens in rapture.
        Therefore, the mind of a prophet can be raised up to see the divine
        essence as the intentional likeness of things by a lesser elevation
        without rapture. Thus, the prophet can see things in the mirror of
        eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The difference between the divine essence as considered in itself
        and as the likeness of something else, is greater than the difference
        between the divine essence as the likeness of one thing and as the
        likeness of another. For God is farther from any creature than one
        creature is from another. But one can see God in so far as He is the
        intentional likeness of one thing without seeing Him in so far as He is
        the likeness of something else. Otherwise, it would be necessary for all
        who saw God to know everything. Therefore, one can see God as the
        intentional likeness of some things without seeing His essence in
        itself. Therefore, those who do not see God through His essence can see
        in the mirror of eternity. And this seems especially to belong to the
        prophets.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Augustine says that the minds of some are elevated in such a manner
        that they look at the unchangeable intelligible natures in the highest
        citadel of all reality. But the minds of the prophets seem to have the
        most lofty elevation. Therefore, it seems that those things which they
        see prophetically they see in the very citadel of all reality, that is
        to say, in the divine essence. The same conclusion follows as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. A thing can be judged only by that which is superior to it, as is
        clear from Augustine. But the prophets judge about the unchangeable
        truths of reality. Therefore, it is not possible for them to judge of
        these things through anything transitory and changeable, but through the
        unchangeable truth, which is God Himself. Thus, we reach the same
        conclusion as before.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Gloss on the Gospel of St. Luke (10:24), “Many kings and
        prophets...” says” that the prophets and just men saw the glory of God
        from afar, through a mirror darkly. But one who sees in the eternal
        foreknowledge of God does not see darkly. Therefore, prophets did not
        see in the divine foreknowledge, which they call the mirror of eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Gregory says: “As long as we live in this mortal flesh, no one
        advances so far in the power of contemplation that he fixes the eyes of
        his mind on that incomprehensible beam of light. For we do not now see
        the omnipotent God in His brightness, but the soul does observe
        something beneath that brightness. Strengthened by this sight, it
        advances and later reaches the glory of His sight. It was thus that the
        prophet Isaiah (6:1), when he confessed that he had seen the Lord, said
        immediately: ‘I saw the Lord sitting...’ and added: ‘and the things
        beneath him filled the ternple,’ because, as has been said, when the
        mind advances in contemplation, it does not fix its gaze on what He is,
        but on that which is below Him.” From this it is clear that Isaiah and
        the other prophets did not see anything in the eternal mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. No evil man can see in the eternal mirror, for Isaiah (26:10) says,
        according to a variant reading: “Let the wicked man be carried away,
        lest he see the glory of God.” But some evil men are prophets.
        Therefore, prophetic vision does not take place in the eternal mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The prophets have distinct knowledge of the things which they see
        prophetically. But, since the eternal mirror is entirely uniform, it
        does not seem to be the kind of thing in which one could perceive many
        things separately. Therefore, there is no prophetic sight in the eternal
        mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We do not see something in a mirror which is in contact with the
        sense of sight, but in a mirror which is at a distance. But the mirror
        of eternity is in contact with the mind of the prophet, since God is in
        everything by His essence. Therefore, the mind of the prophet cannot see
        in the eternal mirror.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Properly speaking, a mirror exists only in material things. But in
        spiritual things something is called a mirror in a transferred sense,
        because of the likeness taken from the material mirror. Thus, in
        spiritual things we call that a mirror in which other things are
        represented, just as the forms of visible things appear in a material
        mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, some” say that the divine mind, in which all the intelligible
        characters of things shine forth, is a kind of mirror, and that it is
        called the mirror of eternity because it is eternal, inasmuch as it has
        eternity. Accordingly, they say that that mirror can be seen in two
        ways. It can be seen either through its essence, as the object of
        beatitude, and in this way it is seen only by those who have beatitude
        in its fullness or in some respect, as those in a rapture. Or it can be
        seen in so far as the likenesses of things are reflected in it, and in
        this way it is properly seen as a mirror. And they say that the mirror
        of eternity was seen in this way by the angels before they received
        beatitude, and by the prophets. But this opinion seems unreasonable on
        two scores.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, these intentional likenesses of things reflected in the divine
        mind are not really anything different from the divine essence itself.
        But the likenesses and intelligible natures of this sort are
        distinguished in it in so far as it is related differently to different
        creatures. Therefore, to know the divine essence and the intentional
        likenesses reflected in it is nothing else than to know the divine
        essence in itself and in relation to other things. But one knows
        something in itself before knowing it as related to something else.
        Hence, the vision by which God is seen as the intentional likeness of
        things presupposes that vision by which He Himself is seen as an
        essence, in so far as He is the object of beatitude. Thus, it is
        impossible for someone to see God as the species of things and not to
        see Him as the object of beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Second, the intentional likeness of one thing is found in another in two
        ways. In the first way, it is there as pre-existing before the thing of
        which it is the likeness, and, in the second, as arising from the thing
        itself. Accordingly, that in which the likenesses of things appear as
        existing before the things cannot properly be called a mirror, but,
        rather, an exemplar. But that in which likenesses of things are caused
        by the things themselves can be called a mirror.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, it has never been said by the saints that God is the mirror
        of things, because there are in God the intentional likenesses or
        intelligible natures of things, but that created things themselves are
        the mirror of God, according to the first Epistle to the Corinthians
        (13:12): “We see now through a glass in a dark manner.” And it is thus,
        too, that the Son is called the mirror of the Father, inasmuch as the
        species of Divinity is received in Him from the Father, according to
        Wisdom (7:2 6): “For she is the brightness of eternal light and the
        unspotted mirror of God’s majesty.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But when the Masters say that the prophets see in the mirror of
        eternity, we should not take this to mean that they see the eternal God
        Himself in so far as He is the mirror of things, but that they see
        something created, in which the eternity of God is portrayed. Thus, we
        understand that the mirror of eternity is not itself eternal, but
        represents eternity. For it belongs to God to have the same certain
        knowledge of the future as He has of the present, as Boethius says,
        because His sight is measured by eternity, in which everything is
        simultaneous. Hence, all times and all that take place in them are
        present to His sight at once.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, in so far as the knowledge of the future is reflected in
        the mind of the prophet from that divine sight by means of the prophetic
        light and through the species in which the prophet sees, those species
        together with the prophetic light are called the mirror of eternity,
        since they represent the divine sight in so far as in eternity it sees
        all future events as present.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, we must concede that the prophets see in the mirror of
        eternity, but not that they see the eternal mirror as the first set of
        difficulties seemed to show. Therefore, we must answer them in order.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The metaphor which says that the prophets read in the book of
        foreknowledge means that the book of divine foreknowledge is a source of
        the knowledge of the future in the mind of the prophet, just as reading
        a book is the source of knowledge in the mind of the reader of the
        things which are written in the book. It does not mean that the prophet
        sees the very foreknowledge of God as one who reads a material book sees
        the material book.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or we can say that the knowledge which is caused in the mind of the
        prophet is called the mirror of eternity, that is, something which
        represents eternity. Thus, it can be called the book of foreknowledge in
        a material sense, since the foreknowledge of God is to some extent
        copied in that knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although all knowledge is derived from the divine foreknowledge, not
        all knowledge represents it in such a way that its eternity makes us see
        even future things as present. Hence, not any knowledge can be called a
        mirror of eternity. But in this we see the privileged nature of the
        knowledge of the prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The intelligible natures of future contingent things exist according
        to unchangeable truth in the divine mind as in their source, but they
        flow thence to the mind of the prophet. Hence, in the revelation which
        he receives the prophet can have unchangeable knowledge of future
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A form which is received follows the manner of the receiver in some
        respects, in so far as it has existence in the subject. For it is there
        materially or immaterially, uniformly or variably, according to the
        requirements of the subject receiving it. But the form which is received
        does in some respects draw the subject to its own mode of being, in so
        far as, for instance, the excellences which belong to the nature of the
        form are communicated to the receiving subject. For in this way the
        subject is perfected and ennobled through the form. And in this way the
        corruptible body is made immortal by reason of the glory of immortality,
        and similarly, by the light of unchangeable truth the mind of the
        prophet is raised up to see changeable things in their unchangeable
        truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since knowledge of the future is proper to God, it therefore can be
        received only from God. Nevertheless, it is not necessary for everyone
        who learns the future from God to see God Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. According to that philosopher, the mind of the prophet is united to
        the world of the intelligences or foreknowledge, not in the sense that
        it sees these intelligences themselves, but in the sense that it shares
        in their foreknowledge from their illumination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. According to the faith, too, the end of human life is for man to be
        united with a higher world. But man reaches this end only in heaven, not
        in this life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Although the mirror in which the prophet sees is dependent on time,
        it represents the eternal foreknowledge of God. And in this sense he
        sees in the mirror of eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although the sun cannot be called the mirror of visible things,
        visible things can in some way be called the mirror of the sun, in so
        far as the brightness of the sun shines in them. Thus, too, the
        knowledge caused in the mind of the prophet is called the mirror of
        eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The sight by which God is seen as the intentional likeness of things
        is more peffect than that by which He is seen as the object of
        beatitude. For the latter presupposes the former and shows that it is
        more perfect. For one who can see the effects in the cause sees better
        than one who sees only the essence of the cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The relation by which God is referred to one creature does not
        presuppose the relation by which He is referred to another the way the
        relation by which He is referred to a creature presupposes the essence
        of God taken absolutely. Thus, the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. We should not apply Augustine’s words to the sight of the prophets,
        but to the vision of the saints in heaven, or of those who, in this
        life, see in the manner of heaven, as Paul did when enraptured (2 Cor.
        12:1-13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13 Prophets judge about the unchangeable truth of future events by means
        of uncreated truth, not because they see it, but because they are
        enlightened by it.

        We concede the reasons to the contrary in so far as they state that the
        prophets do not see the eternal God Himself, although they do see in the
        mirror of eternity, as we have said. But the last two arguments do not
        concludecorrectly, for, although there is complete uniformity in God,
        nevertheless, in Him things can be known distinctly inasmuch as He is
        the proper exemplar of each one. Similarly, although mirror is
        transferred from material to spiritual things, in this transfer we do
        not apply all the conditions of the material mirror, so that all of
        these conditions have to be found in the spiritual mirror. Rather, we
        take it only according to the act of representing.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Gloss on the first Epistle to the Corinthians (14:2): says that
        one is called prophet because of intellectual sight alone. But
        intellectual sight does not refer to things through likenesses of the
        things, but through their very essences, as is said in the same Gloss.
        Therefore, in prophetic sight no species are imprinted on the mind of
        the prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Our understanding abstracts from matter and material conditions. If,
        therefore, in the intellectual sight which constitutes prophecy some
        likenesses are produced, those likenesses will not be involved with
        matter or material conditions. Therefore, through them the prophet will
        not be able to know particular things, but only universals.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3 Prophets have in their minds some species of those things which are
        revealed to them. Thus, Jeremiah, who prophesied the burning of
        Jerusalem, had in his soul a species of that city received from sense,
        and, similarly, he had a species of fire burning, which he had
        frequently seen. If, then, other species of the same things are
        imprinted by God on the mind of the prophet, it follows that there would
        be in the same subject two forms with the same specific nature. But this
        is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The sight by which one sees the divine essence is more powerful than
        the sight by which one sees the species of anything else whatever. But
        the sight by which one sees the divine essence is not enough to acquire
        knowledge of all things whatever. Otherwise, those who saw the divine
        essence would see everything. Therefore, no matter what species are
        imprinted on the mind of the prophet, they will not be able to cause the
        prophet to know reality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It is not necessary for the divine action to produce in the prophet
        that which anyone can do of his own power. But through the power of
        imagination, which joins and divides the images received from things,
        anyone can form in his mind the species of anything whatever. Therefore,
        it is not necessary for the species of things to be impressed by God on
        the soul of the prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Nature works through the shortest way possible; much more so does
        God, whose works have even better order. But the shorter way is to bring
        the prophet to some knowledge of things by means of the species which
        are in his soul, rather than by other newly imprinted species.
        Therefore, it does not seem that any species are imprinted anew.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The gloss of Jerome on Amos(1:2) reads: “Prophets use likenesses of
        things with which they are familiar.”But this would not be so if their
        visions took place through newly imprinted species. Therefore, no new
        species, but only the prophetic light, is imprinted on the soul of the
        prophet.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It is not through light, but through a species of something visible,
        that sight receives the determination to know some definite visible
        object. Likewise, it is not through the light of the agent intellect,
        but through an intelligible species, that the possible intellect
        receives the determination to know intelligible objects. Therefore,
        since the knowledge of the prophet receives a determination to some
        things which he did not know before, it seems that the infusion of light
        without the impression of species is not sufficient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Dionysius says: “It is impossible for the divine radiance to shine on
        us unless it is shrouded with a variety of sacred veils.”But for him
        figures are veils. Therefore, intelligible light is showered on the
        prophet only with figurative likenesses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The infusion of light is uniform in all the prophets. But not all the
        prophets receive uniform knowledge, since some prophesy of the present,
        some of the past, and some of the future, as Gregory says. Therefore,
        there is not only the infusion of prophetic light but the impression of
        certain species by which the knowledge of the various prophets is
        distinguished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The prophet receives the prophetic revelation through internal speech
        made to him by God or by an angel. This is clear to anyone who looks at
        the writings of all the prophets. But all speech takes place through
        some signs. Therefore, prophetic revelation takes place through some
        likenesses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The sight of the imagination and of the understanding are higher than
        bodily sight. But when bodily sight takes place supernaturally, a new
        bodily species is shown to the eyes of the one who sees, as is evident
        in the case of the hand of one writing on the wall which appeared to
        Baltassar (Daniel 5:5). Therefore, it is much more necessary for new
        species to be imprinted on the sight of the imagination and the
        understanding when these take place supernaturally.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Prophecy is a kind of supernatural knowledge. But two things are
        required for knowledge: reception of the things known, and judgment of
        what is received, as we have said previously. Accordingly, knowledge is
        supernatural sometimes only in reception, sometimes only in judgment,
        and sometimes in both.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, one is not called a prophet if this knowledge is supernatural
        only in reception, just as Pharaoh, who supernaturally received a sign
        of abundance and famine under the figures of oxen and ears of corn
        (Genesis 41:25-36), was not called a prophet. But, if someone has
        supernatural judgment or judgment and reception together, he is called a
        prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, supernatural reception can take place only through the three kinds
        of sight: through <i>bodily sight</i>, when certain things are shown to
        the bodily eyes by the divine power, as the hand of one writing was
        shown to Baltassar (Daniel 5:5); through the
        <i>sight of imagination,</i> when by the divine power some figures of
        things appear to the prophets, as the boiling cauldron appeared to
        Jeremiah (1:13) and horses and mountains to Zacharias (6:1-6); and
        through <i>intellectual sight</i>, when something is shown to the
        understanding in a way which surpasses its natural capacity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, since the human understanding is in natural potency to all the
        intelligible forms of sensible things, no matter what intelligible
        species arise in the understanding, there will be no supernatural
        reception; as there was supernatural reception in bodily vision when it
        saw things which were not formed naturally, but only by the divine power
        in order to reveal something. Similarly, there was supernatural
        reception in the sight of imagination when it saw some likenesses not
        received from the senses, but fashioned through some force of the soul.
        But our understanding receives supernaturally only when it sees through
        their essence the intelligible substances themselves, such as God and
        the angels. For it cannot reach this by virtue of its nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the last of these three supernatural receptions surpasses the mode
        of prophecy. Hence, we read in Numbers (12:6-8): “If there be among you
        a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak
        to him in a dream. But it is not so with my servant Moses... and
        plainly, and not in riddles and figures doth he see the Lord.” But to
        see God in His essence, as He is seen in rapture or by the blessed, or
        to see other intelligible substances through their essence, surpasses
        the mode of prophetic sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the first supernatural reception, which takes place through bodily
        sight, is lower than prophetic reception. For in this reception the
        prophet is not given preference over anyone else, since all can equally
        see a species which God fashions for sight. Therefore, the supernatural
        reception which is proper to prophecy is the reception of the sight of
        imagination. Thus, every prophet has either only supernatural judgment
        of those things which are seen by another, as Joseph did about the
        things which Pharaoh saw (Genesis 41:25-36), or reception through the
        sight of imagination together with judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, supernatural judgment is given to the prophet through the
        light infused in him which gives his understanding strength to judge.
        For this no species are required, but for reception there must be a new
        formation of species, whether to produce in the mind of the prophet
        species which were not there previously, as the species of colors might
        be imprinted on one born blind, or by the divine power to set in order
        and join the pre-existing species in a way which is capable of
        signifying the things which should be shown to the prophet. We must
        concede that revelation is made to the prophet in this way not only
        through the light, but also through species; but sometimes it is
        according to the light alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although only he who has intellectual sight is called a prophet, yet,
        not only intellectual light pertains to prophecy, but also the sight of
        imagination, in which suitable species can be formed to represent
        singular things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The solution to the second difficulty is clear from the first
        response.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The prophet does not need a new infusion of the species of those
        things which he has seen, but only an orderly grouping of the species
        retained in the storehouse of the imaginative power, which can suitably
        designate the thing to be prophesied.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The divine essence, in so far as it exists in itself, represents all
        things whatsoever more explicitly than any species or figure does. But,
        since the sight of the one who looks at it is overcome by the loftiness
        of that essence, the one who sees the essence does not see all that it
        represents. But the species imprinted on the imagination are
        proportioned to us; hence, from them we can come to knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. just as one who receives knowledge from signs reaches the things
        themselves by way of the signs, so, conversely, one who uses signs to
        express something must know the thing represented before he can form the
        symbol. For one cannot use fitting signs for things which he does not
        know. Therefore, although any man can by his natural power form any
        images whatever, only one who knows the future events to be symbolized
        can form figures to represent them properly. This formation of images in
        the sight of imagination takes place supernaturally in the prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The species pre-existing in the imaginative power of the prophet, in
        so far as they exist there, are not capable of signifying future things.
        Therefore, they must be reshaped into something else by the divine
        power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The species pre-existing in the imagination of the prophet are, as it
        were, the elements of that sight of imagination which is revealed by the
        divine power, since it is somehow made up of them. Thus it is that the
        prophet uses the likenesses of things with which he is familiar.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, since prophetic revelation does not always take place through
        species, as has been said, we must answer the arguments given to the
        contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although the knowledge of the prophet receives no determination to
        some particular thing from the intellectual light when he receives
        supernatural judgment alone, his knowledge does receive its
        determination from species seen by someone else, as Joseph’s knowledge
        received its determination from the species seen by Pharaoh, or from any
        species seen by Joseph himself without supernatural aid.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. When the rays of divine light shine on the prophet, they are always
        veiled in figures, not in the sense that species are always infused, but
        that these rays are always combined with the pre-existing species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The revelation which the prophets receive is also differentiated by
        reason of the intellectual light, which some perceive more fully than
        others, and by reason of the species, which either exist beforehand or
        are received anew by the prophet himself or by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As Gregory says: “God speaks to the angels by the very act by which
        He shows His invisible secrets to their hearts,” and he adds that He
        speaks to holy souls by infusing certainty in them. Thus, in speech with
        which God is said to have spoken to the prophets in Holy Scripture, we
        consider not only the species of things which are imprinted, but also
        the light which is given, by which the mind of the prophet is made
        certain of something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since the sight of understanding and imagination are higher than
        bodily sight, through them we know not only things which are present,
        but even things which are absent, whereas with bodily sight we perceive
        only things which are present. Therefore, the species of things are
        stored in the imagination and the understanding, but not in the senses.
        Consequently, for bodily sight to be supernatural new bodily species
        must always be formed. But this is not needed for the sight of
        imagination or understanding to be supernatural.

        It seems that it does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, the minds of some are so elevated that they do not
        see the unchangeable natures through an angel, but in the highest
        citadel of reality itself. But this seems especially to belong to the
        prophets. Therefore, their revelation does not take place through the
        mediation of an angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The gifts of the Holy Spirit and the infused habits come directly
        from God. But prophecy is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as is clear from
        the first Epistle to the Corinthians (12:10). It is also a kind of
        infused light. Therefore, it is from God without the mediation of an
        angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The prophecy which proceeds from a created power is natural prophecy,
        as has been said. But an angel is a creature. Therefore, prophecy which
        is not natural but the gift of the Holy Spirit is not produced through
        the mediation of an angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Prophecy takes place through the infusion of light and the imprinting
        of species. But it seems that neither of these can take place through an
        angel. For the angel would have to be the creator either of the light or
        of the species, since these cannot be made from anything pre-existing.
        Therefore, prophetic sight does not take place through the mediation of
        an angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In the definition of prophecy we read that prophecy is a divine
        revelation or inspiration. But, if it took place through the mediation
        of an angel, it would be called angelic and not divine. Therefore,
        itdoes not take place through the mediation of angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Wisdom (7:27) says that the divine wisdom, “through nations conveyeth
        herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.”
        Therefore, one is made a prophet directly by God Himself, and not
        through an angel.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Moses seems to have been higher than the other prophets, as is clear
        in Numbers (11:16-17,25; 12:3,-8) and Deuteronomy (34:10). But God made
        the revelation to Moses through the mediation of angels. Hence, it is
        said in Galatians (3:19): “(the law) being ordained by angels in the
        hand of a mediator:” and in Acts (7:3 8) Stephen said of Moses: “This is
        he that was in the Church in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to
        him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers.” Therefore, the other prophets
        with much greater reason received their revelation through the mediation
        of an angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        21. Dionysius says: “Our glorious fathers received divine visions
        through the mediation of the celestial powers.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Augustine says that all appearances made to the fathers in the Old
        Testament took place through the ministration of the angels.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Two things concur in effecting prophetic revelation: the illumination of
        the mind and the formation of the species in the imaginative power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the prophetic light itself, by which the mind of the prophet
        is enlightened, comes from God as its primary source. Nevertheless, the
        human mind is strengthened and to some extent prepared for its proper
        reception by the angelic light. For, since the power of the divine light
        is most simple and most universal, there is no proportion between it and
        reception of it by the human soul in this life, unless it is limited and
        specified through union with the angelic light, which is narrower, in
        scope and more commensurate with the human mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the formation of the species in the imaginative power must be
        attributed properly to the angels, since the whole of bodily creation is
        under the direction of the spiritual creation, as Augustine proves. Now,
        the imaginative power uses a bodily organ; hence, the formation of
        species in the imaginative power is part of the work proper to the
        angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As has been said earlier, Augustine’s words are to be taken as
        referring to the vision of heaven or to the sight of rapture, but not to
        prophetic sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Prophecy is numbered among the gifts of the Holy Spirit by reason of
        the prophetic light, which, it is true, is directly infused by God.
        Still, the ministration of the angels assists in its proper reception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That which a creature performs by its own power is in some way
        natural, but that which a creature performs not of its own power, but in
        so far as it is moved by God or is an instrument of the divine activity,
        is supernatural. Hence, the prophecy which takes its origin from an
        angel according to the natural knowledge of the angel is natural
        prophecy. But that which takes its origin from an angel in so far as the
        angel receives revelation from God is supernatural prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. An angel does not create light in the human understanding or species
        in the imaginative power. But God uses the activity of the angel to
        strengthen the natural light in the human understanding. In this way an
        angel is said to illuminate man. Also, since an angel has the power to
        move the organ of phantasy, it can fashion the sight of imagination in
        the way which befits prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Activity is not attributed to the instrument, but to the principal
        agent, as a bench is not called the effect of the saw, but of the
        carpenter. Similarly, since an angel is the cause of prophetic
        revelation only as a divine instrument using the revelation received
        from God, the prophecy should not be called angelic, but divine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The divine wisdom, in transferring itself to the soul, brings about
        some effects without the mediation of the ministration of the angels, as
        the infusion of grace, through which one is made a friend of God. But
        nothing hinders it from bringing about some other effects through the
        mediation of the aforesaid ministration. And, transferring itself to
        holy souls in this way, it makes prophets through the mediation of an
        angel.

        It seems that he does, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Numbers (12:6) says: “If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I
        will appear in a vision or I will speak to him in a dream.” But as the
        Gloss says, prophecy takes place “through dreams and visions” when it
        takes place “through those things which seem to be said or done.” But
        when there is an appearance of those things which seem to be said or
        done and they are not actually said or done, a man is transported out of
        his senses. Therefore, the sight of prophecy is always in a prophet who
        is transported out of his senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. When one power is applied intensely to its activity, another power
        must be withdrawn from its activity. But in the sight of prophecy the
        interior powers, that is, the intellect and the imagination, are
        intensely applied to their activities, since prophetic sight is the most
        perfect thing which they can reach in this life. Therefore, in prophetic
        sight the prophet is always withdrawn from the activity of the exterior
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Intellectual sight is more noble than the sight of imagination, and
        this latter is more noble than bodily sight. But combination with that
        which is less noble detracts somewhat from the perfection of the more
        noble. Therefore, intellectual sight and the sight of imagination are
        more perfect when they are not combined with bodily sight. Therefore,
        since they reach their highest perfection in this life in prophetic
        sight, it seems that they are not at all combined with bodily sight in
        such a way that the prophet would make use of bodily sight together with
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The senses are more remote from the understanding and the imagination
        than lower reason is from higher reason. But the consideration of higher
        reason, by which one devotes himself to the contemplation of eternal
        things, withdraws man from the consideration of lower reason, by which
        man employs himself in things temporal. With much more reason does the
        prophetic sight of the understanding and the imagination withdraw man
        from bodily sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. One and the same power cannot apply itself to many things
        simultaneously. But, when one is using his bodily senses, his
        understanding and imagination are occupied with those things which are
        seen bodily. Therefore, one cannot at the same time occupy himself with
        this and with those things which appear in prophetic sight apart from
        the senses of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The first Epistle to the Corinthians (14:32) says: “The spirits of
        the prophets are subject to the prophets.” But this would not be so if
        the prophet lost sense-consciousness, for then he would not have control
        over himself. Therefore, prophecy does not take place in a man who has
        lost sense-consciousness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Through the sight of prophecy one receives certain and inerrant
        knowledge of things. But in those who are transported out of their
        senses, either in a dream, or in some other way, the knowledge is mixed
        with error and is uncertain. For they hold fast to likenesses of things
        as if they were the things themselves, as Augustine says. Therefore,
        prophecy does not take place when one loses sense-consciousness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If we posit this, we seem to fall into the error of Montanus, who
        said that the prophets spoke as insane people who did not know what they
        were saying.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As the Gloss says, prophecy sometimes takes place through words and
        deeds: “Through deeds, as the ark of Noe signified the Church, and
        through words, as those which the angels spoke to Abraham.” But it is
        clear that Noe, when building the ark, and Abraham, when conversing with
        angels and serving them, were not transported out of their senses.
        Therefore, prophecy does not always take place through transport out of
        the senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Prophecy has two acts: one is principal, namely, sight, and the other is
        secondary, namely, announcing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The prophet does the announcing either by words or even by deeds, as is
        clear in Jeremiah (13:5), inasmuch as he put his girdle near the river
        to rot. But in whichever of the two ways the prophetic announcing is
        made, it is always made by a man not transported out of his senses, for
        such an announcing takes place through certain sensible signs. Hence,
        the prophet doing the announcing has to use his senses for his
        announcement to be perfect. Otherwise, he would make the announcement
        like an insane person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But in the sight of prophecy two things concur, as we have said earlier,
        namely, judgment and the proper reception of the prophecy. Now, when the
        prophet is divinely inspired, so that only his judgment is supernatural,
        and not his reception, such inspiration does not require transport out
        of the senses, for the judgment of the understanding is more perfect
        according to its nature in one who has the use of his senses than in one
        who does not have the use of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the supernatural reception proper to prophecy is in the sight of
        imagination, and in order to see this vision human power is enraptured
        by some spirit and transported out of the senses, as Augustine says. The
        reason for this is that the power of imagination is mainly intent on the
        things which are received through the senses, as long as one uses his
        senses. Hence, its primary attention can be transferred to those things
        which are received from another source only when the man is transported
        out of his senses. Hence, whenever prophecy takes place according to the
        sight of imagination, the prophet must be transported out of his senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this transport happens in two ways. In one it is from some cause in
        the soul, and in the other, from a physical cause. It comes from a
        physical cause when the external senses become dull either because of
        sickness or because of the vapors occurring in sleep, which ascend to
        the brain and deaden the organ of touch. It comes from a cause in the
        soul when a man, from too much attention to the objects of the
        understanding or the imagination, is altogether abstracted from the
        external senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, transport from the bodily senses never takes place in a prophet
        through sickness, as happens in epileptics and those who are mad, but
        only through a properly disposed physical cause, as through sleep.
        Therefore, prophecy which takes place with the sight of imagination
        always comes either in a dream, when one is deprived of
        sense-consciousness through a properly disposed physical cause, or in a
        vision, when the transport comes from some cause in the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, between the prophet in his transport out of the senses,
        whether it be through a dream or through a vision, and all others who
        are carried out of their senses, there is this difference, that the mind
        of the prophet is enlightened about those things which are seen in the
        sight of imagination. Consequently, he knows that they are not things,
        but in some way, the likenesses of things about which his judgment is
        certain because of the light of the mind. Therefore, it is clear from
        this that the inspiration of prophecy takes place sometimes with
        transport out of the senses and sometimes without it. Hence, we must
        answer both sets of difficulties.

        1. In those words our Lord wanted to show the pre-eminence of Moses over
        the other prophets in supernatural reception. For Moses was raised to
        the sight of the very essence of God in itself. But everything which the
        prophets have received they have received only in the likenesses
        belonging to dreams or visions. Nevertheless, the judgment of the
        prophet is not by means of the likenesses belonging to dreams or
        visions. Hence judgment of prophecy takes place without transport out of
        the senses.

        2.When an interior power applies itself to the sight of its object, if
        there is perfect attention, it is cut off from exterior sight. But no
        matter how perfect the judgment of the interior power is, it does not
        withdraw from exterior activity, for it is the duty of the internal
        power to judge of the external. Hence, the judgment of that which is
        higher is ordained to the same thing as the exterior activity.
        Therefore, they do not hinder each other.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. This argument follows for the sight of the intellect and the
        imagination according to reception, but not according to judgment, as
        has been said.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The powers of the soul hinder each other in their operations because
        they are rooted in the one essence of the soul. Hence, the closer the
        powers are to each other, the more they naturally hinder each other if
        they are directed toward different objects. Hence, the argument does not
        follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. This argument follows for supernatural reception of the imaginative
        or intellectual power, but not for judgment.

        1. The Apostle is speaking of the announcing of prophecy, for it is in
        the power of free choice to announce or not to announce those things
        about which he is inspired. However, as concerns the revelation, the
        prophet himself is subject to the spirit, for the revelation does not
        take place as the prophet wishes, but as the revealing spirit wishes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is from the light of prophecy that the mind of the prophet is so
        enlightened that even in the transport out of his senses he has a true
        judgment about those things which he sees in the dream or vision.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Montanus erred on two points. First, he took away from the prophets
        the light of mind by which they have true judgment about the things
        which they have seen. Second, he said that, when they were announcing,
        they were carried out of their senses, as happens with those who are
        mad, or with those who talk in their sleep. But this does not follow
        from the above position.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The fact that prophecy is said to take place through words or deeds
        is to be referred more to the announcing of prophecy than to prophetic
        sight.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. When the Gloss divides prophecy, it says: “One type of prophecy
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        cy is according to foreknowledge, and this must be fulfilled in every
        way according to the meaning of the words. ‘Behold a virgin shall
        conceive’ (Isaiah 7:14) belongs to this type. The other kind of prophecy
        is a threat, as: ‘Yet forty days, and Ninive shall be destroyed’ (Jonas
        3:4). This is not fulfilled in the superficial meaning of the words, but
        in the meaning of a tacit construction put on the words.” Therefore, it
        seems that the third division which Jerome made of prophecy of
        predestination is superfluous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That which is a property of all prophecy should not be set down as a
        member dividing prophecy. But to be according to divine foreknowledge is
        a property of all prophecy, for, as the Gloss reads: “The prophets read
        in the book of foreknowledge.” Therefore, prophecy according to
        foreknowledge should not be set down as a division of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Since foreknowledge is a more general term than predestination,
        inasmuch as it is part of its definition, foreknowledge can be divided
        from predestination only with reference to those things in which the
        extension of foreknowledge is greater than that of predestination. But
        it is with respect to evil things that the extension of foreknowledge is
        greater than that of predestination, for there is foreknowledge of these
        and not predestination. But there is both foreknowledge and
        predestination of good things. Therefore, when there is said to be one
        prophecy of predestination and another of foreknowledge, this means that
        one concerns good acts and the other evil. But as far as dependence on
        free will is concerned, there is no difference between good and evil.
        Therefore, there is no difference at all between these two kinds of
        prophecy which Jerome distinguishes when he says: “The prophecy of
        predestination is that which is fulfilled without our free choice, but
        the prophecy of foreknowledge is that in which our free choice is
        involved.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As Augustine says, predestination concerns goods connected with
        salvation. But our merits, also, which depend on free choice, are
        numbered among these goods. Therefore, our free choice is involved in
        prophecy of predestination. Thus, Jerome made a poor division.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Only three things can be considered in prophecy: that from whom it
        is, that in which it is, and that about which it is. But there is no
        distinction in that from whom it is, for all prophecy is from one
        source, the Holy Spirit. Nor is there any difference in that in which it
        is, for the human spirit is the subject of prophecy. And those things
        which prophecy concerns are only good and evil things. Therefore,
        prophecy should be divided only into a division with two members.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Jerome says6 that the prophecy, “Behold a virgin shall conceive”
        (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew1:23), is a prophecy of predestination. But, for
        the fulfillment of that prophecy, free choice played a part in the
        assent of the Blessed Virgin. Therefore, the prophecy of predestination
        has free will involved in it, and, thus, it does not differ from the
        prophecy of foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Every declaration about something future which we do not know will
        exist, is either false or doubtful to the one making the declaration.
        But through the prophecy containing a threat one predicts that something
        will exist, as for example, the destruction of some city. Since this
        declaration is neither false nor doubtful because there is neither
        falsity nor doubt in the Holy Spirit, who is the author of the prophecy,
        this has to be foreknown at least by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the
        prophecy containing a threat is not distinct from the prophecy of
        foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. When something is predicted according to the prophecy containing a
        threat, the prediction should be interpreted conditionally or
        unconditionally. If conditionally, it is not said to belong to prophecy,
        which consists in a kind of supernatural knowledge, for even natural
        reason can know that some things will happen if certain conditions are
        fulfilled. Therefore, it must be interpreted unconditionally.
        Accordingly, either the prophecy is false, or the outcome is as
        predicted. And this must be known beforehand by God. Therefore, prophecy
        containing a threat should not be distinguished from the prophecy of
        foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. In Jeremiah (17:18, 24-27) there is a similar rule for the
        fulfillment of divine promises and threats, for the threats are recalled
        when the nation against whom the threat was made repents of its sins,
        and similarly the promise ceases when the nation to whom it was made
        leaves the path of justice. Therefore, just as one makes the prophecy
        containing a threat a division of prophecy, he ought to make the
        prophecy containing a promise a fourth division.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Isaiah (38:1) spoke prophetically to Ezechias: “Take order with thy
        house, for thou shalt die...” This is not a prophecy of predestination,
        for that kind must be fulfilled in every way even apart from our free
        choice. Again, it is not a prophecy of foreknowledge because God did not
        have foreknowledge of this future event, otherwise there would have been
        falsity in His foreknowledge. Similarly, it does not belong to prophecy
        containing a threat, since the event was predicted unconditionally.
        Therefore, there must be a fourth class of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. It was said that this was predicted to happen according to the lower
        causes, and thus was a prophecy containing a threat.—On the contrary, by
        the art of medicine man can know the lower causes of the death of a sick
        man. Therefore, if Isaiah predicted this only according to lower causes,
        either he did not predict it prophetically, or prophetic prediction does
        not differ from the prediction of a doctor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Every prophecy deals with things either by viewing the higher causes
        or by viewing the lower causes. If we take the previously mentioned
        prophecy as conditional, since it is according to some causes, namely,
        lower causes, there is equal reason to say that all prophecy is
        conditional. Thus, all prophecy will have the same character as the
        prophecy containing a threat.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Although the prophecy of threatening is not fulfilled “in the
        superficial meaning of the words, nevertheless it is fulfilled in the
        meaning of the tacit construction put on the words,” as Cassiodorus
        says..Thus, Jonas’ words, “Niniveh shall be destroyed” (Jonas 3:4), were
        fulfilled according to Augustine, for, “although the walls of Niniveh
        remained standing, its evil ways were wiped out.” But the fulfillment of
        prophecy, not according to the exterior superficial meaning of the
        words, but according to their spiritual sense, takes place in the
        prophecy of predestination and of foreknowledge. We see this in Isaiah
        (54:11) “I will lay thy foundations with sapphires, Jerusalem,” and in
        Daniel (2:45): “the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and
        broke in pieces the statue,” and in many other similar passages.
        Therefore, prophecy containing a threat should not be distinguished from
        the prophecy of foreknowledge and predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. If likenesses of future things are shown to someone, he still is not
        called a prophet unless he understands the things signified through
        these likenesses. Thus, Pharaoh was not called a prophet when he saw the
        ears of corn and the cattle, “for there is need of understanding in a
        vision,” as Daniel (10:1) says. But those through whom the divine
        threats are made understand what they declare only according to the
        superficial meaning of the words, for they are not enlightened about the
        things which are signified through the words. This is clear in the case
        of Jonas, who understood that Ninive was to be overturned materially.
        Hence, he grieved as though his prophecy were not fulfilled when the
        city was not overturned but mended its ways. Therefore, one should not
        on this account be called a prophet, and, thus, threatening should not
        be made a species of prophecy. Hence, the distinction previously
        mentioned seems no distinction at all.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Prophecy is derived from the divine foreknowledge, as has been said
        above. But we must bear in mind that God knows futures differently from
        all others who have foreknowledge of them. For there are two things to
        consider in the knowledge of the future: the order of the causes to the
        future effects and the outcome or execution of this order in the actual
        procession of the effects from their causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, no matter what created power has some knowledge of the
        future, its knowledge reaches only the order of the causes. Thus, a
        doctor is said to foreknow future death in so far as he knows that
        natural principles have an ordination to death. And a meteorologist is
        said to foresee future rains and winds in the same way. Hence, if these
        causes are such that their effects can be impeded, the event which is
        thus foreseen to happen does not always come to pass.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But God knows the future not only by reason of the order of the causes,
        but also in the very outcome or execution of that order. The reason for
        this is that His vision is measured by eternity, which comprehends all
        times in one indivisible present. Thus, in one simple glance He sees
        that to which the causes are ordered and how that order is fulfilled or
        obstructed. But this is impossible for a creature whose gaze is limited
        to a determined time. Hence, He knows those things which exist at that
        time. And at the time when futures are still future they exist only in
        the order of their causes, and hence, we can know them only in this way.
        Consequently, it is clear to all who consider it correctly that when we
        are said to foresee the future we have knowledge more of present things
        than of the future. And, so, it remains proper to God alone to have true
        foreknowledge of future events.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, prophecy is derived from divine foreknowledge sometimes by
        reason of the order of the causes and sometimes by reason of the
        execution or fulfillment of that order. Therefore, when prophetic
        revelation concerns only the order of the causes, it is called prophecy
        containing a threat. For, then, all that is revealed to the prophet is
        that according to the things which now exist such a person is ordained
        to this or that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fulfillment of the order, however, takes place in two ways.
        Sometimes it comes from the activity of the divine power alone, as the
        resuscitation of Lazarus, the conception of Christ, and things of this
        sort. And the prophecy of predestination follows this divine activity,
        for, as Damascene says: “Those things which God predestines are not in
        our power.” Hence, predestination is called a kind of preparatory action
        on the part of God. Now, preparatory action concerns that which one will
        do himself and not what someone else will do.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some things, however, are brought to completion by the operation of
        other causes, whether natural or voluntary. These things, in so far as
        they are accomplished through other causes, are not predestined, but
        they are nevertheless foreknown. Hence, prophecy of these things is said
        to be according to foreknowledge. However, since prophecy takes place
        for the sake of men, the prophecy of foreknowledge especially concerns
        those things which men do by their free will. For this reason Jerome
        puts aside other created causes and makes mention only of free will when
        referring to the prophecy of foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The threefold division which Jerome makes is reduced to a twofold
        division, as has been said, because one division looks to the order of
        causes and the other to the outcome of that order. This is the division
        which Cassiodorus held. But Jerome subdivided the second member; thus,
        Cassiodorus gave two members of the division and Jerome three.
        Cassiodorus also took foreknowledge in its generality, for it refers to
        all existing things, whether they come about through created or
        uncreated power. But Jerome took foreknowledge with a certain
        restriction, inasmuch as it concerns only those things about which there
        is no predestination by reason of themselves, that is to say, those
        things which come to pass by created power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Every prophecy has divine foreknowledge as its root. But, since there
        is knowledge of the order and the outcome in divine foreknowledge, one
        kind of prophecy is derived from the one of these and one from the
        other. However, the foreknowledge of God is properly called
        foreknowledge in so far as it looks to an outcome which is future. For
        the order to the outcome is in the present; hence, of it there is
        knowledge rather than foreknowledge. Thus, not that prophecy which looks
        to the order, but only that which deals with the outcome, is said to
        take place according to foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Foreknowledge is taken here in contrast with predestination in so far
        as foreknowledge has a broader extension than predestination. Now,
        foreknowledge has a broader extension than predestination not only in
        evil things, if predestination be taken strictly, but also in all good
        things which do not take place exclusively by the divine power. Hence,
        the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Our merit is from grace and from free will. However, it belongs to
        predestination only in so far as it comes from grace, which is from God
        alone. Hence, that which is from our free will is said to belong to
        predestination for some extrinsic reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Here, prophecy is distinguished according to the things of which it
        treats. This is not according to good and evil, for differences of this
        sort are related by some extrinsic reason to the future thing which is
        known through prophecy, but rather according to that which concerns the
        order or the outcome of the order, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The consent of the Blessed Virgin intervened in the conception of
        Christ as something which removed a hindrance and not as an operative
        cause. For it was not fitting that so great a benefit be given to one
        who was unwilling.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. We can say that something will exist not only from the fact that it
        will exist in this way, but also from the fact that it is so ordained in
        its causes that it will thus exist. For it is in this way that a doctor
        says: “That man will be cured or will die.” And, if the event prove
        otherwise, he does not speak falsely. For at that time this was about to
        take place from the order of the causes, although it was possible for
        this to be impeded. Then, that which beforehand was going to take place
        in the event will not take place. For this reason the Philosopher says:
        “One who is about to enter will not enter.” And according to this the
        threat of the prophet is neither false nor doubtful, although what he
        has predicted does not come to pass.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If the prophecy containing a threat is referred to the ordination of
        causes to which it directly looks, it is consequently free from all
        condition. For it is absolutely true that it is so ordained in the
        causes that this happen. But, if it is referred to the event to which it
        looks indirectly, it must be understood under this condition: if the
        cause acts. Nevertheless, it is supernatural, because we cannot know by
        natural knowledge that precisely such or such a punishment is deserved
        according to divine justice, even if the cause does exist, namely, if
        the wickedness remain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. We take the prophecy containing a promise as belonging to the
        prophecy containing a threat because both have the same intelligible
        nature. However, this nature is better expressed in prophecy containing
        a threat, because threats are more frequently revoked than promises, for
        God is more inclined to be merciful than to punish.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. That prophecy was a prophecy containing a threat, and although the
        condition was not stated explicitly, that threat should be interpreted
        under the implicit condition: if such an order of things continues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Lower causes include not only natural causes, which doctors can know
        beforehand, but also meritorious causes, which are known from divine
        revelation alone. Likewise, the natural causes of health or death can be
        known much more perfectly by divine revelation than by human ingenuity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Higher causes, which are the intelligible natures of things
        [represented] in the divine foreknowledge, never fail of fulfillment of
        their effects, as lower causes do. Therefore, the outcomes of things are
        known absolutely in the higher causes, but only conditionally in lower
        causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Although in the prophecy of predestination and of foreknowledge the
        truth to be fulfilled is presented under some likenesses, no literal
        sense is understood by reason of those likenesses, but the literal sense
        is grasped according to those things which are signified through the
        likenesses, as happens in all metaphorical expressions. Hence, in such
        prophecies we find no truth in the likenesses, but only in those things
        which are declared through the likenesses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, in the prophecy containing a threat, the literal sense of the words
        of the prophet is considered according to those likenesses of the things
        which will come to pass, because those likenesses are not given only as
        likenesses but as things. Hence, that which will come to pass and is
        represented through likenesses of this sort does not belong to the
        literal sense, but to the mystical sense. Thus, when it is said that
        Ninive will be destroyed, material destruction belongs to the literal
        sense, but destruction of evil ways belongs to the moral sense. By
        reason of the order of causes we see some truth in the literal sense
        itself, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The ears of corn and the cattle were not shown in Pharaoh’s dream as
        things, but only as likenesses. Therefore, Pharaoh, who saw only those
        likenesses, had no understanding of any thing and for this reason was
        not a prophet. But Jonas, to whom it was said: “Ninive shall be
        destroyed,” had some understanding of a thing, namely, of the ordination
        of merits to destruction, even though, perhaps, he had no foreknowledge
        of the other thing, namely, the conversion. Thus, he was not a prophet
        in that which he did not understand. Nevertheless, Jonas and the
        prophets who threatened knew that the prophecy they foretold was not a
        prophecy according to foreknowledge, but according to threat. Hence, it
        is said in Jonas (4:2): “Therefore I went before to flee into Tharsis:
        for I know that thou art a gracious and merciful God.”

        It seems that there is not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Since unchangeable truth is put in the definition of prophecy, if it
        belongs to prophecy at all, it must belong to it for some intrinsic
        reason. But future contingent things, about which we have prophecy, are
        not unchangeable for any intrinsic reason, but only in so far as they
        are referred to the divine foreknowledge, as Boethius says. Therefore,
        unchangeable truth should not be attributed to prophecy as part of its
        definition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That which is fulfilled only if some changeable condition exists does
        not have unchangeable truth. But there is a prophecy, that containing a
        threat, which is fulfilled only if there exists a changeable condition,
        namely, persistence in justice or wickedness, as we see this in Jeremiah
        (18:8). Therefore, not all prophecy possesses unchangeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The Gloss on Isaiah (38:1) reads: “God reveals His sentence
        (<i>sententia</i>) but not His chosen plan (<i>consilium</i>) to the
        prophets.” But His sentence is changeable, as is said in the same place.
        Therefore, prophecy does not possess unchangeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If prophecy contains unchangeable truth, this happens because of the
        prophet who sees it, or because of the thing which is seen, or because
        of the eternal mirror by reason of which it is seen. But its source is
        none of these. Not the seer, for human knowledge is changeable. Not the
        thing which is seen, for that is contingent. Finally, not the divine
        foreknowledge or mirror, for this does not impose necessity on things.
        Therefore, prophecy in no way contains unchangeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said that divine foreknowledge does not impose a necessity
        which makes it impossible for the outcome to be different, but
        nevertheless the outcome which was foreknown will not be different, and
        that in this way prophecy contains unchangeable truth. For, according to
        the Philosopher, that is called unchangeable which cannot be changed, or
        is changed with difficulty, or simply does not change.—On the contrary,
        granted the occurrence of what is possible, nothing impossible follows.
        If, therefore, that which is foreknown and prophesied can vary, then, if
        we assume that it does vary, nothing impossible follows. But it does
        follow that prophecy possesses changeable truth. Therefore, prophecy
        does not necessarily contain unchangeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The truth of a proposition follows the condition of the thing, for:
        “A statement is true or false as the thing is or is not,” as the
        Philosopher says. But the things about which there is prophecy are
        contingent and changeable. Therefore, the prophetic statement contains
        changeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. An effect is called necessary or contingent from the proximate cause,
        not from the first cause. But the proximate causes of the things of
        which we have prophecy are changeable causes, although the first cause
        is unchangeable. Therefore, prophecy does not possess unchangeable, but
        changeable, truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If prophecy possesses unchangeable truth, it is impossible for
        something to be prophesied and not happen. But it is impossible for what
        has been prophesied not to have been prophesied. Therefore, if prophecy
        has unchangeable truth, that which has been prophesied must necessarily
        happen. Thus, prophecy will not concern future contingent things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        l. The Gloss says: “Prophecy is divine inspiration or revelation which
        announces the outcomes of things with immutable truth.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. “Prophecy is a sign of divine foreknowledge,” as Jerome says. But
        things which are foreknown are necessary in so far as they are subjects
        of foreknowledge. Therefore, the things prophesied are also necessary in
        so far as there is prophecy about them. Therefore, prophecy has
        unchangeable truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God’s knowledge about changeable things can be unchangeable, for He
        does not obtain it from things. But in the same way prophetic knowledge
        is not received from the things themselves. Therefore, Prophecy has
        unchangeable truth about changeable things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In prophecy there are two things to consider, the things prophesied and
        the knowledge which is had of those things. And the order of the causes
        in these two is different. For the things prophesied come immediately
        from changeable causes as from their proximate cause, but from the
        unchangeable causes as from their remote cause. Prophetic knowledge, on
        the other hand, comes from the divine foreknowledge as its proximate
        cause and depends on the things prophesied not as a proximate cause, but
        only as a sign of these things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, the necessity and contingency of every effect depends on the
        proximate cause and not on the first cause. Hence, the things prophesied
        are changeable, but the prophetic knowledge is unchangeable, just as is
        the divine foreknowledge from which it is derived as a copy from the
        pattern. For, just as the necessity of the truth of the understanding
        causes necessary truth in the statement which is a sign of
        understanding, so also the immutable divine foreknowledge causes
        unchangeable truth in the prophecy which is its sign.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the way in which God’s foreknowledge can be unchangeably true about
        changeable things is explained in another question, on God’s knowledge.
        Consequently, it is not necessary to repeat it here, since the whole
        immutability of prophecy depends on the immutability of the divine
        foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Nothing prevents something from being in another thing for an
        extrinsic reason, if that thing is taken in itself, and yet being in the
        thing for an intrinsic reason, if it is taken together with something
        else. Thus, to be moved belongs to man for an extrinsic reason, but, in
        so far as he is running, it belongs intrinsically to a man. So also, to
        be unchangeable does not belong intrinsically to the thing which is
        prophesied, but belongs to it only inasmuch as it is prophesied.
        Therefore, it is fittingly included in the definition of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The prophecy containing a threat fully possesses unchangeable truth,
        for it does not deal with the outcomes of things, but with the order of
        the causes to the outcomes, as has been said. And this order, predicted
        by the prophet, must necessarily be, although sometimes the events do
        not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That eternal disposition of God which never changes we call the
        chosen plan of God. For this reason Gregory says: “God never changes His
        chosen plan.” Sentence, however, is that to which some causes are
        ordained. Moreover, sentences are handed down in trials according to the
        merits of the cases (<i>causae</i>) <i>.</i> However, sometimes that to
        which the causes (<i>causae</i>) are ordained is arranged by God from
        eternity. And, then, God’s chosen plan and sentence are the same. But,
        sometimes, causes are ordained to something which is not arranged by God
        from eternity. Then, God’s chosen plan and sentence are directed to
        different things. Therefore, there is mutability in the sentence which
        looks to lower causes, but there is always immutability in the chosen
        plan.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Sometimes, then, a sentence which is in conformity with the chosen plan
        is revealed to the prophet. In this case, the prophecy possesses
        unchangeable truth even with reference to the outcome. Sometimes,
        however, there is revealed a sentence which is not in conformity with
        the chosen plan. In this case, there is unchangeable truth with
        reference to the order, but not with reference to the outcome, as we
        have said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The eternal mirror gives immutability to prophecy, not because it
        imposes necessity on the things prophesied, but because it makes the
        prophecy about contingent things necessary just as it itself is
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Given that something has been prophesied according to foreknowledge,
        although in itself it is possible for it to fail to exist, still,
        granted that it is said to be foreknown, it is then impossible for it
        not to exist. For, from the fact that it is established as foreknown, it
        is established that it will be so, since foreknowledge looks to the
        outcome.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The truth of a proposition follows the condition of the thing when
        the knowledge of the one proposing the truth has its origin from things.
        However, this is not so in our case.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although the proximate cause of the thing prophesied is changeable,
        the proximate cause of the prophecy itself is unchangeable, as has been
        said. Therefore, the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. We should pass like judgment on the failure of what is prophesied to
        come to pass and on the failure of what is foreknown to come to pass. To
        what extent this should be conceded and to what extent it should be
        denied is treated in the question on God’s knowledge.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Prophecy which has the sight of understanding along with imagination
        includes that which has the sight of understanding alone. Therefore, the
        prophetic sight which has both is better than that which has only one.
        For that which embraces something surpasses that which it embraces.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The more abundantly the light of understanding is in a prophecy, the
        more perfect it is. But, because of the fullness of the light of
        understanding in prophecy, there is an overflow from the understanding
        into the imagination, so that the sight of imagination is produced
        there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the prophecy which has the sight of imagination added to it
        is more perfect than that which has the sight of understanding alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3 It is said of John the Baptist that he is a prophet and “more than a
        prophet” (Mat 11:9). But this is stated because he saw Christ not only
        through his understanding or imagination, as the other prophets did, but
        also physically pointed him out. Therefore, prophecy with which bodily
        sight is combined is the most noble, and for the same reason that to
        which the sight of imagination is added is more noble than that which
        has the sight of understanding alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The more fully a thing contains the differences which make up the
        intelligible nature of the species, the more perfect it is. But the
        differences which constitute prophecy are sight and declaration.
        Therefore, the prophecy which includes declaration seems to be more
        perfect than that which does not have it. But the declaration cannot
        take place without the sight of imagination, because the one who
        declares a prophecy must have in his imagination the words he is going
        to speak. Therefore, the prophecy which includes the sight of
        imagination and of understanding is more perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The Gloss on “Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries” (1 Cor. 14:2)
        says: “One who by spirit alone sees the likenesses of the things
        signified is less a prophet, and one who is granted only the
        understanding of them is more a prophet, but he is most a prophet who
        excels in both.” Thus, we conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As Rabbi Moses says, prophecy begins in the understanding and is
        completed in the imagination. Therefore, prophecy which has the sight of
        imagination is more perfect than that which has only the sight of
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7.Weakness of the light of understanding betrays an imperfection of the
        prophecy. But the fact that prophetic sight does not overflow into the
        imagination seems to come from weakness of the light of understanding.
        Therefore, prophecy which has the sight of imagination seems to be more
        perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. To know a thing as it is in itself and as the sign of something else
        is more perfect than to know it only in itself. Therefore, for the same
        reason it is more perfect to know a thing as it is represented in a sign
        than to know it only in itself. But, in the prophecy which has the sight
        of imagination and that of understanding, the thing prophesied is known
        not only in itself but also as it is represented by the images.
        Therefore, the prophecy which has the sight of imagination is more noble
        than that which contains only the sight of understanding, in which one
        understands the things prophesied only in themselves and not as
        represented in a sign.

        9. Dionysius says: “It is impossible for the divine radiance to shine on
        us unless it is shrouded with a variety of sacred veils.”s But, for him
        veils are the imagery of the imagination, in which the purity of the
        light of understanding is, as it were, shrouded. Therefore, in every
        prophccy there must be imagery of the imagination either formed by man
        or introduced by God. Now, the imagery introduced by God seems to be
        more noble than that formed by man. Therefore, those prophecies seem to
        be most noble in which God at the same time infuses the light of
        understanding and the imagery of the imagination.

        10. As Jerome says, the prophets are distinguished from the writers of
        sacred books. But, of those whom he calls the prophets, all, or almost
        all, received revelation under the imagery of imagination. But many of
        those whom he calls writers of sacred books received revelation without
        imagery. Therefore, those to whom revelation is given according to the
        sight of understanding and imagination are more properly called prophets
        than those to whom revelation is given according to the sight of
        understanding only.

        11. According to the Philosopher, our understanding is related to the
        first causes of things, which naturally are most knowable, “just as the
        eye of the owl is related to the light of the sun.” But the eye of the
        owl can look at the light of the sun only when it is darkened to some
        extent. Therefore, our understanding, too, understands divine things
        when they are dimmed to some extent, and therefore seems to understand
        them in this way under certain likenesses. Consequently, the sight of
        understanding will not be more certain than that of imagination, since
        both take place under likenesses. Hence, it seems that the addition of
        the sight of imagination to that of understanding does not lessen the
        nobility of the latter. Thus, that prophecy which takes place under both
        sights is either of greater dignity or at least of equal dignity.

        12. That which can be understood is related to the understanding as that
        which can be imagined is related to the imagination. But that which can
        be imagined is apprehended by the imagination only through the mediation
        of a likeness. Therefore, what can be understood is apprehended by the
        understanding only in the same way. Thus, we conclude as before.

        1. The Gloss says: “There is another kind of prophecy which is of
        greater dignity than the others, that in which one prophesies by means
        of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit alone and apart from every outside
        help of action or word or vision or dream.”But the prophecy which has
        the sight of imagination joined to it takes place with the help of a
        dream or a vision. Therefore, the prophecy which has the sight of
        understanding alone is more noble.

        2. Everything which is received into a thing is received there according
        to the manner of the receiver. But the understanding, in which something
        is received by the sight of understanding, is more noble than the
        imagination, in which it is received by the sight of imagination.
        Therefore, prophecy which takes place according to the sight of
        understanding is more noble.

        3. Where there is sight of understanding there can be no deception, for
        one who is mistaken does not understand, as Augustine says. However, the
        sight of imagination contains a great mixture of falsity. Hence, in the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> it is given as a kind of source of falsity.
        Therefore, the prophecy which has the sight of understanding is more
        noble.

        4. When one power of the soul recedes from its activity, another is
        strengthened in its activity. Therefore, if the power of imagination is
        completely inactive in some prophecy, the sight of understanding will be
        stronger. Therefore, the prophecy will also be more noble.

        5. The acts of the powers are related to each other just as the powers
        are. But understanding not joined to imagination, as in the angels, is
        more noble than understanding joined to imagination, as in men.
        Therefore, the prophecy which contains the sight of understanding
        without the sight of imagination is more noble than that which has both.

        6. Assistance in an action shows imperfection in the agent. But the

        imperfect.

        7. The more remote light is from darkness or clouds, the brighter it is.
        But the imagery of imagination is, as it were, clouds which darken the
        light of understanding. For this reason Isaac says that human reason,
        which abstracts from phantasms, has its origin in the shadow of
        intelligence. Therefore, prophecy which has the light of understanding
        without images is more perfect.

        8. The whole nobility of prophetic knowledge consists in this, that it
        imitates God’s foreknowledge. But prophecy which has no sight of
        imagination imitates divine foreknowledge, in which there is no
        imagination, more than that which has the sight of imagination.
        Therefore, that which does not have the sight of imagination is more
        noble.

        Since the nature of a species is made up of the nature of the genus and
        the nature of the difference, the dignity of the species can be
        estimated from either of these. Likewise, according to these two
        considerations; certain things sometimes surpass each other in dignity.
        In so far as the nature of the species is concerned, that in which the
        difference formally constituting the species exists more nobly, always
        participates more perfectly in the nature of the species. But,
        absolutely speaking, sometimes that in which the nature of the genus is
        more perfect is more noble and sometimes that in which the nature of the
        difference exists more perfectly is more noble.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For, since the difference adds some perfection to the nature of the
        genus, the excellence which comes from the difference makes the thing
        more noble absolutely. Thus, just as in the species of man, who is a
        rational animal, he is more noble absolutely who is more gifted in
        rationality than one who is more gifted in the things which refer to the
        animal nature, as the senses, movement, and other things of this sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, when the difference implies a certain imperfection, then that
        which has the nature of the genus more completely is more noble
        absolutely. This is clear in faith, which is an obscure knowledge,
        namely, of things which are not seen. For one who has a large share of
        the nature of the genus of faith and is deficient in the difference (as
        one of the faithful who has some understanding of matters of belief and
        in a way already sees them) has a faith simply more noble than one who
        has less knowledge. Nonetheless, as far as the nature of faith is
        concerned, he has it more properly who does not at all see the things
        which he believes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The same is true in prophecy. For prophecy seems to be a knowledge which
        is shadowy and mixed with darkness, as the second Epistle of St. Peter
        (1:19) has: “We have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do
        well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place.” This, too,
        the very name prophecy shows, for prophecy is called a kind of sight
        from afar. And things which are seen clearly are seen, as it were, from
        nearby.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, if we compare the types of prophecy on the basis of the
        difference which completes the essence of prophecy, we find that the
        prophecy in which there is admixture of the sight of imagination
        possesses that nature of prophecy more perfectly and more properly. For
        in this the knowledge of prophetic truth is darkened.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But if we compare prophecies according to the attributes of the nature
        of the genus, namely, knowledge or sight, we see that we have to make a
        distinction. For all perfect knowledge has two elements, reception and
        judgment about that which is received. Now, in prophecy, judgment about
        that which is received is according to the understanding alone, but
        reception is according to the understanding and the imagination.
        Sometimes, therefore, there is no supernatural reception in prophecy,
        but only supernatural judgment. Thus, the understanding alone is
        enlightened without any sight of imagination. Perhaps Solomon’s
        inspiration was of this nature, since by a divine impulse he made more
        certain judgments than the rest of us about human actions and the
        natures of things, which we perceive naturally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, sometimes, there is also supernatural reception, and this takes
        place in two ways. For there is either reception by the imagination, as
        when images of things are formed by the divine power in the spirit of
        the prophet, or reception by the understanding, as happens when the
        understanding is so clearly flooded with knowledge of the truth that it
        does not grasp the truth from the likeness of any images, but in fact
        can form images for itself from the truth it has seen. And it uses these
        because of the nature of our understanding. But there can be no prophecy
        in which there is reception without judgment. Hence, no one can have
        sight of imagination without that of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, it is clear that the pure sight of understanding, which has
        judgment alone without supernatural reception, is inferior to that which
        has judgment and the reception of imagination. But the sight of
        understanding which has judgment and supernatural reception is more
        noble than that which has judgment and the reception of imagination. In
        this respect we must concede that prophecy which contains the sight of
        understanding alone is more worthy than that which has sight of
        imagination joined to it.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although the prophecy which consists of both sights does also have
        sight of understanding, it does not include the prophecy which consists
        of the sight of understanding alone, because the latter has the sight of
        understanding more nobly than the former, since in it the perception of
        the light of understanding is sufficient for reception and judgment,
        whereas in the other it is sufficient only for judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In both types of prophecy the prophetic light descends from the
        understanding to the imagination, but in different ways. For in the type
        of prophecy which is said to contain the sight of understanding alone we
        perceive the whole fullness of the prophetic revelation in the
        understanding. Thereupon, because of the nature of our understanding,
        which cannot understand without phantasms, images are suitably formed in
        the imaginative power as the one who understands wishes. But in the
        other type of prophecy the whole fullness of prophetic revelation is not
        received in the understanding, but partly in the understanding, in so
        far as there is judgment, and partly in the imagination, in so far as
        there is reception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, the sight of understanding is more complete in the prophecy which
        contains only the sight of understanding. For the deficiency of the
        light received in the understanding causes it, in a sense, to fall to
        some extent from the intelligible purity into the imagery of
        imagination, as happens in dreams.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That John pointed out Christ physically does not belong to prophetic
        sight in the way we are now speaking about the comparison of prophecy.
        Rather, it belongs to the declaration of prophecy. Also, that he saw
        Christ bodily did not give him prophecy of a more perfect nature, but
        was a concession greater than prophecy given him by God. Hence, Luke
        (10:24) says: “Many prophets and kings have desired to see the things
        that you see...”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Declaration through words or deeds is common to both kinds of
        prophecy, for even the prophecy which has the sight of understanding
        alone can be declared according to images which [the prophet] freely
        forms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That Gloss speaks of one who in his understanding has only judgment
        about those things which are received by another, as Joseph had only
        judgment about the things which Pharaoh had seen and he himself did not
        receive [knowledge of] what would happen. Thus, the argument does not
        reach any conclusion about the prophecy which has the sight of
        understanding alone. And it is of this that we are now speaking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. On this point we do not follow the opinion of Rabbi Moses, for he
        holds that the prophecy of David was below that of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
        which is the opposite of what holy men say. Still, there is some truth
        in what he says, because the judgment is not completed unless the things
        about which we are to judge are brought forward. Hence, in the prophecy
        in which the light of understanding is perceived only in order to make a
        judgment, there is only the light itself, which does not cause
        determinate knowledge of anything until some things about which we must
        judge are put before it, whether these are received either from the
        light itself or from another. Thus, the sight of understanding is
        perfected through the sight of imagination as what is common is
        determined through that which is particular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. It is not always weakness of the light of understanding which is the
        source of prophecy according to the sight of understanding alone. But
        sometimes it is caused by a very complete reception of the
        understanding, as we have noted.” Therefore, the argument does not
        follow. 8. A sign as such is a cause of knowledge. The thing which is
        represented is that which is known through something else. But, just as
        that which is known in itself and makes other things known is known in a
        more noble way than that which is known only in itself, so also, on the
        other hand, that which is known through itself and not through something
        else is known in a more noble way than that which is known through
        something else. Thus, principles are known in a more noble way than
        conclusions, and therefore, the case is just the opposite with the sign
        and the thing signified. Hence, the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although images imprinted by God are more noble than images formed by
        a man, the reception of knowledge which is in the mind from God is more
        noble than that which takes place through the forms of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Those who have prophecy according to visions of imagination are more
        especially called prophets in the above-mentioned distinction, for in
        them there is a fuller character of prophecy even by reason of the
        difference. They, however, are called sacred writers who had only
        intellectual visions supernaturally, whether in judgment alone or in
        judgment and reception together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although our intellect understands divine things through certain
        likenesses, still, because these are immaterial, they are more noble
        than the likenesses of imagination. Hence, the sight of understanding,
        also, is more noble.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. A thing cannot be imaginable through its essence as it can be
        intelligible through its essence, for the imagination concerns only
        material things. Yet, it cannot receive anything except without matter.
        Consequently, it is always necessary for the imagination to attain an
        object not through its essence, but through its likeness. But
        understanding receives things immaterially, and so, knows not only
        material things, but also immaterial things. Hence, it knows some things
        through their essence and some through likenesses.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Prophecy is more noble where the reception of the thing prophesied is
        more noble. But, sometimes, the reception of the thing prophesied takes
        place through the sight of imagination. Therefore, grades of prophecy
        can be distinguished according to the sight of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A more perfect medium of knowing produces more perfect knowledge. It
        is for this reason that scientific knowledge is more perfect than
        opinion. But the likenesses of imagination are a medium of knowing in
        prophecy. Therefore, where the sight of imagination is more noble, the
        grade of prophecy will be higher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In all knowledge which takes place through a likeness the knowledge
        is more perfect where the likeness is more explicit. But in prophecy the
        imagery of imagination is made up of the likenesses of the things about
        which there is revelation of prophecy. Therefore, where the sight of
        imagination is more perfect, the grade of prophecy is higher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Since the prophetic light descends from the understanding to the
        imagination, when the light in the understanding of the prophet is more
        perfect, the sight of imagination is the more perfect. Therefore,
        different grades of the sight of imagination show different grades of
        the sight of understanding. But where the sight of understanding is more
        perfect, the prophecy is more perfect. Therefore, grades of prophecy are
        distinguished according to the sight of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said that diversity of the sight of imagination does not
        distinguish species of prophecy and, therefore, grades of prophecy are
        not distinguished according to it.—On the contrary, every warm element
        is of the. same species, but doctors distinguish warmth into first,
        second, third, and fourth grades. Therefore, the distinction of grades
        does not require the distinction of species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Greater and less do not constitute distinct species. But even the
        sight of understanding is distinguished in prophecy only according to
        the more or less perfect reception of the prophetic light. Therefore,
        difference in the sight of understanding does not constitute distinct
        species of prophecy and so it does not constitute distinct grades of
        prophecy according to the response just given. Thus, there would not be
        grades in prophecy if it were distinguished neither according to the
        sight of understanding nor the sight of imagination. Therefore, it
        remains that grades of prophecy are distinguished according to the sight
        of imagination.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Only the sight of understanding, and not the sight of imagination,
        makes one a prophet. Therefore, neither are grades of prophecy
        distinguished according to the sight of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That which is distinguished by reason of something intrinsic is
        distinguished according to that which is formal to it. But in prophecy
        the sight of understanding is formal and the sight of imagination is, as
        it were, material. Therefore, grades of prophecy are distinguished
        according to the sight of understanding and not according to the sight
        of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The visions of imagination frequently vary in the same prophet, for
        sometimes he apprehends revelation in one way and sometimes in another.
        Therefore, it does not seem possible to distinguish grades of prophecy
        according to the sight of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Prophecy is related to the things prophesied just as scientific
        knowledge is related to the things known. But the sciences are
        distinguished according to the things known, as is said in
        <i>The Soul</i>. Therefore, prophecy is distinguished according to the
        things prophesied and not according to the sight of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. According to the Gloss, prophecy consists in “words and deeds, dreams
        and visions.” Therefore, grades of prophecy should not be distinguished
        more according to the sight of imagination to which visions and dreams
        belong than according to words and deeds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Miracles also are needed for prophecy. Hence, when Moses was sent by
        the Lord (Exodus 3:11-13), he sought a sign. And in Psalms (73:9) we
        read: “Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet...”
        Therefore, grades of prophecy should not be distinguished according to
        the sight of imagination rather than according to signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When two things combine to make up something, and one of them is more
        important than the other in the composite which they constitute, we can
        consider grades of comparison according to that which is primary and
        according to that which is secondary. But a high degree of that which is
        primary shows an absolute pre-eminence, whereas a high degree of that
        which is secondary shows a pre-eminence in some respect and not
        absolutely, unless the high degree of that which is secondary is a sign
        of a high degree of that which is primary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, for human merit, charity, as that which is primary, unites with an
        external work, as that which is secondary. However, absolutely speaking,
        that is to say, with reference to the essential reward, we judge merit
        to be greater when it proceeds from greater charity. And the magnitude
        of the work makes for greater merit in so far as it refers to some
        accidental reward, but not absolutely, except in so far as it shows
        intensity of charity, according to what Gregory says: “Love of God, if
        it exists, does great things.” Therefore, since prophecy is achieved
        through the joint activity of both the sight of understanding and that
        of imagination, the former functioning as the principal factor, and the
        latter in a secondary capacity, it follows that pre-eminence of the
        sight of understanding should be the basis for judging one grade of
        prophecy as absolutely superior. However, pre-eminence of the sight of
        imagination shows a grade of prophecy to be higher in some respect, and
        not absolutely, unless to the extent that perfection of the sight of
        imagination exhibits perfection of the sight of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But we cannot perceive determinate grades of the sight of understanding,
        because the fullness of the light of understanding is displayed only
        through certain signs. Hence, we must distinguish grades of prophecy
        according to those signs. And in this way there are four bases on which
        we can distinguish grades of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first is according to the elements which are necessary for prophecy.
        Now, prophecy has two acts: sight and declaration. For sight, however,
        two things are needed: judgment, which is in the understanding, and
        reception, which is sometimes in the understanding and sometimes in the
        imagination. But for declaration something is needed in the one
        declaring, namely, a certain boldness so that he will not be afraid to
        speak the truth because of the opponents of the truth. In this sense the
        Lord said to Ezechiel (3:8-9): “Behold I have made thy face stronger
        than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads..., fear
        them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence.” And something
        else is needed in the thing to be declared, namely, a sign through which
        the truth of the thing declared is made known. Thus, Moses received a
        sign from God in order that he might be believed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, since the place of declaration in prophecy is not primary but only
        secondary, the lowest grade of prophecy exists in one in whom there is a
        certain boldness or readiness to say or do something without having a
        revelation. This would be the case if we say that there was a grade of
        prophecy in Samson, taking prophecy in a broad sense in which every
        supernatural influx is reduced to prophecy. The second grade will be
        that in which the prophet has the sight of understanding only according
        to judgment, as in Solomon. The third grade is that in which one has the
        sight of understanding together with that of imagination, as in Isaiah
        and Jeremiah. The fourth is that in which the prophet has the very
        fullness of the sight of understanding in judgment and reception, as in
        David.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A second basis on which grades of prophecy can be distinguished is the
        disposition of the one prophesying. Thus, since prophecy takes place in
        a dream or in a vision when one is awake, as we read in Numbers (12:6),
        the grade of prophecy which takes place when one is awake is more
        perfect than that which takes place in a dream. This is so both because
        the understanding is better disposed for judging when one is awake and
        because the transport from sensible things does not take place
        naturally, but comes from the perfect concentration of the inner powers
        on the things which God is disclosing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A third basis is the manner of perceiving these things, for the more
        distinctly the things prophesied are signified, the higher is the grade
        of prophecy. Rut no signs portray anything more distinctly than words.
        Therefore, when one perceives words expressly indicating the thing
        prophesied, as we read of Samuel in the first Book of Kings (3:11), the
        grade of prophecy is higher than when certain figures which are
        likenesses of the things are shown to us, as the boiling caldron which
        was shown to Jeremiah (1:13). From this it is clearly shown that the
        prophetic light is better grasped in its power when the things to be
        prophesied are exhibited according to more distinct likenesses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fourth basis is the one who makes the revelation. For the grade of
        prophecy is higher when he who speaks is seen than when one only hears
        the words, whether in a dream or in a vision. For this shows that the
        prophet approaches closer to the knowledge of him who reveals. And the
        grade of prophecy is higher when he who speaks is seen under the guise
        of an angel than when he is seen in the form of a man, and even higher
        if he should be seen in the image of God, as in Isaiah (6:1) “I saw the
        Lord sitting....” For, since revelation of prophecy descends from God to
        an angel and from the angel to man, the reception of prophecy is
        manifestly fuller, the more it approaches the first source of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must concede the arguments which show that grades of prophecy are
        distinguished according to sight of imagination in the manner we have
        explained. And we must not say that diversity of grade requires
        distinction of species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The answer to the first difficulty is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. When something is distinguished according to species, the distinction
        must be made according to that which is formal. But if there is
        distinction of grades within the same species, it can be according to
        that which is material, as animal is distinguished according to male and
        female, which are material differences, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Since prophetic light is not something abiding in the prophet, but a
        kind of transient impression, it is not necessary for the prophet always
        to possess the same grade of prophecy. In fact, revelation comes to him
        sometimes according to one grade and sometimes according to another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Since some things which are more noble are at times known less
        perfectly, as when there is opinion about things divine and scientific
        knowledge about creatures, we cannot derive grades of prophecy from the
        things prophesied. This is especially true when the things which are to
        be declared are revealed to the prophet according to the demands of the
        disposition of those for whose sake the prophecy is given.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Still, it can be said that grades of prophecy are distinguished
        according to the things prophesied, but, because of their great
        diversity, we cannot thus assign definite grades of prophecy, except
        perhaps in a general way, as if we should say that the grade is higher
        when something about God is revealed than when something about creatures
        is revealed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The words and deeds treated in this objection do not belong to the
        revelation of prophecy, but to the declaration which takes place
        according to the disposition of those to whom it is declared.
        Consequently, we cannot distinguish grades of prophecy according to
        this. The grace of working miracles differs from prophecy, yet it can be
        reduced to prophecy inasmuch as the truth of the prophet is shown forth
        through miracles. Hence, in this respect the grace of working miracles
        is better than prophecy, just as scientific knowledge which gives the
        reason is better than scientific knowledge which gives the fact. For
        this reason the grace of working miracles is put before the grace of
        prophecy in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (12:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, he is the most distinguished prophet who has prophetic
        revelation and also works miracles. However, if he works miracles
        without prophetic revelation, he is not more noble in what belongs to
        the nature of prophecy, although, perhaps, all things considered, he is
        more noble. But such a one is numbered among those in the lowest grade
        of prophecy, just as one who has only the boldness to do something.

        1. Gregory says:. “As there has been a growth age by age, there has been
        an increase in the knowledge about God.” Therefore, the later prophets
        were more outstanding than Moses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Gloss reads: “David was the most outstanding of the prophets.
        Therefore, Moses was not the most outstanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Greater miracles were worked through Joshua, who made the sun and the
        moon stand still (Joshua 10:13), than through Moses. Greater miracles
        were also worked through Isaiah, who made the sun go backward (Isaiah
        38:8). Therefore, Moses was not the greatest prophet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In Sirach (48:4-5) there is this said of Elijah: “Who can glory like
        to thee who raisedst up a dead man from below... ? “ Thus, we conclude
        as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In Matthew (11:11), we read of John the Baptist: “There hath not
        risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the
        Baptist.” Therefore, Moses was not greater than he. Thus, we conclude as
        before.

        1. Deuteronomy (34: 10) says: “And there arose no more a prophet in

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Numbers (12:6-7) says: “If there be among you a prophet of the Lord,
        I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream. But
        it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all my
        house.” From this it is clear that he is given preference over the other
        prophets.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Among the prophets, eminence can, according to various criteria, be
        attributed to some in a qualified way, but speaking without
        qualification, Moses was the greatest of them all. For in him the four
        things necessary for prophecy were present in a most outstanding manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, the sight of understanding was most eminent in him, and through
        this he was lifted up to see the very essence of God, as is said in
        Numbers (12:8): “And plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see
        the Lord.” Moreover, this sight of his did not take place through the
        mediation of an angel, as it did in other prophetic visions. Hence, in
        the same place in Numbers (12:8) we read: “For I speak to him mouth to
        mouth.” And Augustine says this plainly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Second, the sight of imagination existed in Moses most perfectly because
        he had it, as it were, at will. Hence, we read in Exodus (33:10: “And
        the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his
        friend.” We can also note in this another excellence with reference to
        the sight of imagination, that he not only heard the words of the one
        revealing, but saw Him, and this not in the shape of a man or an angel,
        but as God Himself; not in a dream, but when awake. We read this of none
        of the other prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Third, his declaration was most outstanding because all who were before
        him taught their families as one teaches a lesson, but Moses was the
        first who spoke for the Lord, saying: “The Lord says this.” And he spoke
        to the whole people and not to one family. Nor did he declare something
        for the Lord in such a way that his hearers should give heed to what
        another previous prophet said, as the prophets by their preaching led
        the people to observe the law of Moses. Hence, the preaching of previous
        prophets was a preparation for the law of Moses, and this law was the
        foundation of the preaching of subsequent prophets. Fourth, he was more
        outstanding in the matters which refer to the declaration of prophecy.
        For, as regards miracles, he worked signs for the conversion and
        teaching of a whole race, whereas other prophets worked particular
        miracles for special persons and special tasks. Hence, we read in
        Deuteronomy (34:10): “And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like
        unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face”. as for pre-eminence of
        revelation: “In all the signs and wonders, which he sent by him to do in
        the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants” (Deuteronomy
        34:11); and “Great miracles, which Moses did before all Israel”
        (Deuteronomy 34:12). He also showed himself most outstanding in
        boldness, for with only a rod he went down into Egypt, not only to
        preach the words of the Lord, but also to scourge Egypt and to free his
        people.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We should take what Gregory says as referring to the things which
        pertain to the mystery of the Incarnation. Later prophets received more
        explicit revelations about these than Moses did. However, they did not
        receive more explicit revelations of the Divinity, about which Moses was
        most fully taught.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. David is called the most outstanding of the prophets because he
        prophesied most clearly about Christ without any vision of imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although those miracles were greater than the miracles of Moses in
        the substance of what was done, the miracles of Moses. were greater in
        the manner in which they were performed because they were performed for
        the whole people and for the instruction of the people in a new law and
        for their liberation. These other miracles were for particular tasks.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The pre-eminence of Elijah is noted especially in this, that he was
        preserved from death and was more outstanding than many other prophets
        in boldness, by reason of which he did not fear the rulers of his times,
        and in greatness of miracles, as appears from the same place in Sirach
        (48:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When Moses is put before the other prophets, we should understand
        this as referring to prophets of the Old Testament, for, at that time
        especially, when the world awaited the coming of Christ, to whom all
        prophecy was ordained, prophecy was in its proper environment. John,
        however, belongs to the New Testament. Hence, Matthew (11:13) has: “For
        all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.” However, there is a
        clearer revelation in the New Testament; the second Epistle to the
        Corinthians (3:18) has: “But we all, beholding the glory of the Lord
        with open face...” Here, the Apostle distinctly puts himself and the
        other apostles ahead of Moses. Nevertheless, granted that no man was
        greater than John the Baptist, it does not follow from this that no
        prophet had a higher grade of prophecy than he, for one can be greater
        in prophecy and less in merit, since prophecy is not a gift of
        sanctifying grace.
