      consumption, but also by other conditions, which are contained in the

      eagerly." Therefore, since to consume excessively, as this is said with 
      respect to quantity, does not break the fast, nor (does this apply to 
      consuming) ardently with respect to the longing for consumption, nor 
      sumptuously with respect to the richnesses which are sought in food, nor 
      eagerly with respect to the exquisite way of preparing food (some mortally 
      sin who act in this fashion during the days of fasting, being 
      transgressors, as it were, of the precepts of the Church, which is hard to 
      say). It would seem not to consume ahead of time, which is to anticipate 
      the time, breaks the fast.</FONT></TD></TR>

      respond to the 1st question (sub-article 1) saying that the fast is broken 
      in two ways. In one way, in relation to (the) merit (that attends to the 
      fast), so that man either does not merit, or merits less (those things 
      promised or gained by the fast). Concerning this breaking of the fast, we 
      do not intend (to discuss) at the present moment. For the conditions which 
      either augment or diminish the merit of an act are indeterminate, in that 
      they are sometimes accidentally related to the meritorious act. The second 
      way in which a fast is broken is said in relation to that which is 
      instituted by the Church. Through this breaking, a man is made a 
      transgressor of the statutes of the Church concerning the observance of 
      fasting; at the least, he is not an observer (of those statutes), unless 
      by reason of a dispensation (that he has received), or (that) he has been 
      released through a legitimate cause. Concerning this breaking of the 
      (Church's) fast, we here investigate (at the present moment).

      hoc autem praecipue valet considerare intentiones statuentis. intendit 
      autem ecclesia certum modum statuere manducandi, ut scilicet semel in die 
      jejunans manducet; et ideo si aliquorum sumptio, secundum quae manducatio 
      solet compleri, iteretur, jejunium praedicto modo acceptum solvitur. si 
      autem aliqua sumantur quae ad manducandum de se ordinata non sunt, sed ad 
      alium usum, qui usus communiter manducatio non vocatur; talis cibi vel

      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>In 
      this regard, one is especially able to consider the intentions of the one 
      who regulates (the rules binding and governing the fast). The Church 
      intends in a specific way to regulate the eating (of the fasting meal), 
      namely that those fasting eat once a day. And for this reason, if the 
      taking of something which one is accustomed in the act of eating to 
      consume, if this is taken again, fasting, understood in the second way, is 
      broken. If, however, something is taken which is not ordered <I>per se</I> 
      to the act of eating, but rather to some other use (which use is not 
      generally called an act of eating), the taking of this sort of food or 
      drink (in addition to the one act of eating, and this either before or 
      after this one meal) does not make one to eat twice. Thus the taking of 
      this sort does not break the fast.</FONT></TD></TR>

      primum ergo dicendum, quod quamvis aliquis potus aliquo modo nutriat, 
      tamen de se non ordinatur ad nutriendum, sed magis ad dispositionem bonam 
      eorum quae nutriunt, ut scilicet per membra deducantur, et in stomacho non 
      comburantur; unde sumptio potus manducatio non dicitur: et ideo ille qui 
      potat extra horam unicae comestionis, non dicitur bis manducare; et

      ;>Response to the first objection: Although a drink may nourish in some 
      fashion, nevertheless in itself it is not ordered to nutrition, but rather 
      to the good condition of those which they nourish, so that, namely, (the 
      water is) drawn away through one's members, and not consumed in the 
      stomach. Hence, the taking of drink is not called an act of eating. And 
      thus, he who drinks outside of the hour of the single meal is not said to 
      eat twice. According to this, he does not break the statute of the Church, 
      except where he engages in a deception. For he who does something so as to 
      deceive the law violates the law.</FONT></TD></TR>

      nature, since it does nourish in some fashion, nevertheless it does not 
      break the fast of the Church. For the church does not attend in the making 
      of statutes to that which in any way at all is able to nourish, but rather 
      is ordered principally to (what is involved in) nutrition (as was detailed 
      in both the response and the prior reply).</FONT></TD></TR>

      delectationem, solvunt jejunium; si autem causa medicinae sumantur, non 
      solvitur jejunium. sed statutum positivae legis non attendit intentionem 
      observantis, sed ipsum actum; eo quod modus virtutis non cadit in 
      praecepto, sed est finis praecepti; sed ex intentione potest aliquis 
      mereri vel demereri. et ideo dicendum, quod electuaria etsi aliquo modo

      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT 
      ;>Response to the third objection: Some say that if electuaries are eaten 
      for pleasure, they break the fast. If, however, they are taken as 
      medicine, they do not. But the statute of the positive law does not attend 
      to the intention of the one observing (the fast), but rather to the act 
      itself, in that the mode of virtue does not fall within the precept, but 
      is the end of the precept. But because of (one's) intention, someone can 
      merit or not. Therefore, it should be said that electuaries, even if they 
      do nourish in some way, nevertheless this is not its principal use. Hence 
      they have not customarily been taken on the occasion of eating. Thus, this 
      sort of taking does not break the fast of the Church, although one can 
      wholly by this destroy the merit of the fast, or even mortally sin, if 
      there is immoderate pleasure. However, he is not a transgressor of the 
      Church's precept unless he were to engage in deception, or if he were to 
      utilize them like other foods so as to extinguish hunger.</FONT></TD></TR>

      respond to the 2nd question (sub-article 2) saying that he is said to 
      break the ecclesial fast who does not preserve the mode of abstinence 
      instituted by the Church. Since the ecclesial fast was instituted for the 
      sake of reparation, and for the restraint of concupiscence, just as she 
      (the Church) has determined the abstinence of the fast with respect to 
      number, namely so that he who fasts eats only once for the affliction of 
      his flesh on account of reparation, so too has she determined that one 
      abstain from meat because with this kind of food, concupiscence especially 
      is encouraged and strengthened.</FONT></TD></TR>

      through the mode of alteration. And since these kinds of alterations do 
      not endure for long, the drink of wine does not, to a great extent, work 
      efficaciously to the encouragement of concupiscence, just as the eating of 
      meat by which the matter of concupiscence is especially ministered to and 
      the natural heat is strengthened much more radically; on the other hand, 
      the denial of wine excessively weakens nature on account of hindering 
      digestion.</FONT></TD></TR>

      jejunium solvit. non enim ecclesia arctare intendit ad subtilem temporis

      respond to the 3rd. question (sub-article 3) saying that, as was said, he 
      breaks the fast who does not preserve the Church's determination. Hence, 
      when the Church institutes a certain time for eating for those who fast, 
      he who perceptibly excessively anticipates (the time of eating) breaks the 
      fast. For the Church does not intent to bind one to an exact inspection of 
      the time. Nor is it appropriate to use an astrolabe so as to know the hour 
      of eating. Hence, it suffices if around the hour that the Church has 
      instituted, that he who fasts take food, even if he somewhat anticipates 
      on account of some necessity.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;>Response to the second objection: Those things in which a certain 
      measure cannot be taken, do not fall under the determination of the 
      legislator. Since a certain measure cannot be taken in the quantity of 
      food or in the other conditions enumerated, for this reason the conditions 
      of the other four do not fall under the determination of the Church's 
      precepts. And so, although he sins through a lack of proper ordering 
      concerning those circumstances, and loses the merit of fasting either in 
      whole or in part, nevertheless the statute of the Church is not 
      transgressed. And so the fast is not broken.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
