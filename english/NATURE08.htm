    <p>
      <strong>8.1 Arguments against its existence</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 15)
    </p>
    <p>
      1) Time includes the past, present and future. But the past and the future
      do not exist. Therefore time does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Even present time does not exist, because time is divisible, whereas
      the "now" which exists, being indivisible, is not a part of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question arises whether successive "nows" are distinct or the same. On
      the one hand it seems they are not distinct, since two parts of time
      cannot exist together unless one contains the other, as a year contains a
      month. But between two "nows" there are an infinity of "nows", so that one
      can never contain or even touch the other. Therefore, if time is
      continuous, the same "now" must perdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it seems that each "now" is distinct: No finite
      divisible thing can have just one boundary; thus a line must have two
      terminal points. But the "now" is a demarcation of time, and periods of
      time are determined by two points of time (= past or future "nows").
      Therefore each "now" must be distinct. Likewise, if the same "now"
      perdured through all time, there would be no way of distinguishing the
      time of things that happened a thousand years ago from things that exist
      today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.2 How time is related to motion</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 16)
    </p>
    <p>
      Time is not the same as motion, because motion exists in the particular
      things that are in motion, whereas time is everywhere and among all
      things. Besides, every motion is either slow or fast, but time is neither;
      rather it is the measure of what is fast or slow, since something is fast
      if it is moved a great distance in a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, time is not independent of motion. A sign of this is
      that we think little or no time has passed (or time has gone fast) if
      nothing is happening around us or we become so absorbed in something that
      we are unaware of what is happening around us.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore time is not motion, but it does not exist without motion.</p>
    <p><strong>8.3 Definition of time</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 17)</p>
    <p>
      Time is connected with motion. This is obvious by our perceiving the two
      together. Even if we in a silent dark room, we perceive the succession of
      our thoughts and imaginings, and by this are aware that time is elapsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter case would make it appear that time depends on the motion of
      the mind. In that case time will not be a thing of nature but a rational
      being. On the other hand, if time follows upon any and every motion, then
      there are as many times as there are motions, which is absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem of multiple times is solved if we measure the multiple motions
      of this world by reference to regular cosmic motions, such as the daily
      revolution of the earth on its axis, the annual orbital movement of the
      earth around the sun, and the 28 day orbital movement of the moon around
      the earth. These are the constants of our world of experience, and it is
      by these motions that time is calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If time is calculated according to such a basic local motion, and this
      motion is the continuous passage of the earth over a continuous orbit or
      position in reference to the sun, then time must be continuous. Because
      positions can be demarcated in the path of these motions, the motions
      themselves can be demarcated by points which are before or after each
      other. Because there is a priority and posteriority of motion, there is a
      priority and posteriority of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priority and posteriority of motion are the same as motion as to
      subject, but are different formalities. <em>Time</em>, precisely, is
      <strong>the number of motion</strong>. That is because time is a counting
      of the different "befores" and "afters" of a motion. We could re-phrase
      our definition to say that <em>time</em> is
      <strong>the numbering of motion according to before and after</strong>.
      The "before" and "after" are not those of time, so that the definition
      would be circular, but the "before" and "after" of motion as it crosses
      different points of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a number, time is not an abstract number, such as used in pure
      mathematics, but a concrete quantity that we can call a "numbered number",
      as when we say ten men or 100 horses. <em>Time</em> is the
      <strong>number of before and after in motion</strong>. Although number is
      discrete quantity, time is a continuous quantity on account of the thing
      counted, just as ten measures of cloth is a continuous quantity, even
      though ten is a discrete quantity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8.4 The meaning of "now"</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 18 & 21)</p>
    <p>
      Just as the parts of motion are always other and other, so also the parts
      of time. But what always exists throughout the whole of time is the same,
      namely, the "now" which, as to its nature is always the same, although in
      conception it varies according as it is prior and subsequent. Thus the
      "now" measures time not in as much as it is always the same thing, but in
      as much as in conception it is other and other, i.e. "before" and "after".
    </p>
    <p>
      [Other words for "now" are: a "point in time", an "instant", a "moment",
      but the latter two are more often understood as infinitismal segments of
      time.]
    </p>
    <p>
      In so far as the "now" constantly changes with the succession of time and
      of motion, in that sense it is other and not always the same, but in so
      far as the "now" is a certain being, abstracted from "before" and "after",
      in that sense it is always of the same nature. "Now" is comparable to a
      moving car along a road; in its nature it is always the same, yet
      different when considered located at different positions along its path.
      Just as the mobile object is more known to us than motion, and motion is
      known through the mobile object, so time is known through the "now".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain that if there is no time there will be no "now", and if there
      is no "now" there will be no time. Time is the number of local motion, but
      a single "now" is not the number of motion (since it is indivisible), but
      a principle of motion, just as "one" is the principle of number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the unity of the mobile (e.g. the car on the road) gives unity to
      the movement (since a change of vehicles would mean different movements),
      so time derives its unity from the moving "now". And like the moving point
      of a line as it is drawn, the on-going "now" both gives unity to time and
      distinguishes its parts. Points are only potential in a line and are
      actualized only when demarcated as the end of one segment and the
      beginning of another, as at an angle, which is one point serving two
      lines. Angular motion (like a bouncing ball), however, is multiple, with
      the two motions connected at two contiguous points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "now" of time is continuous like the point of a line, being at the
      same time a potential end of the past and beginning of the future. Only
      when we designate one "now" as the end of one period of time and the
      beginning of another is it an actualized point. [Compare the separate
      frames of a video film with the continuity of actual motion.] The
      distinction of the "now" is a work of the human mind taking it as a
      boundary; in reality there is no break into contiguous "nows", but it is
      continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the "now" is not a part of time, but a boundary of time; in that way
      it is a number, and is applicable to all things that are moved in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides its meaning as a point in time, "now" is commonly used for a
      period of time that includes the present, as we say "He has now come"
      because he has come today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we say something happened "then", meaning either at a precise
      moment in the past or at a more or less broad period of time including
      that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words "presently" or "just now" mean "now" in the broad sense of the
      present time, while "long ago" refers to a period of time in the distant
      past. Something occurs "suddenly" when the time in which it takes place is
      imperceptibly small.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now" in its strict sense has the double function of being an end of the
      past and a beginning of the future. Thus, of its nature, time does not
      necessarily have a beginning or an end. Only were the whole universe and
      its motion to have a beginning would the first "now" serve only as a
      beginning and not as an end. And were the whole universe and its motion to
      have an end, then the last "now" would serve only as an end and not as a
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8.5 Explanations about time</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 19)</p>
    <p>
      We have seen that <em>time</em> is
      <strong>the number of motion according to before and after</strong>. It is
      a type of continuum; although it does not have continuity in so far as it
      is a number, it does by reason of that of which it is the number: for it
      is the number of a continuum, namely, of motion. For time is not a number
      absolutely but a number of something numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does time have a minimum? As a number, the minimum is one: a year, day or
      second etc., but as a continuum, any given time can be divided into
      smaller parts, just as a magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is time not said to be slow or fast, but is said to be much or little,
      and short or long? In so far as time is a continuum it is said to be long
      or short; in so far as it is a number it is said to be much or little. But
      it cannot be called fast or slow, because that is said of something that
      can be counted in a short or long time, whereas time is the number of a
      constant motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what ways is time the same and different? Time is the same everywhere,
      but is different by reason of before and after in the basic motion of
      which it is the number; just as different segments of motion are
      different, so different segments of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is time everywhere, when motion is not everywhere? The answer is that
      time accompanies motion, whether motion be actual or potential. For things
      that are capable of motion, and are not actually being moved, are at rest.
      But time measures not only motion but rest as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can time be repeated? Since the same motion may be repeated
      specifically, but not numerically, so time can be duplicated in the same
      day. Thus each year we have a rainy season, specifically the same but
      numerically different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does time measure motion or motion time? Each is defined in terms of the
      other. The basic continuum is that of a magnitude (e.g. a road); motion
      imitates this in quantity, continuity and divisibility, and likewise time
      imitates motion. Fundamentally, time is the number and measure of motion,
      but it is not always the most known to us. Sometimes we say a certain town
      is two hours away, not knowing the exact distance. Other times we say that
      it is 60 kilometres, not knowing the time it takes to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.6 How things are or are not in time</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 20)
    </p>
    <p>
      Motion is measured by time both in its duration (so many hours, days) and
      in its being, which is essentially continuous and numerable. Other things,
      like a stone or a man, are measured by time in their duration (i.e. in so
      far as they have motion), but not in their being, which merely co-exists
      with time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything that exists in time tends to waste away with age. Even though it
      could be argued that some things get better with time, nonetheless one
      does not necessarily learn with time but one does forget with time. Time
      is <em>per se</em> corruptive, and <em>per accidens</em> generative,
      whereas generation and being is attributed <em>per se</em> to the agent
      and generator. The latter are not required for corruption, but simply old
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus whatever is contained in time is subject to decay and corruption. But
      whatever is outside time exists forever. Aristotle and Thomas wrongly
      thought this applies to the heavenly bodies which have only local motion
      but are subject to no other change. But if heavenly bodies, like the sun,
      moon and stars, are corruptible like everything else, then only spiritual
      beings are outside of time and exist forever. Besides, universal truths,
      such as mathematical axioms, are not subject to time and are forever true,
      but that is because they are abstracted from the real sensible existence
      of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8.7 Problems regarding the existence and unity of time</strong>
      (Book 4, Lesson 23)
    </p>
    <p>
      1) Can there be time without the soul? An argument for the negative is
      that without anyone to count nothing is countable, and there is no number.
      On the other hand, motion is a reality independent of the soul, and so is
      its "before" and "after", which is numerable. Consequently, just as there
      can be things perceptible to sense even though no sense exists, and
      intelligible things even though no intelligence exists, so there can exist
      both countable things and number, even though no counter exists. It is
      true that if it is impossible for a counter to exist, then nothing
      countable could exist, but it does not follow that if there is no one
      counting that there is nothing countable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motion, however, does not have a fixed existence in reality, nor is any
      par of motion actually found in things but a certain indivisible of motion
      which divides motion; indeed, the totality of motion comes to be on
      account of the mind considering and comparing a previous state of the
      mobile to a subsequent state.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this, then, time also has no existence outside the soul
      except according to its indivisible, while the totality of time is had by
      an ordering process of the mind enumerating what is prior and subsequent
      in motion. Therefore, apart from the soul time is "a sort of being", i.e.
      an imperfect being, just as motion exists imperfectly without a soul
      knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Of which motion is time the number? Since every motion has a before and
      an after, it would seem that time is the number of each and every motion.
      But in this case two simultaneous motions would each have their own time
      (or calendar) and two equal measures of time would exist simultaneously.
      The only way to compare them is by some regular constant motion, such as
      the spinning of the earth, which gives us day and night, and the
      revolution of the earth around the sun, which gives us a year.<br

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      (Objection 10 to Whether there can be forgiveness of sin without grace):
      Grace and guilt cannot be in the soul together. If, then, grace is infused
      for the forgiveness of guilt, the guilt must first have been in the soul
      when grace was not. Now since the guilt has ceased to be, a last instant
      can be designated in which the guilt existed. Similarly, since the grace
      begins to be, a first instant can be designated in which grace exists in
      the soul. But these must be two distinct instants, because grace and guilt
      cannot exist in the soul at the same time, as has been said. Between any
      two instants, however, there is an intervening time, as in proved in the
      <em>Physics</em>. There will therefore be a time in which man has neither
      guilt nor grace, and so grace is seemingly not necessary for the
      forgiveness of guilt. <b>(Reply):</b> To this and similar difficulties a
      number of answers are ordinarily given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is that, although that instant is really one, it is nevertheless
      several in thought, being the beginning of the future and the end of the
      past; and so nothing prevents guilt and grace from being in the soul at
      the same time, but in such a way that guilt is in that instant in so far
      as it is the end of the past, whereas grace is in it in so far as it is
      the beginning of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this again cannot stand. Because a line is an intrinsic measure, it is
      divided according to the distinction of real things. But time is an
      extrinsic measure and is one with regard to all things that are in time;
      for the existence of guilt is not measured by one time and that of grace
      by another, unless we mean by another time another part of the same
      continuous time. It is therefore necessary that between any two instants,
      whatever the things to which they may be referred, there should be an
      intervening time. Furthermore, two points on two line-segments in contact
      described on located bodies are united at a single point designated on an
      external line on the locating body; for contiguous beings are those whose
      extremities coincide. If, then, it is granted that distinct beings have
      distinct times which are not continuous but in a sense contiguous, it will
      nevertheless be necessary that in the time serving as the extrinsic
      measure there correspond to their end-points a single indivisible instant.
      Consequently the same inadmissible conclusion mentioned above, that guilt
      and grace are together, comes back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this account others say that, just as a line extends between two points
      on a single line but not between two points on two line-segments in
      contact at their end-points; in the same way it is not necessary that
      between the instant which is the last of the time in which guilt was
      present and the instant which is the first of the time in which grace is
      present, there be any intervening time, since they are instants of
      distinct times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this again cannot stand. For the distinction given implies different
      aspects of the instant which do not multiply its substance but leave it
      one. The real consequence is that guilt and grace are in the soul in the
      same indivisible point of time; for the term instant means an indivisible
      point of time. But this is to be together at the same time; and so it
      follows that contraries are in the same subject at the same time.
      Furthermore, according to the Philosopher [Physics, VII, 8; 262a22-27,
      b5-7], when anything in moving makes use of one point as two, a period of
      rest must intervene. It is by this argument that he proves that
      reciprocating motions (bouncing) are not continuous. Likewise, if anyone
      makes use of one instant as two, he must understand some interval; as a
      consequence the soul would at some time be without guilt or grace. But
      this is inadmissible. On this account others say that, just as a line
      extends between two points on a single line but not between two points on
      two line-segments in contact at their end-points; in the same way it is
      not necessary that between the instant which is the last of the time in
      which guilt was present and the instant which is the first of the time in
      which grace is present, there be any intervening time, since they are
      instants of distinct times. But this again cannot stand. Because a line is
      an intrinsic measure, it is divided according to the distinction of real
      things. But time is an extrinsic measure and is one with regard to all
      things that are in time; for the existence of guilt is not measured by one
      time and that of grace by another, unless we mean by
      <em>another time</em> another part of the same continuous time. It is
      therefore necessary that between any two instants, whatever the things to
      which they may be referred, there should be an itervening time.
      Furthermore, two points on two line-segments in contact described on
      located bodies are united at a single point designated on an external line
      on the locating body; for contiguous beings are those whose extremities
      coincide. If, then, it is granted that distinct beings have distinct times
      which are not continuous but in a sense continguous, it will nevertheless
      be necessary that in the time serving as the extrinsic measure there
      correspond to their end-points a single indivisible instant. Consequently
      the same inadmissible conclusion mentioned above, that guilt and grace are
      together, comes back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason others say that such spiritual changes are not measured by
      a time which is the number of the movement of the heavens, because the
      soul and every spiritual substance are above time; but they have their own
      time inasmuch as there is found in them a before an after. But this time
      is not continuous, since according to the Philosopher [ <em>Physics</em>,
      IV, 11; 219a 12-13] the continuity of time is dependent upon the
      continuity of motion, whereas the affections of the soul are not
      continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this likewise has no place in the matter at hand. For not only things
      essentially in time, but also those having an accidental reference to the
      movement of the heavens because they are dependent upon things that have
      an essential reference to the time just mentioned. And this holds even for
      the justification of sinners, which is dependent upon thoughts,
      conversations, and other such motions that are essentially measured by the
      time of the movement of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A different explanation must therefore be given: we cannot indicate the
      last instant in which the sinner had guilt, but the last time. We can,
      however, indicate the first instant in which he has grace, and this
      instant is the end of the time in which he had guilt; but between a time
      and the end of that time nothing intervenes. We therefore do not have to
      indicate any time or instant in which a person would have neither guilt
      nor grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is explained as follows. Since the infusion of grace takes place in
      an instant, it is the end of a continuous movement, such as a meditation
      by which the will is disposed for the reception of grace; and the end of
      the same movement is the forgiveness of guilt, for guilt is forgiven by
      the very fact that grace is infused. In that first instant, then, there is
      the end of the forgiveness of guilt, that is, the absence of guilt, and
      the end of the infusion of grace, that is, the possession of grace. Then
      in the whole preceding time that ends at this instant, by which the
      movement of the meditation just mentioned was measured, the sinner had
      guilt and not grace, except only at the last instant, as we have said. But
      before the last instant of this time we cannot pick out another
      immediately next to it, because, if any instant at all other than the last
      is taken, between it and the last there will be an infinite number of
      intervening instants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is clear that we cannot distinguish a last instant in which the
      person justified would have guilt and not have grace; but we can
      distinguish a first instant in which he has grace and does not have guilt.
      This solution can be gathered form the words of the Philosopher [
