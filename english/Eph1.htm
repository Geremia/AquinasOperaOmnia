  var WPFootnote2 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Often, St. Thomas&#8217; citations of Scripture contain minor variations from the Clementine edition of the Vulgate. For\
instance, he inserts here &#8220;so am I&#8221; after &#8220;They are ministers of Christ.&#8221; At other times his understanding of a Latin\
word or phrase is different from the meaning which the Douay-Rheims translation of the Vulgate conveys. In both\
these cases an asterisk (*) is placed immediately after the number of the verse; only significant variations will be\
mentioned in the notes. The &#8220;seed of Abraham&#8221; in 2 Cor. 11:22 is taken by Aquinas as a reference to St. Paul&#8217;s faith\
since &#8220;the men of faith are the real sons of Abraham.&#8221; (Gal. 3:7; also Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3,16). This provides the\
three correlations:<\/p>\
<p style="text-align: center">Israelites&#8212;Paul&#8217;s Jewish origin<\/p>\
<p style="text-align: center">Seed of Abraham&#8212;Paul&#8217;s religious faith<\/p>\
<p style="text-align: center">Ministers of Christ&#8212;Paul&#8217;s Apostleship<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote3 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas did not hesitate to apply several, or all, of the four metaphysical causes in his Scripture commentaries.\
In the Prologues to these commentaries he usually discusses the author (efficient cause), while the final cause is more\
often designated as the &#8220;subject matter,&#8221; the &#8220;intention of the author,&#8221; or the &#8220;utility&#8221; of the book or letter; cf.\
Prologues to the Psalms (Viv&egrave;s Ed., t. 18, p. 228), to the Lamentations and Jeremiah (<i>ibid., <\/i>t. 19, pp. 66-67, 199);\
they also appear in his introduction to the Pauline Corpus and many of Paul&#8217;s individual letters (Romans, Colossians,\
Philippians, etc.). He also applies them in a commentary proper; for example, cf. his comments on Ephesians 1, Lect.\
1; 2, Lects. 2 &amp; 5. On the development of this method, cf. Smalley, op. <i>cit., pp. <\/i>99, 116-17, 296-97; Spicq, op. cit.,\
col. 717.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote4 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Glossator in question is Peter Lombard (c. 1100-1160 A.D.), whose glosses on the Psalms and Pauline letters\
superseded those of the <i>Glossa Ordinaria. <\/i>A gloss would offer some ancient text, in the present instance an Old or\
New Testament book, accompanied by marginal and interlinear explanatory notes-usually quotations from the\
Fathers of the Church. On the mysteries surrounding the <i>Glossa Ordinaria, <\/i>falsely attributed to Walafraid Strabo,\
cf. Smalley, op. cit., pp. 55-66. 269.  When Aquinas refers to &#8220;the Gloss&#8221; he normally means Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea\
in Epistolis S. Pauli<\/i>, P.L. 191-92; thus of the thirteen references in his lectures on Ephesians to the Gloss all can be\
located in Lombard and only five in the <i>Glossa Ordinaria<\/i>, from which Lombard probably lifted them. The statement\
cited here is one of the five, it reads: &#8220;The Ephesians are Asians; having received the word of truth, they remained\
steadfast in faith. The Apostle praises them, writing from a prison in Rome through Tychius, a deacon.&#8221; P.L. 114,\
col. 587; 192, col. 169.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote5 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Ephesus, as a Greek city, owed its origin to the colonizing Ionians. It was an important port of Ancient Greece and\
under Roman rule became part of the province of Asia. Although oriental influences were increasing, Asia Minor\
was still predominantly Greek in language and culture when St. Paul travelled its roads. St. Thomas&#8217; use of &#8220;pars\
Graeciae&#8221; need not, then, connote political ties. Latin classical authors often referred to Lower Italy, inhabited by\
Greeks, as &#8220;Major Graecia,&#8221; and it may be in this more cultural sense that Aquinas thought of Asia Minor as &#8220;Part\
of Greece.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote6 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>It is commonly held today that St. Paul is the author of this Letter, but this authorship need not imply that he wrote\
every word of it. In his day dictation left more initiative to the scribes than that method does today. He probably\
wrote or dictated it during his Roman imprisonment, sometime between 61 and 63 A.D. Few modern scholars,\
however, maintain that it was addressed only to the Ephesian community. The &#8220;at Ephesus&#8221; of v.1 is missing from\
the best Greek manuscripts. It seems that this was a circular letter&#8212;hence its more impersonal tone as compared with\
other Pauline letters&#8212;intended for the Christian communities in Asia. Or, as P. Benoit, O.P., conjectures in his &#8220;les\
Epitres de la captivit&eacute;&#8221; Bible de Jerusalem (Paris: Ed. du Cerf, 1949), p. 73, it may have been intended for all the\
communities made up of recent converts from paganism. The &#8220;at Ephesus&#8221; was added later either because of the\
connection between Eph. 6:21-22 and 2 Tim. 4:12, or because it was found among the papers of the Ephesian\
Church.<\/p>\

by the English &#8220;habit.&#8221; For him virtue, or &#8220;bonus habitus,&#8221; is a spiritually creative power which is the exact opposite\
of the mechanical repetition of acts associated with the word &#8220;habit.&#8221; Cf. S. Pinchaera, O.P., &#8220;Virtue is not a Habit,&#8221;\

own sects.&#8221; However, it notes the &#8220;in their own deeds&#8221; of the Piana, which I have followed as fitting more into the\

  var WPFootnote10 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Appropriation occurs when an attribute which really belongs to the Divine Nature, and so is common to all Three\
Persons, is attributed to one of the Persons. We do this because the divine activities by which God creates and\
redeems us&#8212;his 11 ad extra&#8221; actions&#8212;are more easily grasped by us than the activity of his own inner life. Thus\
we take events which the whole Trinity accomplished and attribute them to one or another Person in order to better\
understand his personal properties, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 39, 7 and 8. For example, creation is attributed to the Father, truth to\
the Son, and love as it effects our sanctification (grace and peace) to the Holy Spirit.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote11 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas was dimly aware of the Hebrew usage regarding verb tenses and its influence on New Testament\
constructions, cf. Spicq, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, col. 706-07. His observation on the certainty of human salvation in Christ is\
characteristic of Paul&#8217;s thought. In the final stages of his thought, represented in the Captivity Letters, the Apostle\
views the temporal dimensions of our Christian existence in the light of the mystery of Christ already unifying the\
world of men and the cosmic forces in his glorified existence. Cf. L. Cerfaux, <i>Christ in the Theology of St. Paul<\/i>\
(New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1959), pp. 419-38, 532,-34; and D. M. Stanley, S.J., <i>Christ&#8217;s Resurrection in Pauline\
Soteriology<\/i> (Rome: Institutum Biblicum, 1961), pp. 216-17.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote12 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Augustine referred to is, of course, St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo and Doctor of the Church (354-430\
A.D.). The work St. Thomas had in mind is most likely <i>De Trinitate <\/i>1, 8, n. 17 (P.L. 42, 831). When we see God\
&#8220;face to face&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:12), &#8220;this contemplation is promised to us as the end of all our labors and the eternal\
fullness of our joys... Contemplation is indeed the reward of faith, and our hearts are purified by faith in preparation\
for this reward.&#8221; Translation of S. McKenna, C.SS.R. <i>Saint Augustine, The Trinity <\/i>(F.C. 1963), pp. 23-25. This idea\
is expanded in the final two chapters of Book 22 of <i>The City of God. <\/i>The supernatural virtue of charity is the\
&#8220;effective form&#8221; (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 23, 8 ad 1) of all the other virtuous acts, and thus formally sanctifies us because it directs\
us to God as he is in himself <i>(ibid., <\/i>23, 6c). The acts of any other virtue are holy only insofar as they share in this\
Godward impulse of charity <i>(ibid., <\/i>23, 7 &amp; 8).<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote13 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Note that the six blessings developed in this lecture are offered to all mankind; this does not mean that they are\
accepted by everyone. At the beginning of Lecture 5 Aquinas refers back to them as &#8220;the blessings offered generally\
to all the faithful.&#8221; In the Second Lecture he opts for a less involved exegesis of vv. 3-7; however, his theological\
reflections on these blessings remain valid. Many contemporary exegetes maintain that vv. 3-14 enumerate six\
blessings given men by God, cf. K. Sullivan, R.S.C.J., <i>The Captivity Epistles <\/i>(Collegeville: The Liturgical Press,\
1960), pp. 54-56.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote14 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Peter&#8217;s actions are not the cause of God&#8217;s willing him glory but they are <i>a <\/i>cause of his attaining glory. They are\
a cause only because God has willed them to be such; as St. Thomas expresses it: &#8220;There can be no merit on the part\
of man before God except on the presupposition that God has ordained it&#8221; (<i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 114, 1c). No one insists more\
strongly than Aquinas on the sinner&#8217;s absolute dependence on God to justify him (<i>ibid., <\/i>113); but he equally insists\
that God&#8217;s justifying word effects what it says. God&#8217;s love&#8212;unlike created love&#8212;presupposes no goodness but\
rather creates that goodness (<i>ibid., <\/i>110, 1c). For a similar presentation in a scriptural perspective, cf. H. Kung,\
&#8220;Justification and Sanctification in the New Testament,&#8221; in <i>Christianity Divided <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1962),\

  var WPFootnote15 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>One created effect, i.e., a creature, existing prior to another may be the cause of this other existing also. If so, the\
priority may be either of nature or of time depending on whether one views the succession of causes from the\
evolutive perspective of the imperfect beings preceding the more perfect&#8212;which is temporal priority&#8212;or, from the\
teleological perspective of nature intending the more perfect beings which the imperfect then strive to\
attain&#8212;priority of nature; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 77, 4c; 85, 3 ad 1. For an enlightening presentation of these priorities, cf. B.\
Lonergan, S.J., <i>Insight: A Study of Human Understanding <\/i>(New York: Philosophical Library, 1958); on a temporal\
priority cf. the schemes of recurrence in emergent probability, pp. 115-28; on natural priority cf. the upward directed\
dynamism of proportionate being, pp. 444-58, 665. Temporal succession does not affect God&#8217;s creative will-act\
which is eternal and comprehends all times &#8220;tota simul&#8221;; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 10, 1-4. For a further discussion of the freedom\
in the divine creative and predestining will-acts cf. <i>ibid., <\/i>I, 19, 5; 23, 5.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote16 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This views the relation of hands to the human mind in a teleological perspective. It is interesting to note that St.\
Thomas saw in the coordination of the human mind and human hands the radical power for a limitless technology,\
cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 76, 5 ad 4; 91, 3 ad 2. If the cause of the entire created universe was itself created it would perforce be\
simply a part of this <i>created <\/i>universe and so push the investigation back a step further. Note that Aquinas conceived\
the spiritual creation as included in this created universe, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 50, 1c; 61, 3 &amp; 4.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote17 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Pelagianism, one of the important heresies of the fifth and sixth centuries, owed its origin chiefly to Pelagius (c.\
360-420 A.D.), who spread the teaching-some of which he learned from Rufinus&#8212;that human nature had not been\
corrupted by original sin, and that man was not dependent on divine grace for his meritorious actions. In the present\
context &#8220;ratio&#8221; is sometimes translated as &#8220;motive.&#8221; When St. Thomas asserts that &#8220;the reason for predestination is\
the will of God alone&#8221; he is speaking in terms of the divine causality in itself (&#8220;ex parte volentis&#8221;). When seen in the\
perspective of man (&#8220;ex parte voliti&#8221;) grace, as St. Thomas mentioned several lines above, is the reason of\
predestination.<\/p>\

respectively. The former is given to individuals for the utility of the whole Christian community, e.g., the grace of\
prophecy; the latter effects the individual&#8217;s own personal sanctification, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 111, 1c; <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154;<i> Comm.\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The satisfaction of Christ should not be approached in a purely vindictive or juridic fashion, as though an angered\
God could be appeased only by terrible suffering on man~s part. The truly Christian notion of satisfaction was\
spelled out by St. Thomas: &#8220;He properly satisfies for an offense who presents the offended party with something this\
party loves just as much, or more, than he hates the offense.&#8221; <i>S.T.<\/i>, III, 48, 2c. Thus it is the <i>love <\/i>with which Christ\
offered <i>himself <\/i>that made the passion a truly redeeming sacrifice (<i>ibid., <\/i>48, 3 &amp; 4).<\/p>\

assert, against Judaizing pressures, God&#8217;s universal will to save all men. But then, if God willed all men to be saved,\
why did the Redeemer come so late in mankinds history? For the answers Christians gave cf. Tertullian, <i>Adv.\

things in Christ. But he took it to mean the restoration of all things into their original, purely spiritual state. This\
involved the purification or redemption of the damned, including the demons, cf. his <i>Peri Archon<\/i> I, 6 and III, 6.<i>\

<p style="text-align: justify">Not all the doctors agreed, however, on the listing of the First Hierarchy. St. John Chrysostom (c. 344-407 A.D.),\
Patriarch of Constantinople and Doctor of the Church, put Powers in the place of Thrones, cf. C.V. Heris, O.P., <i>le\
Gouvernement divin<\/i>, Vol. 1 (Paris: Ed. de Cerf, 1959) pp. 277-83. The Gregory here referred to is Pope St. Gregory\
the Great (540-604 A.D.). He treats of the heavenly hierarchies in his <i>Homilia 34 in Evangelia, <\/i>P.L. 76, 1250-51.\
During the Middle Ages, Dionysius was thought to be the Areopagite mentioned in Acts 17:34; this accounts for the\
great authority his writings enjoyed. It is now established that he probably lived in Syria during the first half of the\
fifth century. A Christian platonist and disciple of Proclus, his writings were translated into Latin by Scotus Erigena\
around 858 A.D. St. Thomas took him as a primary witness to the immediate post-apostolic Church. He commented\
on his <i>De Divinis Nominibus <\/i>and some have counted over 1,700 explicit references to Dionysius in Aquinas&#8217;\
writings. Fortunately, this thorough acquaintance with Greek Oriental theology influenced Thomas&#8217; own thought\
profoundly. Dionysius lists the angelic ranks in his <i>De Coelestia Hierarchia, <\/i>Ch. 77. (P.G. 3, 205 ff.).<\/p>\

in the world. First, there is a cause which is incorruptible and immutable, namely, the divine cause; second, beneath\
this there are causes which are incorruptible but mutable, namely, the celestial bodies; and third, beneath this there\
are those causes which are corruptible and mutable. Therefore causes in this third grade are particular causes and\
are determined to proper effects of the same kind; for example, fire generates fire, man generates man, and plants\
generate plants.&#8221; In the present lecture St. Thomas refers to the third category as &#8220;determinatio ad speciales effectus&#8221;\
which I have translated as &#8220;individual causes.&#8221; The celestial bodies are universal causes insofar as their causality\
extends to all terrestrial alteration, generation and corruption (cf. Appendix on Thomas&#8217; cosmology). God&#8217;s causality\
is most universal since its proper effect is existence itself: &#8220;Whatever exists, and in whatever way it exists, comes\
properly under the causality and direction of that (first) cause.&#8221; (Rowan&#8217;s translation of the <i>Meta., ibid., <\/i>n. 1209).\

course, applies only to knowledge connatural to angelic intelligences; regarding certain types of supernatural\
knowledge, cf. Ch. 3, Lect. 3 below). St. Thomas often refers to the whole of spiritual creation as angelic or as\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The concept of the Church as the &#8220;fullness&#8221; or <i>pleroma <\/i>of Christ is an important one for Paul. The sanctifying\
power of Divinity is &#8220;concentrated&#8221; in the risen body of Christ (cf. Cerfaux, <i>op..cit., pp. <\/i>426-29). But the Church\
is also the body of Christ: &#8220;This &#8216;fullness&#8217; which is present in Christ is less static than dynamic;&#8217; it is directed towards\
the sanctification of Christians through him... And so we can say that Christ is the sanctifying fullness of Christians.\
In keeping with this formula, but taking <i>pleroma <\/i>in the passive and concrete sense to mean the entirety of those who\
receive life and sanctification from Christ, Paul writes that the Church is the body of Christ, his <i>pleroma, <\/i>that is to\
say, the sphere in which is exercised the power of life and sanctification of him who &#8216;fulfills&#8217; holiness completely\
in all (Eph. 1:23).&#8221; L. Cerfaux, <i>The Church in the Theology of St. Paul <\/i>(New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1959), pp.\
322-23. The intimate union between the risen body of Christ and the Church (cf. S.T. 111, 8, 2) is certainly stressed\
by St. Thomas when he uses the relationship of soul and body to enunciate analogously the relation between Christ\
and the Church, his <i>pleroma.<\/i><\/p>\

    Although St. Paul did not initiate the Ephesians into the faith, the Apostle
    is justly praised for having strengthened them in it. Of the Church at
    Ephesus he rightfully can claim:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">I have strengthened its pillars</span> —I
    who am an Israelite in nationality, a Christian in religion, an Apostle in
    dignity.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    A Jew by birth, for I am an Israelite sprung from Abraham’s seed in the
    tribe of Benjamin (cf. 2 Cor. 11:22; Rom. 11: 1). A Christian in religion,
    “For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God; with
    Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ lives in
    me. And [the life] that I live now in the flesh, I live in the faith of the
    Son of God” (Gal. 2:19-20). An Apostle in dignity since I am the least of
    the apostles” (1 Cor. 15:9). These three are found in 2 Corinthians 11
    (22-23*): “They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am
    I. They are the ministers of Christ, so am I. I speak as one less wise: I am

    Everyone who proclaims saving wisdom, like Paul, must be an Israelite in his

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    I, therefore, am a Jew by birth, seeking God through faith, and am an
    Apostle of God through following the example [of the twelve].
    <span style="font-weight: bold">I have strengthened</span> them lest they
    falter in their faith, as the workman will buttress a building against a
    fall. “And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers” (Lk. 22:32),
    was spoken to Peter and accomplished by Paul. A verse in Job 4 (4) applies
    to him: “Your words have upheld the stumbler.” The bishop confirms a boy to
    fortify him against becoming spiritless; similarly, Paul has strengthened
    the Ephesians not to fear unreasonably. In this connection, Psalm 89 (21-22)
    says of David: “I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have
    anointed him. For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    “By the word of the Lord,” written through Paul, “the heavens,” applying to
    the Ephesians, “were established” (Ps. 33:6) lest they lose their prize of
    glory, just as a prelate or prince ratifies a gift to protect it against
    theft. Psalm 41 (13) prays: “Because of my perfection grasp me, and set me
    before you forever.” Psalm 68 (29) also asks for strengthening power: “Send,
    my God, your strength; strengthen, God, what you have built for us.” The
    Apostle promised these divine aids in 2 Thessalonians 3 (3): “But the Lord
    is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">I have strengthened its pillars</span>,
    namely, the Church’s faithful at Ephesus. They are referred to as pillars
    since they must be straightforward, upright, and strong—straightfoward
    through faith, upright through hope, and strong because of charity. I say
    straightforward through faith because faith reveals the straight and true
    way to arrive at the fatherland; it is symbolized by the pillar of cloud in
    Exodus 13 (21): “And the Lord went before them to show the way by day in a
    pillar of a cloud.” Faith, similar to clouds, is opaque with its mysteries,
    dissolves when it gives way to vision, and moistens by arousing devotion.
    [The faithful are] upright through hope, for hope points heavenwards; it is
    symbolized by the column of smoke in Judges 20 (40): “The signal rose from
    the city as a pillar of smoke.” Hope, like smoke from fire, springs from
    charity, ascends upward, and finally vanishes in glory. [The faithful must
    be] strong through charity, “for love is strong as death” (Cant. 8:6);
    hence, it is symbolized by a pillar of fire capable of consuming everything,
    as in Wisdom 18 (3): “Therefore, [they received] a burning pillar of fire
    for a guide on the unknown journey.” As fire makes the surroundings visible,
    puts metals to the test, and destroys what can burn, so charity enlightens
    human actions, examines one’s motives, and exterminates all vices.

    The efficient cause of this letter is, of course, St. Paul; this cause was
    ascribed to the <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> of Psalm 75 (4).
    The final cause is to fortify, designated by the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">have strengthened</span>. The material cause
    is the Ephesians, as noted under
    <span style="font-weight: bold">its pillars</span>. The formal cause will be
    understood in the structural divisions of the letter and its method of
    presentation.

    prefaces this letter with a prologue or summary expressing two main ideas:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify">First, he describes them [the recipients].</p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he gives the reason and circumstances of writing, at “The Apostle
    praises them.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The Ephesians, to whom he wrote, are described in three ways: first, by
    their locality, “the Ephesians are Asians,” coming from Asia Minor; second,
    by their religion, “they have accepted the word” of Christian “truth”; third
    is their constancy, “they have remained steadfast in the faith.” The first
    has reference to their home country, the second to grace, and the third to
    perseverance.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    At “The Apostle praises them...” he adds the reason and circumstance for
    writing; secondly, the author is “the Apostle”; thirdly, the place from
    which he writes is “from a prison in Rome”; fourthly, the messenger through
    whom he writes is Tychius, a deacon” (cf. Eph. 6:21).

    They were not initiated into the faith by the Apostle Paul but he did
    strengthen them in it. Even before he had met them, they had been converted,
    as can be gathered from Acts 19 (1): “It happened that, while Appollo was at
    Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, where he
    found certain disciples.” Once they were converted and fortified by the
    Apostle, they were steadfast in the faith, not succumbing to false doctrine.
    Thus, they were entitled to encouragement rather than reprimand; and Paul’s
    letter has a tone of reassurance and not of rebuke. He wrote them from the
    city of Rome through the deacon, Tychicus.”

    whereas the title of <span style="font-weight: bold">Apostle</span> is one
    of dignity; the reason is that “he that humbles himself shall be exalted”
    (Lk. 14:11; 18:14). An Apostle, I mean,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of Jesus</span> and not one of the
    pseudo-apostles who are of Satan: “It is no great thing if his [Satan’s]
    ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice” (2 Cor. 11:15). I am
    an apostle, he says, not by my own merits but
    <span style="font-weight: bold">by the will of God</span>. In many instances
    it is just the opposite—“They have reigned, but not by me” (Hos. 8:4).

    holy through the exercise of virtues; and about faith to those who believe
    with true knowledge. Or, [it may mean], to the saints who are the elders and
    perfect [members], and to the faithful who are less experienced and

    He adds here the formula of greeting which indicates three qualities which
    make any gift pleasing: the sufficiency of the gift, in
    <span style="font-weight: bold">grace be to you and peace</span>; the power
    of the giver, <span style="font-weight: bold">from God our Father</span>;
    and the excellence of the mediator,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and from the Lord Jesus Christ</span>. For a
    gift is pleasing when what is given is sufficient and is offered by someone
    in power, as a king or prince, and is presented by a solemn messenger, for
    example, by his son.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He mentions <span style="font-weight: bold">grace</span> meaning
    justification from sin,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and peace</span> which is calmness of mind,
    or reconciliation to God, in regard to the freedom from punishment due to
    sin. May this be to you from God our Father from whom every good comes:
    “Every good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from
    the Father of lights” (Jam. 1:17). And the Lord Jesus Christ without whom no
    blessings are given. That is why nearly all the [liturgical] prayers are
    concluded “through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The Holy Spirit is not mentioned
    in the greeting form ula since he is the bond uniting Father and Son and is
    understood when they are mentioned; or he is understood in the gifts
    appropriated to him, grace and peace.

    Thirdly, because of the Apostle himself, whose ministry and solicitude has
    confirmed them in their good state (Ch. 3).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He treats of six blessings offered generally to the human race:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, that of praising [God] in the certainty of future beatitude (1:3).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    Secondly, that of being chosen in the foreordained separation from those
    headed toward destruction (1: 4).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    Thirdly, that of predestination in the foreordained community of the good,
    namely, of the adopted sons (1:5).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Fourthly, that of becoming pleasing [to God] through the gift of grace (1:
    6b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Fifthly, that of being redeemed, liberated from the punishment of diabolical
    slavery (1: 7a).
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"

    Sixthly, that of being pardoned by having sin blotted out (1:7b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Regarding the benefit of praise (v. 3) two aspects are touched on:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, the praise itself which should be rendered, at Blessed be God.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, the blessing on account of which it should be rendered, at who
    hath blessed us.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He says that God should be <span style="font-weight: bold">blessed</span> or
    praised by you, me and others with our hearts, tongues and actions. He who
    is <span style="font-weight: bold">God</span> by the divine essence
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and Father</span> because of his property of
    generating [the Son]. The copula
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> is not placed between God and
    Father to designate two separate persons, for there is only one Father, but
    to denote what he is by his essence and what he is in relation to the Son.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Father</span>, I say, of our Lord Jesus

    Even though by our own merits we were cursed, he blessed us
    <span style="font-weight: bold">with every spiritual blessing</span> both
    for soul and for body. For then the body will be spiritual: “It is sown a
    natural body: it shall rise a spiritual body” (1 Cor. 15:44). [This will
    occur] by a blessing enjoyed
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in heavenly places</span>, that is, in
    heaven, and <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ</span> since it will
    be through Christ or by Christ’s action: “For he himself will transform our
    lowly body” (Phil. 3:21).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This blessing is greatly to be desired. And this by reason of its efficient
    cause since <span style="font-weight: bold">God</span> is the one who
    blesses; and by reason of its material cause since
    <span style="font-weight: bold">he has blessed us</span>; and because of the
    formal cause since he blessed us
    <span style="font-weight: bold">with every spiritual blessing</span>; and on
    account of the end, he blessed us
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in heavenly places</span>. “Behold, thus
    shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord” (Ps. 127:4).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (v. 4), he treats of the blessing of election; he sets forth the
    advantages of this election because: it is free,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">as he chose us in him</span>; it is eternal,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">before the foundation of the world</span>;
    it is fruitful,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that we should be holy</span>; and it is
    gratuitous, <span style="font-weight: bold">in charity</span>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore he states: He blessed us in the same way—not through our merits
    but from the grace of Christ—
    <span style="font-weight: bold">as he chose us</span> and, separating us
    from those headed to destruction, freely foreordained us in him, that is,
    through Christ. “You have not chosen me; but I have chosen you” (Jn. 15:16).
    This happened
    <span style="font-weight: bold">before the foundation of the world</span>,
    from eternity, before we came into being. For when the children were not yet
    born, nor had done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
    election, might stand” (Rom. 9:11).
    <span style="font-weight: bold">He chose us</span>, I say, not because we
    were holy—we had not yet come into existence—but that
    <span style="font-weight: bold">we should be holy</span> in virtues
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and unspotted</span> by vices. For election
    performs this twofold action of justice: “Turn away from evil and do good”
    (Ps. 33:15).

    <span style="font-weight: bold">in his sight</span> may mean that we may
    gaze on him since the [beatific] vision, according to Augustine, is the
    whole of our reward. He will accomplish this, not by our merits, but in his

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Then (v. 5) he adds the third blessing, that of predestination in the
    foreordained community of those who are good. Six characteristics of
    predestination are sketched here. First, it is an eternal act,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">having predestinated</span>; secondly, it
    has a temporal object, <span style="font-weight: bold">us</span>; thirdly,
    it offers a present privilege,
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >the adoption of children through Jesus Christ</span
    >; fourthly, the result is future,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">unto himself</span>; fifthly, its manner [of
    being realized] is gratuitous,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the purpose of his will</span>;
    sixthly, it has a fitting effect,
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >unto the praise of the glory of his grace</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Hence he affirms that God,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">having predestinated us</span>, has
    fore-chosen us by grace alone
    <span style="font-weight: bold">unto the adoption of children</span> that we
    might share with the other adopted children the goods yet to come—thus he
    says <span style="font-weight: bold">unto the adoption of children</span>.
    “For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have
    received the spirit of adoption of sons,” and further on, “waiting for the
    adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body” (Rom. 8:15 & 23).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It must be through contact with fire that something starts to burn since
    nothing obtains a share in some reality except through whatever is that
    reality by its very nature. Hence the adoption of sons has to occur through
    the natural son. For this reason the Apostle adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">through Jesus Christ</span>, which is the
    third characteristic touched on in this blessing, namely, the mediator who
    draws all to himself. “God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the
    law, that he might redeem them who were under the law, that we might receive
    the adoption of sons” (Gal. 4:4-5). This is accomplished
    <span style="font-weight: bold">unto himself</span>, that is, inasmuch as we
    are conformed to him and become servants in the Spirit. “See what love the
    Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; and
    so we are,” after which comes: “We know that when he shall appear we shall
    be like him” (1 Jn. 3:1-2).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Here it should be noted that the likeness of the predestined to the Son of
    God is twofold. One is imperfect, it is [the likeness] through grace. It is
    called imperfect, firstly, becatise it only concerns the reformation of the
    soul. Regarding this Ephesians 4 (23-24) states: “Be renewed in the spirit
    of your mind, and put on the new man, who according to God is created in
    justice and holiness of truth.” Secondly, even with the soul it retains some
    imperfection, “for we know in part” (1 Cor. 13:9). However, the second
    likeness, which will be in glory, will be perfect; both as regards the
    body—“He will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body.” (Phil.
    3:21)—and in regard to the soul—“when the perfect comes, the imperfect shall
    pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    What the Apostle says, therefore, about his predestinating us unto the
    adoption of children can refer to the imperfect assimilation to the Son of
    God possessed in this life through grace. But it is more probable that it
    refers to the perfect assimilation to the Son of God which will exist in the
    fatherland. In reference to this adoption Romans 8 (23) asserts: “Even we
    ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of
    God.”

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Divine predestination is neither necessitated on God’s part nor due to those
    who are predestined; it is rather
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the purpose of his will</span>.
    This is the fourth characteristic which recommends the blessing to us, for
    it springs from pure love. Predestination, according to [how man] conceives
    it, presupposes election, and election love. A twofold cause of this immense
    blessing is designated here. One is the efficient cause— which is the simple
    will of God—
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the purpose of his will</span>.
    “Therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wills; and whomever he wills he
    hardens” (Rom. 9:18). “Of his own will he has given us birth by the word of
    truth (Jam. 1:18).
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >Unto the praise of the glory of his grace</span
    >
    specifies the final cause which is that we may praise and know the goodness
    of God. Once again this eminent blessing is recommended inasmuch as the
    homage [it results in] is in accord with itself. For the [efficient] cause
    of divine predestination is simply the will of God, while the end is a
    knowledge of his goodness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Whence it should be realized that Gods will in no way has a cause but is the
    first cause of everything else. Nevertheless, a certain motive can be
    assigned to it in two ways. On the part of the one willing, the motive for
    the divine will is his own goodness which is the object of the divine will,
    moving it to act. Hence, the reason for everything that God wills is his own
    goodness: “Yahweh has made everything for his own purpose” (Prov. 16:4). On
    the side of what is willed, however, some created existent can be a motive
    for the divine will; for example, when he wills to crown Peter because he
    has fought well (cf. 2 Tim. 4:7-8). But this latter is not the cause of
    [God’s] willing; rather it is a cause of it happening the way it did.

      }
    </script>
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged how, in the realm of what is willed,
    effects are a motive for the divine will in such a way that a prior effect
    is the reason for a later one.
    <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote15',%20WPFootnote15%20)"
      ><img
        src="footnoteicon.gif"

        );
        document.write("<\/span>");
      }
    </script>
    But when the primary effect [i.e., the perfection of the Universe] is
    arrived at, no further reason can be given for that effect except the divine
    will. For instance, God wills that men should have hands that they might be
    of service to his mind;
    <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16',%20WPFootnote16%20)"
      ><img
        src="footnoteicon.gif"
        alt="Footnote"

    <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
      if (bInlineFloats) {

        document.write(WPFootnote16);
        document.write(
          "<br><a href=\"javascript:WPHide('WPFootnote16')\">Close<\/a>"
        );
        document.write("<\/span>");
      }
    </script>
    and [he wills] man to possess a mind since he wills him to be a man; and he
    wills man to exist for the sake of the perfection of the Universe. Now since
    this is what is primarily effected in creation, no further reason for the
    Universe can be assigned within the domain of creatures themselves; [it
    lies] rather within the domain of the Creator, which is the Divine Will.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In this perspective, neither can predestination find any reason on the part
    of the creature but only on the part of God. For there are two effects of
    predestination, grace and glory. Within the realm of what is willed [by
    God], grace can be identified as a reason for the effects which are oriented
    towards glory. For example, God crowned Peter because he fought well, and he
    did this because he was strengthened in grace. But no reason for the grace,
    as a primary effect, can be found on the part of man himself which would
    also be the reason for predestination. This would be to assert that the
    source of good works was in man by himself and not by grace. Such was the
    heretical teaching of the Pelagians who held that the source of good works
    exists within ourselves. Thus it is evident that the reason for
    predestination is the will of God alone, on account of which the Apostle
    says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the purpose of his will</span>.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To understand how God creates everything and wills it because of his own
    goodness, it should be realized that someone can work for an end in two
    ways. [A person may act] either in order to attain an end, as the sick take
    medicine to regain their health; or [he may act] out of a love of spreading
    the end, as a doctor will work to communicate health to others. But God
    needs absolutely nothing external to himself, according to Psalm 16 (2):
    “Yahweh, you are my Lord; you are my Good; there is none above you. [Vul:
    you have no need of my goods].” Therefore, when it is said that God wills
    and performs everything on account of his own goodness, this should not be
    understood as though he acted in order to confer goodness on himself but
    rather to communicate goodness to others.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This divine goodness is properly communicated to rational creatures in order
    that the rational creature himself might know it. Thus, everything that God
    performs in reference to rational creatures is for his own praise and glory,
    according to Isaiah 43 (7): “Everyone called by my name, whom I have created
    for my glory, whom I have formed and made” so that he may know what goodness
    is, and in this knowledge praise it. The Apostle thus adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >unto the praise of the glory of his grace</span
    >, that man might realize how much God must be praised and glorified.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nor does he say “unto the praise of justice.” For justice enters into the
    picture only where a debt is present or is to be returned. But for man to be
    predestined to eternal life is not due to him—as was said, it is a grace
    given in perfect freedom. Nor does he simply say
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of the glory</span>, but annexes
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of his grace</span> as though it were of a
    glorious grace. And grace is just this; the greatness of grace is revealed
    in that it consists in the greatness of glory. [Its grandeur is shown] also
    in the way it is bestowed; for he gives it without any preceding merits when
    men are unworthy of it. “God proves his love for us in that while we were
    yet sinners Christ died for us”; and a little further on, “when we were
    enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son” (Rom. 5:8 & 10).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    By now it must be clear how divine predestination neither has nor can have
    any cause but the will of God alone. This, in turn, reveals how the only
    motive for God’s predestinating will is to communicate the divine goodness
    to others.<br />

        Now the Apostle writes of the fourth blessing (cf. 1:3), that of
        becoming pleasing [to God] through the gift of grace. Regarding this he
        does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he touches on the giving of this blessing.
      </p>
      <p
        style="

        "
      >
        Secondly, he shows the manner and conditions of its bestowal (1:7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence he first asserts: We are predestined unto the adoption of sons,
        for the praise of the glory of his grace—that grace, I say,
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >in which he hath graced us in his beloved Son</span
        >. In this respect, it should be noted that to be loved by someone is
        identical to being pleasing to him. For he is pleasing to ine whom I
        love. Now, since God loved us from eternity—he chose us before the
        foundation of the world in love, as has been said (1:4)—how has he made
        us pleasing to himself in time? A reply is that those whom he loves
        eternally in himself, he renders pleasing [to himself] in time according
        as they exist in their own natures. The former [his love] is from
        eternity and is not created, the latter happens in time and is said to
        come into being. Hence the Apostle says that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">he hath graced us</span>, that is, made
        us pleasing that we should be worthy of his love. “See what love the
        Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God;
        ans so we are” (1 Jn. 3:1).

    The latter is the grace dealt with here.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Notice how persons can be loved for the sake of others, or for their own
    sake. For when I love someone very much, I love him and whatever belongs to
    him. We are loved by God, not for what we are in ourselves, but in him who
    by himself is beloved of the Father. Thus the Apostle adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in his beloved Son</span> on account of whom
    he loves us and to the degree that we are like him. For love is based on
    similarity: “Every beast loves its like: so also every man his neighbor”
    (Sir. 13:15). By his own nature, the Son is similar to the Father, he is
    beloved before all else and essentially. Hence he is naturally, and in a
    most excellent way, loved by the Father. We, on the other hand, are sons
    through adoption to the degree that we are conformed to his Son; in this way
    we enjoy a certain participation in the divine love. “The Father loves the
    Son, and has given all things into his hand. He who believes in the Son has
    life everlasting” (Jn. 3:35-36). “He has transferred us into the kingdom of
    the Son he loves” (Col. 1: 13).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (1:7), he sets down the way itself [that grace is given]. Concerning
    this he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, the part of Christ in the way it is given.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, the part of God in it, at according to the riches of his grace (1:
    7b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    On the part of Christ he writes of two ways through which Christ has made us
    pleasing [to God]. For within us there exists two antagonisms to the divine
    good pleasure, the stains of sin and the punishing injuries [sin inflicts].
    justice is as opposed to sin as life is to death, so that through sin,
    having departed from our likeness to God, we cease being pleasing to God.
    But through Christ he has made us pleasing. First, indeed, by abolishing the
    punishment; and in reference to this he says that in Christ
    <span style="font-weight: bold">we have redemption</span> from the slavery
    of sin. “You know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as
    gold or silver, from the vain manner of life handed down from your fathers:
    but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled”
    (1 Pet. 1:18-19). “You have redeemed [us] for God, by thy blood” (Apoc.
    5:9).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, we are said to be redeemed because through Christ we are freed
    from a slavery in which we were caught as a result of sin without ourselves
    being capable of fully making satisfaction. By dying for us, Christ has
    satisfied the Father and thus the penalty of sin was abolished.

      }
    </script>
    Whence he says unto
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the remission of sins</span>. “Behold the
    Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (Jn. 1:29). “It is written
    that Christ should suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and that
    penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name” (Lk.
    24:46-47).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The way [we are blessed with grace] on God’s part is set down in
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the riches of his grace</span>.
    As though he said: In making us pleasing to himself, God not only forgave us
    our sins, but be gave his own Son to make reparation on our behalf. This was
    from an overflowing graciousness by which he willed to preserve the human
    race’s honor while, as though in justice, willing men to be freed from the
    slavery of sin and death through the death of his own Son. Thus, in saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the riches of his grace</span>
    he seems to state: That we were redeemed and made pleasing [to God] through
    the satisfaction of his Son comes from an overflowing grace and mercy since
    mercy and compassion are bestowed on those having no claim to it.

    which seems to be a far-fetched exposition since the same idea expressed in
    one phrase occurs in another.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">He chose us</span> is the same as to say he
    <span style="font-weight: bold">predestinated us</span>. And the same idea
    is expressed in that
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >we should be holy and unspotted as in unto the adoption of children</span
    >.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In this regard it should be known that the customary procedure of the
    Apostle, when speaking of a difficult subject, is to explain what went
    before by what immediately follows. This is not verbal proliferation but an
    exposition; and this is the method the Apostle uses here. Retaining the same
    import of the words, we may divide it differently from the beginning (v. 3)
    into three sections:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    First, the Apostle gives thanks in
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">
    Secondly, he mentions conjointly the bestowal of all blessings in
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in
      Christ</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p
    style="
      text-align: justify;
      text-indent: -0.240833in;
      margin-left: 0.5in;
      margin-bottom: 0.125in;
    "
  >
    Thirdly, he gives a clear expression of the divine blessings in particular
    (v. 4 ff.).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This latter is divided into two parts:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    First, he distinctly formulates the blessings.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he interprets them (v. 5).
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    He formulates the blessings:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
    First, as regards election, in
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p
    style="
      text-align: justify;
      text-indent: -1.24333in;
      margin-left: 1.24333in;
      margin-bottom: 0.125in;
    "
  >
    Secondly, as regards its consequences,
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight</span
    >.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First, he treats of election, for there are two types of election, one
    involving a present justification and another an eternal predestination.
    Concerning the first John 6 (71) states: “Have not I chosen you twelve? And
    one of you is a devil?” But this is not what the Apostle refers to since it
    did not occur
    <span style="font-weight: bold">before the foundation of the world</span>.
    So he immediately clarifies what he means, that it is the second type,
    eternal predestination. Thus he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Who hath predestinated us</span>... (v. 5).
    As he said <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ</span> (v. 3) to
    signify that we are assimilated and conformed to Christ in proportion as we
    are [God’s] adopted children, so he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ</span
    >. What he means by <span style="font-weight: bold">in charity</span> he
    explains when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >In whom we have redemption through his blood</span
    >. As though he affirmed: We have, etc.

    Whence the rashness—not to say error—of those who dare equate the grace and
    glory of some saints with that of the Apostles. For this passage openly
    asserts that the Apostles are more fully graced than the other saints,
    except for Christ and his Virgin Mother. However, should it be claimed that
    other saints were able to merit as much as the Apostles merited, and
    consequently would have as much grace, it must be said that this would be a
    good argument if grace was given according to merits—but if that were the
    case, “grace is no more grace” (Rom. 11:6).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Greater dignity was preordained by God to some saints, and hence he infused
    grace more abundantly into them. For example, he imparted a unique grace to
    Christ as man when he assumed [the humanity] into the unity of the [Second]
    Person. He endowed with special graces in both her body and soul, the
    glorious Virgin Mary whom he chose to be his mother. Similarly, those God
    called to a unique dignity, the Apostles, were gifted with a corresponding
    favor of grace. Thus the Apostle states in Romans 8 (23): “ourselves also,
    who have the first fruits of the Spirit.” And a Gloss comments: “their share
    is first in time and more copious than others.”

    What rashness, therefore, to put some later saint on the same level with the
    Apostles.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    God’s grace has superabounded in the Apostles, [enriching them] with all
    wisdom. For the Apostles are set over the Church to be her pastors: “And I
    will give you pastors according to my own heart: and they shall feed you
    with knowledge and doctrine” (Jer. 3:15). Two qualities should characterize
    pastors: a profound knowledge of divine truths and an assiduous fulfillment
    of religious actions. They must teach those trusted to them the true faith;
    this requires that wisdom which consists in a knowledge of the divine,
    concerning which he remarks
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in all wisdom</span>. “For I will give you a
    mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and
    gainsay” (Lk. 21:15). They also need
    <span style="font-weight: bold">prudence</span> to guide their subjects in
    external and temporal affairs: “Be therefore prudent as serpents and simple
    as doves” (Mt. 10:16). Thus the special blessing of wisdom given to the
    Apostles is clearly expressed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The reception of an uncommon revelation is their next blessing,
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that he might make known unto us the mystery of his will</span
    >. As if he had said: Our wisdom does not consist in discovering the natures
    of material realities, nor the course of the stars, or such like; rather, it
    concerns Christ alone. “I decided not to know any thing among you, but Jesus
    Christ, and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2). Hence he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might make known the mystery</span>,
    that is, the sacred secret, hidden from the beginning, the mystery of the
    Incarnation. He adds the cause of this hidden mystery when he says his will.
    Future events are known only if their causes are; for example, we can
    determine a future eclipse only by knowing what causes an eclipse.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now the mystery of the Incarnation has God’s will as its cause since he
    willed to become incarnate on account of his intense love for men: “For God
    so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son” (Jn. 3:16). Yet God’s
    will is more hidden than anything else: “No one knows what pertains to God,
    but the Spirit of God” (1 Cor. 2:11). So, the cause of the Incarnation was
    concealed from everyone except those to whom God revealed it through the
    Holy Spirit, as the Apostle mentions: “God has revealed to us through the
    Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God” (1 Cor.
    2:10). Hence he affirms
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might make known the mystery</span>
    which is a sacred secret—a secret because it is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of his will</span>. “I thank you, Father,
    Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the wise and clever
    and revealing them to little children” (Mt. 11:25). “The mystery, hidden
    from ages and generations, and now made manifest to his saints, to whom God
    would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery.” (Col. 1:26-27).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He then explains something about this mystery (vv. 9-10). His thought is
    involved and should be construed as:
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that he might make known unto us the mystery of his will</span
    >, which mystery is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">to re-establish all things in Christ</span>,
    that is, through Christ. All, namely, that are in heaven and on earth. This
    re-establishment in Christ must be
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >in the dispensation of the fulness of times</span

    briefly sums up the cause. Although whatever pleases God is good, goodness
    is preeminently (<i>antonomostice</i>) suited to God’s pleasure in this
    [effecting of the Incarnation] because through it we are led to perfectly
    enjoy goodness. As Psalm 146 (11) declares: “Yahweh is pleased with those
    who fear him, who rely on his strength”; and Romans 12 (2): “that you may
    prove what is the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God.”

    The suitable time was in that dispensation of the fulness of times which
    Galatians 4 (4-5) speaks of: “But when the fulness of the time came, God
    sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, that he might redeem them
    who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.” The
    pointless problem pagans used to raise is thus brushed aside by the Apostle.

    For as Job 24 (1) remarks: “Why are times not hidden from Shaddai? [Vul:
    Times are not hidden from the Almighty.]” He orders and arranges everything,
    including time; for he manages and accommodates the passage of time to those
    events which he wills to exist at the right moment. Just as other events
    effected by him bad their specified time, likewise he eternally preordained
    a time for the mystery of the Incarnation. This time, a Gloss

    Creator—“For, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools” (Rom.
    1:22)—and of his own absolute inability to live up to the prescriptions of
    the written Law. Thus men, no longer trusting in their own wisdom and power,
    would not consider Christ’s advent as unimportant. Weak, and to a certain
    extent ignorant, they would eagerly desire the Christ.

    The mystery’s purpose is to
    <span style="font-weight: bold">re-establish all things</span>. Inasmuch as
    everything is made for mankind, everything would be re-established [when man
    was redeemed]: “In that day I will raise up the booth of David that had
    fallen; I will close up its breaches and rebuild it as long ago” (Am. 9:11).
    Everything that is <span style="font-weight: bold">in heaven</span>, namely,
    the angels. Christ did not die for the angels, but in redeeming mankind “he
    shall fill the ruins” (Ps. 109:6) left by the sin of the angels. Beware of
    the error Origen fell into, as if the damned angels were to be redeemed
    through Christ; this was only a figment of his imagination.

    is no more than a search for divine guidance in contingent and human
    affairs. Augustine, commenting on Psalm 30 (16), teaches that casting lots
    is not an evil but a means of discovering God’s will in a doubtful issue.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nonetheless, three sins must be avoided. First, is superstition; for any
    religion which is shallow and immoral is superstition. The forbidden sin of
    superstition would be incurred when the casting of lots is performed in
    league with the devil. For instance, Ezechiel 21 (26) relates how: “the king
    of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking
    divination, shuffling arrows: he consulted the idols and looked at the
    liver.” The shuffling of the arrows is related to sortilege, and the
    questioning of idols belongs to superstition. Sortilege, moreover, is
    condemmed there (Ez. 21) among sins pertaining to superstition.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, the sin of tempting God must be shunned. As long as a man can
    discover and accomplish by himself what he ought to do, he tempts God if he
    resorts to lots, or any other such method, to ascertain what he should do.
    Only when unavoidably threatened by situations where one is powerless by
    himself can a man licitly resort to [extraordinary ways of] questioning God
    concerning what he must do. “But as we know not what to do, we can only turn
    our eyes to you” (2 Par. 20:12). Vanity is the third sin. It is committed if
    we inquire into futile matters not pertaining to us; for example, contingent
    events in the future. “It is not for you to know the times or moments, which
    the Father hath put in his own power” (Ac. 1:7).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Relative to this [purpose for which they are cast], there are three types of
    lots: some are divisory, others are consultatory, while still others are
    divinatory.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Divisory lots are those which people cast when they are dividing an
    inheritance and cannot agree. Using a certain slip of paper, or the like
    they declare: Whoever it will fall to shall have this part of the
    inheritance. Such lots can be cast lawfully: “The lot puts an end to
    disputes, and decides between powerful contenders” (Prov. 18:18) when they
    wish to divide in this way.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consultatory lots are used when someone doubts what he should do and
    consults God by casting lots. Jonas 1 (7) recounts how, when the great storm
    came upon them at sea, they cast lots to seek information from God that they
    might know for whose sin the tempest had occurred. This method is licit,
    especially in necessities and in the elections of secular rulers. Hence, men
    will make small wax balls called “bussuli,” of which some contain slips of
    paper and others none. Whoever draws a “bussulus” with the paper inside has
    a voice in the election. This was done also, previous to the Holy Spirit’s
    coming, in spiritual elections, evidenced in the choice of Mathias by lot
    (Ac. 1:26). Now that the Holy Spirit has come, however, it is no longer
    lawful in these elections since making. use of them would be an insult to
    the Holy Spirit. It must be believed, after all, that the Holy Spirit will
    provide his Church with good pastors. After the Holy Spirit’s advent,
    therefore, when the Apostles chose the seven deacons (cf. Ac. 6), they did
    not cast lots. Thus, this method is not lawful in any ecclesiastical
    election.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Divinatory lots augur future events reserved to the divine knowledge alone.
    They always are colored by vainglory, nor can they be resorted to without a
    sinful curiosity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Lots, therefore, are nothing other than a questioning concerning realities
    whose occurrence depends on the divine will. Since grace depends on the
    divine will alone, the grace of divine election is termed a lot. For God, as
    though by lot, according to his hidden providence, calls men through an
    inner grace and not on account of anyone’s merits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next, when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">predestined according to his purpose</span>,
    he writes of the free predestination of God concerning which Romans 8 (30)
    deals: “And those he predestinated he has also called.” The reason for this
    predestination is not our merits but the will of God alone, on account of
    which he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the purpose of him</span>. “And
    we know that to those who love God, all things work together unto good; to
    those who are called according to his purpose” (Rom. 8:28).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He approves of what he has predestined according to his purpose since not
    only this, but also everything else that God does
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >he worketh according to the counsel of his will</span
    >. “Whatever he wills Yahwe does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and in
    all the depths” (Ps. 135:6). “My counsel shall stand, and what I like I
    shall do” (Is. 46: 10). He did not say “according to his will” lest you
    would believe it was irrational, but
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the counsel of his will</span>.
    This means, according to his will which arises from reason; not that reason
    here implies any transition in his thoughts,

  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Finally, he briefly mentions the end of one’s predestination and vocation,
    namely, the praise of God. Thus he states that we may be unto the praise of
    his glory, we who before hoped in Christ. Through us, who believe in Christ,
    the glory of God is extolled. “The mountains and hills shall sing praise
    before you” (Is. 55:12). The praise of God’s glory, as Ambrose remarks,

        Once the Apostle has enumerated the blessings offered generally to all

        to recount those granted to the Ephesians themselves. This section is
        divided into two parts:

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

        Thirdly, the blessing of justification (1: 13-14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In reference to the first point he says: Christ
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >in whom you also, after you had heard</span
        >, that is, by whose favor and power you have heard the proclamation of
        the <span style="font-weight: bold">word of truth</span> since Christ
        himself has sent those who preach it to you. “How shall they believe him
        of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a
        preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be sent?... Faith, then,
        comes by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ” (Rom. 10:14-15,
        17). They hear through the blessing of him who sends them the preachers:
        “Blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it” (Lk. 11: 28).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Apostle mentions the threefold recommendation of this preached word.
        It is, first of all, true;
        <span style="font-weight: bold">a word of truth</span>. Indeed, it could
        be nothing else since its source is Christ concerning whom John 17 (17)
        states: “Your word is truth.” And James 1 (18): “For of his own will he
        has begotten us by the word of truth.” Secondly, it is a proclamation of
        good news. Hence he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">the gospel</span>: it announces the
        highest good and eternal life. “Word of faith” is preeminently
        (<i>antonomastice</i>) applicable to the Gospel as the communication of
        the highest good. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him
        who brings good news and preaches salvation... Go up on a high mountain,
        lady-messenger of Sion (Is. 52:7; 40:9). This refers to future goods.
        The present goods are what describe and recommend [Christian preaching]
        in the third place, for it saves. Thus he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of your salvation</span>; if believed
        in, it gives salvation. “I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the
        power of God unto salvation to all who believe” (Rom. 1:16). “Now I make
        known unto you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also
        you have received and wherein you stand, by which also you are saved” (1
        Cor. 15:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Regarding the blessing of conversion to the faith, he states
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in whom</span>, namely, Christ, by whose
        action you
        <span style="font-weight: bold">also believing, were signed</span>. This
        blessing is applied to faith since faith is necessary for those who
        listen. In vain would anyone listen to the word of truth if he did not
        believe, and the believing itself is through Christ. “By grace you are
        saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of
        God” (Eph. 2:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Concerning the blessing of justification he mentions that
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >you were signed with the Holy Spirit</span
        >
        who was given to you. Concerning this [Spirit] three things are said; he
        is a sign, the spirit of the promise, and the pledge of our inheritance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He is a sign inasmuch as through him charity is infused into our hearts,
        thereby distinguishing us from those who are not the children of God.
        Relating to this be says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">you were signed</span>, set apart from
        Satan’s fold. “Grieve not the holy Spirit of God; whereby you are sealed
        unto the day of redemption” (Eph. 4:30). Just as men brand a mark on
        their own herds to differentiate them from others, so the Lord willed to
        seal his own flock, his people, with a spiritual sign. The Lord had the
        Jews as his own people in the Old Testament. “And you, my flocks, the
        flocks of my pastures are men” (Ez. 34:31). “And we are the people of
        his pasture and the sheep of his hand” (Ps. 95:7). This flock was fed on
        the earthly pastures of material teachings and temporal goods: “If you
        be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good things of the land” (Is.
        1:19). The Lord, therefore, differentiated and set them apart from
        others by means of the bodily sign of circumcision. “And my covenant
        shall be in your flesh” (Gen. 17:13); before this it says, “You shall
        circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the
        covenant between me and you” (Gen. 17:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the New Testament the flock he had is the Christian people: “You have
        returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls” (1 Pet. 2:25). “My
        sheep hear my voice; and I know them; and they follow me” (Jn. 10:27).
        This flock is fed on the pastures of spiritual doctrine and spiritual
        favors; hence the Lord differentiated it from others by a spiritual
        sign. This is the Holy Spirit through whom those who are of Christ are
        distinguished from the others who do not belong to him. But since the
        Holy Spirit is love, he is given to someone when that person is made a
        lover of God and neighbor. “God’s love has been poured into our hearts
        through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us” (Rom. 5:5).
        Therefore, the distinctive sign is charity which comes from the Holy
        Spirit: “By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you
        have love one for another” (Jn. 13:35). The Holy Spirit is he by whom we
        are signed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Spirit is described as a promise for three reasons. First, he is
        promised to those who believe: “I will put a new spirit within you...
        And I will give you a new spirit” (Ez. 36:26, 37:6). Secondly, he is
        given with a certain promise, by the very fact that he is given to us we
        become the children of God. For through the Holy Spirit we are made one
        with Christ: “Anyone who does not have the Spirit of God, does not
        belong to him” (Rom. 8:9). As a result of being made adopted children of
        God, we have the promise of an eternal inheritance since “if sons, heirs
        also” (Rom. 8:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, he is termed a pledge inasmuch as he makes us certain of the
        promised inheritance. Adopting us into the children of God, the Holy
        Spirit is the Spirit of promise who also is the seal of the promise yet
        to be attained.

    and perhaps this is a better rendering. For a pledge differs from the object
    in place of which it is given, and it must be returned once he who has
    received the pledge obtains the object due him. An earnest, however, does
    not differ from the object in place of which it is given, nor is it returned
    since it is a partial payment of the price itself, which is not to be
    withdrawn but completed. God communicates charity to us as a pledge, through
    the Holy Spirit who is the spirit of truth and love. Hence, this is nothing
    else than an individual and imperfect participation in the divine charity
    and love; it must not be withdrawn but brought to perfection. More
    fittingly, therefore, it is referred to as an earnest rather than as a
    pledge.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nevertheless, it can also be called a pledge. For through the Holy Spirit
    God grants us a variety of gifts. Some of these will remain in the
    fatherland, as charity which “never comes to an end” (1 Cor. 13:8); while
    others will not last on account of their imperfection, such as faith and
    hope “which shall be done away” with (<i>ibid.</i>, v. 10). Hence, the
    Spirit is called an earnest in reference to what will remain, and a pledge
    with respect to what will be done away with.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He adds the purpose for which we are signed as
    <span style="font-weight: bold">unto the redemption</span>. For when a man
    buys new animals and adds them to his flock, he puts a mark on them to the
    effect that he has purchased them. Now Christ has purchased a people from
    the Gentiles. “Other sheep I have that are not of this fold; them also I
    must bring. And they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and
    one shepherd” (Jn. 10:16). And on them he imprints a sign of purchase: “A
    holy nation, a purchased people” (1 Pet. 2:9) “which he has purchased with
    his own blood” (Ac. 20:28).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Christ acquired this people, not because they never were his, but because
    they previously belonged to him and yet, by sinning, had sold themselves
    into a diabolical slavery which oppressed them. So it does not simply state
    that he acquired them but adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">unto redemption</span>, as though to say:
    You are not strictly a new acquisition; you are re-purchased from the
    slavery of the devil through his blood. “You were not redeemed with
    corruptible things as gold or silver, from the vain manner of life handed
    down from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ” (1 Pet.
    1:18-19). Christ purchased us, therefore, through a redemption; not that
    this added anything to God since he needs none of our goods. “If you are
    rigtheous, what do you give him [God], or what does he receive of thy hand?”
    (Job 35:7). The purpose for which Christ acquired us is unto the praise of
    his glory, that God himself be praised since “everyone who is called by my
    name, I have created him for my glory” (Is. 43:7).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        After enumerating the blessings conferred on the Ephesians through
        Christ (1:13), the Apostle now reveals how his affection for them has
        grown. This section is divided into three parts:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he begins by relating the good reports he has heard concerning
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, he gives the thanks due for the blessings they have received
        (1: 16a).
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Thirdly, he adds a prayer for future blessings (1: 16b-19a).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There were two good things which he heard about them. One was their
        faith by which they were properly orientated toward God; regarding this
        he remarked:
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Wherefore, I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord
          Jesus</span
        >. Indeed, faith makes God dwell in man: “That Christ may dwell by faith
        in your hearts” (Eph. 3:17). Again, it purifies hearts: “purifying their
        hearts by faith” (Ac. 15:9). Moreover, it justifies without recourse to
        the Law: “for we account a man to be justified by faith, without the
        works of the law” (Rom. 3:28). The second good is love by which they are
        properly orientated toward their neighbor; in reference to this he says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and of your love</span> consisting in
        works of charity. This love is a spirittial sign that a man is a
        disciple of Christ: “A new commandment I give you: that you love one
        another, as I have loved you, so also you must love one another. By this
        shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for
        another” (Jn. 13:34-35). This
        <span style="font-weight: bold">love</span>, I say,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">is towards all the saints</span>. For
        everyone whom we love with charity, we ought to love either because they
        are holy or in order that they become holy. “While we have time, let us
        work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household
        of the faith” (Gal. 6:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next (1:16a), the Apostle gives thanks for these goods and blessings he
        has heard about, saying
        <span style="font-weight: bold">I cease not to give thanks for you</span
        >. On the contrary, however, he could not have continually offered
        thanks for them. I reply. In saying
        <span style="font-weight: bold">I do not cease</span>, the Apostle means
        at the required times; or,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">I do not cease</span> because my
        attitude of thanksgiving for you is withmit intermission habitually with
        me. “We do not cease to pray for you, and to beg that you may be filled
        with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual
        understanding” (Col. 1:9). “I remember you constantly, always in my
        prayers making request” (Rom. 1:9-10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, the Apostle prays for the blessings that must be given
        them in the future. This has three divisions:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he sets down certain ones that he asks for them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, he explains these (1: 17b-19a).
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Thirdly, he discloses the exemplar and form of these blessings (1: 19b
        ff.).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to the first he says: Not only do I give thanks for past
        benefits which you have received and for the good reports concerning
        you, but I also pray that, by all means, these increase in the future,
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >making commemoration of you in my prayers</span
        >
        in behalf of these
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory</span
        >.
      </p></a
    >
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <a name="6" id="6"
      >It must be acknowledged, at this point, that our Lord Jesus Christ is
      both God and man. Insofar as be is man, be is related to God, since he is
      composed of body and soul, both of which, being creatures, are necessarily
      related to God. But according as he is God, he is related to the Father.
      “I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and to your God” (Jn.
      20:17). Likewise, as God he is the glory of the Father: “who, being the
      brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance” (Heb. 1:3). He
      is also our glory because he himself is life eternal: “We are in his true
      Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life” (1 Jn. 5:20).
      Therefore, he states
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the God of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> in
      relation to him as man, and
      <span style="font-weight: bold">his Father</span> in reference to him as
      God. I say the <span style="font-weight: bold">Father of glory</span>,
      that is, of Christ who is his glory. “A wise son makes his father glad
      [Vul: is the glory of the father]” (Prov. 10:1);</a

    and of our glory, inasmuch as he communicates glory to all.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Then he writes down the two things he asks for:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the spirit of wisdom and of revelation</span
    >. It must be realized here that certain gifts are common to all the saints
    and are necessary for salvation, such as faith, hope and charity. These they
    already possessed, as is evident. Then there are other special gifts; be
    prays that they receive these. First is the gift of wisdom when be says the
    spirit of wisdom whom no one can bestow except God: “Who ever knew your
    counsel, unless you had given wisdom, and sent thy Holy Spirit from above”
    (Wis. 9:17). The second gift prayed for is that of understanding which
    consists in the revelation of spiritual mysteries that God alone can give:
    “There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries” (Dan. 2:28).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next, he explains what he asks for:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, what pertains to the gift of wisdom.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, what pertains to the gift of understanding (1: 18b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To the gift of wisdom belongs the knowledge of divine realities. Hence, to
    ask for the gift of wisdom is to ask that they enjoy a knowledge of God. He
    begs for this in saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the knowledge of him</span>, as if to
    say: I ask that, through the spirit of wisdom, you may have
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the eyes of your heart enlightened in</span>
    a clearer <span style="font-weight: bold">knowledge of</span> God. “Look at
    me, answer me, Yahweh my God! Enlighten my eyes; turn away the sleep of
    death” (Ps. 12:4). This is the opposite of those whose eyes are enlightened
    only with respect to temporal reality when it is more necessary and more
    glorious to know God. “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom... and let
    not the rich man glory in his riches: but let anyone who boasts glory in
    this, that he understands and knows me” (Jer. 9:23-24).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Three aspects pertain to the gift of understanding, one of which has
    reference to the present life, and two to the future. Hope, which is
    necessary for salvation, belongs to the present condition: “for we are saved
    by hope” (Rom. 8:24). Concerning this he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may know what</span>, that is, how
    great <span style="font-weight: bold">the hope is of his calling</span>,
    meaning the virtue of hope and what an immense reality it is concerned with.
    This [hope] is of the utmost importance because it concerns the greatest
    realities: “He hath given us a new birth to a living hope, by the
    resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1 Pet. 1:3). It is also the
    strongest of the virtues: “that we who have fled for refuge may have strong
    encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. This we have as a sure
    and firm anchor of the soul, which enters [the sanctuary] behind the veil”
    (Heb. 6:18-19).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Yet, since what we hope for concerns the future life, the other two aspects
    [of the gift of understanding] pertain to the future. One, the essential
    reward, is common to all the just; regarding which he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints</span
    >. Here he writes down four characteristics of those gifts. First, they are
    most abundant, which he implies in
    <span style="font-weight: bold">riches</span>. “He who obeys me will dwell
    secure, and be at ease without fear of evil” (Prov. 1:33); “Glory and wealth
    shall be in his house” (Ps. 112:3); “Riches and honor are with me, enduring
    wealth and prosperity” (Prov. 8:18). Secondly, they have the greatest
    clarity, regarding which he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of glory</span>, “Glory, honor and peace to
    everyone who does good” (Rom. 2:10). Thirdly, they are the most enduring, in
    reference to which he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of his inheritance</span>, for what is
    hereditary is possessed permanently. “His goods will be established”
    (Ecclus. 31:11); “Yahweh, you have portioned my cup of smooth wine; you have
    cast my lot. The lines have fallen on rich land for me; the Most High has
    marked out my estate.” (Ps. 16:5). Fourthly, he indicates that they will be
    most profound, as <span style="font-weight: bold">in the saints</span>. “The
    sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come
    that shall be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18); “for this slight momentary
    affliction is preparing for us an incomparable eternal weight of glory” (2
    Cor. 4:17).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The other aspect [of the gift of understanding] which be sets down in
    reference to the future glory pertains especially to the Apostles. Hence he
    asks
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that you may know... what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards
      us</span
    >, the Apostles. He seems to say: Although he bestows the riches of his
    glory abundantly on all the saints, he grants them in an exceedingly great
    measure to the Apostles. For the greatness of a power is gauged by what it
    does. Hence, the more the divine power accomplishes in someone, the more is
    that divine power revealed there—even though it is one and undivided in
    itself. Therefore, since a greater effect of the divine power is present in
    the Apostles, the greatness of this power will reside in them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He shows what this greater effect present in them is by saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold">we who believe</span>; we who are the
    first-fruits among those who believe. “We also believe. For which cause we
    speak also, knowing that he who raised up Jesus will raise us up also with
    Jesus” (2 Cor. 4:13). “I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he
    is able to keep what I have committed unto him until the last day” (2 Tim.
    1: 12).

        Once he has listed the blessings which he hopes will be granted to the
        Ephesians in the future (1:16 ff.), the Apostle discusses the exemplar
        and form of those benefits. As the life of Christ is the model and form
        of our justice, so Christ’s glory and exultation is the form and
        exemplar of our glory and exaltation. Here the Apostle makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he proposes in a general manner the form of our exaltation with

        "
      >
        Secondly, he discusses it in detail (1:20b ff.).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine activity in Christ is the form and exemplar of the divine
        activity in us. In reference to this he states
        <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the operation</span>, that
        is, in the likeness of the operation,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of the might of his power</span>,
        meaning the virtuous power of God,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">which he wrought in Christ</span>
        exalting him who is the head. Understand that in this way he will
        mightily act in us. “We await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will
        transfigure our wretched body to be like his glorious body by the power
        which enables him to subject all things to himself” (Phil. 3:20-21). In
        Scripture we frequently read that we will be exalted in the likeness of
        Christ’s exaltation. For example, Romans 8 (17): “...provided we suffer
        with him, so as also to be glorified with him.” Or the Apocalypse 3
        (21): “He who conquers I will grant him to sit with me in my throne; as
        I myself have conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As a result, he specifies the form and exemplar in more detail, showing
        what pertains to the exaltation of Christ while speaking of him inasmuch
        as he is man (v. 20b ff.). He writes of three favors in the exaltation
        of Christ:

    “And, if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you;

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Setting him on his right hand</span> refers
    to the second [element in Christ’s exaltation]. This height of glory can be
    viewed in three perspectives: in its relation to God, to material creatures,
    and to spiritual creatures. Considered in relation to God, he is seated at
    his right hand; this is not to be thought of as a bodily organ—“God is a
    Spirit” (Jn. 4:24)—but as a metaphorical way of speaking. The right hand is
    taken as a nobler and stronger part of man; so when we say that Christ Jesus
    is seated at the right hand of God, it should be understood that according
    to his humanity he partakes of the Father’s choicest blessings, and
    according to his divinity it is understood as equality with the Father.
    “Yahweh spoke to my lord: Take the throne at my right” (Ps. 109: 1); and the
    last chapter of Mark (16:19): “And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to
    them, was taken up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">In heavenly places</span> defines Christ’s
    relation to material creatures. For the heavenly bodies occupy the highest
    place in comparison to the other bodies; yet, “He who descended is he who
    also ascended above all the heavens” (Eph. 4:10). In relation to spiritual
    creatures, he first mentions that Christ is exalted over certain specific
    ones, and secondly, over all of them generally (1:21b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To understand this, note that there are nine ranks of angels, of which the
    Apostle here (1:21a) mentions only the four middle ranks. Above these are
    the three superior ranks of the Thrones, Cherubim and Seraphim. Below them
    are the two lower ranks of the Archangels and the Angels. These nine ranks
    are also differentiated into three hierarchies, or sacred authorities [
    <i>principatus</i> ], each of which embraces three ranks.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    All the doctors agree in assigning the ranks of the First Hierarchy. The
    highest rank is the Seraphim, second are the Cherubim, third are the
    Thrones. In assigning the ranks among the Middle and Lower Hierarchies,
    however, Dionysius and Gregory disagree.

    </script>
    Dionysius, [starting from the highest] and going down, places the Dominions
    as first in the Middle Hierarchy, the Virtues second, and the Powers third.
    In the first rank of the Lower Hierarchy he puts the Principalities, second
    are the Archangels and third are the Angels. This listing of the ranks is in
    accord with the present text where the Apostle begins, in an ascending
    order, from the first rank of Hierarchy, the seventh [down from the
    Seraphim].
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Gregory, on the other hand, arranges them differently. He places the
    Principalities between the Dominions and the Powers, which is the second
    rank of the Middle Hierarchy; while he puts the Virtues between the Powers
    and the Archangels, which is the first rank of the Lower Hierarchy. This
    arrangement is supported by the Apostle’s words in Colossians 1 (16): “For
    in him [Christ] were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and
    invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers,”
    where he enumerates those ranks in a descending order. Reserving Gregory’s

    for the present we will follow Dionysius’ approach since it accords with the
    text at hand.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To understand this, it should be realized that the structure of reality can
    be considered in three ways:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, according as it is present in the First Cause of everything’ God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"

    Thirdly, according to the arrangement of individual causes.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Since everything that happens among creatures occurs with the assistance of
    the angels, the three angelic hierarchies are distinguished according to the
    threefold way of conceiving the structure of reality. To one it belongs to
    grasp the intelligible patterns of things in the very summit of reality,
    God; it pertains to another to grasp the intelligible patterns of reality in
    the universal causes; while still another [understands these patterns] in
    the individual causes. For the higher the angelic minds are, the more do
    they receive divine illumination with greater universality.

    Therefore, the governance of reality in relation to God pertains to the
    First Hierarchy. On this account, the ranks of that hierarchy are named with
    reference to God. The Seraphim are so called because they are burning with
    love and through it are united to God. The Cherubim are, as it were, radiant
    inasmuch as they possess a supereminent knowledge of divine mysteries. The
    Thrones are so termed inasmuch as in them God carries out his judgments. Of
    these three ranks the Apostle makes no mention here.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To the Middle Hierarchy belongs the governance of things in relation to the
    universal causes. Hence the ranks of this hierarchy have names associated
    with power since the universal causes are present in the lower and
    individual things by their energy and power. Three tasks pertain to these
    powers which govern universally. First, some must give direction by their
    commands; secondly, others must dispose of any impediments to the
    fulfillment [of those commands]; thirdly, some must arrange how others will
    carry out the commands. Of these, the first belongs to the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Dominions</span> who, as Dionysius remarks,
    are free from any subordination; nor are they sent out on external
    [missions] but they give orders to those who are sent. The second pertains
    to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Virtues</span> who facilitate the
    execution of the commands. The third belongs to the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Powers</span> who carry out the commands.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    On the Lower Hierarchy devolves the guidance of things in relation to
    individual causes, and they are named from the [classes of objects]
    consigned to them. Hence, those called Angels carry out what pertains to the
    salvation of individual persons. The salvation and utility of greater
    personages is entrusted to the Archangels.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Principalities</span> is the name of those
    who preside over each of the provinces.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Christ is above all of these ranks that have been discussed. The Apostle
    only makes a special mention of four of them. The reason is that the names
    of these four ranks are given them for their dignity, and since he is
    dealing with the dignity of Christ, he names them especially to show that
    Christ surpasses all created dignity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and above every name that is named</span>,
    he teaches that Christ has been exalted above every spiritual creature in
    general. He had stated previously that Christ was exalted above all the
    spiritual creatures whose names were related to power. However, in Sacred
    Scripture, besides those ranks of angels, other ranks of celestial spirits
    are mentioned; for instance, the Seraphim (Is. 6), Cherubim (Ez. 10, 11 and
    41), and Thrones (Psalms), which be did not speak of. Therefore, he shows
    that Christ, as man, is exalted above all of these ranks by adding
    <span style="font-weight: bold">above every name that is named</span>... [He
    surpasses] not only those who exercise authority but everything capable of

    knowledge and which we name, whereas those of the future life cannot be
    comprehended or named: “We know in part; and we prophesy in part” (1 Cor.
    13:9). Nevertheless, the blessed in the future life do name these latter;
    they are those realities of which the Apostle says in 2 Corinthians 12 (4),
    that “he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.” Yet
    Christ is even exalted above these. “He gave him a name which is above all
    names” (Phil. 2:9).

        The Apostle has previously dealt with the exaltation of Christ both from
        the viewpoint of his passing over from death to life (1:20a), and from
        that of his exaltation to the highest glory (1:20b-21). Now be treats of
        the immense power of his exaltation. Concerning this he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he discusses the power of Christ with respect to the whole of
        creation.
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Secondly, then his power in relation to the Church (22b23).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He affirms that, with respect to the whole of creation, Christ has
        universal power since God the Father
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >hath subjected all things under his feet</span
        >. The phrase <span style="font-weight: bold">under his feet</span> can
        be taken in two ways. In one it is a figurative and symbolic way of
        saying that every creature is totally subject to the power of Christ.
        What we trample under foot is certainly subjected to us. Regarding this
        power the last chapter of Matthew (28:18) states: “All power is given to
        me in heaven and in earth.” “For in subjecting all things to him, he
        left nothing not subjected to him” (Heb. 2:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In another acceptation it is a metaphorical way of speaking. By the feet
        the lowest part of the body is understood, and by the head the highest.
        Although the humanity and divinity should not be thought of as parts of
        Christ, nonetheless the divinity is preeminent in Christ and may be
        understood as his head—“The head of Christ is God” (1 Cor. 11-3). The
        humanity is lower and may be taken as the feet—“Let us worship at his
        footstool” (Ps. 132:7). The meaning [of this passage] is then that the
        Father has not only subjected all of creation to Christ as he is God, to
        whom everything is subject from eternity, but also to his humanity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Notice how something may be subjected to Christ in two ways, some are so
        voluntarily and others involuntarily. Origen overlooked this distinction
        so that this saying of the Apostle occasioned an error on his part. He
        claimed that everything subjected to Christ, who is true salvation, must
        share in salvation. He concluded that the demons and damned will be
        saved at some time since they are subjected under Christ’s feet. But
        this is contrary to the Lord’s pronouncement: “Depart from me, you
        cursed, into everlasting fire, which was prepared for the devil and his
        angels”; and he concludes at the end of the chapter, “And these shall go
        into everlasting punishment” (Mt. 25:41, 46).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It must be held, therefore, that he subjects everything under his feet.
        Some do so willingly, as to their Saviour. For example, the just who
        fulfill God’s will in the present life, and are subjected to him that
        they may satisfy their desire and will, awaiting for what Proverbs 10
        (24) says of the good: “To the just their desire shall be given.”
        Others, however, are subjected to him unwillingly, as to their judge,
        that Christ may accomplish his own will in their regard. These are the
        wicked to whom those words in Luke 19 (27) are applicable: “But as for
        those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them here
        and kill them before me.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Next (v. 22b), he deals with Christ’s power with respect to the Church.
        In reference to this he makes three points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, be sets down the relation of Christ to the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, the relation of the Church to Christ (1:23a).
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Thirdly, be explains this relationship (1:23b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Concerning the first, he says God the Father
        <span style="font-weight: bold">made him head over all the church</span
        >, both of the Church militant, composed of men living in the present,
        and of the Church triumphant, made up of the men and angels in the
        fatherland. On account of certain general reasons, Christ is even the
        head of the angels—“who is the head of all principality and power” (Col.
        2:10)—whereas Christ is spiritually the head of mankind for special
        reasons. For the head has a threefold relationship with the other
        members. First, it has a preeminent position; secondly, its powers are
        diffused [throughout the body] since all the senses in the members are
        derived from it; thirdly, it is of the same nature [as the other
        members].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, Christ is head of the Angels in regard to previninence and the
        diffusion [of his power]. Even in his humanity Christ surpasses the
        angels: “Being made so much better than the angels as he hath inherited
        a more excellent name than they” (Heb. 1:4). Moreover, even as man,
        Christ enlightens and influences them; Dionysius proves this from the
        words of Isaias 63 (1): “Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed
        garments from Bosra?,” claiming that these words are those of the
        highest angels. The response which follows: “It is I, announcing justice
        mighty to save,” he says are the words of Christ who immediately answers
        them. From this it should be understood that Christ not only illumines
        the lower but also the higher angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        With respect to a conformity of nature, Christ is not the head of the
        angels, “for surely he did not take angels to himself, but he took the
        line of Abraham” (Heb. 2:16). [By this relationship] he is head of men
        only. “You have wounded my heart, my sister,” through nature, “and my
        spouse,” through grace (Cant. 4:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He speaks of the relation of the Church to Christ at
        <span style="font-weight: bold">which is his body</span>, inasmuch as
        she is subject to him, receives his influence, and shares the same
        nature with Christ. “Just as the body is one and has many members, and
        all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with
        Christ. For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body” (1 Cor.
        12:12-13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He explains <span style="font-weight: bold">which is his body</span> by
        adding <span style="font-weight: bold">the fulness of him</span>. To one
        asking why there are so many members in a natural body—hands, feet,
        mouth, and the like it could be replied that they are to serve the
        soul’s variety of activities. [The soul] itself is the cause and
        principle of these [members], and what they are, the soul is virtually.
        For the body is made for the soul, and not the other way around. From
        this perspective, the natural body is a certain fullness of the soul;
        unless the members exist with an integral body, the soul cannot exercise
        fully its activities.

      >This is similar in the relation of Christ and the Church. Since the
      Church was instituted on account of Christ, the Church is called the
      fullness of Christ. Everything which is virtually in Christ is, as it
      were, filled out in some way in the members of the Church. For all
      spiritual understanding, gifts, and whatever can be present in the
      Church—all of which Christ possesses superabundantly—flow from him into
      the members of the Church, and they are perfected in them.</a

    So he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">who is filled all in all</span> since Christ
    makes this member of the Church wise with the perfect wisdom present in
    himself, and he makes another just with his perfect justice, and so on with
    the others.
