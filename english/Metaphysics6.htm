        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 1025b 3-1026a 32
      </p>
      <p>
        532. The principles and causes of beings are the object of our search,
        and it is evident that [we must investigate the principles and causes of
        beings] as beings. For there is a cause of health and of its recovery;
        and there are also principles and elements and causes of the objects of
        mathematics; and in general every intellectual science, to whatever
        degree it participates in intellect, deals with principles and causes:
        either with those which are more certain or with those which are
        simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        533. But all these sciences single out some one thing, or some
        particular class, and confine their investigations to this, but they do
        not deal with being in an unqualified sense, or as being. Nor do they
        make any mention of the whatness itself of things. But proceeding from
        this, some making it evident by means of the senses, and others taking
        it by assuming it [from some other science], they demonstrate with
        greater necessity or more weakly the essential attributes of the class
        of things with which they deal. For this reason it is evident that there
        is no demonstration of a thing’s substance or whatness from such an
        inductive method, but there is another method of making it known. And
        similarly they say nothing about the existence or non-existence of the
        class of things with which they deal, because it belongs to the same
        science to show what a thing is and whether it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        534. And since the philosophy of nature is concerned with some class of
        being (for it deals with that kind of substance in which there is a
        principle of motion and rest), it is evident that it is neither a
        practical nor a productive science. For the principle of productive
        sciences is in the maker, whether it be intellect or art or some kind of
        power; but the principle of practical sciences is <i>prohaeresis</i> in
        the agent, for the object of action and that of choice are the same.
        Thus if every science is either practical, productive or theoretical,
        the philosophy of nature will be a theoretical science. But it will be
        theoretical of that kind of being which is subject to motion, and of
        that kind of substance which is inseparable from matter in its
        intelligible structure for the most part only.
      </p>
      <p>
        535. Now the essence and the conceptual expression of the way in which a
        thing exists must not remain unknown, because without this our
        investigation will be unfruitful. And regarding things defined, or their
        whatness, some are like snub and others like concave. And these differ,
        because snub is conceived with sensible matter (for snub is a concave
        nose), whereas concave is conceived without sensible matter. But all
        physical things are spoken of in a way similar to snub, for example,
        nose, eye, face, flesh, bone and animal in general; leaf, root, bark and
        plant in general (for the definition of none of these is without motion
        but always includes matter). Thus it is clear how we must investigate
        and define the essence in the case of physical things, and why it also
        belongs to the natural philosopher to speculate about one kind of
        soul-that which does not exist without matter. From these facts, then,
        it is evident that the philosophy of nature is a theoretical science.
      </p>
      <p>
        536. But mathematics is also a theoretical science, although it is not
        yet evident whether it deals with things which are immobile and
        separable from matter. However, it is evident that mathematics
        speculates about things insofar as they are immobile and insofar as they
        are separable from matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        537. Now if there is something which is immobile, eternal and separable
        from matter, evidently a knowledge of it belongs to a theoretical
        science. However, it does not belong to the philosophy of nature (for
        this science deals with certain mobile things), or to mathematics, but
        to a science prior to both. For the philosophy of nature deals with
        things which are inseparable from matter but not immobile. And some
        mathematical sciences deal with things which are immobile, but
        presumably do not exist separately, but are present as it were in
        matter. First philosophy, however, deals with things which are both
        separable from matter and immobile. Now common causes must be eternal,
        and especially these; since they are the causes of the sensible things
        visible to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        538. Hence there will be three theoretical philosophies: mathematics,
        the philosophy of nature, and theology.
      </p>
      <p>
        539. For it is obvious that, if the divine exists anywhere, it exists in
        this kind of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        540. And the most honorable of the sciences must deal with the most
        honorable class of things. Therefore the theoretical sciences are more
        desirable than the other sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        541. But someone will raise the question whether first philosophy is
        universal or deals with some particular class, i.e., one kind of
        reality; for not even in the mathematical sciences is the method the
        same, because both geometry and astronomy deal with a particular kind of
        nature, whereas the first science is universally common to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        542. Therefore, if there is no substance other than those which exist in
        the way that natural substances do, the philosophy of nature will be the
        first science; but if there is an immobile substance, this substance
        will be prior, and [the science which investigates it will be] first
        philosophy, and will be universal in this way. And because it will be
        first and about being, it will be the function of this science to
        investigate both what being is and what the attributes are which belong
        to it as being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>How it differs from other sciences in treating of being</i></p>
      <p>
        1144. Having shown in Book IV (535) of this work that this science
        considers being and unity and those attributes which belong to being as
        such, and that all of these are used in several senses; and having
        distinguished the number of these in Book V (843; 885) of this work,
        here the Philosopher begins to establish the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">truth</span> about being and those
        attributes which belong to being.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part is divided into two sections. In the first he explains the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">method</span> by which this science
        should establish what is true about being. In the second (1247) he
        begins to settle the issue about being. He does this at the beginning of
        Book VII (“The term being is used in many senses”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two sections. In the first he explains
        the method of treating beings, which is proper to this science, by
        showing how it differs from the other sciences. In the second (1170 he
        excludes certain senses of being from the investigation of this science,
        namely, those senses which are not the chief concern of this science
        (“Being in an unqualified sense”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is again divided into two sections. In the first he shows
        how this science differs from the others because it considers the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">principles of being as being</span>. In
        the second (1152) he shows how this science differs from the others in
        its method of treating principles of this kind (“And since the
        philosophy of nature”). In regard to the first he does two things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1145. First, he shows how this science
        <span style="font-weight: bold">agrees</span> with the other sciences in
        its study of principles. He says that since being is the subject of this
        kind of science, as has been shown in Book IV (529-30), and every
        science must investigate the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">principles and causes</span> which
        belong to its <span style="font-weight: bold">subject</span> inasmuch as
        it is this kind of thing, we must investigate in this science the
        principles and causes of beings as beings. And this is also what occurs
        in the other sciences. For there is a cause of health and of its
        recovery, which the physician seeks. And similarly there are also
        principles, elements and causes of the objects of mathematics, as figure
        and number and other things of this kind which the mathematician
        investigates. And in general every intellectual science, to whatever
        degree it participates in intellect, must always deal with causes and
        principles. This is the case whether it deals with purely intelligible
        things, as divine science does, or with those which are in some way
        imaginable or sensible in particular but intelligible in general; or
        even if it deals with sensible things inasmuch as there is science of
        them, as occurs in the case of mathematics and in that of the philosophy
        of nature. Or again whether they proceed from universal principles to
        particular cases in which there is activity, as occurs in the practical
        sciences, it is always necessary that such sciences deal with principles
        and causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        1146. Now these principles are either (1) more certain
        <span style="font-weight: bold">to us</span>, as occurs in the natural
        sciences, because they are closer to sensible things, or (2) they are
        simpler and prior <span style="font-weight: bold">in nature</span>, as
        occurs in the mathematical sciences. But cognitions which are only
        sensory are not the result of principles and causes but of the sensible
        object itself acting upon the senses. For to proceed from causes to
        effects or the reverse is not an activity of the senses but only of the
        intellect. Or “more certain principles” means those which are better
        known and more deeply probed, and “simple” means those which are studied
        in a more superficial way, as occurs in the moral sciences, whose
        principles are derived from those things which occur in the majority of
        cases.
      </p>
      <p>1147. <b>But all these</b> (533).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows how the other sciences
        <span style="font-weight: bold">differ</span> from this science in their
        study of principles and causes. He says that all these particular
        sciences which have now been mentioned are about one
        <span style="font-weight: bold">particular</span> class of being, for
        example, number, continuous quantity or something of this kind; and each
        confines its investigations to “its subject genus,”’ i.e., dealing with
        this class and not with another; for example, the science which deals
        with number does not deal with continuous quantity. For no one of the
        other sciences deals “with being in an unqualified sense,” i.e., with
        being in general, or even with any particular being as being; for
        example, arithmetic does not deal with number as being but as number.
        For to consider each being as being is proper to metaphysics.
      </p>
      <p>
        1148. And since it belongs to the same science to consider both being
        and the whatness or quiddity, because each thing has being by reason of
        its quiddity, therefore the other particular sciences make “no mention
        of,” i.e., they do (~) not investigate, the whatness or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">quiddity</span> of a thing and the
        definition signifying it. But (+) they proceed “from this,” i.e., from
        the whatness itself of a thing, to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">other things</span>, using this as an
        already established principle for the purpose of proving other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1149. Now some sciences make the whatness of their subject evident by
        means of the senses, as the science which treats of animals understands
        what an animal is by means of what “is apparent to the senses,” i.e., by
        means of sensation and local motion, by which animal is distinguished
        from non-animal. And other sciences understand the whatness of their
        subject by assuming it from some other science, as geometry learns what
        continuous quantity is from first philosophy. Thus, beginning from the
        whatness itself of a thing, which has been made known either by the
        senses or by assuming it from some other science, these sciences
        demonstrate the proper attributes which belong essentially to the
        subject-genus with which they deal; for a definition is the middle term
        in a causal demonstration. But the method of demonstration differs;
        because some sciences demonstrate with greater necessity, as the
        mathematical sciences, and others “more weakly,” i.e., without
        necessity, as the sciences of nature, whose demonstrations are based on
        things that do not pertain to something always but for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
        1150. Another translation has “condition” in place of “assumption,” but
        the meaning is the same; for what is assumed is taken, as it were, by
        stipulation. And since the starting point of demonstration is
        definition, it is evident that from this kind of inductive method “there
        is no demonstration of a thing’s substance,” i.e., of its essence, or of
        the definition signifying its whatness; but there is some other method
        by which definitions are made known, namely, the method of elimination
        and the other methods which are given in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>,
        Book IV.
      </p>
      <p>
        1151. And just as no particular science settles the issue about the
        whatness of things, neither does any one of them discuss the existence
        or nonexistence of the subject-genus with which it deals. This is
        understandable, because it belongs to the same science to settle the
        question of a thing’s existence and to make known its whatness. For in
        order to prove that a thing exists its whatness must be taken as the
        middle term of the demonstration. Now both of these questions belong to
        the investigation of the philosopher who considers being as being.
        Therefore every particular science
        <span style="font-weight: bold">assumes</span> the existence and
        whatness of its subject, as is stated in Book I of the
        <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. This is indicated by the fact that no
        particular science establishes the truth about being in an unqualified
        sense, or about any being as being.
      </p>
      <p>1152. <b>And since the philosophy of nature</b> (534).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how this science differs from the other sciences in its
        method of considering the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">principles</span> of being as being. And
        since the philosophy of nature was considered by the ancients to be the
        first science and the one which would consider being as being,
        therefore, beginning with it as with what is more evident, he shows,
        first (534), how the philosophy of nature differs from the practical
        sciences; and second (535), how it differs from the speculative
        sciences, showing also the method of study proper to this science.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (534), that the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">philosophy of nature</span> does not
        deal with being in an unqualified sense but with some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">particular</span> class of being, i.e.,
        with natural substance, which has within itself a principle of motion
        and rest; and from this it is evident that it is neither a practical nor
        a productive science. For action and production differ, because action
        is an operation that remains in the agent itself, as choosing,
        understanding and the like (and for this reason the practical sciences
        are called moral sciences), whereas production is an operation that
        passes over into some matter in order to change it, as cutting, burning
        and the like (and for this reason the productive sciences are called
        mechanical arts).
      </p>
      <p>
        1153. Now it is evident that the philosophy of nature is not a (~)
        productive science, because the principle of productive sciences is in
        the maker and not in the thing made, which is the artifact. But the
        principle of motion in natural bodies is within these natural bodies.
        Further, the principle of things made by art, which is in the maker, is,
        first, the intellect which discovers the art; and second, the art which
        is an intellectual habit; and third, some executive power, such as the
        motive power by which the artisan executes the work conceived by his
        art. Hence it is evident that the philosophy of nature is not a
        productive science.
      </p>
      <p>
        1154. And for this reason it is evident that it is not a (~) practical
        science; for the principle of practical sciences is in the agent, not in
        the actions or customary operations themselves. This principle is
        “prohaeresis,” i.e., choice; for the object of action and that of choice
        are the same. Hence it is evident that the philosophy of nature is
        neither a practical nor a productive science.
      </p>
      <p>
        1155. If, then, every science is either practical, productive or
        theoretical, it follows that the philosophy of nature is a (+)
        theoretical science. Yet “it is theoretical,” or speculative, of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">special class</span> of being, namely,
        that which is subject to motion; for mobile being is the subject matter
        of the philosophy of nature. And it deals only with “that kind of
        substance,” i.e., the quiddity or essence of a thing, which is for the
        most part inseparable from matter in its intelligible structure. He adds
        this because of the intellect, which comes in a sense within the scope
        of the philosophy of nature, although its substance is separable from
        matter. Thus it is clear that the philosophy of nature deals with some
        special subject, which is mobile being, and that it has a special way of
        defining things, namely, with matter.
      </p>
      <p>1156. <b>Now the essence</b> (535).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how the philosophy of nature differs from the other
        speculative sciences in its method of defining things; and in regard to
        this he does two things. First, he explains this difference. Second
        (1166), he draws a conclusion about the number of theoretical sciences.
        (“Hence there will be”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he exposes the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">method of definings</span> things which
        is proper to the philosophy of nature. He says that, in order to
        understand how the speculative sciences differ from each other, the
        quiddity of a thing and the way in which “the conceptual expression,”
        i.e., the definition signifying it, should be expressed in each science,
        must not remain unknown. For in seeking the aforesaid difference
        “without this,” i.e., without knowing how to define things, our search
        would be unfruitful. For since a definition is the middle term in a
        demonstration, and is therefore the starting-point of knowing the
        difference between the speculative sciences must depend on the different
        ways of defining things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1157. Now concerning things which are defined it must be noted that some
        are defined like snub and others like concave. And these two differ
        because the definition of snub includes sensible matter (since snub is
        merely a curved or concave nose), whereas concavity is defined without
        sensible matter. For some sensible body, such as fire or water or the
        like, is not included in the definition of concave or curved. For that
        is said to be concave whose middle curves away from the ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        1158. Now all natural things are defined in a way similar to snub, as is
        evident both of those parts of an animal which are unlike, for example,
        nose, eye and face; and of those which are alike, for example, flesh and
        bone; and also of the whole animal. And the same is true of the parts of
        plants, for example, leaf, root and bark; and also of the whole plant.
        For no one of these can be defined without
        <span style="font-weight: bold">motion</span>; but each includes
        <span style="font-weight: bold">sensible matter</span> in its
        definition, and therefore motion, because every kind of sensible matter
        has its own kind of motion. Thus in the definition of flesh and bone it
        is necessary that the hot and cold be held to be suitably mixed in some
        way; and the same is true of other things. From this it is evident what
        the method is which the philosophy of nature uses in investigating and
        defining the quiddity of natural things; i.e., it involves sensible
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1159. And for this reason the philosophy of nature also investigates one
        kind of <span style="font-weight: bold">soul</span> —the kind that is
        (+) not defined without
        <span style="font-weight: bold">sensible matter</span>. For in Book II
        of <i>The Soul</i> he says that a soul is the first actuality of a
        natural organic body having life potentially. But if any soul can exist
        (~) <span style="font-weight: bold">separately</span> from a body, then
        insofar as it is not the actuality of such a body, it does not fall
        within the scope of the philosophy of nature. Therefore it is evident
        from the above that the philosophy of nature is a theoretical science,
        and that it has a special method of defining things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1160. <b>But mathematics</b> (536).<br />
        Second, he exposes the method proper to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">mathematics</span>. He says that
        mathematics is also a speculative science; for evidently it is neither a
        practical nor a productive science, since it considers things which are
        devoid of motion, without which action and production cannot exist. But
        whether those things which mathematical science considers are immobile
        and separable from matter in their being is not yet clear. For some men,
        the Platonists, held that numbers, continuous quantities and other
        mathematical objects are separate from matter and midway between the
        Forms and sensible things, as is stated in Book I (157) and in Book III
        (350). But the answer to this question has not yet been fully
        established by him, but will be established later on.
      </p>

      <p>
        1161. However, it is evident that mathematical science studies some
        things insofar as they are immobile and separate from matter, although
        they are neither immobile nor separable from matter in being. For their
        intelligible structure, for example, that of concave or curved, does not
        contain sensible matter. Hence mathematical science differs from the
        philosophy of nature in this respect, that while the philosophy of
        nature considers things whose definitions contain sensible matter (and
        thus it considers what is not separate insofar as it is not separate),
        mathematical science considers things whose
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >definitions do not contain sensible matter</span
        >. And thus even though the things which it considers are not separate
        from matter, it nevertheless considers them insofar as they are
        separate.
      </p>
      <p>1162. <b>Now if there is something</b> (537).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he exposes the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">method</span> proper to this science. He
        says that, if there is something whose being is immobile, and therefore
        eternal and separable from matter in being, it is evident that the
        investigation of it belongs to a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">theoretical</span> science and not to a
        practical or productive one, whose investigations have to do with
        certain kinds of motion. However, the study of such being does not
        belong to the philosophy of nature, for the philosophy of nature deals
        with certain kinds of beings, namely, mobile ones. Nor likewise does the
        study of this being belong to mathematics, because mathematics does not
        consider things which are separable from matter in being but only in
        their intelligible structure, as has been stated (1161). But the study
        of this being must belong to another science which is prior to both of
        these, i.e., prior to the philosophy of nature and to mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        1163. For the <i>philosophy of nature</i> deals with things which are
        inseparable from matter and mobile, and <i>mathematics</i> deals with
        certain immobile things although these are not separate from matter in
        being but only in their intelligible structure, since in reality they
        are found in sensible matter. And he says “presumably” because this
        truth has not yet been established. Further, he says that some
        mathematical sciences deal with immobile things, as geometry and
        arithmetic, because some mathematical sciences are applied to motion, as
        astronomy. But <i>the first science</i> deals with things which are
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >separable from matter in being and are altogether immobile</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        1164. Now <span style="font-weight: bold">common</span> causes must be
        eternal, because the first causes of beings which are generated must not
        themselves be generated, otherwise the process of generation would
        proceed to infinity; and this is true especially of those causes which
        are altogether immobile and immaterial. For those immaterial and
        immobile causes are the causes of the sensible things evident to us,
        because they are beings in the highest degree, and therefore are the
        cause of other things, as was shown in Book II (290). From this it is
        evident that the science which considers beings of this kind is the
        first of all the sciences and the one which considers the common causes
        of all beings. Hence there are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">causes of beings as beings</span>, which
        are investigated in first philosophy, as he proposed in Book I (36).
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >And from this it is quite evident that the opinion of those who
          claimed that Aristotle thought that God is not the cause of the
          substance of the heavens, but only of their motion, is false</span
        >. [against Ibn-Rushd]
      </p>
      <p>
        1165. However, we must remember that even though things which are
        separate from matter and motion in being and in their intelligible
        structure belong to the study of first philosophy, still the philosopher
        not only investigates these but
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >also sensible things inasmuch as they are beings</span
        >. Unless perhaps we may say, as Avicenna does, that common things of
        the kind which this science considers are said to be separate from
        matter in being, not because they are always without matter, but because
        they
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >do not necessarily have being in matter</span
        >, as the objects of mathematics do.
      </p>
      <p>1166. <b>Hence there will be</b> (538).</p>
      <p>
        He draws a conclusion as to the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">number of theoretical sciences</span>.
        And in regard to this he does three things. First, he concludes from
        what has been laid down above that there are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">three</span> parts of theoretical
        philosophy: mathematics, the philosophy of nature, and theology, which
        is first philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>1167. <b>For it is obvious</b> (539).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives two reasons why this science is called
        <span style="font-weight: bold">theology</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first of these is that “it is obvious that if the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">divine</span> exists anywhere,” i.e., if
        something divine exists in any class of things, it exists in such a
        nature, namely, in the class of being which is immobile and separate
        from matter, which this science studies.
      </p>
      <p>1168. <b>And he most honorable</b> (540).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the second reason why this science is called theology; and the
        reason is this: the most
        <span style="font-weight: bold">honorable</span> science deals with the
        most honorable class of beings, and this is the one in which divine
        beings are contained. Therefore, since this science is the most
        honorable of the sciences because it is the most honorable of the
        theoretical sciences, as was shown before (64)—and these are more
        honorable than the practical sciences, as was stated in Book I (35)—it
        is evident that this science deals with divine beings; and therefore it
        is called theology inasmuch as it is a discourse about divine beings.
      </p>
      <p>1169. <b>But someone will</b> (541).</p>
      <p>
        [objection] Third, he raises a question about a point already
        established. First, he states the question, saying that someone can
        inquire whether first philosophy is universal inasmuch as it considers
        being in general, or whether it investigates some particular class or a
        single nature. Now this does not seem to be the case. For this science
        and the mathematical sciences do not have one and the same method;
        because geometry and astronomy, which are mathematical sciences, deal
        with a special nature, whereas first philosophy is universally common to
        all. Yet the reverse seems to be true, namely, that it deals with a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">special</span> nature, because it is
        concerned with things which are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">separable from matter and immobile</span
        >, as has been stated (1163).
      </p>
      <p>1170. <b>Therefore, if</b> (542).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he answers this question, saying that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >if there is no substance other than those which exist in the way that
          natural substances do, with which the philosophy of nature deals, the
          philosophy of nature will be the first science</span
        >. But if there is some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">immobile</span> substance, this will be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">prior</span> to natural substance, and
        therefore the philosophy of nature, which considers this kind of
        substance, will be first philosophy. And since it is first, it will be
        universal; and it will be its function to study being as being, both
        what being is and what the attributes are which belong to being as
        being. For the science of the primary kind of being and that of being in
        general are the same, as has been stated at the beginning of Book IV
        (533).<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 2: 1026a 33-1027a 28
      </p>
      <p>
        543. Being in an unqualified sense has various meanings, of which one is
        the accidental, and another the true (and non-being may signify the
        false); and besides these there are the categorical figures, for
        example, the what, of what sort, how much, where, when, and anything
        else which signifies in this way; and besides all of these there is the
        potential and the actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        544. Since being is used in many senses, then, we must speak first of
        the accidental, because there is no speculation about it. And this is
        indicated by the fact that there is no science, either practical or
        speculative, that investigates it. For one who builds a house does not
        simultaneously cause all traits that are accidental to the completed
        house, since these are infinite in number. For nothing prevents the
        completed house from being pleasant to some, harmful to others, useful
        to others, and different, as I may say, from all other things, none of
        which the art of building produces. And similarly neither does the
        geometrician speculate about things which are accidents of figures in
        this way, nor whether a triangle differs from a triangle having two
        right angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        545. And this is understandable, because the accidental is in a sense
        being only in name.
      </p>
      <p>
        546. Hence in a way Plato was not wrong when he said that sophistry
        deals with non-being. For the arguments of the sophists, as I may say,
        are concerned chiefly with the accidental; [for example, they ask]
        whether the musical and the grammatical are the same or different; and
        whether musical Coriscus and Coriscus are the same; and whether
        everything which is but has not always been has come to be, so that if
        one who is musical has become grammatical, then one who is grammatical
        has become musical; and all other such arguments. For the accidental
        seems to be close to non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        547. Now this is also clear from these arguments: there is generation
        and corruption of those things which are in another way, but not of
        those things which are by accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        548. Yet concerning the accidental it is necessary to state further, so
        far as it is possible, what its nature is and by what cause it exists;
        and perhaps at the same time it will also become evident why there is no
        science of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        549. Therefore, since there are some beings which always are in the same
        way and of necessity (not necessity in the sense of compulsion, but in
        the sense of that which cannot be otherwise), and others which are
        neither of necessity nor always, but for the most part, this is the
        principle and this the cause of the accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        550. For that which is neither always nor for the most part, we call the
        accidental. For example, if there should be cold and wintry weather
        during the dog days, we say that this is accidental; but not if the
        weather is sultry and hot, because the latter occurs either always or
        for the most part, whereas the former does not. And it is accidental for
        a man to be white, for this is so neither always nor for the most part;
        but it is not accidental for him to be an animal. And it is accidental
        if a builder produces health, because it is not a builder but a
        physician who is naturally fitted to do this; but it is accidental for a
        builder to be a physician. Again, a confectioner, aiming to prepare
        something palatable, may produce something health-giving; but not
        according to the confectioner’s art. Hence we say that it was
        accidental. And while there is a sense in which he produces it, he does
        not produce it in a primary and proper sense. For there are other powers
        which sometimes are productive of other things, but there is no art or
        determinate power which is productive of the accidental; for the cause
        of things which are or come to be by accident is also accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        551. Hence, since not all things are or come to be of necessity and
        always, but most things occur for the most part, the accidental must
        exist; for example, a white man is neither always nor for the most part
        musical. But since this occurs only occasionally, it must be accidental;
        otherwise everything would be of necessity. Hence matter is the
        contingent cause of the accidental, which happens otherwise than usually
        occurs. And we must take as our starting point this question: Is there
        nothing that is neither always nor for the most part, or is this
        impossible? There is, then, besides these something which is contingent
        and accidental. But then there is the question: Does that which occurs
        for the most part and that which occurs always, have no existence, or
        are there some beings which are eternal? These questions must be
        investigated later (1055)
      </p>
      <p>
        552. However, it is evident that there is no science of the accidental,
        for all scientific knowledge is of that which is always or for the most
        part; otherwise how could one be taught or teach anyone else? For a
        thing must be defined either as being so always or for the most part;
        for example, honey-water is beneficial in most cases to those with a
        fever. But with regard to what happens in the other cases, it will be
        impossible to state when they occur, for example, at the new moon; for
        whatever happens at the new moon also happens either always or for the
        most part; but the accidental is contrary to this. We have explained,
        then, what the accidental is, and by what cause it exists, and that
        there is no science of it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>This science is not about accidental being.</i></p>
      <p>
        1171. Here Aristotle indicates with what beings this science chiefly
        intends to deal; and in regard to this he does three things. First, he
        recalls the ways in which things are said to be; second (1172), he
        establishes the nature of the two kinds of being with which he is not
        chiefly concerned (“Since being”); and third (1241), he shows that it is
        not his chief aim to consider these two kinds of being (“But since
        combination”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly he says, first, that being in an unqualified sense, i.e., in
        a universal sense, is predicated of many things, as has been stated in
        Book V (885). In one sense being means what is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental</span>; and in another sense
        it means the same thing as the truth of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">proposition</span> (and non-being the
        same as the falseness of a proposition); and in a third sense being is
        predicated of the things contained under the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">categorical</span> figures, for example,
        the what, of what sort, how much, and so on; and in a fourth sense, in
        addition to all of the above, being applies to what is divided by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">potentiality and actuality</span>
        [modes].
      </p>
      <p>1172. <b>Since being</b> (544).</p>
      <p>
        Here he deals with the senses of being which he intends to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">exclude</span> from this science. First
        (1172), he deals with <i>accidental</i> being; and second (1223), with
        being which is, identical with the <i>true</i> [logical].
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First he shows that there can
        be no science of the accidental. Second (1180), he establishes the
        things that must be considered about accidental being (“Yet concerning
        the accidental”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that since being is used in many senses, as has been
        stated (1170), it is necessary first of all to speak of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental</span> being, so that
        anything which has the character of being in a lesser degree may first
        be excluded from the study of this science. And with regard to this kind
        of being it must be said that no speculation of any science can be
        concerned with it; and he proves this in two ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        1173. He does this first by giving a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">concrete indication</span>. He says that
        the impossibility of there being any speculation about accidental being
        is indicated by the fact that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">no science</span>, howsoever
        “investigative” it may be, or “thoughtful” as another translation says,
        i.e. no matter how carefully it investigates the objects which come
        within its scope, is found to deal with
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental being</span>. No practical
        science (and this is divided into the science of action and productive
        science, as was said above [1152]) is concerned with it, nor even any
        speculative science.
      </p>
      <p>
        1174. He makes this evident, first, in the case of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">practical</span> sciences; for one who
        builds a house, granted that he builds it, is only an accidental cause
        of those things which are accidental to the completed house, since these
        are infinite in number and thus cannot come within the scope of art. For
        nothing prevents the completed house from being “pleasant,” or
        delightful, to those who dwell there happily; “harmful” to those who
        suffer some misfortune occasioned by it; “useful” to those who acquire
        some profit from it; and also “different” from and unlike all other
        things. But the art of building does not produce any of the things which
        are accidental to a house, but only produces a house and the things
        which are essential to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1175. Then he shows that the same thing is true in the case of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">speculative</span> sciences, because
        similarly neither does geometry speculate about those things which are
        accidents “of figures in this way,” i.e., accidentally, but only about
        those attributes which belong essentially to figures. For it speculates
        about a triangle being a figure having “two right angles,” i.e., having
        its three angles equal to two right angles; but it does not speculate
        whether a triangle is anything else, such as wood or something of the
        sort, because these things pertain to a triangle accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>1176. <b>And this is understandable</b> (545)</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves the same thing by means of an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">argument</span>. He says it is
        reasonable that no science should speculate about accidental being,
        because a science studies those things which are being in a (+)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">real</span> sense, but (~) accidental
        being is in a sense being only in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">name</span>, inasmuch as one thing is
        predicated of another. For each thing is a being insofar as it is one.
        But from any two things which are accidentally related to each other
        there comes to be something that is one only in name, i.e., inasmuch as
        one is predicated of the other, for example, when the musical is said to
        be white, or the converse. But this does not happen in such a way that
        some one thing is constituted from whiteness and the musical.
      </p>
      <p>1177. <b>Hence in a way</b> (546).</p>
      <p>
        He proves in two ways that accidental being is in a sense being only in
        name. He does this, first, on the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">authority of Plato</span>; and second
        (1179), by an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says that since accidental being is in a sense being only in name,
        Plato in a way was not wrong when, in allotting different sciences to
        different kinds of substance, he assigned sophistical science to the
        realm of non-being. For the arguments of the sophists are concerned
        chiefly with the accidental, since hidden paralogisms have the fallacy
        of accident as their principal basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        1178. Therefore in the first book of the
        <i>Sophistical Refutations</i> it is said that in arguing against wise
        men the sophists construct syllogisms that are based on the accidental.
        This is evident, for example, in these paralogisms in which the question
        is raised whether the musical and the grammatical are the same or
        different. Let us construct such a paralogism. The musical differs from
        the grammatical; but the musical is the grammatical; hence the musical
        differs from itself. For the musical differs from the grammatical
        essentially speaking, but the musical is the grammatical by accident.
        Little wonder then that an absurd conclusion follows, for what is
        accidental is not distinguished from what is essential. And it would be
        similar if we were to speak thus: Coriscus differs from musical
        Coriscus; but Coriscus is musical Coriscus; therefore Coriscus differs
        from himself. Here too no distinction is drawn between what is
        accidental and what is essential. And it would be the same if we were to
        say: everything which is and has not always been, has come to be; but
        the musical is grammatical and has not always been so; therefore it
        follows that the musical has become grammatical and that the grammatical
        has become musical. But this is false, because no process of generation
        terminates in the grammatical being musical, but one process of
        generation terminates in a man being grammatical and another in a man
        being musical. It is also evident that in this argument the first
        statement is true of something that has being essentially, whereas in
        the second something is assumed that has being only by accident. And it
        is similar in all such argument based on the fallacy of accident. For
        accidental being seems to be close to non-being; and therefore
        sophistics, which is concerned with the apparent and nonexistent, deals
        chiefly with the accidental.
      </p>
      <p>1179. <b>How this is also clear</b> (547).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves the same thing by an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">argument</span>. He says that it is also
        evident, from these arguments which the sophists use, that the
        accidental is close to non-being; for there is generation and corruption
        of those things which are beings in a different way than the accidental
        is, but there is neither generation nor corruption of the accidental.
        For the musical comes to be by one process of generation and the
        grammatical by another, but there is not one process of generation of
        the grammatical musical as there is of two-footed animal or of risible
        man. Hence it is evident that accidental being is not called being in
        any true sense.
      </p>
      <p>1180. <b>Yet concerning te accidental</b> (548).</p>
      <p>
        He now establishes the truth about accidental being insofar as it is
        possible to do so. For even though those things which are properly
        accidental do not come within the scope of any science, still the nature
        of the accidental can be considered by some science. This is also what
        happens in the case of the infinite; for even though the infinite as
        infinite remains unknown, still some science treats of the infinite as
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to this he does two things. First, he settles the issue
        regarding those points which should be investigated about accidental
        being. Second (1191), he rejects an opinion that, would abolish
        accidental being (“Now it is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1181. In regard to the first he does two things. First (548), he says
        that there are three points which must be discussed about
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental being</span>, insofar as it
        is possible to treat of it, namely, (1) what its nature is, and (2) what
        causes it; and from this the third will become evident, (3) why there
        can be no science of it.
      </p>
      <p>1182. <b>Therefore, since there are</b> (549).</p>
      <p>
        He discusses these three points. (2) First, he shows what the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">cause</span> of the accidental is. He
        says that there are some beings which always are in the same way and of
        necessity (not in the sense in which necessity is taken to mean
        compulsion, but in the sense of that which cannot be otherwise than it
        is, as “Man is an animal”); and there are other beings which are neither
        always nor of necessity, but for the most part, i.e., in the majority of
        cases, and “this,” i.e., what occurs in the majority of cases, is the
        principle and the cause of the accidental. For in the case of those
        things which always are there can be nothing accidental, because only
        that which exists of itself can be necessary and eternal, as is also
        stated in Book V (839). Hence it follows that accidental being can be
        found only in the realm of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">contingent</span> things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1183. But that which is contingent, or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">open to opposites</span>, cannot as such
        be the cause of anything. For insofar as it is open to opposites it has
        the character of <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span>, which is
        in potency to two opposites; for nothing acts insofar as it is in
        potency. Hence a cause which is open to opposites in the way that the
        will is, in order that it may act, must be inclined more to one side
        than to the other by being moved by the appetible object, and thus be a
        cause in the majority of cases. But that which takes place in only a few
        instances is the accidental, and it is this whose cause we seek. Hence
        it follows that the cause of the accidental is what occurs in the
        majority of cases, because this
        <span style="font-weight: bold">fails to occur</span> in only a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">few</span> instances. And this is what
        is accidental.
      </p>
      <p>1184. <b>For that which</b> (550).</p>
      <p>
        Second (1), he exposes the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nature</span> of accidental being; and
        he speaks thus: that which exists for the most part is the cause of the
        accidental, because we call that accidental which is neither always nor
        for the most part. And this is the absence of what occurs for the most
        part; so that “if there should be wintry weather,” i.e., a period of
        rain and cold, “during the dog days,” i.e., in the days of the dog star,
        we say that this is accidental. But we do not say this “if the weather
        is sultry” during that time, i.e., if there is a period of drought and
        heat; for the latter occurs always or almost always, but the former does
        not. Similarly we say that it is accidental for a man to be white,
        because this is so neither always nor for the most part. But we say that
        man is an animal essentially, not accidentally, because this is so
        <span style="font-weight: bold">always</span>. And similarly a builder
        causes health accidentally, because a builder inasmuch is he is a
        builder is not naturally fitted to cause health, but only a physician
        can do this. However, a builder may cause health inasmuch as he happens
        to be a physician. Similarly a confectioner, or cook is “aiming,” i.e.,
        intending, to prepare something palatable,” or delightful in the line of
        food, may make something health-giving when he prepares a tasty dish.
        For food which is good and delightful sometimes promotes health. But it
        is not according to the “confectioner’s art,” i.e., the culinary art,
        that he produces something health-giving, but something delightful. And
        for this reason we say that this is accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        1185. And it should be noted that in the (1) first example the
        accidental came about insofar as
        <span style="font-weight: bold">two things</span> happen to occur at the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">same time</span>; in the second, (2)
        insofar as <span style="font-weight: bold">two things</span> happen to
        be present in the <span style="font-weight: bold">same subject</span>,
        as white and man; in the third, (3) insofar as the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">same efficient cause</span> happens to
        be a <span style="font-weight: bold">twofold agent</span>, as a builder
        and a physician; and in the fourth, insofar as the effect happens to be
        twofold, as health and pleasure in the case of food; for while a cook
        prepares a pleasing dish, nevertheless this happens to be health-giving
        by accident. In fact a cook prepares something health-giving only in a
        secondary sense but not in a primary and proper sense, because an art
        operates through knowledge. Hence whatever lies outside the knowledge of
        an art is not produced primarily and properly by that art. Therefore the
        accidental, which lies outside the knowledge of an art, is not produced
        by art. For there are certain determinate powers which sometimes are
        productive of other beings which have being in the proper sense of the
        term, but there is no art or determinate power which is productive of
        beings in an accidental sense. Now the cause of those things which are
        or come to be by accident must be an accidental cause and not a proper
        cause. For effect and cause are proportionate to each other; and
        therefore whatever is an accidental effect has only an accidental cause,
        just as an effect in the proper sense has a cause in the proper sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1186. And since he had said above (1182) that the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">cause</span> of the accidental is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">what occurs for the most part</span>,
        therefore when he says “Hence, since not all,” he shows how the
        accidental exists as a result of what occurs for the most part. He says
        that, since not all things are or come to be always and of necessity,
        “but most things happen for the most part,” i.e., in the majority of
        cases, therefore (#) the accidental must exist; and this is what does
        not occur always or for the most part, as when I say “The white man is
        musical.” Yet because this sometimes happens, although not always or in
        the majority of cases, it follows that this comes about by accident. For
        if that which occurs only occasionally were never to occur, then that
        which occurs in the majority of cases would never fail to occur but
        would be always and of necessity. Thus all things would be eternal and
        necessary. But this is false. And since that which occurs in the
        majority of cases fails to occur because of matter (which is not
        completely subject to the active power of the agent, as happens in the
        majority of cases), then matter is the cause of that which happens to be
        otherwise “than usually occurs,” i.e., of what happens only
        occasionally. This cause, I say, is not a necessary cause but a
        contingent one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1187. Granted that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">not all things are necessary</span> but
        that there is something which is neither always nor for the most part,
        then we must take as our starting-point the question whether there is
        nothing that is neither always nor for the most part. But obviously this
        is impossible; for since that which occurs for the most part is the
        cause of the accidental, then both that which always is and that which
        is for the most part must exist. Hence anything besides the things just
        mentioned is an accidental being.
      </p>
      <p>
        1188. However, the question whether that which occurs for the most part
        is found in some being, and whether that which occurs always is not
        found in any being, or whether there are some things which are eternal,
        must be dealt with later in Book XII (2488), where he will show that
        there are some substances which are eternal. Hence in the first question
        he asks whether all things are accidental; and in the second, whether
        all things are contingent and nothing is eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        1189. Here he establishes the third point, namely, that there is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">no science of the accidental</span>. He
        says that this is evident from the fact that every science is concerned
        with what is either always or for the most part. Therefore, since the
        accidental occurs neither always nor for the most part, there will be no
        science of it. He proves the first thus: one cannot be taught by another
        or teach another about something which does not occur either always or
        for the most part; for anything that may be taught must be defined on
        the grounds that it is so either always or for the most part; for
        example, that “honey-water” (a mixture of honey and water) is beneficial
        to those with a fever, is defined as something that occurs for the most
        part.
      </p>
      <p>
        1190. But with regard to “what happens in the other cases,” i.e., in the
        case of things which are neither always nor for the most part, it cannot
        he said when they will occur, for example, at the time of the new moon;
        for whatever is destined to happen at that time also happens either
        always or for the most part. Or his statement about the new moon can be
        another example of something that is defined as occurring always; and he
        adds the phrase “or for the most part” because of the way in which the
        accidental differs, because it does not occur in either of these ways.
        Hence he adds that “the accidental is contrary to this,” i.e., contrary
        to what occurs always or for the most part. And this is the minor
        premise of the principal argument used above. In bringing his discussion
        to a close he mentions the points which have been explained, namely,
        what the accidental is, and what its cause is, and that there can be no
        science of it.<br /></p

      <p>
        553. Now it is evident that there are principles and causes which are
        generable and corruptible without generation and corruption; for if this
        were not the case, everything would be of necessity, i.e., if there must
        be some cause, and not an accidental one, of that which is generated and
        corrupted. For if we ask: “Will this thing exist or not?” It will if
        some second thing happens; but if the latter does not, neither will the
        former. And this second thing will happen if some third thing does. And
        thus it is evident that when time is continually taken away from a
        limited period of time, one will finally come to the present moment.
        Hence this man will die either from illness or violence if he goes out;
        and he will do this if he gets thirsty; and this will happen if
        something else does. And in this way one will come to what exists now,
        or to something that has already happened; for example, he will go out
        if he gets thirsty, and this will happen if he eats highly seasoned
        food, and this is either the case or not. Therefore it will be from
        necessity that he dies or does not die. And similarly if one jumps back
        to something that has already happened, the same argument applies; for
        this—I mean what has already happened—is already present in something.
        Therefore everything that will be, will be of necessity; for example,
        one who lives shall die; because some part of the process has already
        been completed, as the presence of contraries in the same body. But
        whether he will die from illness or violence has not yet been
        determined, unless something else will have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        554. It is evident, then, that this process goes back to some principle,
        but that this does not go back to anything else. Therefore this will be
        the principle of everything that happens by chance, and there will be no
        cause of its generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        555. But to what kind of principle and what kind of cause such a process
        of reduction leads, whether to matter or to a final cause or to a cause
        of motion, must be given careful consideration. Let us dismiss
        accidental being, then, for it has been dealt with at sufficient length.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Chance and providence</i></p>
      <p>
        1191. Having drawn his conclusions concerning accidental being, the
        Philosopher now rejects an opinion that would completely abolish this
        kind of being. For some men held that whatever comes to pass in the
        world has some <span style="font-weight: bold">proper cause</span>, and
        again that given any cause its
        <span style="font-weight: bold">effect necessarily</span> follows.
        Hence, as a result of the connection between causes it would follow that
        everything in the world happens of necessity and nothing by chance.
        Therefore the Philosopher’s aim is to destroy this position; and in
        regard to this he does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he destroys this position. Second (1201), he draws a conclusion
        from his discussion (“It is evident”). Third (1202), he poses a question
        that arises out of this discussion (“But to what kind of principle”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that it will be evident from the following remarks that
        the principles and causes of the generation and corruption of some
        things “are generable and corruptible,” i.e., they are capable of being
        generated and corrupted, “without generation and corruption, i.e.,
        generation and corruption taking place. For if the generation or
        corruption of one thing is the cause of the generation or corruption of
        another, it is not necessary that the generation or corruption of the
        effect necessarily follows when the generation or corruption of the
        cause takes place, because
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >some causes are active only for the most part</span
        >. Therefore, granted that these causes exist, their effect can be
        hindered accidentally, either because the matter is not disposed, or
        because an opposing agent interferes, or because of some such reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        1192. Yet it must be noted that <i>Avicenna</i> proves in his
        Metaphysics that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >no effect is possible in relation to its own cause but only
          necessary</span
        >. For if when the cause is posited it is possible for its effect not to
        follow, and it does follow (and the potential as such is made actual by
        some actual being), then something else besides this cause will have to
        cause the actual effect to follow. Therefore this cause was not
        sufficient. This appears to be contrary to what the Philosopher says
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        1193. But it must be noted that Avicenna’s statement should be
        understood to apply
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >only if we assume that no obstacle interferes with the cause</span
        >. For given the cause its effect must follow unless there is some
        obstacle, and sometimes this occurs accidentally. Hence the Philosopher
        says that generation and corruption need not follow when the causes of
        generation and corruption are posited.
      </p>
      <p>
        1194. For if this statement were not true, it would follow that all
        things would be of necessity, granted that along with this statement:
        given the cause the effect must follow, another position is also
        maintained, namely, that there must be some proper cause, and not merely
        an accidental one, of each thing which is generated and corrupted. For
        from these two propositions it follows that all things are of necessity.
        He proves this as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        1195. If it is asked whether a thing will be or not, it follows from the
        above remarks that one or the other is true of necessity; because if
        everything that is generated has a proper cause which produces it, and
        if given the cause its effect must ensue, then it follows that that
        thing about which it was asked whether it will exist or not, will come
        to be if its cause is held to exist; and if that cause will not exist,
        neither will its effect. And similarly it will be necessary to say that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >this cause will exist if some other thing which is its cause will
          exist</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        1196. Further, it is evident that regardless of the amount of future
        time that may be taken, whether after a hundred or a thousand years, the
        amount of time beginning from the present moment up to that point is
        limited. However, since the generation of a cause is prior in time to
        the generation of its effect, then by proceeding from effect to cause we
        must subtract some part of future time and come closer to the present.
        But every limited thing is used up by having some part of it constantly
        taken away. Thus by proceeding from an effect to its cause and again
        from that cause to its cause and so on in this way, it follows that the
        whole period of future time is used up, since it is limited, and in this
        way the present moment is reached.
      </p>
      <p>
        1197. This is clear in the following example. If every effect has some
        proper cause from which it follows of necessity, then this man must die
        of necessity, either from illness or violence, if he leaves the house.
        For his leaving the house is found to be the cause of his death by
        either violence (for example, if on leaving the house he is discovered
        by robbers and is killed), or illness (for example, if on leaving the
        house because he is hot he contracts a fever and dies). And in the same
        way it will also happen of necessity that he leaves the house in order
        to draw water from a well if he is thirsty; for thirst is the cause of
        his leaving the house in order to draw water. And similarly by the same
        argument it will also happen of necessity that he is thirsty if there is
        something else which causes his thirst; and thus by proceeding from
        effect to cause in this way one comes to “something which exists now,”
        i.e., to some present thing or to “something that has already happened,”
        i.e., to some past event. For example, if we were to say that a man will
        be thirsty if he eats highly seasoned or salty food which makes him
        thirsty, his eating or not eating salty food is in the present. Thus it
        follows that “the aforesaid future event,” namely, that this man will
        die or not die, will happen of necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        1198. For since every conditional proposition is a necessary one, then
        granted the antecedent the consequent must follow; for eaxmple, this
        conditional proposition is true: “If Socrates runs, he moves.”
        Therefore, granted that he runs, he must be moving so long as he runs.
        But if any effect has a proper cause from which it follows of necessity,
        then that conditional proposition must be true of which the antecedent
        is the cause and the consequent is the effect. And although there are
        sometimes several intermediates between a cause which exists at the
        present moment and an effect which will exist in the future (each of
        which is an effect in relation to those preceding it and a cause in
        relation to those following it), nevertheless it follows from first to
        last that any conditional proposition is true whose antecedent is
        present and whose consequent exists at some future time, for example,
        the proposition: “If a man eats salty food, he will be killed.” Now the
        antecedent refers to what is present, and therefore it will be by
        necessity that he is killed. And in this way all other future events
        whose proximate or remote causes exist in the present will be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        1199. The same argument applies if one in proceeding from effects to
        causes “jumps back to something that has already happened,” or to past
        events, that is to say, if one traces future effects back to some past
        cause that is not present; for that which is past nevertheless still is
        in some sense. I say this insofar as it has occurred, or is past. For
        even though Caesar’s life is not now, in the present, nevertheless it is
        in the past, because it is true that Caesar has lived. Thus it is
        possible to hold as true now the antecedent of a conditional proposition
        in whose antecedent clause there is a past cause and in whose consequent
        clause there is a future effect. And thus since all future effects must
        be traced back to such present or past causes, it follows that all
        future events happen of necessity. For example, we say that it is
        absolutely necessary that one now living is going to die, because this
        follows of necessity in reference to something that has already come to
        pass, namely, that there are two contraries in the same body by reason
        of its composition; for this conditional proposition is true, “If a body
        is composed of contraries, it will be corrupted.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1200. But it is impossible that all future events should happen of
        necessity. Therefore the two premises from which this conclusion would
        follow are impossible, namely, that any effect has a proper cause, and
        that given the cause its effect must follow. For from this would follow
        the position already mentioned, namely, that there are some causes
        already posited for any future effect; for example, some causes have
        already been posited for the corruption of an animal. But no cause has
        yet been posited from which it will follow of necessity that this man
        will die either from illness or violence.
      </p>
      <p>1201. <b>It is evident</b> (554).</p>
      <p>
        He draws a conclusion from the foregoing discussion. He says that, since
        not everything which comes to be has a proper cause, it is therefore
        evident that in the case of future contingent events the reduction of a
        future effect to some proper cause goes back to some principle, and that
        this principle is not reduced to some other proper principle but will be
        the cause of “everything that happens by chance,” i.e., an accidental
        cause, and that there will be no other cause of that accidental cause;
        just as we have already said (1184) that accidental being has no cause
        and is not generated. For example, the cause of this man being killed by
        robbers is a proper cause, because he is wounded by robbers; and this
        also has a proper cause, because he is found by the robbers; but this
        has only an accidental cause. For if on his way to work this man is
        wounded by robbers, this is accidental, as is evident from the
        foregoing; and therefore it is not necessary to posit a cause for this.
        For that which is accidental is not generated, and thus it is not
        necessary to look for some proper cause which produces it, as was said
        above.
      </p>
      <p>1202. <b>But to what kind of principle</b> (555).</p>
      <p>
        Here he poses a question arising out of the foregoing discussion; for he
        has just said above that the causes of those beings which are accidental
        are ultimately reduced to some principle for which it is impossible to
        give another cause. Hence he inquires here about this process of
        reduction or
        <span style="font-family: 'Bwgrkl', serif">avnagwgh,</span>, which means
        the same as “
        <span style="font-weight: bold">to what kind of principle</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">what kind of cause</span> it should be
        reduced,”, i.e., to what class of cause or principle, whether to some
        first cause which is a material cause, or to one which is a final cause
        (or that for the sake of which a thing comes to be), or to one which is
        a mover. He omits the formal cause because the question here involves
        the cause responsible for the generation of things that come to be by
        accident. But in the process of generation a form has no causal role
        except that of an end, because in the process of generation the end and
        the form are identical. Now he does not answer the question which is
        raised here, but assumes its solution from what has been established in
        Book II of the <i>Physics</i>; for it was shown there that fortune and
        chance, which are the causes of things that come to be by accident, are
        reduced to the class of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause. Hence he
        concludes from the above that we must omit any discussion of accidental
        being, because the truth concerning it has been established as
        completely as it is possible to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        1203. It must be noted, however, that the doctrine of the Philosopher
        set forth here seems to do away with certain things which some thinkers
        hold in philosophy, namely,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">fate and providence</span>. For here the
        force of the Philosopher’s argument is that not all that occurs may be
        traced back to some proper cause from which it follows of necessity,
        otherwise it would follow that everything in the world would be of
        necessity and nothing by accident. But those who posit fate say that the
        contingent events occurring here, which appear to be accidental, can be
        traced back to some power of a celestial body, whose activity produces
        in a certain order those things which, viewed in themselves, seem
        accidental. And similarly those who posit providence say that whatever
        occurs here is ordained by the order of providence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1204. From both of these positions, then, there seem to follow two
        conclusions which are opposed to what the philosopher establishes here.
        (1) The first is that <span style="font-weight: bold">nothing</span> in
        the world happens
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidentally</span> either by fortune or
        by chance; for those things which occur in a certain order are not
        accidental, since they occur either always or for the most part. (2) The
        second is that <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> things happen
        <span style="font-weight: bold">of necessity</span>. For if all those
        things whose cause is placed in the present or has been placed in the
        past occur of necessity, as the Philosopher’s argument maintains, and if
        the cause of those things which come under providence or fate is placed
        in the present or has already been placed in the past (because
        providence is unchangeable and eternal, and the motion of the heavens is
        also invariable), it seems to follow that those things which come under
        providence or fate happen of necessity. Thus if everything that occurs
        here is subject to fate and providence, it follows that everything
        happens of necessity. Therefore according to the mind of the Philosopher
        it seems impossible to posit either fate or providence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1205. In clearing up this difficulty it must be noted that the higher a
        cause the more extensive is its causality, for a higher cause produces
        its own proper higher effect, which is more general and extends to many
        things. For example, in the case of the arts it is evident that the
        political art, which is higher than the military art, has jurisdiction
        over the entire political community, whereas the military art has
        jurisdiction only over those things which fall within the military
        sphere. But the order found in the effects of a cause extends only so
        far as the causality of that cause extends, for every cause in the
        proper sense has definite effects which it produces in a certain order.
        It is evident, then, that (a) when effects are referred to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">lower</span> causes they seem to be
        unrelated and to coincide with each other accidentally, but (b) that
        when they are referred to some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">higher</span> common cause they are
        found to be related and not accidentally connected but to be produced
        simultaneously by one proper cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1206. For example, if the blossoming of one plant is referred to a
        particular power in this plant and the blossoming of a second plant is
        referred to a particular power in that plant, there seems to be no
        reason (indeed it seems to be accidental) why the first plant should
        blossom when the second does. And this is true, because the cause of the
        power of the first plant extends to the blossoming of this plant and not
        to that of the second, so that while it causes the first plant to
        blossom, it does not cause it to blossom at the same time as the second.
        But if this is attributed to the power of a celestial body, which is a
        universal cause, then we find that the first plant blossoms when the
        second does, not by accident, but by the direction of some first cause,
        which ordains this and moves each plant to blossom at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        1207. Now we find three grades of causes in the world. (1) First, there
        is a cause which is incorruptible and immutable, namely, the divine
        cause; (2) second, beneath this there are causes which are incorruptible
        but mutable, namely, the celestial bodies; and (3) third, beneath this
        there are those causes which are corruptible and mutable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore causes in this (3) third grade are particular causes and are
        determined to proper effects of the same kind; for example, fire
        generates fire, man generates man, and plants generate plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        1208. Now a cause belonging to the (2) second grade is in one sense
        universal and in another particular. It is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">particular</span> because it extends to
        some special class of beings, namely, to those which are generated by
        motion; for it is both a cause of motion and something that is moved.
        And it is <span style="font-weight: bold">universal</span> because its
        causality extends not only to one class of changeable things but to
        everything that is altered, generated and corrupted; for that which is
        first moved must be the cause of everything that is subsequently moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        1209. But the cause belonging to the (1) first grade is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">universal without qualification</span>,
        because its proper effect is existence. Hence whatever exists, and in
        whatever way it exists, comes properly under the causality and direction
        of that cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1210. If, then, we attribute all contingent events here to particular
        causes only, many things will be found to occur accidentally. This will
        be so for a number of reasons. (1) First, because of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">conjunction</span> of two causes one of
        which does not come under the causality of the other, as when robbers
        attack me without my intending this; for this meeting is caused by a
        twofold motive power, namely, mine and that of the robbers. (2) Second,
        because of some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">defect in the agent</span>, who is so
        weak that he cannot attain the goal at which he aims, for example, when
        someone falls on the road because of fatigue. (3) Third, because of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">indisposition of the matter</span>,
        which does not receive the form intended by the agent but another kind
        of form. This is what occurs, for example, in the case of the deformed
        parts of animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        1211. But if these contingent events are traced back further to a
        celestial body, we find that many of them are not accidental; because
        even though particular causes are not contained under each other, they
        are nevertheless contained under one common celestial cause. Hence their
        concurrence can be attributed to one definite celestial cause. Again,
        since the power of a celestial body is incorruptible and impassible, no
        effect can escape from the sphere of its causality because of any defect
        or weakness of its power. But since it acts by moving, and since every
        agent of this kind requires a matter which is properly determined or
        disposed, then in the case of natural beings it can happen that the
        power of a celestial body fails to produce its effect because the matter
        is not disposed; and this will be accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        1212. Therefore, even though many things which seem to be accidental
        when traced back to these particular causes are found not to be
        accidental when traced back to a common universal cause, namely, to a
        celestial body, yet even when this reduction has been made some things
        are found to be accidental, as the Philosopher stated above (1201). For
        when an agent produces its effect for the most part but not always, it
        follows that it fails in a few instances; and this is accidental. If,
        then, the celestial bodies cause their effects in these lower bodies for
        the most part but not always, because the matter is not properly
        disposed, then it follows that, when the power of a celestial body fails
        to produce its effect, this happens accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        1213. There is also another reason why things happen accidentally even
        if causality is traced back to a celestial body. It is that in the
        sphere of lower bodies there are some efficient causes which
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >can act of themselves without the influence of a celestial body</span
        >. These causes are <i>rational souls</i>, to which the power of a
        celestial body does not extend (since they are not forms subjected to
        bodies), except in an accidental way, i.e., inasmuch as the influence of
        a celestial body produces some change in the [human] body, and
        accidentally in the powers of the soul which are actualities of certain
        parts of the body, by which the rational soul is disposed to act.
        However, no necessity is involved, since the soul’s dominion over the
        passions is free inasmuch as it may not assent to them. Therefore in the
        sphere of lower bodies whatever things are found to happen accidentally
        when reduced to these causes, i.e., rational souls, insofar as they do
        not follow the inclination produced by the influence of a celestial
        body, will not be found to be generated in any essential way by being
        traced back to the power of a celestial body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1214. Thus it is evident that to posit
        <span style="font-weight: bold">fate</span>, which is a certain
        disposition present in lower bodies as a result of the activity of a
        celestial body, is not to do away with everything that happens by
        chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1215. But if these contingent events are traced back further to the
        highest, <span style="font-weight: bold">divine cause</span>, it will be
        impossible to find anything that lies outside its sphere of influence,
        since its causality extends to all things insofar as they are beings.
        Hence its causal activity cannot be thwarted as a result of the matter
        being indisposed, because matter itself and its dispositions do not lie
        outside the domain of this agent, since He is the agent who gives things
        their being and not merely moves and changes them. For it cannot be said
        that matter is presupposed as the subject of being as it is presupposed
        as the subject of motion; it is rather part of the essence of a thing.
        Therefore, just as the power of changing and moving is not hindered by
        the essence of motion or its terminus but by the subject which is
        presupposed, in a similar fashion the power of the one giving being is
        not hindered by matter or anything which accrues in any way to the being
        of a thing. From this it is also evident that in the sphere of lower
        bodies no efficient cause can be found which is not subject to the
        control of this first cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1216. It follows, then, that everything which occurs here insofar as it
        is related to the first divine cause, is found to be ordained by it and
        not to be accidental, although it may be found to be accidental in
        relation to other causes. This is why the Catholic faith says that
        nothing in the world happens by chance or fortuitously, and that
        everything is subject to divine providence. But in this place Aristotle
        is speaking of those contingent events which occur here as a result of
        particular causes, as is evident from his example.
      </p>
      <p>
        1217. It now remains to see how the affirming of fate and
        <i>providence</i>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">does not eliminate contingency</span>
        from the world, as though all things were to happen of necessity. From
        the things that have been said above it is evident that <i>fate</i> does
        not do away with contingency. For it has been shown already that, even
        though the celestial bodies and their motions and activities are
        necessary, nevertheless their effects in these lower bodies can fail
        either because the matter is not disposed or because the rational soul
        may freely choose to follow or not follow the inclinations produced in
        it by the influence of a celestial body. Thus it follows that effects of
        this sort do not happen of necessity but contingently; for to posit a
        celestial cause is not to posit a cause of such a kind that its effect
        follows of necessity, as the death of an animal is a result of its being
        composed of contraries, as he mentions in the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        1218. But there is greater difficulty with regard to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">providence</span>, because divine
        providence cannot fail; for these two statements are incompatible,
        namely, that something is foreknown by God, and that it does not come to
        pass. Hence it seems that, once providence is posited, its effect
        follows of necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        1219. But it must be noted that an effect and all of its proper
        accidents depend on one and the same cause; for just as a man is from
        nature, so also are his proper accidents, such as risibility and
        susceptibility to mental instruction. However, if some cause does not
        produce man in an absolute sense but such and such a man, it will not be
        within the power of this cause to produce the proper attributes of man
        but only to make use of them. For while the statesman makes man a
        citizen, he does not make him susceptible to mental instruction. Rather
        he makes use of this property in order to make a citizen of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        1220. Now, as has been pointed out (1215),
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >being as being has God himself as its cause</span
        >. Hence just as being itself is subject to divine providence, so also
        are all the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidents of being as being</span>,
        among which are found <i>necessity</i> and <i>contingency</i>. Therefore
        it belongs to divine providence not only to produce a particular being
        but also to give it contingency or necessity; for insofar as God wills
        to give contingency or necessity to anything, He has prepared for it
        certain intermediate causes from which it follows either of necessity or
        contingently. Hence the effect of every cause is found to be necessary
        insofar as it comes under the control of providence. And from this it
        follows that this conditional proposition is true: “If anything is
        foreknown by God, it will be.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1221. However, insofar as any effect is considered to come under its
        <span style="font-weight: bold">proximate</span> cause, not every effect
        is necessary; but some are necessary and some contingent in proportion
        to their cause. For effects are likened in their nature to their
        proximate causes, but not to their remote causes, whose state they
        cannot attain.
      </p>
      <p>
        1222. It is evident, then, that when we speak of divine providence we
        must say that this thing is foreseen by God not only insofar
        <span style="font-weight: bold">as it is</span> but also insofar
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >as it is either contingent or necessary</span
        >. Therefore, just because divine providence is held to exist, it does
        not follow, according to the argument which Aristotle gives here, that
        every effect happens of necessity, but only that it must be either
        contingent or necessary. In fact this applies solely in the case of this
        cause, i.e., divine providence, because the remaining causes do not
        establish the law of necessity or contingency, but make use of this law
        established by a higher cause. Hence the only thing that is subject to
        the causality of any other cause is that its effect be. But that it be
        either necessary or contingent depends on a higher cause, which is the
        cause of being as being, and the one from which the order of necessity
        and of contingency originates in the world.<br /></p

      <p>
        556. Again, being in the sense of the true and non-being in the sense of
        the false [are not to be considered] since such being depends on
        combination and separation, and these taken together form both parts of
        a contradiction. For truth resides in the affirmation of one side of a
        contradiction when there is combination, and in the negation when there
        is separation. But falsity consists in the reverse of this division.
      </p>
      <p>
        557. But how [the intellect] happens to understand [things which are
        combined and separated, whether] together or separately, pertains to
        another discussion; and by understanding things together or separately I
        mean understanding them not successively but insofar as they form a
        unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        558. For what is true and what is false are not in things themselves, so
        that what is good is true and what is evil is false, but only in the
        mind. And with regard to simple concepts and the whatness of things
        there is neither truth nor falsity in the mind. Hence the things which
        must be investigated about being and non-being in this sense must be
        considered later on (806).
      </p>
      <p>
        559. But since combination and separation exist in thought and not in
        things, and being in this sense is different from being in the proper
        senses (for these are either what a thing is, or of what sort, or how
        much, or anything else that the mind combines or separates), then being
        in the sense of what is accidental and being in the sense of what is
        true must be omitted from this science. For the cause of the former is
        the indeterminate, and of the latter some positive state of mind; and
        both of these pertain to the remaining class of being and do not
        indicate the existence of any definite kind of being outside of the
        mind. For this reason, then, let us exclude them from our study, and let
        us look for the causes and principles of being as being. Now from our
        discussions of the different meanings of words it is evident that being
        is used in several senses (435).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        <i>The “being” of propositions is not the subject of this science.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        1223. Having drawn his conclusions about accidental being, the
        Philosopher now settles the issue about the being which signifies the
        truth of a proposition; and in regard to this he does two things. First
        (556:C 1223), he determines the meaning of this kind of being. Second
        (1241), he excludes it from the principal study of this science (“But
        since combination”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he determines the
        meaning of this kind of being. Second (1227), he answers a question
        (“But how [the intellect]”). Third (1230) he clarifies a statement which
        he had made (“For what is true”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that “in one sense
        <span style="font-weight: bold">being</span> means what is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span>,” i.e., it signifies nothing
        else than truth; for when we ask if man is an animal, the answer is that
        he is, by which it is meant that this proposition is true. And in the
        same way <span style="font-weight: bold">non-being</span> signifies in a
        sense what is <span style="font-weight: bold">false</span>; for when one
        answers that he is not, it is meant that the statement made is false.
        Now this ‘being which means what is true, and non-being which means what
        is false, depend on combination and separation; for simple terms signify
        neither truth nor falsity, whereas complex terms have truth and falsity
        through affirmation or negation. And here affirmation is called
        combination because it signifies that a predicate belongs to a subject,
        whereas negation is called separation because it signifies that a
        predicate does not belong to a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1224. Further, since words are the signs of concepts, we must speak in
        the same way about the concepts of the intellect; for those which are
        simple do not have truth and falsity, but only those which are complex
        through affirmation or negation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1225. And since the being and non-being just mentioned—the true and the
        false—depend on combination and separation, they therefore also depend
        on the division of a contradiction; for each part of a contradiction
        separates the true and the false from each other so that one part is
        true and the other is false. For since a contradiction is constituted of
        an affirmation and a negation, and each of these is constituted of a
        predicate and a subject, then a predicate and a subject can be related
        to each other in two ways; because they are either connected in reality,
        as man and animal, or are unconnected, as man and ass.
      </p>
      <p>
        1226. Hence, if two contradictions are formed, one from connected terms,
        as “Man is an animal” and “Man is not an animal,” and another from
        unconnected terms, as “Man is an ass” and “Man is not an ass,” then
        truth and falsity divide each contradiction between themselves, so that
        the true on its side “resides in affirmation when there is combination,”
        i.e., in connected terms, and “in negation when there is separation,”
        i.e., in unconnected terms. For these two propositions “Man is an
        animal” and “Man is not an ass” are true. But the false on its side
        resides in the reverse of this division, i.e., in the contradictory of
        those statements which fall on the side of the true, because it consists
        in the negating of connected terms and in the affirming of unconnected
        terms; for these two propositions “Man is not an animal” and “Man is an
        ass” are false.
      </p>
      <p>1227. <b>But how [the intellect]</b> (557).</p>
      <p>
        Here he dismisses a problem that could arise from the foregoing remarks.
        For he said that the true and the false consist
        <span style="font-weight: bold">secondarily</span> in the combination
        and separation of <i>words</i>, but
        <span style="font-weight: bold">primarily</span> and properly in the
        combination and separation which the <i>intellect</i> makes. Now every
        combination and separation involves a plurality, and therefore the
        problem can arise how the intellect understands things which are
        combined and separated, whether together or separately. But he says that
        this pertains to another discussion, namely, to <i>The Soul</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1228. Now <i>together</i> is used in two senses. (1) For sometimes it
        signifies a <span style="font-weight: bold">unity</span>, as when we say
        that those things which exist at one and the same instant are together
        in time; and (2) sometimes it signifies the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">connection and proximity</span> of
        things which succeed each other, as when we say that two men are
        together in place when their places are joined and next to each other,
        and in time when their times succeed each other. And since this is so,
        he therefore answers the proposed question which asks whether the
        intellect understands things which are combined or separated, together
        or separately, by saying that it does not understand them together
        according as some things are said to be together (~) insofar as they
        succeed each other, but (+) according as they are said to be together
        insofar as they form <span style="font-weight: bold">one</span> thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1229. And in this way he indicates the solution of this question. For
        (1) if the intellect understands a man and an animal as they are in
        themselves, as two
        <span style="font-weight: bold">distinct</span> things, it understands
        them successively by two simple concepts without forming an affirmation
        or a negation from them. But (2) when it
        <span style="font-weight: bold">combines</span> or separates them, it
        understands them both as one thing, i.e., according as one thing is
        constituted from them; just as the intellect also understands the parts
        of a whole as one thing by understanding the whole itself. For the
        intellect does not understand a house by understanding first the
        foundation and then the walls and then the roof, but it understands all
        of these together insofar as one thing is constituted from them. And in
        a similar way it understands a predicate and a subject together insofar
        as one judgment is constituted from them, namely, an affirmation or a
        negation.
      </p>
      <p>1230. <b>For what is true</b> (558).</p>
      <p>
        He explains a statement which he had made to the effect that truth and
        falsity consist in combination and separation; and he proves this by
        means of the process of elimination. For some of the things signified by
        a word are found in things outside of the mind, but others are found
        only in the mind. For white and black are found outside of the mind, but
        their concepts are found only in the mind. Now someone might think that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">the true and the false</span> are also
        found in things, just as good and evil are, so that the true is a kind
        of good and the false a kind of evil; for this would be necessary if
        truth and falsity were found in things, since truth signifies a certain
        perfection of nature, and falsity a defect. Moreover, every perfection
        existing in things pertains to the perfection and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">goodness</span> of their nature, whereas
        every defect and privation pertains to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">evil</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1231. But he denies this, saying that the true and the false are not
        found in things in such a way that what is true on the part of reason is
        a kind of natural good, and what is false a kind of evil, but “they are
        found <span style="font-weight: bold">only in the mind</span>,” or
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        1232. The intellect, however, has two operations. One of these is called
        the understanding of indivisibles, and this is the operation by which
        the intellect forms simple concepts of things by understanding the
        whatness of each one of them. The other operation is that by which the
        intellect combines and separates.
      </p>
      <p>
        1233. Now while truth and falsity are in the mind, they do not pertain
        to that operation by which the mind forms simple concepts and the
        whatness of things. This is what he means when he says “with regard to
        simple concepts and the whatness of things there is neither truth nor
        falsity in the mind.” Hence as a result of this process of elimination
        it follows that since truth and falsity are neither in things nor in the
        mind when it apprehends simple concepts and the whatness of things, they
        must pertain <span style="font-weight: bold">primarily</span> and
        principally to the combination and separation which the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">mind</span> makes, and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">secondarily</span> to that of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">words</span>, which signify the mind’s
        conceptions. Further, he concludes that everything which must be
        considered about being and non-being in this sense, namely, insofar as
        being signifies the true, and non-being the false, “must be considered
        later on,” i.e., at the end of Book IX (1895), and also in
        <i>The Soul</i>, and in his works on logic. For the whole of logic seems
        to be devoted to the being and non-being spoken of in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1234. Now it must be noted that any kind of knowing attains its
        completion as a result of the likeness of the thing known existing in
        the knowing subject. Therefore, just as the completion of the thing
        known depends upon this thing having the kind of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">form</span> which makes it to be such
        and such a thing, in a similar fashion the completion of the act of
        knowing depends upon the knowing subject having the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">likeness of this form</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, just as the thing known is said to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">good</span> because it has the form
        which it ought to have, and evil because it is defective in some way, in
        a similar fashion the knowledge of the knowing subject is said to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span> because this subject
        possesses a likeness of the thing known, and false because its knowledge
        falls short of such a likeness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, just as
        <span style="font-weight: bold">good and evil</span> designate
        perfections of things, in a similar way
        <span style="font-weight: bold">truth and falsity</span> designate
        perfections of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        1235. But even though in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">sensory</span> perception there can be a
        likeness of the thing known, nevertheless it does not belong to the
        senses to know the formality of this likeness but only to the intellect.
        Hence, even though the senses can be true in relation to sensible
        objects, they
        <span style="font-weight: bold">still cannot know the truth</span>, but
        only the intellect can do this. And this is why it is said that truth
        and falsity are in the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        1236. And although the intellect has within itself a likeness of the
        things known according as it forms concepts of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">incomplex</span> things, it does not for
        that reason make a <i>judgment</i> about this likeness. This occurs only
        when it <span style="font-weight: bold">combines</span> or separates.
        For when the intellect forms a concept of mortal rational animal, it has
        within itself a likeness of man; but it does not for that reason know
        that it has this likeness, since it does not judge that “Man is a mortal
        rational animal.” There is truth and falsity, then, only in this second
        operation of the intellect, according to which it not only possesses a
        likeness of the thing known but also reflects on this likeness by
        knowing it and by making a judgment about it. Hence it is evident from
        this that truth is not found in things but only in the mind, and that it
        depends upon combination and separation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1237. And if a <span style="font-weight: bold">thing</span> is sometimes
        said to be <span style="font-weight: bold">false</span>, and the same
        applies to a definition, this will be so in reference to affirmation and
        negation. For a false thing, as is said at the end of Book V (1128),
        means (a) one that does not exist in any way (for example, the
        commensurability of a diagonal) or (b) one that exists but is naturally
        disposed to appear otherwise than it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly a <span style="font-weight: bold">definition</span> is said to
        be <span style="font-weight: bold">false</span> either because it is not
        the definition of any existing thing or because it is assigned to
        something other than that of which it is the definition. For it is
        evident that falsity is said to be in things or in definitions in all of
        these ways by reason of a false statement made about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1238. The same thing is evident in the case of truth. For a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">thing</span> is said to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span> when it has the proper form
        which is shown to be present in it; and a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">definition</span> is said to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span> when it really fits the
        thing to which it is assigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        1239. It is also evident that nothing prevents truth from being a kind
        of <span style="font-weight: bold">good</span> insofar as the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">knowing intellect</span> is taken as a
        thing. For just as every other thing is said to be good because of its
        perfection, in a similar fashion the intellect which knows is said to be
        good because of its truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        1240. It is also evident from the statements made here that the true and
        the false, which are objects of knowing, are found in the mind, but that
        good and evil, which are the objects of appetite, are found in things.
        And it is also evident that, just as the act of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">knowing</span> attains its completion as
        a result of the things known existing in the knowing subject, in a
        similar fashion every
        <span style="font-weight: bold">appetite</span> attains its completion
        as a result of the ordering of the appetitive subject to its appetible
        objects.
      </p>
      <p>1241. <b>But since combination</b> (559).</p>
      <p>
        Here he <span style="font-weight: bold">excludes</span> being in the
        sense of the <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span> and being in
        the sense of the <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental</span> from
        the principal consideration of this science. He says that combination
        and separation, on which truth and falsity depend, are found in the mind
        and not in things; and that if any combination is also found in things,
        such combination produces a unity which the intellect understands as one
        by a simple concept. But that combination or separation by which the
        intellect combines or separates its concepts is found only in the
        intellect and not in things. For it consists in a certain comparison of
        two concepts, whether these two are identical or distinct in reality.
        For sometimes the intellect uses one concept as two when it forms a
        combination, as when we say “Man is man”; and it is clear from this that
        such a combination is found only in the intellect and not in things.
        Therefore whatever is a being in the sense of the true, and consists in
        such a combination, differs from those things which are beings in the
        proper sense and are realities outside of the mind, cach of which is
        “either what a thing is,” i.e., substance, or of what sort, or how much,
        or any of the simple concepts which the mind combines or separates.
      </p>
      <p>
        1242. Therefore both being in the sense of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental</span> and being in the sense
        of the true must be excluded from this science. For the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">cause</span> of the former—being in the
        sense of the accidental—is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">indeterminate</span>, and therefore it
        does not come within the scope of art, as has been shown (1174);

        and the cause of the latter—being in the sense of the true—is “some
        positive state of mind,” i.e., the operation of the intellect combining
        and separating, and therefore it belongs to that science which studies
        the intellect.

        1243. Another reason for excluding them is that, while “both of these,”
        namely, being in the sense of the true and accidental being, (+) belong
        to <span style="font-weight: bold">some</span> class of being, (~) they
        do not belong to being in the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">proper</span> sense, which is found in
        reality. Nor do they designate another kind of being distinct from
        beings in the proper sense. For it is evident that accidental being is a
        result of the coincidental connection of beings which exist outside the
        mind, each of which is a being of itself. For even though the
        grammatical musical has being only accidentally, nevertheless both
        grammatical and musical are beings in the proper sense, because each of
        these taken by itself has a definite cause. Similarly the intellect
        combines and separates those things which are contained in the
        categories.

        1244. If, then, the class of being contained in the categories is
        sufficiently dealt with, the nature of accidental being and being in the
        sense of the true will be evident. And for this reason we must exclude
        these types of being and investigate the causes and principles of beings
        as beings in the proper sense. This is also evident from what has been
        established in Book V (885), where, in discussing the different senses
        of such terms, it was stated that being is used in many senses, as
        follows below at the beginning of Book VII (1240).
