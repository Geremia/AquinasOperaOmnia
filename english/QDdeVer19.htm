    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it cannot, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. No activity common to soul and body can remain in the soul after death.
    But understanding is an activity common to soul and body. For the
    Philosopher says: “To say that the soul understands is like saying that it
    weaves or builds.” Therefore, after death the soul cannot understand.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. It was said that the Philosopher is speaking of the act of understanding
    which befits the soul in its lower aspect, but not about the act which
    befits it in its higher aspect.—On the contrary, the higher aspect of the
    soul is that according to which it turns to the things of God. However, even
    when man understands something by reason of divine revelation, his
    understanding depends on the body, because he must understand through
    conversion to phantasms, which are in a bodily organ. For, as Dionysius
    says: “It is impossible for the divine radiance to shine on us unless it is
    shrouded with a variety of sacred veils. For him, veils are the bodily forms
    under which spiritual things are revealed. Therefore, the act of
    understanding which belongs to the soul according to its higher aspect
    depends on the body. Consequently, understanding in no way remains in the
    soul after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In Ecclesiastes (9:5) it is said: “For the living know that they shall
    die, but the dead know nothing more.” The Gloss reads: “For they make no
    more progress.”Therefore, it seems that after death the soul either knows
    nothing, if we take “more” in a temporal sense, or at least that it can
    understand nothing it did not understand before. For it thus would make more
    progress, which is contrary to the Gloss.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. According to the Philosopher, the understanding is related to phantasms
    as the senses are to sensible things. But sense can have sensation only when
    sensible things are presented to it. Therefore, neither can the human soul
    understand anything unless phantasms are presented to it. But they are not
    presented to it after death, because they are presented only in a bodily
    organ. Therefore, after death the soul cannot understand.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. It was said that the Philosopher is speaking of the soul according to the
    state in which it is in the body.—On the contrary, the object of a power is
    determined by the nature of the power itself. But the nature of the
    intellective soul is the same before and after death. Therefore, if the
    intellective soul has an ordination to phantasms as objects before death, it
    seems that it will likewise have it after death. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The soul cannot understand if the intellective power is taken away from
    it. But, after death, the intellective powers, agent and possible intellect,
    do not remain in the soul, for these powers belong to it by reason of its
    union with the body. For, if it were not united to the body, it would not
    have these powers, just as an angel does not have them. Therefore, after
    death the soul cannot understand.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The Philosopher says: “Understanding is destroyed when something within
    us is destroyed.” But that thing within us, about which the Philosopher is
    speaking, is destroyed in death. Therefore, there will be no understanding
    after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. If the soul understands after death, it must understand through some
    power, because everything which acts, acts through some active power, and
    everything which is acted upon is acted upon through some passive power.
    Therefore, it will understand either through the same power which it had in
    this life or through another. If through another, it seems that new powers
    are produced in it when it is separated from the body. But this does not
    seem probable. However, if it understands through the same power, this does
    not seem correct either, since the powers which it has are in it by reason
    of its union with the body. And this union ceases with death. Therefore, the
    soul cannot understand after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. If the intellective power remains in the soul, it remains only in so far
    as it is grounded in the substance of the soul, or in so far as it has
    reference to act. But it does not remain in so far as it is grounded in the
    substance of the soul, since, if it remained tnly in this way, after death
    it would be able to understand nothing but itself. Nor does it remain in so
    far as it has reference to act, for, in so far as it has reference to act,
    it is brought to completion through the habits which it has acquired in the
    body, and these habits depend on the body. Therefore, it seems that the
    intellective power does not remain after death; hence, the soul will not
    understand after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Everything which is understood is understood through the essence of the
    thing understanding, through the essence of the thing understood, or through
    a likeness of the thing understood which exists in the one understanding.
    But it cannot be said that the soul understands things only through the
    essence of the thing understood, for thus it would understand only itself,
    its habits, and other things the essences of which are present in the soul.
    Likewise, it cannot be said to understand only through the essence of itself
    as understanding for, if it understood things beside itself in this way, its
    essence would have to be the exemplar of other things, just as the divine
    essence is the exemplar of all things, for which reason God understands all
    other things by understanding His essence. But this cannot be said of the
    soul. Again, it cannot be said to understand through likenesses of the
    things understood which exist in the soul, since it would seem that above
    all it understands through the species which it has acquired in the body.
    And it cannot be said to understand only through them, because the souls of
    children, which have received nothing from the senses, would thus understand
    nothing after death. Therefore, it seems that the soul cannot understand in
    any way after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. If it be said that it knows through species with which it is created,
    the answer is that whatever is created along with the soul belongs to it
    just as much when it is existing in the body as when it is separated from
    the body. Therefore, if species through which it can know are created along
    with the human soul, to know through these species befits the soul not only
    after it is separated from the body but also while it is in the body. Thus,
    it seems that the species which it receives from things would be
    superfluous.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. If it be said that the body makes it impossible for the soul to use
    these while it is joined to the body, the answer is that if the body keeps
    the soul from using these species, this will be either because of the body’s
    nature, or because of corruption. But it is not because of the body’s
    nature, since that is not directly opposed to understanding. And nothing is
    naturally impeded except by its opposite. Likewise, it is not because of
    corruption, since, if it were, in the state of innocence, when there was
    none of this corruption, man would have been able to use these species, and
    so would not have needed his senses in order that through them the soul
    might receive species from things. But this seems to be false. Therefore, it
    does not seem that the separated soul understands through innate species.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. If it be said that the soul understands through infused species, the
    answer is that such species were infused either by God or by an angel. But
    not by an angel, because, if they were, these species would have to be
    created in the soul by the angel. Similarly, they are not infused by God,
    because it is not probable that God would infuse His gifts into souls
    existing in hell. Hence, it would follow that the souls in hell would not
    understand. Therefore, it does not seem that the separated soul understands
    through infused species.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. Augustine gives the mode in which the soul knows when he says: “Since
    the soul cannot bring bodies themselves into itself, as though it brought
    them within the limits of incorporeal nature, it fashions likenesses of
    bodies and seizes upon these likenesses which are made in the soul by
    itself. For, in forming them, it gives them something of its own substance.
    However, it saves something with which freely to judge of the species of
    such images. This is mind, that is, the rational intelligence, which is kept
    to judge. For we perceive that we have in common with beasts those parts of
    the soul which are informed by bodily likenesses.”n these words he says that
    the judgment of the rational soul deals with the images with which the
    sensitive powers are informed. But these images do not remain after death,
    since they are received in a bodily organ. Therefore, neither does the
    judgment of the rational soul, which is its understanding, remain in the
    soul after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. According to Damascene, no substance is deprived of its proper activity.
    But the proper activity of the rational soul is to understand. Therefore,
    the soul understands after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. just as something is made passive by its union with a material body, so
    it is made active by its separation from the same body. For something hot
    acts and is acted upon because of the union of heat with matter. But, if
    there were heat without matter, it would act and not be acted upon.
    Therefore, the soul is made completely active by its separation from the
    body. But it is due to the passivity of the powers of the soul that they
    cannot know of themselves without exterior objects, as the Philosopher says”
    of the senses. Therefore, after the separation from the body, the soul will
    be able to understand of itself without reception from any objects.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Augustine says: “Just as the mind itself obtains knowledge of bodily
    things through the senses of the body, so it obtains knowledge of
    incorporeal things through itself.” But it will always be present to itself.
    Therefore, it will be able to have understanding at least of incorporeal
    things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. As is clear from the passage quoted above from Augustine, the soul knows
    bodily things in so far as it fashions likenesses of these things and draws
    them within itself. But it can do this more freely after its separation from
    the body, especially since Augustine there says that it does this by itself.
    Therefore, the soul can understand better when separated from the body.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. In <i>Spirit and Soul</i> it is said that the soul takes its powers along
    with it when it is separated from the body. But it is called cognoscitive
    because of its powers. Therefore, it will be able to know after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    As the Philosopher says, if none of the activities of the soul is proper to
    it, that is to say, in such a way that it would not be able to have it
    without the body, it is impossible for the soul to be separated from the
    body. For the activity of anything is its end, in a sense, since it is what
    is best in it. Hence, just as we firmly maintain according to the Catholic
    faith that the soul continues to exist after being separated from the body,
    so must we maintain that it can understand when it exists without the body.
    But it is hard to see the way in which it understands, because we have to
    say that it has a different mode of understanding than it has now, since it
    is quite clear that it can understand now only if it turns to phantasms, and
    these will not remain in any way after death.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, some say, that, just as the soul now receives species from
    sensible things through the mediation of the senses, so, then, it will be
    able to receive them without the intervention of any sense. But this seems
    to be impossible, because a thing cannot pass from one extreme to the other
    except through the intermediate things. But in the sensible thing the
    species has an extremely material existence, but, in the understanding, a
    very highly spiritual existence. Hence, it has to pass to this spirituality
    through certain intermediate levels, inasmuch as it has a more spiritual
    existence in sense than in the sensible thing, and a still more spiritual
    existence in imagination than in sense, and so on as it goes higher.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Hence, others, therefore, say that the soul understands after death through
    the species which were received from the senses while it was in the body,
    and which are retained within the soul itself. But this opinion is attacked
    by some who follow Avicenna’s opinion. For, since the intellective soul does
    not use a bodily organ in order to understand, there cannot be anything in
    the intellective part of the soul except in so far as it is intelligible. In
    powers which use a physical organ, however, something can be retained, not
    in so far as it is knowable, but as in some kind of physical subject. It is
    because of this that there are certain sensitive powers which do not always
    actually apprehend the species or intentions which are retained in them.
    This is clearly the case with imagination and memory. Thus, it seems that
    only what is actually perceived is retained in the intellective part of the
    soul. Accordingly, after death the soul can in no way understand through the
    species which it previously received from things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But this does not seem to be true, because everything which is received in a
    thing is received in it according to the mode of the recipient. However,
    since an immaterial substance has a more stable existence than a physical
    substance, the species will be received with greater firmness and immobility
    in the intellective part than in any material thing. And, although they are
    received in it in so far as they have the character of an intelligible, it
    is not necessary for the soul actually to understand them at all times,
    because they are not always in the soul in perfect act. Nor are they there
    in pure potency, but in incomplete act, which is intermediate between
    potency and act, which is to say that something exists habitually in the
    understanding. For this reason, also, the Philosopher” wants to make the
    intellective soul “the place of the species,” inasmuch as it retains and
    preserves them in itself. However, such species, previously received and
    preserved, do not suffice for the knowledge which we must ascribe to the
    separated soul because of the souls of children and because of the fact that
    there are many things now not known to us, such as the punishments of hell
    and so forth, which will be known by the separated souls.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, others say that, although the separated soul does not receive
    anything from things, still, in their presence it has the power to conform
    itself to the things it is to know. We see that the imagination of itself
    makes up forms in this way which it has never received through the senses.
    But this cannot stand either, for it is impossible to have something which
    reduces itself from potency into act. And our soul is in potency to the
    likenesses of the things by which it knows. Consequently, they have to be
    made actual, not through the soul, but through something which has these
    likenesses actually, either through the things themselves or through God, in
    whom all forms are in actuality. Thus, neither imagination nor understanding
    constructs a new form except from those already in existence, as it fashions
    the form of a golden mountain from the pre-existing likenesses of gold and
    mountain.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, others say that the forms by which the separated soul knows are
    imprinted on it by God from its very creation, and according to some, we now
    understand through these forms in such a way that no new species are
    acquired for the soul through the senses, but the soul is only aroused to
    look at the species which it has within itself. And the Platonists, who
    wanted learning to be nothing but remembering, have spoken in this way. But
    experience contradicts this opinion, for we see that one who lacks one sense
    lacks one type of knowledge, so that one who does not have sight cannot have
    knowledge of colors. But this would not be so if the soul did not need to
    receive from the senses the species by which it knows.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, according to others, while the soul is joined to the body and is
    hindered by the body, it understands nothing through these concreated
    species. But it does understand through them once it is separated from the
    body. But, again, it seems difficult to admit that species which are
    naturally implanted in the soul should be hindered completely by the body,
    even though the union of body and soul is natural to the soul and not
    adventitious. For we do not find that one of two elements which are natural
    to a given thing hinders the other in every respect. Otherwise, the second
    element would be to no purpose. This position also disagrees with that of
    the Philosopher, who compares the understanding of the human soul to “a
    tablet on which nothing is written.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, we must give a different answer, namely, that each thing is
    influenced by that which is above it according to the mode of its own being.
    But the rational soul receives its being in a mode midway between separated
    forms and material forms. For immaterial forms, that is to say, angels,
    receive from God a being which does not depend on matter and is not in any
    matter. But material forms receive from God a being which is in matter and
    depends on matter, since they cannot be conserved without matter. The soul,
    however, receives from God a being which is in matter, for it exists in
    matter in so far as it is the form of the body, and through this it is
    united to the body in its being, but it is not dependent on matter, since
    the being of the soul can be maintained without the body. Therefore, the
    rational soul receives God’s influence in a manner midway between that of
    angels and that of material things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For it receives intellectual light in such way that its intellective
    knowledge has an ordination to the body, in so far as it receives something
    from the powers of the body and has to refer to them in the act of
    consideration. In this it is lower than the angels. Nevertheless, this light
    is not so confined to the body that its activity is performed by means of a
    bodily organ. In this it is above every material form, which performs only
    the activity in which matter has a share. But, when the soul will be
    separated from the body, just as it will have its being neither dependent on
    the body nor existing in the body, so, too, it will receive an influx of
    intellectual knowledge in such a way that it will neither be confined to the
    body, as though it had to be exercised through the body, nor will it have
    any ordination to the body at all.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, when at its creation the soul is infused in the body, the only
    intellectual knowledge that is given it is ordained to the powers of the
    body. Thus, through the agent intellect it can make potentially intelligible
    phantasms actually intelligible, and through the possible intellect it can
    receive the intelligible species thus abstracted. Hence it is, too, that, as
    long as it has being united to the body in the state of this life, it does
    not know even those things whose species are preserved in it except by
    insight into phantasms. And for this reason, also, God does not make any
    revelations to it except under the species of phantasms, nor is it able to
    understand separated substances, inasmuch as these cannot be sufficiently
    known through the species of sensible things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But, when it will have its being free of the body, then it will receive the
    influx of intellectual knowledge in the way in which angels receive it,
    without any ordination to the body. Thus, it will receive species of things
    from God himself, in order not to have to turn to any phantasms actually to
    know through these species or through those which it acquired previously.
    Nevertheless, it will be able to see separated substances, as the angels and
    demons, with natural knowledge, although it will not be able to see God in
    this way, for, without grace this is not given to any creature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    From all this we can conclude that the soul understands in three ways after
    death. In one, it understands through species which it received from things
    while it was in the body. In the second, through species which God infuses
    in it at the time of its separation from the body. In the third, by seeing
    separated substances and looking at the species of things which are in them.
    But this lasf mode does not lie within their free choice but within that of
    the separated substance, which opens its intelligence when it speaks and
    closes it when it is silent. We have said before what sort of speech this
    is.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The activity of understanding which is common to soul and body is that
    activity which now belongs to the intellective soul in its relation to the
    powers of the body, whether we take this with reference to the higher part
    of the soul or to the lower part. But, after death, the soul, separated from
    the body, will have an activity which will not take place through a bodily
    organ and will have no ordination to the body.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The solution to the second difficulty is clear from the first response.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. This authoritative citation is speaking of progress in merit, as it is
    clear from another gloss on the same passage which says: “Some assert that
    merit increases and decreases after death, so that it be understood that
    there is no further advance in knowledge, which is to say, that they have
    more merit or reward, or that they deserve clearer knowledge, but it does
    not mean that they will not then know anything which was previously unknown.
    For it is clear that they will then know the punishments of hell, which they
    do not know now.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The Philosopher is here speaking only of the understanding united to the
    body. Otherwise, the consideration of understanding would not belong to
    natural science.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Although the nature of the soul is specifically the same before and after
    death, its mode of being is not the same. Consequently, its mode of activity
    is not the same.

    6. The power of understanding and the agent and possible intellects will
    remain in the separated soul. For the existence of these powers is not
    caused in the soul by the body, although, while they exist in the soul
    united to the body, they do have an ordination to the body which they will
    not have in the separated soul.

    7. The Philosopher is speaking of the act of understanding which is now
    proper for us with our dependence on phantasms. For this is hindered when
    the bodily organ is inhibited and it is completely destroyed when the organ
    is destroyed.

    8. The same intellective powers which are now in the soul will be in the
    separated soul because they are natural. And things which are natural have
    to remain, although they now have an ordination to the body which they will
    not have then, as has been said.

    9. The intellective powers remain in the separated soul both in their
    radication in the essence of the soul and in their relation to act. Nor is
    it necessary that the habits which were acquired in the body be destroyed,
    except, perhaps, according to the opinion mentioned above, which says that
    no species remains in the understanding, unless actual intellection
    continues. But, even granting that those habits would not remain, the
    intellective power with an ordination to acts of a different type would
    remain.

    10. After death, the soul understands through certain species. It can,
    indeed, understand through the species which it has acquired in the body,
    although these are not entirely adequate, as the difficulty points out.

    13. The infusion of the gifts of grace does not reach those who are in hell,
    but these souls are not deprived of the things which belong to the state of
    nature. “For nothing is completely deprived of a share in the good,” as
    Dionysius says. But the infusion of species mentioned above, which is given
    when the soul is separated from the body, belongs to the natural state of
    separated substances. Therefore, the souls of the damned are not deprived of
    this infusion.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. Augustine is here trying to show how the soul clothes itself with
    likenesses of physical things, so that it sometimes thinks it is itself a
    body, as appears in the opinion of the ancient philosophers. He says that
    this happens because the soul with its attention focused on bodies is
    attracted to them through the external senses. For this reason, it strives
    to bring these bodies into itself in so far as possible. However, since the
    soul is incorporeal, it cannot bring the bodies themselves into itself, but
    it does bring likenesses of bodies into the domain of incorporeal nature, as
    it were, in so far as the forms existing in imagination are without matter;
    however, they do not yet reach the limits of incorporeal nature, because
    they are still not free of the conditions of matter.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The soul is said to seize upon these likenesses in so far as it immediately
    abstracts them from sensible things. And it is said to fashion them to the
    extent that it simplifies them, or in so far as it joins and divides them.
    It constructs them in itself in so far as it receives them in a power of the
    soul, the imagination. It constructs them by itself because the soul itself
    is that which fashions imaginations of this sort in itself, so that the word
    by denotes the efficient principle. Therefore, he adds that the soul gives
    these species something of its substance when it forms them, since a part of
    the soul, rooted in As substance, is given this role of forming images.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But, since everything which passes judgment on a thing has to be free from
    that thing, understanding has been made pure and unmixed in order to judge
    of all things, according to the Philosopher. Therefore, for the soul to
    judge of these images, which are not things themselves, but likenesses of
    things, there has to be something higher in the soul which is not occupied
    by these images. This is the mind, which can judge of such images. However,
    it is not necessary that the mind judge only of these images, but at times
    it also judges of things which are neither bodies nor the likeness of
    bodies.

        1. If it knows singulars, it knows them either through species created
        with the soul, or through species it has acquired. But it does not know
        them through species which it has acquired, because the species received
        in the intellective part of the soul are not singular but universal. And
        it is only this part of the soul which is separated from the body, “as
        the perpetual from the corruptible,” according to the Philosopher.
        Similarly, it does not know them through species created with the soul,
        for, since singulars are countless, there would have to be an infinite
        number of species created with the soul. But this is impossible.
        Therefore, the separated soul does not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that it knows singulars through a universal speciesOn the
        contrary, an indistinct species cannot be the source of distinct
        knowledge. But the universal species is indistinct, and knowledge of
        singulars is distinct. Therefore, separated souls cannot know singulars
        through universal species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was said that the separated soul conforms itself to the singular
        when the singular is present to it and thus knows the singular.—On the
        contrary, when the singular thing is present to the soul, either
        something passes over from the singular into the soul, or nothing passes
        over. If something passes over, the separated soul receives something
        from singulars, which seems unfitting, but, if nothing passes over, the
        species existing in the soul remain general, and, so, nothing singular
        can be known through them.

        4. Nothing which is in potency reduces itself from potency to act. But
        the cognoscitive soul is in potency to things which can be known.
        Therefore, it cannot reduce itself to act, and so conform itself to
        them. Consequently, it seems that the separated soul does not know
        singulars when they are present to it.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The separated soul, as has been said knows in two ways. In one it knows
        through species infused when it is separated from the body; in the
        other, through species which it received while in the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        According to the first mode, we have to ascribe to the separated soul a
        knowledge which is like angelic knowledge. Consequently, just as angels
        know singulars through the species given them at their creation, so,
        too, the soul will know them through the species given it at its
        separation from the body. For, since the ideas which exist in the divine
        mind are productive of things according to form and matter, they must be
        exemplars and likenesses of things according to both form and matter.
        Hence, through them God knows things not only in their generic and
        specific nature, which is derived from formal principles, but also in
        its singularity, whose principle is matter. But the forms which are
        created with angelic minds and which souls acquire when they are
        separated from the body are likenesses of those ideal forms which exist
        in the divine mind. Therefore, just as things derive from these ideas
        and so exist in form and matter, so also the species in created minds
        derive from them. And these species can know things according to form
        and to matter, that is, according to their universal nature and their
        singular nature. It is through this kind of species that the separated
        soul knows singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the species which it has received from the senses are like things
        only in so far as these latter can act, and they act according to their
        form. Therefore, singulars can be known through them only in so far as
        they are received in another power which uses a bodily organ, in which
        they exist materially in some way, and so are received as individual. In
        the understanding, however, which is entirely free from matter, they can
        be a principle only of universal knowledge, unless, perhaps, through
        some reflection on phantasms, from which the intelligible species are
        abstracted. After death, when phantasms have been destroyed, there
        cannot be this reflection. However, the soul can apply universal forms
        of this type to singulars which it knows through another type of
        knowledge.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The separated soul does not know singulars through the species which
        it acquired while in the body, nor through species created with the
        soul, but through species given it when it is separated from the body.
        Nevertheless, it is not necessary to have an infinite number of species
        infused into the soul to know singulars, because the singulars which it
        is to know are not actually infinite in number, and because a separated
        substance can know all the individuals of a species through one likeness
        of the species, in so far as that likeness of the species is made the
        proper likeness of each of the singulars according to its proper
        relation to this or that individual, as we said of the angels. This is
        also clear of the divine essence which is the proper likeness not only
        of the individuals of one species but of all beings according to the
        different relations which it has to different things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although the species by which the separated soul knows singulars are
        intrinsically immaterial and therefore universal, they are likenesses of
        things both in their general nature and in their singular nature.
        Therefore, nothing prevents the soul from knowing singulars through
        them.

        We concede the other difficulties.
