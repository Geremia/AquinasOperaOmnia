          beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said
          to them, "Children, have you any fish?" They answered him, "No." 6 He
          said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you
          will find some." So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul
          it in, for the quantity of fish.

    <p>
      2569 The Evangelist has just told of two appearances of Christ to his
      disciples. Now he mentions a third appearance. If we consider the order
      and purpose of these appearances, it is evident that the first showed
      Christ's divine authority by his breathing the Holy Spirit upon them; the
      second showed that he was the same person as before, since he let them
      view his wounds; and the third showed the reality of his risen human
      nature, for he ate with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two parts in this. The Evangelist first mentions Christ's
      dealing with a group of the disciples; secondly, with two of them he
      especially loved (v 15). As to the first, the Evangelist mentions the time
      and circumstance of his appearance, and then adds a short epilogue,
      <b>This was now the third time....</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2570 The time is <b>After this</b>, after what the Evangelist just
      narrated. It is significant that he says this for it shows that Christ was
      not with them continuously, but appeared to them at intervals. The reason
      for this was that he had not risen with the same life as before, but with
      a glorious life, as the angels have and the blessed will have: "Except the
      gods," that is, the angels, "whose dwelling is not with flesh" (Dan 2:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      2571 The Evangelist seemed to be ending his gospel before, when he wrote,
      <b>these are written that you may believe....</b> Why, then, does he add
      on this appearance? Augustine gives a mystical reason for this, which is
      that this appearance signifies the glory of the future life, when Christ
      will appear to us as he is.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> And so
      the Evangelist put this appearance after what seemed to be the end of his
      gospel so that this could be better understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      2572 The circumstance of his appearance was that
      <b
        >Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of
        Tiberias.</b
      >
      It is in the nature and power of a glorified body that it can be seen or
      not seen, as the person wishes, by nonâ€‘glorified bodies. That is why he
      says, <b>revealed</b>, i.e., Christ made himself visible. In the same way
      he is said to appear, which means the same thing as to reveal, "appearing
      to them during forty days" (Acts 1:3). As Ambrose says, that appears in
      whose power it is to be seen or not seen.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2573 The place is <b>by the Sea of Tiberias</b>, which is the Sea of
      Galilee. It is called the Sea of Tiberias after the city of Tiberias,
      which was built in honor of Tiberius Caesar. The Evangelist mentions this,
      first, to show that our Lord had kept the promise made to the disciples,
      "he is going before you to Galilee" (Mt 28:7). Secondly, he wanted to show
      that our Lord had banished the very great fear from the hearts of his
      disciples, so that they no longer remained shut up in their house, but
      even traveled as far as Galilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      2574 In describing this appearance, he first mentions the persons to whom
      Christ appeared; what they were doing; and thirdly, the circumstances of
      this appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2575 Christ appeared to seven persons. The Evangelist says that there were
      together <b>Simon Peter,</b> who had denied him,
      <b>Thomas called the Twin,</b> who was not present at the first
      appearance, <b>Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,</b> who is thought to be the
      brother of Philip, <b>the sons of Zebedee</b>, that is, James and John,
      and <b>two others of his disciples</b> not explicitly named. In the
      mystical sense, this number signifies the state and appearance of future
      glory, which will be after the seventh age, that is, in the eighth, which
      is the age of those who arise: "From new moon to new moon, and from
      sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me" (Is 66:23).
    </p>
    <p>
      2576 They were fishing, and so we first see Peter asking about this; the
      willingness of the others to go with him; and then their efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      2577 Peter asks them to go fishing, saying, <b>I am going fishing.</b> In
      the mystical interpretation, this signifies the work of preaching: "I will
      make you fishers of men" (Mt 4:19). So when Peter said,
      <b>I am going fishing,</b> the mystical sense is that he is taking the
      others to share in his concerns and preaching: "So it will be easier for
      you, and they will bear the burden with you" (Ex 18:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      2578 Their actual fishing seems to go against Luke (9:62): "No one who
      puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
      And it is clear that Peter had given up his work as fisherman. Why then
      did he return to it and look back? I answer, with Augustine, that if he
      had returned to this work of fishing before Christ's resurrection and
      before seeing Christ's wounds, we would think that he was acting out of
      despair. But now, even after Christ returned from the grave, after they
      had seen his wounds, and had received the Holy Spirit by Christ's
      breathing on them, they became what they were before, fishers of fish [not
      of men].
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>
      We can learn from this that a preacher can use his abilities to earn the
      necessaries of life and still preserve the integrity of his apostolate, if
      he has no other means of sustenance. For if St. Paul learned an art he did
      not previously have in order to obtain the food he needed, so as to avoid
      being a burden to others, Peter could all the more do this by using his
      own skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      2579 Augustine says that a preacher can do this when he cannot gain a
      living in any other way. But in this case Peter did have another way, for
      our Lord promised: "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and
      all these things shall be yours as well," that is, what is necessary for
      life (Mt 6:33). The answer is that it is true that these things will be
      added, with our cooperation. So our Lord did keep his promise here, with
      the cooperation of Peter. For who else but our Lord caused the fish that
      were caught to be within the range of their net?
    </p>
    <p>
      2580 Gregory remarks that there are two kinds of work.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> One
      absorbs the mind, and hinders our spiritual concerns, as tax collecting.
      No one should return to such work, even to provide food. So we do not read
      that Matthew returned to his tax collecting post. There is another kind of
      work which can be done without sin and without absorbing the mind, such as
      fishing and things like that. And it was not a sin for Peter to return to
      this kind of work after his conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      2581 The others agree to this, <b>We will go with you</b>. This sets an
      example for preachers and prelates to encourage each other in their work
      of turning people to God: "A brother helped is like a strong city" (Prv
      18:19); "He was like a young cedar on Lebanon; and they surrounded him
      like the trunks of palm trees" (Sir 50:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      2582 Next, we see that they were working at this,
      <b
        >They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught
        nothing.</b
      >
      Here he touches on three things that preachers ought to do. First, they
      should leave those places which are sunk in sin: "Come out from them," the
      Chaldaeans, "and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing
      unclean; and I will welcome you" (2 Cor 6:17). And they should go out from
      their carnal affections: "Go from your country and your kindred and your
      father's house" (Gen 12:1). And also leave the quiet of contemplation:
      "Let us go forth into the fields, and lodge in the villages; let us go out
      early to the vineyards" (Song 7:11). Secondly, preachers should get into
      the ship, that is, go forward in charity within the unity of the Church,
      which is called a ship: "In the days of Noah, during the building of the
      ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water" (1
      Pet 3:20). They should also board the ship of the cross by depriving the
      flesh: "But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord
      Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the
      world" (Gal 6:14); "Blessed is the wood by which righteousness comes" (Wis
      14:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, preachers should have total confidence in the help of Christ. All
      <b>that night they caught nothing,</b> because as long as God's help and
      the interior Preacher are not there, the words of the preacher have no
      effect. But when the light comes, enlightening hearts, the preacher makes
      a catch: "Send out your light and your truth" (Ps 42:3). Here, night
      indicates the lack of divine help: "Night comes, when no one can work"
      (9:4). Or, one could say, <b>that night,</b> during the time of the Old
      Testament, <b>they caught nothing,</b> because they could not bring the
      Gentiles to the faith: "The night has passed" [Rom 13:12]. According to
      Augustine, they were fishing at night because they were still afraid.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2583 Now we see the way and stages in which Jesus appeared: first, he
      allows himself to be seen; secondly he is recognized; and thirdly, he eats
      with the disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      2584 The Evangelist says that the <b>day was breaking</b>, it was morning.
      In the mystical interpretation, morning or the break of day indicates the
      glory of the resurrection: "Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes
      with the morning" (Ps 30:5); "In the morning I will stand before you, and
      will see you" [Ps 5:5].
    </p>
    <p>
      2585 Before his passion, on the occasion of a similar miracle, Jesus did
      not stand on the shore, but was in a boat. Why, after the passion, does he
      stand on the shore? The reason is that the sea signifies the troubles and
      tribulations of this present life, but all these end at the shore [of
      eternal life]. So, before his passion, Christ stood on the sea, because he
      had a body subject to death; but after the resurrection, he had surmounted
      the corruption of the flesh and stood upon the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      2586 <b>The disciples did not know that it was Jesus</b> because of their
      own ignorance. We can see from this that on this turbulent sea of the
      present, we cannot know the hidden things of Christ: "The eye has not
      seen, O God, besides you, what things you have prepared for those who wait
      for you" [Is 64:4].
    </p>
    <p>
      2587 Next, Jesus brings them to recognize him. First, the Evangelist shows
      how they came to recognize him; and who was the first to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      2588 The Evangelist does three things regarding the first. First, he shows
      our Lord asking for food, <b>Children, have you any fish?</b> The
      disciples did not think it was Christ asking, but someone who wanted to
      buy fish, for he spoke like a customer. In the mystical interpretation,
      Christ asks us for food to refresh himself. And we do this for him by
      obeying the commandments "My food is to do the will of him who sent me,
      and to accomplish his work" (4:34). <b>They answered him, No</b>, that is,
      not of themselves: "I can will what is right, but I cannot do it" (Rom 7:
      18).
    </p>
    <p>
      2589 Secondly, the Evangelist mentions Christ's order,
      <b>Cast the net on the right side of the boat.</b> In Luke (5:4) there is
      a similar incident, but there Christ did not tell them to cast their nets
      to the right side, as he does here. The reason for this is that the
      fishing mentioned by John signifies that fishing by which the predestined
      are taken to eternal life, and it is only those children on the right who
      are brought there: "The Lord knows the ways that are on the right; those
      on the left are perverse" [Prv 4:27]; "The right hand of the Lord does
      valiantly!" (Ps 118:16). The fishing mentioned in Luke signified the call
      into the Church, and so the net is cast to all sides because people are
      caught and brought to Christ from all over: "Go out quickly to the streets
      and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and maimed and blind and
      lame" (Lk 14:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      2590 The obedience of the disciples is shown when the Evangelist says,
      <b>So they cast it</b>, the net; and the effect of this obedience,
      <b>and now they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish,</b>
      that is, for the great number of those who would be saved: "By your
      descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because
      you have obeyed my voice" (Gen 22:18); "Behold, a great multitude which no
      man could number" (Rev 7:9). This fishing differs from that mentioned by
      Luke because there (Lk 5:6) the nets broke; and in a like way the Church
      is rent by disagreements and heresies. But in the fishing mentioned by
      John the net does not break because there will be no lack of unity in the
      future life. Again, in the incident mentioned by Luke, the fish were taken
      into the boat. But here in John's incident, the fish are brought to the
      shore, because the saints destined for glory are hidden from us: "In the
      covert of your presence you hide them from the plots of men" (Ps 31:20).
      [Augustine remarks that when on the sea of this life the elect are not
      known to us, they are hidden from us; they become known to us only when we
      arrive at the shore, at eternal life.]

    <p align="center"><b>LECTURE 2</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b
          >7 That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"
          When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes,
          for he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea. 8 But the other
          disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they
          were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards [two hundred
          cubits] off. 9 When they got out on land, they saw [hot coals] a
          charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said
          to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught." 11 So
          Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish,
          a hundred and fiftyâ€‘three of them; and although there were so many,
          the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them. "Come and [dine] have
          breakfast." Now none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?"
          They knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave
          it to them, and so with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that
          Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

            >[8]</a
          ></b
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      2591 The Evangelist, having shown how the taking of the great number of
      fish lead the disciples to recognize Christ, now mentions the order in
      those recognizing him. First, he mentions John; then Peter; and then
      actions of the other disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      2592 John, being quick in understanding, recognized Christ at once. So he
      said to Peter, whom he loved more than the others, and also because Peter
      was above the others in rank, <b>It is the Lord!</b> John was convinced of
      this by the catch of the fish: "Thou dost rule the raging of the sea" (Ps
      88:8); "Whatever the Lord pleases he does, in heaven and on earth in the
      seas and all deeps" (Ps 134:6). He said, <b>It is the Lord!</b> because
      they usually called him this: "You call me teacher and Lord" (13:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      2593 Peter is seen as passionately devoted to Christ. His devotion is
      clear, first of all, by his quickness to act:
      <b
        >When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes, for
        he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea. But the other
        disciples came in the boat.</b
      >
      As soon as he heard it was the Lord, Peter went without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we see his devotion for Christ, for out of modesty he did not
      want to appear naked, but put on his clothes, for he was stripped for
      work, because it was hot and it made working easier. We can learn from
      this that those coming to Christ ought to put off the old man and put on
      the new, which has been created for God in faith: "He who conquers shall
      be clad thus in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the
      book of life" (Rev 3:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, his devotion is shown by his lack of fear: for because of his
      great love he was unwilling to stay in the boat, which was moving too
      slowly, and so he <b>sprang into the sea</b>, to reach Christ more
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      2594 In the mystical interpretation, the sea signifies the troubles of
      this present world. Those who desire to come to Christ cast themselves
      into the sea, and do not refuse the tribulations of this world: "Through
      many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22); "My son,
      if you come forward to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for trials" (Sir
      2:1). Now Peter did cast himself into the sea and he reached Christ
      unharmed because the servant of Christ is kept safe and unharmed in the
      midst of tribulations: "You have given a path in the sea, and a safe way
      through the waves" [Wis 14:3]. As Chrysostom says, this incident very well
      brings out the difference between John and Peter: for John is seen to be
      greater in understanding, while Peter is more ardent in his affections.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2595 The other disciples remained on the boat. First, the Evangelist
      mentions what they did,
      <b>the other disciples came in the boat,</b> because they were not as
      ardent as Peter. The boat signifies the Church: "The hope of the world
      took refuge on a raft, and guided by your hand left to the world the seed
      of a new generation" (Wis 14:6). This text refers to the Church as we see
      from 1 Peter (3:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The other disciples came in the boat,</b> that is, protected by the
      society of the Church, which is as formidable as an army prepared for
      battle: "In the covert of your presence you hide them from the plots of
      men" (Ps 31:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      2596 Secondly, the Evangelist gives the reason why they did this,
      <b
        >for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits
        off.</b
      >
      This could be the reason why Peter sprang into the sea, because the land
      was near; and it could explain why the others arrived so quickly. Indeed,
      they were not far away, because the Church is not far from the land of the
      living, for the Church is "none other than the house of God, and... the
      gate of heaven" (Gen 28:17); and the saints think about this land every
      day: "We look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are
      unseen" (2 Cor 4:18); "Our commonwealth is in heaven" (Phil 3:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says, <b>two hundred cubits,</b> which signifies the same thing as the
      two boats mentioned by Luke (5:2), that is, the two peoples from which the
      elect are drawn to eternal life: "That he might create in himself one new
      man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to
      God in one body through the cross" (Eph 2:15). The net by which the fish
      are taken is the teaching of the faith, by which God draws us by inspiring
      us from within: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws
      him" (6:44). The apostles also draw us by their exhortations.
    </p>
    <p>
      2597 Next, the Evangelist tells how Christ affectionately prepared a meal
      for his disciples. He mentions its preparation; Christ's invitation; and
      the meal itself. In the preparation of the meal we see what was
      contributed by Christ, and what was brought by the disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      2598 Christ prepared three things. The Evangelist continues,
      <b
        >When they got out on land, they saw hot coals there, with fish lying on
        it, and bread,</b
      >
      which Christ by his power had created from nothing, or had formed from
      some nearby matter. In a previous miracle (6:11), Jesus fed the people
      with bread he had multiplied from previously existing bread. Now, after
      his passion, he creates or newly forms things, because it is no longer the
      time to show weakness but his power. For what he did before his passion in
      the multiplication of the bread was done in condescension, because if he
      wanted, he could have created it from nothing or newly formed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2599 We can understand from this that Christ prepares a spiritual meal or
      banquet. If we take this present meal symbolically for the Church's meal,
      Christ also prepares these three things. First the hot coals of charity:
      "You will heap coals of fire on his head" (Prv 25:22); "Fill your hands
      with burning coals" (Ez 10:2). Christ carried these burning coals from
      heaven to earth: "A new commandment I give you, that you love one another"
      (13:34); "I came to cast fire upon the earth" (Lk 12:49). Also, Christ
      prepares the fish laid over the coals, which is Christ himself: for the
      cooking fish outspread over the hot coals is the suffering Christ who is
      spread over the hot coals when because of the fire of his love for us he
      is immolated on the cross: "Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a
      fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (Eph 5:2); "Be imitators of God,
      as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself
      up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (Eph 5:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      He also prepares the bread which nourishes us, and this bread is himself.
      Christ is called a fish insofar as his divinity is hidden, for it is
      characteristic of fish to remain hidden in the water: "Truly, you are a
      God who hides yourself" (Is 45:15). While insofar as Christ nourishes us
      by his teaching, and even gives us his body for food, he is truly bread:
      "I am the living bread which came down from heaven" (6:51); "The bread
      will be rich and abundant" [Is 30:23]. The ministers of the Church should
      also bring something to this meal; but whatever it is, it has come from
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2600 The Evangelist now mentions what was brought by the disciples: first,
      we see the Lord's command; and then one of the disciples acts on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2601 Our Lord tells them to bring some of the fish they have caught. It
      was like saying: I have given you the gift of charity, I have roasted my
      body upon the cross and given you the bread of my teaching, which perfects
      and strengthens the Church. Now it is your task to catch others. These are
      the ones who will be converted by the preaching of the apostles: "Bring to
      the Lord, O children of God" [Ps 29:1]; "And they shall bring all your
      brethren from all the nations as an offering to the Lord" (Is 66:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      2602 If this meal is understood to be a moral meal, then Christ first
      prepares as food for the soul the burning coals of charity: "God's love
      has been poured into our hearts" (Rom 5:5); "I came to cast fire upon the
      earth" (Lk 12:49). Then he prepares the fish, that is, a hidden faith,
      since it is concerned with things that are not evident (Heb 10:1); and
      also the bread, that is, solid teaching: "Solid food is for the mature"
      (Heb 5:14). Our contribution to this meal is to make good use of the grace
      given to us: "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward
      me was not in vain" (1 Cor 15:10). Thus our Lord asks us to
      <b>bring the fish,</b> bring your good works, which have been granted to
      you to accomplish: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
      your good works" (Mt 5:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      2603 The Evangelist mentions that this was done by one of the disciples,
      Peter, who was more ardent than the others,
      <b>So Simon Peter went aboard</b>; he also went up to the helm of the
      Church: "I will climb the state of perfection" [Song 7:8]; "In his heart
      he is set to ascend" [Ps 64:6]. <b>And hauled the net ashore,</b> because
      the holy Church has been entrusted to him, and it was said to him in
      particular, "Feed my lambs" (21:15). Peter now foreshadows this by his
      action in drawing the fish to the solid land, because he will show the
      solidity of the eternal homeland to the faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      2604 He said, <b>full of large fish,</b> because "those whom he
      predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified"
      (Rom 8:30); "Men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their
      understanding, and proclaiming prophecies; leaders of the people in their
      deliberations" (Si 44:3). At the other catch of fish (Lk 5:4) the number
      of fish taken was not mentioned, but it is here; here there were
      <b>a hundred and fiftyâ€‘three.</b> The reason for this is that those called
      to the Church of the present time include both those who are good and bad:
      "The number of fools is infinite" [Eccl 1:15]. Thus in Genesis (22:17),
      when Abraham is told of his calling, we read, "I will multiply your
      descendants as the sand which is on the seashore," which refers to the
      bad. While referring to the good, God says, "Look toward heaven, and
      number the stars, if you are able to number them.... So shall your
      descendants be" (Gen 15:5); for God especially counts the good, "He tells
      the number of the stars" [Ps 147:4].
    </p>
    <p>
      2605 Does this mean that no more than a hundred and fiftyâ€‘three will be
      saved? No indeed! There will be more, but this number indicates a mystery.
      For no one can reach the homeland without observing the commandments of
      the decalogue; and the commandments can only be kept with the help of the
      sevenfold gift of the Holy Spirit: "The spirit of wisdom and of
      understanding, the spirit of counsel and of fortitude; the spirit of
      knowledge and of godliness, and you will be filled with the spirit of the
      fear of the Lord" [Is 11:2]. Further, the first recorded instance of
      sanctification occurred on the seventh day: "God blessed the seventh day
      and hallowed it" (Gen 2:3). Adding ten and seven gives seventeen. Now if
      we add the cardinal numbers successively â€‘ one plus two gives three, plus
      three gives six, plus four gives ten, plus five gives fifteen, plus six
      gives twentyâ€‘one, and so on in this way till we have reached the number
      seventeen â€‘ we arrive at the number one hundred and fiftyâ€‘three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, in another way: Christ now was appearing to seven disciples. If we
      multiply this seven by seven (the gifts of the Holy Spirit) we get
      fortyâ€‘nine. Now if we add one to indicate that perfection of unity which
      is characteristic of the children of God who act by the Spirit of God, we
      get fifty. If we triple this, and also add three, to indicate our faith in
      the Trinity (which we profess with our heart, our words and our actions),
      we get a hundred and fiftyâ€‘three. Thus, those who are perfected by the
      seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, and united by their faith in the Trinity,
      come to the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      2606 The Evangelist continues,
      <b>and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</b> In the
      incident related by Luke (Lk 5:6) the net broke because in the present
      Church [in this world], which the net signifies, there are many rips of
      schisms, heresies and seditions. But the Church is not entirely torn apart
      because "I am with you always, to the close of the age" (Mt 28:20). But in
      the future, in our homeland, heaven, which is signified by the net which
      was not torn, that is, in that peace which will be in the saints, there
      will be no schisms: "He makes peace in your borders" (Ps 147:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      2607 When the Evangelist says,
      <b>Jesus said to them, Come and dine,</b> we see his invitation to the
      meal he had prepared. First, we see Christ's invitation; then the attitude
      of the disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      2608 Christ invites us to dine with him by inspiring us himself from
      within, saying, <b>Come and dine</b>: "Come to me, all who labor and are
      heavy laden, and I will refresh you" [Mt 11:28]; "Eat, O friends, and
      drink; drink deeply, O lovers!" (Song 5:1). He also invites us to dine by
      encouraging and teaching us from without through others: "A man once gave
      a great banquet... he sent his servant to say to those who had been
      invited, Come" (Lk 14:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      2609 The Evangelist gives their attitude when he says,
      <b>Now none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you?</b> According to
      Augustine, this indicates the disciples' certainty about Christ's
      resurrection; they were so certain that it was Christ that none of them
      presumed to doubt that it was he.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> And
      because a question indicates a doubt, no one presumed to ask,
      <b>Who are you?</b> "In that day you will ask nothing of me" (16:23). For
      Chrysostom, it indicates a reverence of the disciples for Christ which was
      greater than usual.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> They
      would have liked to have questioned him; but Christ appeared to them in
      such grandeur and glory that they did not dare to question him because of
      their amazement and respect. It was this that particularly stopped them
      from questioning him, for <b>they knew it was the Lord.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2610 Next, Jesus came and took bread and gave it to them, and we see the
      meal they had, with Jesus eating with them: "You open your hand, you
      satisfy the desire of every living thing" (Ps 145:16). For he is the one
      who gives nourishment at the appropriate times.
    </p>
    <p>
      2611 But did Christ really eat with them? We should say that he did,
      although it does not say this here. Luke (24:43) explicitly says that he
      ate with them, and in Acts [1:4] we read that "while eating with them, he
      charged them not to leave Jerusalem."
    </p>
    <p>
      2612 But did he truly eat? We should say to this that a thing is said to
      be true in two ways: true with the truth of signification, and true with
      the truth of its species. A thing is true in the first way when it
      corresponds to what is signified. For example, if I want to signify
      something by speech, and what I signify by it is true and agrees with the
      thing signified, my speech is true with the truth of signification,
      although not [necessarily] true with the truth of the species. When Christ
      said "I am the true vine" (15:1), that was true, although he is not a true
      vine in the sense that he has the species or nature of a vine, but he is a
      vine considering what vine signifies. On the other hand, something is said
      to be true with the truth of its species or kind, when it has what belongs
      to the truth of its species. These things are the principles of the
      species, not their subsequent effects. Thus the utterance, "Man is an
      animal" is true in the first way, with the truth of signification, because
      it signifies what is true. But is not true with the truth of species
      unless it is spoken by the mouth of a [human] animal using its normal
      organs of speech. Its truth does not depend on the effects of the
      speaking, for example, that it be heard by someone. So, applied to the act
      of eating: some cases are true only with the truth of signification, as
      the eating ascribed to an angel, because an angel does not have the organs
      for eating. But what is signified by their eating is true, that is, the
      desire they have for our salvation. But Christ's act of eating after the
      resurrection was true both with the truth of signification, because he did
      it to show that he had a human nature, which he did in truth have, and his
      eating was true according to its species, because he had the organs used
      for eating. However, the effects consequent on eating were not present,
      since the food was not transformed into his substance, since he had a
      glorified and incorruptible body. It was dissolved into preâ€‘existing
      matter by the divine power. However, this effect does not alter the truth
      of the species, as was said.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2613 The Evangelist summarizes the appearances by saying,
      <b
        >This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the
        disciples.</b
      >
      According to Augustine, if this <b>third time</b> refers to the number of
      times, it is not true.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> For
      as was said, on the first day Christ appeared five times, again on the
      eighth day when Thomas was present, again by the Sea as recorded here,
      again on the mountain in Galilee (Mt 28:16), again when they were at table
      (Mk 16:14), and again on the day of his ascension, when "as they were
      looking on, he was lifted up" (Acts 1:9). Further, he appeared to them
      many other times during the forty days, but these are not recorded (Acts
      1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the <b>third time</b> must refer to the days on which Christ
      appeared. The first day he appeared was the day of the resurrection; the
      second day was eight days after the resurrection,
      <b>eight days later</b> (20:26); and the third day was the appearance by
      the lake mentioned here. Or, one could say, this statement can be true
      even if it is refereed to the number of times: for the only times we read
      that he appeared to a <i>number</i> of the disciples gathered together was
      on the first day in the evening, when the doors were shut; secondly, eight
      days later, when the disciples were gathered together; and thirdly, here
      at the Sea. Thus, he explicitly says,
      <b
        >this was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the
        disciples.</b
      ><br />

          because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said
          to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus
          said to him, "Feed my sheep."

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      2614 The Evangelist just showed what the Lord did for the disciples in
      general; here he shows him dealing with his two especially loved
      disciples: first, what he did for Peter; and how he dealt with John (v
      20). He does two things with the first: first, he lays on Peter the
      pastoral office; secondly, he predicts that he will be martyred (v18).
    </p>
    <p>
      He imposes the pastoral office on Peter only after an examination. Thus,
      those who are to be raised to this office are first examined, "Do not be
      hasty in the laying on of hands" (1 Tim 5:22). Christ examined him three
      times, and so this part is divided into three parts. In the first part we
      see our Lord's question (v 15); Peter's answer; and the imposition of the
      office (v 15). Looking at the first, we can consider three things: the
      time of the examination; the tenor of the conversation; and on what Peter
      was examined.
    </p>
    <p>
      2615 The order of this event is given as <b>When they had finished</b> the
      meal. This signifies the spiritual meal by which the soul is refreshed
      with spiritual gifts, even when it is united to the body: "I will come in
      to him and eat with him" (Rev 3:20). Therefore it is appropriate that one
      who is raised to this office be already refreshed with this joyous meal.
      Otherwise, how could he refresh the hungry ones that come to him: "I will
      feast the soul of the priests with abundance" (Jer 31:14), with that
      abundance mentioned in Psalm 63 (v 5): "My soul is feasted as with marrow
      and fat."
    </p>
    <p>
      2616 The tenor of the conversation is seen when he says,
      <b>Jesus said to Simon Peter.</b> Three things are given here which are
      necessary for a prelate. First, obedience, when he says,
      <b>Simon,</b> which means obedient. A prelate needs to be obedient because
      one who does not know how to obey superiors does not know how to govern
      inferiors: "An obedient man will speak of victory" [Prv 21:28]. Secondly,
      a prelate needs knowledge, indicated by <b>Peter</b>, which means
      understanding. A prelate needs understanding for he is the appointed
      watchman, and one who is blind is a poor watchman: "His watchmen are
      blind" (Is 56:10); "Because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from
      being a priest to me" (Hos 4:6). Thirdly, a prelate needs grace, for he
      says <b>son of John.</b> Prelates need grace because if they do not have
      grace they do not have anything: "By the grace of God I am what I am" (1
      Cor 15:10); "And when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James
      and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and
      Barnabas the right hand of fellowship" (Gal 2:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      2617 The questions are about love; and Jesus asks,
      <b>Do you love me more than these?</b> This was a suitable question, for
      Peter had previously fallen, as we saw before, and it was not appropriate
      that he be preferred to the others until his sin was forgiven â€‘ which is
      only brought about by charity: "Love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet
      4:8); "Love covers all offenses" (Prv 10:12). So it was fitting that his
      charity be made known by this questioning, not indeed to him who looks
      into the depths of our hearts, but to others. So Christ said, but not as
      one who did not already know, <b>Do you love me more than these?</b> Now
      we read that "perfect love casts out fear" (1 Jn 4:18). Thus it was that
      when our Lord was about to die, Peter was afraid and denied him; but the
      risen Lord restored love and banished his fear. So Peter, who before had
      denied Christ because he was afraid to die, now, after our Lord has
      arisen, feared nothing. Why should he be afraid, since he now realized
      that death had died?
    </p>
    <p>
      2618 This questioning was also appropriate for the office, since many who
      assume a pastoral office use it as selfâ€‘lovers: "In the last days there
      will come times of stress. For men will be lovers of self" (1 Tim 3:1).
      One who does not love the Lord is not a fit prelate. A fit prelate is one
      who does not seek his own advantage, but that of Christ's; and he does
      this through love: "The love of Christ controls us" (2 Cor 5:14). Love
      also becomes this office because it benefits others: for it is due to the
      abundance of love that those who love Jesus will at times give up the
      quiet of their own contemplation to help their neighbor. Although the:
      Apostle said, "I am sure that neither death nor life... will be able to
      separate us from the love of God" (Rom 8:39), he added, "For I could wish
      that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
      brethren" (Rom 9:3). Thus a prelate should be questioned about his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      2619 He adds, <b>more than these,</b> for even as the Philosopher says in
      his <i>Politics</i>, it is the natural order of things that the one who
      cares for and governs others should be better.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Thus
      he says that just as the soul is to the body that it rules, and reason is
      to our lower powers, so man is related to the irrational animals. And
      there ought to be a similar relation between prelates and their subjects.
      Thus, according to Gregory, the life of a pastor should be such that he is
      related to his subjects as a shepherd to his sheep.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" id="_ftnref16"
        >[16]</a
      >
      So Christ says, <b>more than these,</b> because the more Peter loves the
      better he is: "Do you see him whom the Lord has chosen? There is none like
      him among all the people" (1 Sam 10:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      2620 But in selecting someone [to rule] is it always necessary to choose
      the one who is unconditionally better, even if the laws say that it is
      enough to choose one who is merely good? To answer this two distinctions
      must be made. Some things are sufficient according to human judgment which
      are still not sufficient according to the divine judgment. According to
      human judgment, if a person cannot be reproached for something, this is
      sufficient for his election to stand. For it is obvious that it would be
      difficult to have elections if they could be nullified because someone was
      found who was better than the one actually chosen. So, according to our
      human judgment, it is sufficient if an election is honest and a suitable
      person is chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, so far as concerns the divine judgment, and our own conscience, it is
      necessary to choose that person who is better. Now a person can be
      unconditionally better; and this is the way a holier person is said to be
      better, for holiness makes one good. Yet such a person might not be better
      for the Church. For this purpose, that person would be better who is
      better educated, more competent, more discerning, and chosen more
      unanimously. But if other things are equal, such as the benefit and
      welfare of the Church, one would sin if he were to choose a person who was
      less unconditionally good than another. There has to be a reason for such
      a choice. This is either the honor of God and the benefit of the Church,
      or some private motive. If the motive is the honor of God and the benefit
      to the Church, these goods will be regarded as linked to the one chosen,
      and will make him the better person, in these respects. If there is some
      private motive for the choice, such as some carnal love, the expectation
      of ecclesiastical advancement, or temporal advantage, the election is a
      fraud and there has been partiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      2621 Now we see Peter's answer,
      <b>Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.</b> This is a clear sign that he
      had retracted his previous denial. And it shows that if the predestined
      fall, they are always better after they are corrected. Before his denial,
      Peter thought that he was better than the other apostles, saying, "Though
      they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away" (Mt 26:33). And
      when Jesus said to him, "You will deny me three times," Peter went against
      this and even boasted that "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny
      you" (Mt 26:35). But now, Peter, having been conquered by his own
      weakness, does not presume to state his love unless it is attested to and
      confirmed by the Lord. He humbles himself before Christ, saying,
      <b>You know that I love you</b>: "My witness is in heaven, and he that
      vouches for me is on high" (Job 16:19). He also humbles himself in respect
      to the apostles, for he does not say that he loves Jesus more than they
      do, but simply, <b>I love you.</b> This teaches us not to rank ourselves
      before others, but others before ourselves: "In humility count others
      better than yourselves" (Phil 2:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      2622 We can also notice, as Augustine points out, that when our Lord asks,
      <b>Do you love</b> (<i>diligis</i>) <b>me</b>, Peter does not answer with
      the same word, but says <b>I love</b> <i>(amo)</i> <b>you</b>, as if they
      were the same.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a> And
      they are the same in reality, but there is some difference in meaning:
      Love <i>(amor) is</i> a movement of our appetitive power, and if this is
      regulated by our reason it is the will's act of love, which is called
      "direction" (<i>dilectio</i>) â€‘ because it presupposes an act of election,
      choice (<i>electio</i>). This is why the brute animals are not said to
      love (<i>diligere</i>). For if the appetitive movement is not regulated by
      reason, it is called <i>amor.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      2623 After this examination, Christ assigns Peter his office, saying,
      <b>Feed my lambs,</b> that is, my faithful, which I, the Lamb, call lambs:
      "Behold, the Lamb of God" (1:29). Thus, one should not be called a
      Christian who says he is not under the care of that shepherd, that is,
      Peter: "They shall all have one shepherd" (Ez 37:24); "They shall appoint
      for themselves one head" (Hos 1:11). It was appropriate that this office
      be assigned to Peter, the others being passed over, because, according to
      Chrysostom, he was the extraordinary apostle, the voice of the disciples,
      and the head of the group.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2624 Now we have the second examination. In order to avoid a lot of
      repetition, note that Christ says three times,
      <b>Feed my lambs,</b> because Peter ought to feed them three ways. First,
      they are to be fed by being taught: "And I will give you shepherds after
      my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding" (Jer
      3:15). Secondly, they are to be fed by example: "Set the believers an
      example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity" (1 Tim 4:12);
      "Upon the mountain heights of Israel," that is, in the excellence of great
      men, "shall be their pasture" (Ez 34:14). Thirdly, they are to be fed by
      being offered temporal help: "Woe, shepherds of Israel who have been
      feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?" (Ez 34:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      2625 The third time Christ says to him, <b>Feed my sheep.</b> This is
      because there are three types of people in the Church: beginners, those
      who have made some progress, and the perfect. The first two types are the
      lambs, since they are still imperfect. The others, since they are perfect,
      are called sheep: "The mountains," that is, the perfect, "skipped like
      rams," and "the hills," the others, "like lambs" (Ps 114:4). And so all
      prelates ought to guard their charges as Christ's sheep and not their own.
      But alas! As Augustine says in his <i>Easter Sermon</i>: "We witness the
      appearance of certain unfaithful servants who have abandoned Christ's
      flock and by their thefts have made gold their flock. You hear them say,
      'These are my sheep. What do you want with my sheep? I will not let you
      come to my sheep.' But if we say "my sheep," and others talk about their
      sheep, then Christ has lost his own sheep."
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2626 Note also that just as Peter was assigned his office three times, so
      he was examined three times. This was because he had denied Christ three
      times. As Augustine says: "A threefold profession was required so that
      Peter's tongue might show as much love as it had shown of fear, and that
      life gained would wrest more words than the threat of death."
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
      Another reason for this was because Peter was obligated to love Christ for
      three things. First, because his sin was forgiven, for the one who is
      forgiven more loves the more (cf. Lk 7:43). Secondly, because he was
      promised a great honor: "On this rock I will build my Church" (Mt 16:18).
      Thirdly, because of the office entrusted to him, as right here, when
      Christ entrusts the care of the Church to him, <b>Feed</b>. "You shall
      love the Lord your God with all your heart," so that you will direct your
      entire intention to God, "and with all your soul," so that your entire
      will might rest in God through love, "and with all your might," so that
      the performance of all your actions will serve God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2627 Peter became sad because asked three times. As was seen, he was
      rebuked by our Lord before the passion when he so quickly asserted that he
      loved him. Now, seeing that he is questioned so many times about his love,
      he is afraid he will be rebuked again and becomes sad. Thus he says,
      <b>Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.</b> He is saying
      in effect: I do love you; at least I think I do. But you know all things,
      and perhaps you know of something else that will happen. And so the final
      commitment of the Church is given to the humbled Peter. According to one
      of the Greek doctors, this is also the reason why catechumens are
      questioned three times during their baptism.

    <p>
      2628 Above, our Lord entrusted the office of shepherd to Peter. Now he
      foretells his martyrdom. This was pertinent because a good shepherd should
      lay down his life for his sheep (10:11). It was not granted to the young
      Peter to lay down his life for Christ; but rather to the old Peter to lay
      down his life for his sheep. This is what Christ foretold to him. Christ
      first tells of Peter's past life; then he predicts the end of his future
      life (v 18). Thirdly, the Evangelist explains our Lord's words (v 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      2629 Peter's past life showed certain shortcomings, for as a young man he
      was too presumptuous and selfâ€‘willed. But this is characteristic of the
      young, as the Philosopher says in his <i>Rhetoric.</i>
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a> Thus
      we read in Ecclesiastes (11:9) a kind of reproach: "Rejoice, O young man,
      in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth;
      walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes." Our Lord
      refers to this trait of Peter and says,
      <b
        >When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you would.</b
      >
      He says, <b>you girded yourself</b>, that is, you restrained yourself from
      certain unlawful and superfluous things,
      <b>but walked where you would,</b> not allowing yourself to be kept in
      check by anyone. That is why you always wanted to be in danger for my
      sake. But it was not granted to you that you suffer for me when young,
      <b>but when you are old</b> I will fulfill your desire because
      <b>you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you.</b> What a
      wondrous prediction! It gives both the time and the suffering. From the
      time these words were spoken until Peter's death, about thirtyâ€‘seven years
      went by. We can see from this that Peter was quite old.
    </p>
    <p>
      2630 According to Chrysostom, he says, <b>when you are old</b>, because
      human affairs are different than divine affairs: in human affairs the
      young are useful, and the old are not of much use; but in divine matters
      virtue is not taken away by old age, rather it sometimes becomes even
      stronger: "My old age is exalted in abundant mercy" [Ps 92:10]; "As the
      days of your youth, so shall your old age be" [Deut 33:25].
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="" id="_ftnref23"
        >[23]</a
      >
      But this is to be understood only of those who have practiced virtue in
      their youth, as Cicero says.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> For
      those who have passed their youth in idleness will become of little or no
      value when old. This also teaches us that we rarely find rulers and
      teachers who are useful to the Church dying young, as Origen remarks in
      his explanation of Matthew (25:19): "Now after a long time the master of
      those servants came."
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> He
      gives Paul as an example. In Acts (7:58) Paul is seen as "a young man,"
      but in Philemon (1:9) he is "an old man." The reason for this is that
      people of this caliber are so rare, that when they are found, the Lord
      preserves them to a ripe old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      2631 He mentions the way he will suffer when he says,
      <b>you will stretch out your hands,</b> for Peter was crucified. Yet he
      was crucified using ropes, not nails, so he would not die so quickly. This
      is the girding spoken of by Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three things can be considered in the sufferings of the saints. First,
      there is a natural affection: there is such a natural love between the
      soul and the body that the soul never desires to be separated from the
      body, nor the body from the soul: "For while we are still in this tent, we
      sigh with anxiety; not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be
      further clothed" (2 Cor 5:4); "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death"
      (Mt 26:38). This is why Christ says,
      <b>where you do not wish to go,</b> that is, by the impulse of nature,
      which is so rooted in nature that even old age could not destroy it in
      Peter. Yet, the desire due to grace weakens this: "My desire is to depart
      and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23); "We are of good courage, and we would
      rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord" (2 Cor 5:8).
      Secondly, the intentions of the persecutors and the saints are different,
      <b>and carry you where you do not wish to go.</b> Thirdly, we see that we
      should be prepared to suffer, but not to kill ourselves. Thus Christ says,
      <b>you will stretch out your hands.</b> This clearly was the case with
      Peter: for when the people wanted to rebel against Nero and deliver Peter,
      he forbade it: "Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example" (1
      Pet 2:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      2632 The words <b>another will gird you</b> rightly come before
      <b>and carry you</b>, the thought being that
      <b>another will gird you</b> because he will
      <b>carry you where you do not wish to go</b>. Lest one think this
      statement was lightly written, it was written after the death of Peter.
      Peter was killed during Nero's lifetime; and John wrote this Gospel after
      he returned from the exile to which he had been banished during the reign
      of Domitian, there being several other emperors between Nero and Domitian.
    </p>
    <p>
      2633 John mentions this as something in the future, saying,
      <b>This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God,</b> for the
      death of the saints gives glory to Christ: "Christ will be honored in my
      body, whether by life or by death" (Phil 1:20); "But let none of you
      suffer as a murderer, or a thief... yet if one suffers as a Christian, let
      him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God" (1 Pet 4:15).
      Indeed, the greatness of the Lord is shown by the fact that the saints
      brave death for his truth and faith.<br />

          that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!" 23 The
          saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      2634 After the Evangelist showed what our Lord had in mind for Peter, he
      now tells about John. First, we see the commendation of the disciple,
      John; secondly, his gospel is commended (v 25). In regard to the first, we
      see the occasion for John's commendation; and then the commendation
      itself, <b>the disciple whom Jesus loved.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2635 The occasion for John's commendation was Christ's invitation to Peter
      to follow him. <b>And after he said this to him,</b> that is, after Christ
      told Peter about his office and martyrdom, he <b>said to him,</b> Jesus
      said to Peter, <b>Follow me.</b> For Augustine, this means follow me in
      martyrdom, by suffering for me; for it is not enough just to suffer in
      some way, but this must be done by following Christ, that is, by suffering
      for his sake: "Blessed are you when men hate you... on account of the Son
      of man" (Lk 6:22); "Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example,
      that you should follow in his steps" (1 Pet 2:21).
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2636 Many others who were present would also suffer for Christ, especially
      James, who was the first to be killed: "He killed James the brother of
      John with the sword" (Acts 12:2). Why then does Christ say to Peter in
      particular, <b>Follow me</b> ? The reason, according to Augustine, was
      that Peter not only suffered death for Christ, but also followed Christ
      even in the kind of death, that is, death by the cross: "If any man would
      come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me"
      (Mt 16:24).
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a> Or,
      according to Chrysostom, in saying <b>Follow me,</b> Christ means in your
      office as prelate, leader.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a> He
      was saying in effect: As I have the care of the Church, received from my
      Father â€‘ "Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage" (Ps 2:8) â€‘
      so will you be, in my place, over the whole Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      2637 But after Christ's ascension, why did James hold first place in
      Jerusalem? We can say that James had a special jurisdiction over that
      place, but Peter had the universal authority over the whole Church of
      believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2638 Now we see that John is commended: first, as to his past; then with
      respect to his future (v 21). John is commended on three points in his
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      2639 First, John had the privilege of having Christ's special love. The
      Evangelist says, <b>Peter turned,</b> for he had begun to follow Jesus
      even bodily,
      <b>and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved.</b> Here we see
      that Peter, already made a shepherd, was intent on the care of others:
      "And when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren" (Lk 22:32). Now
      Jesus loved John without excluding the others, for above he said, "As the
      Father has loved me, so have I loved you" (15:9). But he loved John above
      the others with a special love. There were three reasons for this. First,
      because of his penetrating understanding: for teachers especially love
      their intelligent students: "A servant who deals wisely has the king's
      favor" (Prv 14:35). Secondly, because of his purity, for he was a virgin:
      "He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the
      king as his friend" (Prv 22:11). Thirdly, because of his youth, for we
      have tender feelings for the young and the weak, and act with friendship
      towards them. And this is the way Christ acted with the youthful John:
      "When Israel was a child, I loved him" (Hos 11:1). We can see from this
      that God especially loves those who serve him from their youth: "My soul
      desires the first ripe figs" [Mic 7:1].
    </p>
    <p>
      2640 But this seems to go against Proverbs (8:17): "I love those who love
      me." Peter loved Christ more than the others: "Do you love me more than
      these?" (21:15). Therefore, Christ should have loved Peter more than John.
      I answer: it could be said that John, because he was more loved, was
      happier; while
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, because he loved more, was better. But this would be a violation of
      justice. Consequently, this refers to a mystery: that is, Peter and John
      stand for two kinds of life, the active and the contemplative, and the end
      and object of each is Christ. The active life, which Peter signifies,
      loves God more than the contemplative life (which is signified by John)
      because it feels more keenly the difficulties of this present life, and
      more intensely desires to be freed from them and to go to God. But God
      loves the contemplative life more, because he preserves it longer: it does
      not come to an end with death, as does the active life: "The Lord loves
      the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob" (Ps 87:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      2641 Some try to solve this problem using the literal sense. They
      distinguish two kinds of love in Christ, according to his two wills, his
      human and divine will. They say that Christ loved Peter more with his
      divine love, but he loved John more with his human love. The objection to
      this is that Christ's human will was entirely conformed to his divine
      will; and so the more he loved one with his divine will, so also he loved
      that one more with his human will. Therefore, we should say that he loves
      that one the more to whom he wills more good. He loved Peter more in the
      sense that he made Peter love him [Christ] more; Christ loved John more in
      another sense, that is, by giving him a keener understanding. "The Lord
      will fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding" [Sir 15:3].
      Accordingly, Peter is better because charity is better than knowledge (cf.
      1 Cor 13:8); but John is better in keenness of understanding. However,
      only God can weigh their merits: "The Lord weighs the spirit" (Prv 16:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      And so others say, and this is better, that Peter loved Christ more in his
      members; and in this way he was also more loved by Christ. For this reason
      the Church was entrusted to him. But John loved Christ more in Himself,
      and in this way was more loved by Christ, who entrusted his mother to
      John's care. Or, one could say that Peter loved Christ more readily and
      fervently. While John was more loved by being given tokens of intimate
      friendship, which Christ gave him on account of his youth and purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      2642 John adds,
      <b>who had lain close to his breast at the supper,</b> which commends him
      to us on the second point, his special intimacy with Christ. This was just
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      2643 Thirdly, John is commended on account of the special confidence he
      had in Christ, so that he could question Christ with more assurance than
      all the others. Thus he adds that this disciple
      <b>had said, Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?</b> This was
      also explained before (13:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      John is recalling his own privileges in order to exalt Peter. One might
      suppose that because Peter had denied Christ he would not be allowed back
      to his former intimacy. To reject this, John shows that he was admitted to
      a greater intimacy. The one who did not dare to question Christ at the
      supper, but asked John to do it, was made head over his brethren after the
      passion, and is now questioning Christ not only for himself, but also for
      John. We can understand from this that those who fall into sin sometimes
      rise in greater grace: "For just as you purposed to go astray from God,
      return with tenfold zeal to seek him" (Bar 4:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      2644 And so the Evangelist immediately shows Peter asking a question,
      <b>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?</b>
      This concerns the future of John. First, we have Peter's question;
      Christ's answer; and then the interpretation of the answer (v 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      2645 Regarding the first point, note that when our Lord said to Peter,
      "Follow me" (v 19), Peter did begin to follow him with bodily steps, and
      so did John. When Peter noticed John following he asked Christ about him,
      saying, <b>Lord, what about this man?</b> This was like saying: I am
      following you in your suffering. But this man, will he die also? John
      would have asked the same question had he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But according to Chrysostom, Peter was questioning about the leadership
      [of the Church], not about John's martyrdom.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> For
      Peter loved John more than all the other disciples, and they are always
      found together in the Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles. So Peter
      wanted to have John as his companion in the work of preaching. Peter says,
      <b>Lord, what about this man?</b> as if to say, "Let him come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      2646 Christ's answer is given,
      <b>So it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?</b>
      Notice that the Greek text does not have "So" but
      <b>If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?</b>
      Yet the difference is not too important, for whatever the expression, the
      meaning understood by the apostles from the beginning was that John was
      not going to die. So <b>it is my will that he remain until I come,</b> was
      [for them] the same as saying, John will not die until I come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this interpretation is rejected by what follows:
      <b
        >yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, So it is my
        will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2647 Those who defend the first interpretation, claim that John added this
      not to exclude the first interpretation but to show that our Lord did not
      convey that meaning by these words, but only by the words,
      <b>So it is my will that he remain.</b> This is the reason they say that
      John has not yet died.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various opinions about John's burial. All say that it is true
      that he was buried in a tomb which still exists. But some say he entered
      his tomb while still alive, and then left it by divine power, transported
      to the region of Enoch and Elias, and he is being kept there until the end
      of the world. According to this, the meaning is:
      <b>So it is my will that he remain</b> alive until the end of the world;
      and then, under the Antichrist, he will be martyred along with those other
      two. For it is not right that he should not die, for whatever is born
      dies: "It is appointed for men to die once" (Heb 9:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Others say he entered his tomb at Ephesus alive, and he remains there
      still alive, but sleeping, until the Lord comes. They base their theory on
      the fact that the soil there moves up and down in rhythm with John's
      breathing. Augustine rejects this by saying that it is not as good to be
      alive and sleeping as to be alive and blessed.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> Why
      then would Christ reward the disciple he loved above the others with a
      long sleep and deprive him of that great good for the sake of which the
      apostle wanted to be dissolved and to be with Christ (Phil 1:23). Thus, we
      should not believe this. Rather, we should say that he died and arose with
      his body indicated by the fact that his body cannot be found â€‘ and remains
      happy with Christ, as Christ invited him: "He who testifies to these
      things says, Surely I am coming soon" (Rev 22:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      2648 Augustine explains this passage mystically.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Then
      the word remain means "continue on," or "persist," as in "Remain in the
      city, until you are clothed with power from on high" [Lk 24:49].
      Consequently, our Lord is saying about John, that is, about the
      contemplative life, <b>So it is my will that he remain,</b> that is,
      continue on, <b>until I come,</b> either at the end of the world, or at
      the death of any contemplative; for the contemplative life although begun
      here is not completed here. It remains incomplete and continues on till
      Christ comes to complete it: "Then they were... told to rest a little
      longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren
      should be complete" (Rev 6:11); "Mary has chosen the good portion, which
      shall not be taken away from her" (Lk 10:42); "Long life is in her right
      hand; in her left hand are riches and honor" (Prv 3:16). Meanwhile, the
      active life, completed and vivified by the example of Christ's passion,
      follows him by suffering for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      2649 Chrysostom understands it this way:
      <b>So it is my will that he remain,</b> that is, to remain in Judea, and
      to preach on this earth; and I want you [Peter] to follow me by having a
      concern for the entire world, and by suffering for me; and John is to
      remain <b>until I come,</b> to destroy the Jewish nation.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a>
      <b>What is that to you?</b> means "These things are for me to decide." For
      we do see from history that John did not leave Judea until Vespasian came
      to Judea and took Jerusalem; then John set out for Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      2650 Then there is the interpretation of Jerome: <b>Follow me!</b> Peter,
      by your martyrdom; and so, now speaking about John,
      <b>it is my will that he remain,</b> without the sufferings of martyrdom
      and death, <b>until I come,</b> to call him to myself â€‘ "I will come again
      and take you to myself" (14:3) â€‘ <b>what is that</b>, this privilege,
      <b>to you?</b> And so in the stories about blessed John it is said that
      when he was ninety years old our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him and
      invited him to his banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      2651 Then the Evangelist shows how the disciples understood these words of
      our Lord. They thought that John would not die.
      <b>The saying spread abroad among the brethren,</b> the disciples â€‘
      "Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!" (Ps
      133:1) â€‘ <b>that this disciple,</b> John, <b>was not to die.</b> But he
      corrects this error, saying,
      <b>Yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die</b>: "Are you also
      still without understanding?" (Mt 15:16). The rest has been explained.<br />

    <p>
      2652 Now we have the last part of this Gospel, which is a kind of
      epilogue. First, the Gospel is commended; and then the vastness of the
      subject treated (v 25). The Gospel is commended because of two things: its
      author, and its truth. Three things are mentioned about the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      2653 First, there is the authority of the author, because
      <b>This is the disciple</b> â€‘ understanding what was mentioned before who
      was loved above the others, intimate with Christ, able to question him
      with confidence, and to whom it was granted to remain until Christ came.
      All these things refer to the authority of the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      John is said to have been loved more than the others because of his unique
      charity: "By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have
      love for one another" (13:35). None of the other apostles speak so much of
      love for others as does John in his letters. We also read that as an old
      man he was carried to the church by his followers to teach the faithful.
      He taught only one thing: "Little children, love one another." This is the
      perfection of the Christian life.
    </p>
    <p>
      2654 Secondly, John's office is mentioned, which was to give testimony,
      for he says, <b>who is bearing witness to these things</b>. This is the
      special office of apostles: "You shall be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8); "You
      are my witnesses!" (Is 44:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      2655 Thirdly, he refers to his zeal when he says,
      <b>and who has written these things</b>. As an apostle he testified to the
      actions of Christ to those who were present; and in his zeal he recorded
      these actions in writing for those who were not with him and were to come
      after him: "Take a large tablet and write upon it in common characters"
      (Is 8:1); "The wisdom of the scribe depends on the opportunity of leisure;
      and he who has little business may become wise" (Sir 38:24). For it was
      granted to John to live until the time when the Church was at peace; and
      this is the time when he wrote all these things. John mentions such things
      so that we will not think that his gospel has less authority than the
      other three, seeing that he wrote after the death of all the other
      apostles, and the other gospels, especially that of Matthew, had been
      approved by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2656 Now John states that his Gospel is true, and he speaks in the person
      of the entire Church which received it: "My mouth will utter truth" (Prv
      8:7). We should note that although many have written about Catholic truth,
      there is a difference among them: those who wrote the canonical
      scriptures, such as the evangelists and apostles and the like, so
      constantly and firmly affirm this truth that it cannot be doubted. Thus
      John says, <b>we know that his testimony is true</b>: "If any one is
      preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be
      accursed" (Gal 1:9). The reason for this is that only the canonical
      scriptures are the standard of faith. The others have set forth this truth
      but in such a way that they do not want to be believed except in those
      things in which they say what is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      2657 Now John states the incompleteness of his Gospel as compared with the
      reality, because Christ not only did these things
      <b>but there are also many other things which Jesus did.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2658 His statement,
      <b
        >were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself
        could not contain the books that would be written,</b
      >
      can be understood in two ways. First, the word <b>contain</b> can refer to
      the capacity of our minds to understand. So the meaning is: So much could
      be said about Christ that the world could not understand all that could be
      written: "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them
      now," that is, understand them (16:12). We could also regard this
      statement as a deliberate exaggeration; and it then indicates the
      abundance of Christ's works.
    </p>
    <p>
      2659 How reconcile this? He had just said,
      <b>we know that his testimony is true</b>, and then immediately resorts to
      hyperbole, exceeding the truth. According to Augustine, Scripture does use
      figures of speech, such as "I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty
      throne" [Is 6:1], and such statements are not false.
      <a href="John21.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a> This
      is so when hyperbole is used. The desire of the speaker is not that we
      accept the literal meaning of the words, but what they were intended to
      mean, that is, the great number of Christ's works. Hyperbole is not used
      to explain what is obscure or doubtful, but to exaggerate or minimize what
      is obvious. For example, to emphasize how plentiful something is, one can
      say that there is enough for a hundred or a thousand people. And to
      minimize something, one could say that there is hardly enough for three.
      This is not speaking falsely, because it is so obvious that the words
      contort the reality that they show that one does not intend to lie, but to
      indicate that something is great or small.
    </p>
    <p>
      2660 Or, this statement could be understood to refer to the power of
      Christ, who performed these signs; and the emphasis is on
      <b>every one of them.</b> For to write about each and every word and deed
      of Christ is to reveal the power of every word and deed. Now the words and
      deeds of Christ are also those of God. Thus, if one tried to write and
      tell of the nature of every one, he could not do so; indeed, the entire
      world could not do this. This is because even an infinite number of human
      words cannot equal one word of God. From the beginning of the Church
      Christ has been written about; but this is still not equal to the subject.
      Indeed, even if the world lasted a hundred thousand years, and books
      written about Christ, his words and deeds could not be completely
      revealed: "Of making many books there is no end" (Eccl 12:12); The works
      of God "are multiplied above number" [Ps 50:5].
