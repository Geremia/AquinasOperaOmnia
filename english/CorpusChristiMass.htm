      Deus qui nobis sub sacramento mirabili passionis tuae memoriam reliquisti, tribue, quaesumus, ita nos corporis et sanguinis tui sacra mysteria venerari, ut redemptionis tuae fructum in nobis iugiter sentiamus. Qui vivis et regnas cum Deo patre in unitate spiritus sancti Deus per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.

      God, in this wonderful sacrament you left us a memorial of your Passion. Enable us, we ask, so to venerate the sacred mysteries of your Body and Blood, that we may always fell the fruit of your redemption in us. You live and reign with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.

      Fratres, ego enim accepi a domino quod et tradidi vobis; quoniam dominus Iesus in qua nocte tradebatur, accepit panem, et gratias agens fregit et dixit: accipite et manducate: hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis tradetur; hoc facite in meam commemorationem. Similiter et calicem, postquam cenavit, dicens: hic calix novum testamentum est in meo sanguine; hoc facite, quotiescumque sumitis, in meam commemorationem. Quotiescumque enim manducabitis panem hunc et calicem bibetis, mortem domini annuntiabitis donec veniat. Itaque quicumque manducaverit panem vel biberit calicem domini indigne, reus erit corporis et sanguinis domini. Probet autem seipsum homo; et sic de pane illo edat, et de calice bibat. Qui enim manducat et bibit indigne, iudicium sibi manducat et bibit, non diiudicans corpus domini.
      <td><b>NAB</b><br>
      For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread, and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, "This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me." For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes. Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. A person should examine himself, and so eat the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.

                Swell in melody sublime:
                <p>For this day the Shepherd gave us<br>
                Flesh and blood to feed and save us,<br>
                Lasting to the end of time.

                <p>Thus in faith the Christian heareth:<br>
                That Christ's Flesh as bread appeareth,<br>
                And as wine His Precious Blood:

                Living Faith that doth decree it<br>
                All defects of sense makes good.
                <p>Lo! beneath the species dual<br>
                (Signs not things), is hid a jewel<br>
                Far beyond creation's reach!
                <p>Though His Flesh as food abideth,<br>
                And His Blood as drink-He hideth<br>
                Undivided under each.
                <p>Whoso eateth It can never<br>

                Christ entire our hearts doth fill:
                <p>Thousands eat the Bread of Heaven,<br>
                Yet as much to one is given:<br>
                Christ, though eaten, bideth still.
                <p>God and bad, they come to greet Him:<br>
                Unto life the former eat Him,<br>
                And the latter unto death;
                <p>These find death and those find heaven;<br>
                See, from the same life-seed given,<br>
                How the harvest differeth!
              <td valign="top">
                <p>When at last the Bread is broken,<br>
                Doubt not what the Lord hath spoken:<br>
                In each part the same love token,<br>
                The same Christ, our hearts adore:
                <p>For no power the Thing divideth-<br>
                'Tis the symbols He provideth,<br>
                While the Saviour still abideth<br>
                Undimished as before.
                <p>Hail, angelic Bread of Heaven,<br>
                Now the pilgrim's hoping-leaven,<br>
                Yea, the Bread to children given<br>
                That to dogs must not be thrown:
                <p>In the figures contemplated,<br>
                'Twas with Isaac immolated,<br>
                By the Lamb 'twas antedated,<br>
                In the Manna it was known.
                <p>O Good Shepherd, still confessing<br>
                Love, in spite of our transgressing,-<br>
                Here Your blessed Food possessing,<br>
                Make us share Your every blessing<br>
                In the land of life and love:
                <p>Thou, whose power hath all completed<br>
                And Your Flesh as Food hath meted,<br>
                Make us, at Your table seated,<br>
                By Your Saints, as friends be greeted,<br>
                In Your paradise above.

      In illo tempore dixit Iesus discipulis suis et turbis Iudaeorum: Caro mea vere est cibus, et sanguis meus vere est potus. Qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet et ego in illo. Sicut misit me vivens pater, et ego vivo propter patrem; et qui manducat me, et ipse vivet propter me. Hic est panis qui de caelo descendit. Non sicut manducaverunt patres vestri manna, et mortui sunt: qui manducat hunc panem, vivet in aeternum.

Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven.
