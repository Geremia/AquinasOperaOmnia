        God, in this wonderful sacrament you left us a memorial of your Passion.
        Enable us, we ask, so to venerate the sacred mysteries of your Body and
        Blood, that we may always fell the fruit of your redemption in us. You
        live and reign with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

        <b>Lectio epistolae beati Pauli apostoli ad Corinthios</b>
        (11:23-29)<br />
        Fratres, ego enim accepi a domino quod et tradidi vobis; quoniam dominus
        Iesus in qua nocte tradebatur, accepit panem, et gratias agens fregit et
        dixit: accipite et manducate: hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis
        tradetur; hoc facite in meam commemorationem. Similiter et calicem,
        postquam cenavit, dicens: hic calix novum testamentum est in meo
        sanguine; hoc facite, quotiescumque sumitis, in meam commemorationem.
        Quotiescumque enim manducabitis panem hunc et calicem bibetis, mortem
        domini annuntiabitis donec veniat. Itaque quicumque manducaverit panem
        vel biberit calicem domini indigne, reus erit corporis et sanguinis
        domini. Probet autem seipsum homo; et sic de pane illo edat, et de
        calice bibat. Qui enim manducat et bibit indigne, iudicium sibi manducat
        et bibit, non diiudicans corpus domini.

        For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord
        Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread, and, after he had
        given thanks, broke it and said, "This is my body that is for you. Do
        this in remembrance of me." In the same way also the cup, after supper,
        saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as
        you drink it, in remembrance of me." For as often as you eat this bread
        and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.
        Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
        unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. A
        person should examine himself, and so eat the bread and drink the cup.
        For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and
        drinks judgment on himself.

            prefigures.
