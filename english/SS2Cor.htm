      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        “Men shall speak of you as ministers of our God” (Is. 61:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. – The subject matter of this second epistle to the Corinthians is
        fittingly touched upon by these words. For in the first epistle the
        Apostle discussed the sacraments; in this one he discusses the
        ministers, both good and bad, of these sacraments. The reason he wrote
        this epistle was that he had preached to the Corinthians, but they had
        welcomed certain false apostles, whom they preferred to the Apostle.
        Therefore he writes them this epistle, in which he commends the apostles
        and the dignity of the true apostles, and discloses and reproves the
        falseness of the false apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. – He commends the dignity of the true apostles, because they are
        God’s ministers. Men shall speak of you, i.e., the apostles, as the
        ministers of God. They are called ministers under three aspects. First,
        inasmuch as they dispense the sacraments: “This is how one should regard
        us, as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1). For Christ instituted the
        sacraments, but the apostles and their successors dispense them;
        therefore the text just cited continues: and stewards of the mysteries
        of God. Secondly, inasmuch as they govern the people of God: “Because,
        as servants of his kingdom, you did not rule rightly, nor keep the law”
        (Wis. 6:4). For God governs all things by his wisdom, so that whoever
        governs any one is called God’s minister. Thirdly, because they labor
        for the salvation of men, namely, inasmuch as many are converted by
        their ministry and preaching. But God alone is the author of man’s
        salvation, because it was he who came to save that which had been lost;
        the apostles, however, are his ministers: “What then is Apollos? What is
        Paul? The ministers of him whom you have believed” (1 Cor. 3:5).

        1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our
        brother. To the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints
        who are in the whole of Achaia: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our
        Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. – In this epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle treats of these
        ministers and points out their dignity: first, he gives his greeting;
        secondly, he begins his message (v. 3). In the greeting he does three
        things: first, he mentions the persons who send the greeting; secondly,
        those who are greeted; thirdly, the good things he wishes them. In
        regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the principal
        person who sends the greeting, namely Paul; secondly, his companion,
        Timothy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. – The person who sends the greeting is described by his humility,
        because it is Paul, which in Latin means ‘humble’. He is that humble
        person of whom it is said in Is. (60:22): “The least one shall become a
        clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation.” Or by his doctrine, because
        Paul is called the mouth of the trumpet. This is the trumpet mentioned
        in Zechariah (9:14): “The Lord God will sound the trumpet, and march
        forth in the whirlwinds of the south.” He fits what is said in Isaiah
        (58:1): “Lift up your voice like a trumpet.” By the authority of his
        dignity, because he says, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Here he mentions
        three things: first, that he is a representative; hence, he is called an
        apostle, i.e., principally sent, for only twelve apostles were sent by
        Christ: “He chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles” (Lk. 6:13).
        But the other disciples were not sent principally, but secondarily. That
        is why the apostles are succeeded by bishops, who have a special care of
        the Lord’s flock; but other priests succeed the seventy-two disciples
        and perform duties committed to them by the bishops. His dignity,
        therefore, is that he is an apostle: “If to others I am not an apostle,
        at least I am to you” (1 Cor. 9:2); “He who worked through Peter for the
        ministry to the circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles”
        (Gal. 2:8). But why does he call himself an apostle, whereas in the
        epistle to the Romans he calls himself a servant. The reason for this is
        that he rebuked the Romans for quarreling and for pride, which is the
        mother of quarrels, because there are always disputes among the proud.
        Hence to cure them of quarreling he leads them to humility by calling
        himself a servant. But the Corinthians were obstinate and rebellious; so
        in order to curb their boldness, he uses a dignified name here, calling
        himself an apostle. Secondly, he mentions the one he represents, Jesus
        Christ: “We are ambassadors for Christ” (2 Cor. 5:20). Thirdly, he
        mentions how he obtained his ambassadorship, because he is not coming as
        a false apostle: “I did not send them and they ran” (Jer. 23:21), nor
        was he given to the people in God’s anger in the sense of Job (34:30):
        “Who makes a hypocrite to reign”; “I have given you kings, but in my
        anger” (Hos. 13:11). But he obtained apostleship by God’s will and
        pleasure: “He is a chosen instrument of mine” (Ac. 9:15). Therefore he
        says, by the will of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. – The other person is Timothy; hence he says, and Timothy our
        brother. A brother, I say, because of the faith: “You are all brothers”
        (Matt. 23:8), and because of his dignity, for he was a bishop. This is
        why the Pope calls all bishops brothers. He mentions Timothy because,
        since he [Timothy] had visited them, as he said in the first epistle
        (ch. 16), the people might believe that he had maliciously reported to
        the Apostle the things he is writing to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. – Then he mentions the persons greeted: first, the principal ones;
        secondly, those associated with the principal ones. He says, to the
        church of God, which includes all believers, both the clergy and the
        laity: “That you may know how one ought to behave” (1 Tim. 3:15); which
        is at Corinth, because Corinth was the chief city of Achaia. But those
        associated with the principal ones are all the saints who are reborn by
        the grace of the one Holy Spirit: “But you were washed, you were
        sanctified, in the Spirit of our God” (1 Cor. 6:11); who are in Achaia,
        whose chief city is Corinth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. – The Apostle wishes good things to the persons greeted; hence, he
        says, grace and peace to you. In regard to this he does two things:
        first, he mentions the good things; secondly, their author (v. 2b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. – He mentions these two gifts as two extremes, between which are
        contained all other goods. For the first good is grace, which is the
        beginning of all good things; because before grace there is only a
        diminished goodness in us. The last of all goods is peace, because peace
        is the general end of the mind; for no matter how peace is defined, it
        has the character of an end. In eternal glory, in government and in the
        way one lives, the end is peace: “He makes peace in your borders” (Ps.
        147:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. – He indicates the author of these goods when he says, from God our
        Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These two expressions can be
        distinguished in two ways, because, when he says, from God our Father,
        it can be referred to the entire Trinity. For although the person of the
        Father is called the Father of Christ by nature, the entire Trinity in
        our Father by creation and governance: “For thou art our Father” (Is.
        63:16); “You would call me My Father” (Jer. 3:19). Therefore good things
        come from God our Father, i.e., from the entire Trinity: “If you, then,
        who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
        more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask
        him” (Matt. 7:11). But if God our Father is taken for the entire
        Trinity, why is the person of the Son added, when he says, and the Lord
        Jesus Christ? Is there another person in the Trinity? I answer that he
        is added, not as though he were an additional person, but on account of
        another nature, namely, of the humanity assumed by the Son to the divine
        person. The reason he lists him along with the Trinity is that all good
        things come to us from the Trinity through the Incarnation of Christ,
        first of all grace: “Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (Jn.
        1:17), and secondly peace: “He is our peace” (Eph. 2:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. – Again, when he says, from God our Father, it can be taken to mean
        the person of the Father alone; and although the entire Trinity is our
        Father, as has been said, the person of the Father is our Father by
        appropriation. Then the Lord Jesus Christ can be referred to the person
        of the Son. No mention is made of the Holy Spirit because, as Augustine
        says, since he is the nexus of the Father and the Son, whenever the
        person of the Father and the person of the Son are mentioned, the person
        of the Holy Spirit is also understood.

        abundantly in comfort too.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. – Here begins the message, in which the Apostle does two things:
        first, he excuses himself for not visiting them as he had promised;
        secondly, he begins to follow out his intention (chap. 3). In regard to
        the first he does two things: first, he wins their good will; secondly,
        he presents his excuse (v. 15). In regard to the first he does two
        things: first, he wins their good will be citing some general facts;
        secondly, some special ones (v. 8). The Apostle wins their good will by
        showing that whatever he does, it is all for their benefit. In regard to
        this he does two things: first, he mentions the profit others have
        obtained from him; secondly, the reason (v. 5). In regard to the first
        he does three things: first, he gives thanks; secondly, the manner of
        the thanks (v. 4); thirdly, the cause (b. 4b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. – He gives thanks, therefore, to the entire Trinity, the source of
        every good; hence he says, Blessed be the God, i.e., the entire Trinity;
        and to the person of the Father when he says, and Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, through whom the Father has given us all things. It should
        be noted that we bless God and God blesses us, but in different ways.
        For when God speaks, he accomplishes: “He spoke and they were made” (Ps.
        148:5). Hence, for God to bless is to produce something good, and to
        infuse something good, and so to be a cause: “I will indeed bless you
        and multiply your descendants” (Gen. 22:17). But our speech does not
        cause things, but acknowledges or expresses them; hence, our blessing is
        the same as recognizing good. Therefore, when we thank God, we bless
        him, i.e., acknowledge that he is good and the giver of all good: “Bless
        God and acknowledge him in the presence of all the living for the good
        things he has done for you.” (Tob. 12:6); “Bless the Lord, all you works
        of the Lord; praise and exalt him above all for ever” (Dan. 3:57).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. – It is fitting that he thank the Father, because he is merciful;
        hence he says, the Father of mercies: and because he is a comforter he
        says, and God of all comfort. He thanks God for the two things men
        especially need: first, to have evil removed from them, and this is done
        by mercy which takes away misery, for it is characteristic of a father
        to have compassion: “As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
        those who fear him” (Ps. 103: 13). Secondly, they need to be supported
        in the face of evils which occur, and that is to receive comfort.
        Because unless a man had something in which his heart could rest, he
        would not stand firm when evils come upon him. Therefore a person
        comforts another by affording him something refreshing, in which he can
        rest in evil times. And although a man might be comforted by something
        and find rest and be supported by it in the case of some evils, it is
        God alone who comforts us in all evils; hence he says, the God of all
        comfort. For if you sin, God comforts you, because he is merciful; if
        you are afflicted, he comforts you either by rooting out the affliction
        by his power or by judging justly; if you labor, he comforts you with a
        reward: “I am your shield; your reward shall be very great (Gen. 15:1).
        Therefore, it says in Matthew (5:4): “Blessed are those who mourn, for
        they shall be comforted.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. – He tells us why he is thankful when he adds, who comforts us in
        all our affliction. As if to say: He is blessed, because he comforts us
        in all our affliction: “God who comforts the downcast” (2 Cor. 7:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. – He gives the reason for this when he says, so that we may be able
        to comfort those who are in any affliction. Here it should be noted that
        there is an order among God’s gifts. For God gives special gifts to
        some, that they may pour them out for the benefit of others; for he does
        not give light to the sun in order that the sun may shine for itself
        alone, but for the whole world. Hence, God desires that some profit
        accrue to others from all our gifts, whether they be riches or power of
        knowledge or wisdom: “As each has received a gift, employ it for one
        another” (1 Pet. 4:10). This then is what the Apostle says, who comforts
        us in all our affliction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. – But why? Not only for our benefit, but that it profit others too.
        Hence, he says, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any
        affliction. For we can comfort others by the example of our own comfort.
        For one who is not comforted does not know how to comfort others: “He
        who has not been tried, what manner of things does he know” (Sir. 34:9,
        Vulgate) about any affliction; “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me to
        bring good tidings to the afflicted” (Is. 61:1); “He who comforts all
        who were mourning in Zion” (Sir. 48:27, Vulgate). We are able, I say, to
        comfort them by exhorting them to endure sufferings by promising eternal
        rewards, i.e., because we exhort you by the Scriptures and internal
        inspirations, in order that we may patiently endure and exhort others by
        our example and by the Scriptures themselves: “For I received from the
        Lord what I also delivered to you” (1 Cor. 11:23); “What I have heard
        from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you” (Is.
        21:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. – Having mentioned the profit which comes to others from the
        apostles, he gives the reason for what he has said: For as we share
        abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly
        in comfort too. And because he has said two things, namely, that God
        comforts us in every affliction and that we ourselves can also comfort
        others, he explains here the reason for these two things: first, he
        shows how God comforts us in every affliction; secondly, how our comfort
        is turned to the comfort of others (v. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. – He says, therefore, I am right in saying that he comforts us in
        every affliction, for as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so
        through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. He says, in Christ’s
        sufferings, i.e., begun by Christ: “Begin at my sanctuary” (Ez. 9:6).
        For the sufferings for our sins began in Christ, because ‘he himself
        bore our sins in his body on the tree” (1 Pet. 2:24); then by the
        apostles, who said: “We are slain all the day long” (Ps. 44:22; Rom.
        8:36); then by the martyrs, who were cut in two and were tempted (Heb.
        11:37). Finally, sinners themselves will bear patiently God’s anger for
        their sins. Or the sufferings of Christ, i.e., what we endure for
        Christ: “Then they left the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they
        were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Ac. 5:41); “For
        your sake we are slain all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the
        slaughter” (Ps. 44:22). Just as we share abundantly in these sufferings,
        so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too: “When the cares of
        my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul” (Ps. 94:19).

        6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we
        are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you
        patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. 7 Our hope for you
        is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will
        also share in our comfort. 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant,
        brethren, of the affliction we experienced in Asia; for we were so
        utterly, unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself. 9 Why, we
        felt that we had received the sentence of death; but that was to make us
        rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead; 10 he delivered us
        from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our
        hope that he will deliver us again. 11 You also must help us by prayer,
        so that many [faces] will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing
        granted us in answer to many prayers.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        19. – After showing that the Lord comforts his servants in their
        tribulations, i.e., the ministers of the faith and preachers, the
        Apostle now shows that their comfort redounds to the good of others:
        first, he shows that their comfort results in the advantage and
        salvation of others; secondly, he shows the relation of this comfort to
        salvation (v. 6b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        20. – In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle says
        that he received three things: afflictions, when he says, “In all our
        afflictions”; comfort, when he says, “who comforts us”; exhortation,
        when he says, “so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any
        affliction”. By taking these three things in a passive sense, we say
        that the apostles are afflicted, comforted and exhorted. Hence, the
        Apostle also shows that three things result in the comfort of others,
        and these in a definite order. First, their affliction, when he says, If
        we are afflicted it is for your comfort and salvation, because by our
        example God is telling you to endure suffering, from which eternal
        salvation will come to you. Hence in 1 Maccabees (6:34) we read that
        “they showed the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse
        them for battle”. This is done when the lukewarm and lazy are shown the
        sufferings of the saints as an example. Secondly, he shows that their
        comfort turns out to the advantage of others, when he says, and if we
        are comforted, it is for your comfort: as if to say, the very comfort by
        which we are comforted by the hope of a reward is a comfort to you, for
        by our example you also rejoice in having the same hope of a reward.
        Thirdly he shows that the exhortation they receive turns out to the
        benefit of others, saying, if we are exhorted by an internal inspiration
        or by scourges, it is for your exhortation, i.e., that you be inspired
        to greater things and hope for salvation. Hence it says in 2 Maccabees
        (15:17) that, “exhorted by the word of Judas, they determined to attack
        bravely.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        21. – He suggests the relationship between this comfort and salvation
        when he says, which you experience when you patiently endure the same
        sufferings that we suffer. In regard to this he does two things: first,
        he shows the patience to be had in adversity; secondly, the fruit which
        results from patience (v. 7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        22. – He says, therefore, I say that these things work for your
        salvation, inasmuch as by our example you are strong enough to endure
        sufferings and patiently endure the trials which we also suffer: “By
        your endurance you will gain your lives” (Lk. 21:19); “As an example of
        suffering and patience, brethren, take the prophets” (Jas. 5:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        23. – You obtain fruit from this patience because from it our hope for
        you is unshaken by the fact that you are made heirs of eternal life:
        “Suffering produces endurance, and endurance true hope” (Rom. 5:3-4):
        “Hope in God becomes firmer to the extent that one suffers more
        difficult things for his name. For as a result of the sufferings the
        saints endure for Christ, the hope of eternal life rises in them”
        (Gregory). And the cause of this hope is knowing that as you share in
        our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort, i.e., in eternal
        life: “The saying is sure: If we have died with him, we shall also live
        with him; if we endure, we shall also reign with him” (2 Tim. 2:11-12);
        “But rejoice in so far as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may
        also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed” (1 Pet. 4:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        24. – Then when he says, For we do not want you to be ignorant,
        brethren, of the affliction we experienced in Asia, he wins their good
        will by mentioning certain specific things. And he does three things:
        first, he describes the persecution he suffered in Asia; secondly, the
        special comfort he received (v. 10); thirdly, the cause of the comfort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        25. – He says first, therefore: it is good for you to know not only what
        we have said about our afflictions in general, but we do not want you to
        be ignorant, because it is profitable for you to know them, inasmuch as
        you are more patient because of our example: we do not want you to be
        ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we experienced; “Remember my
        affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall” (Lam. 3:19).
        This is the persecution mentioned in Acts (19:23ff), which was launched
        by a certain Asian silversmith, who incited the people against him. The
        Apostle describes it from three aspects: from the place, because it was
        in Asia; hence he says, in Asia, i.e., Ephesus, which is in Asia, where
        he should rather have been honored and comforted; from its bitterness,
        because it was an extreme suffering; hence he says, for we were so
        utterly crushed. Also it was beyond his strength, and so he says,
        unbearably.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        26. – But this seems to be contrary to what it says in 1 Corinthians
        (10:13): “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond
        your strength.” I answer that to suffer beyond one’s strength can be
        understood in two ways: first, above one’s natural strength, which the
        Apostle means here, above which God sometimes permits his servants to be
        tempted; secondly, above the strength of grace, which the Apostle means
        in 1 Corinthians (10:13): “God is faithful.” That the Apostle is
        speaking of natural strength is indicated by what he says next, we
        despaired of life itself. For it is evident that among all else, life is
        most desirable. Therefore when a persecution is so great that life
        itself becomes wearisome, it is obviously above the strength of our
        nature. And this is what he says, we despaired of life itself, as if to
        say, this persecution was so cruel that life itself became a burden to
        us: “I loathe my life” (Jb. 10:1). But against this James (1:2) says:
        “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials.” I answer
        that affliction can be considered in two ways: either in itself, and
        then it is wearisome, or in relation to faith, and then it is joyful,
        inasmuch as it is endured for God and with the hope of eternal life. We
        were not only weary of life, but we were certain of death; hence, he
        says, we felt that we had received the sentence of death, i.e., the
        certainty of death. As if to say: in my opinion I was about to die. Or
        another way, the sentence of death, i.e., reason itself would say to
        choose death because of the weariness of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        27. – He amplifies the reason for his affliction when he says, but that
        was to make us rely not on ourselves, i.e., that human pride should be
        repressed: “O Lord, my strength and my stronghold” (Jer. 16:19), and
        that we trust God in all things: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the
        Lord, whose trust is the Lord” (Jer. 17:7). And therefore he says, but
        on God who raises the dead: “The Lord kills and brings to life” (1 Sam.
        2:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        28. – But because the Lord does not abandon those who trust in him, the
        Apostle mentions the comfort he received from the Lord, saying, he
        delivered us from so deadly a peril. In regard to this he does three
        things: first, he describes his present comfort against past evils;
        secondly, the comfort to come; thirdly, the cause of love. He says,
        therefore: We have been comforted by God, who delivered us in the past
        from so deadly a peril, and is delivering us in the present, because he
        does not stop delivering: “When you pass through the waters I will be
        with you” (Is. 43:2); on him we have set our hope that he will deliver
        us again, adding in the future: “You who fear the Lord, hope for good
        things” (Sir. 2:9). Your prayers give us cause for this hope; hence he
        says, you also must help us by prayer, which you make for us: “A brother
        helped is like a strong city” (Prov. 18:19); “I appeal to you, brethren,
        by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive
        together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf” (Rom. 15:30).
        These prayers are necessary, because God gives many gifts to one person
        due to the prayers of many. The reason is that God wishes to be thanked
        for the gifts he gives, and as a result many are bound to give thanks.
        This happens when, as a result of giving to one person because of the
        prayers of many, he puts all those at whose prayers he gave some good
        under an obligation to him. Consequently, not only the one who received
        the benefit, but those who prayed should give thanks to God. And this is
        what he says, so that many will give thanks. And he says, from many
        faces, either as to age or condition or the diversity of nations or
        customs. On our behalf for the blessing, i.e., for the gift of faith
        which we have, granted us in answer to many prayers: “Always and for
        everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the
        Father” (Eph. 5:20). Or another way: “from the faces of many persons”,
        i.e., the condition of persons. I say, “For the blessing granted to us”,
        i.e., because they have the same gift, namely of faith or of charity;
        i.e., by means of the many persons who are in the faith of Christ,
        “thanks may be given on our behalf.” Therefore, according to this
        explanation, by the many faces are understood the various virtues, so
        that the predominant virtue in a person is called his face; thus,
        patience is the face of Job, humility the face of David, and so on.

        12 For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience that we have
        behaved in the world, and still more toward you, with holiness and godly
        sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God. 13 For we
        write you nothing but what you can read and understand; I hope you will
        understand fully, 14 as you have understood in part, that you can be
        proud of us as we can be of you, on the day of the Lord Jesus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        29. – After speaking of the comfort he had received from God following
        his persecution, the Apostle assigns the cause of this comfort, which is
        hope in God’s help. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
        states the cause of hope; secondly, he supports this with the testimony
        of those to whom he is writing (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        30. – He says, therefore: I say that we still hope to be rescued by God
        to be comforted, For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience,
        as if to say: the cause of this hope is our good conscience, for hope is
        an expectation of things to come and arises from grace and merits.
        Hence, in regard to this he also does three things: first, he shows the
        boast which he has in the testimony of a pure conscience; secondly, he
        suggests the cause of this boasting (v. 12b); thirdly, he discloses the
        source of this cause (v. 12c).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        31. – He says, therefore: The reason I hope and trust in God is because
        our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, i.e., I glory in the
        testimony and purity of our conscience: “If our hearts do not condemn
        us, we have confidence before God” (1 Jn. 3:21): “The Spirit himself
        bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God” (Rom.
        8:16). It should be noted that the testimony of conscience is true,
        because it does not deceive; for many appear good outwardly who are not
        good in their conscience; and conscience always endures. He does not
        say, “the conscience of others,” but our conscience, because a man
        should put more trust in the testimony of his own conscience about
        himself than in the testimony of others; they do not do this who
        consider themselves good because others are evil rather than because
        they themselves are truly good. Nor is it done by those who boast in the
        goodness of a good person, who is joined to them by some bond.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        32. – He suggests the cause of this boast when he says, in simplicity of
        heart, which consists of two things. For purity of conscience consists
        of two things, namely, that the things a person does are good and that
        his intention is right. These two things the Apostle says of himself.
        First, that he has a right intention towards God in his action; hence he
        says, in simplicity of heart, i.e., with a right intention: “Seek him
        with sincerity of heart” (Wis. 1:1); “The integrity of the upright
        guides them” (Prov. 11:3). Secondly, that the things he does are good;
        hence, he says, and godly sincerity in his actions: “That you may be
        pure and blameless” (Phil. 1:10)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        33. – He discloses the source of the cause of this glory when he says,
        not by earthly wisdom. This can be taken in two ways. First, as
        referring to what he had just said, namely, godly sincerity, and then he
        is suggesting the source of his sincerity and simplicity; as if to say:
        many of the ancients were wise in earthly wisdom, as the philosophers,
        and many Jews lived honorably, trusting in the justice of the Law, but
        we have behaved in the world, not by earthly wisdom, which is according
        to the nature of things, nor by the desires of the flesh, but by the
        grace of God: “To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the
        mind on the Spirit is life and peace” (Rom. 8:6); “not in plausible
        words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (1
        Cor. 2:4); “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Cor. 15:10). Or even
        according to this manner, not by earthly wisdom, i.e., as though relying
        on human wisdom, but by the grace of God: “Do not rely on your own
        insight” (Prov. 3:5) Or it might be explained in another way, so that in
        saying, in simplicity of heart and godly sincerity, he is referring to
        his purity of life; but in saying, not by earthly wisdom, but by the
        grace of God, he is referring to the truth of his teaching; as if to
        say: Just as our life is in the simplicity and sincerity of God, so our
        teaching is not in earthly wisdom, but in the grace of God. But the
        first two interpretations are more valid. And although we have behaved
        thus in the world, yet still more toward you, because he had received
        collections from the other churches, but not from them: “I robbed other
        churches” (2 Cor. 11:8). The reason for this might be that they were
        greedy; hence, in order not to sadden them, he refused to take any
        revenue from them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        34. – Then he calls on them to witness to this holy manner of life,
        saying, For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand.
        As if to say: these things I write to you are not unknown to you,
        because you have already read them in the first letter, and you know
        them by experience: “I am writing you no new commandment, but an old
        commandment” (1 Jn. 2:7). And although you do not know fully, because
        you have received false apostles, I hope you will to the end, namely, of
        your life, understand, namely, perfectly, as you have understood in
        part. The reason for this is that when we see someone starting well, we
        should hope that he will always progress well. And why? Because “he who
        began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus
        Christ” (Phil. 1:6) And you will understand, that you can be proud of
        us, i.e., that through us you should obtain eternal glory, which a
        person reaches through the faith of Christ, which we preach to you: “The
        glory of sons is their fathers” (Prov. 17:6). I say that you can be
        proud of us as we can be of you, because we hope for the reward of
        eternal glory through you who have been instructed by us: “For what is
        our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Is it not you?” (1 Th. 2:19). And
        this boast will be ours from you on the day of the Lord Jesus, i.e., on
        the day of judgment, which is called Christ’s day, because he will then
        accomplish his will with sinners by punishing those who in this world
        did their own will by sinning against the will of Christ the Lord: “At
        the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity” (Ps. 75:2); “And
        books were opened... and the dead were judged by what was written in the
        books, by what they had done” (Rev. 20:12).

        15 Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that
        you might have a double pleasure; 16 I wanted to visit you on my way to
        Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me
        on my way to Judea. 17 Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I
        make my plans like a worldly man, ready to say Yes and No at once? 18As
        surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. 19
        For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we preached among you, Silvanus
        and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No; but in him it is always Yes. 20
        For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why we utter
        the Amen through him, to the glory of God. 21 But it is God who
        establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us; 22 he has put
        his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
        23 But I call God to witness against me—it was to spare you that I
        refrained from coming to Corinth. 24 Not that we lord it over your
        faith; we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        35. – After winning the good will of the Corinthians, the Apostle adds
        his excuse. In regard to this he does three things: first, he mentions
        what he intends; secondly, in the form of a question he answers an
        accusation they made against him (v. 17); thirdly, he excuses himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        36. – In regard to the first it should be noted that in a previous
        epistle (which we do not have), which the Apostle has sent to the
        Corinthians by a messenger, he had promised them that he would visit
        them before going to Macedonia, and that he would return again to
        Achaia, where Corinth is, and from Achaia to Judea. Then in a second
        epistle, which we call the first, he wrote them that he would first go
        to Macedonia and later to Corinth. Therefore, because this seemed
        contrary to the first promise, the Apostle now excuses himself for this
        by first mentioning the promise he originally made; hence, he says,
        Because I was sure of this. As if to say: you know my honesty and
        sincerity and you are my witnesses and my glory; therefore, because I
        was sure of this, i.e., relying on this, because we hope to be glorified
        by you, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double
        pleasure, because a second visit and strengthening of the faith is
        called a second grace in relation to the time they were first converted
        by his ministry and his teaching. I wanted to visit you on my way to
        Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia, and have you send me
        on my way to Judea. This is the sequence of the first promise, but in
        the preceding epistle this is a contrary sequence, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        37. – Then he puts the accusation for this change, for which the
        Corinthians accused him, in the form of a question, saying, Was I
        vacillating when I wanted to do this? For on account of this they
        charged him with two things: light-mindedness, because he changed his
        mind: “The fool changes like the moon” (Sir. 27:11); and carnal love,
        because it seemed to them that he had done this from some carnal and
        human affection. Hence, he touches on two points: first,
        light-mindedness, and he says, Was I vacillating, if I failed to do what
        I once wanted to do? God forbid! “Neither must you think, if we command
        different things, that it comes from the levity of our mind” (Est. 16:9,
        Vulgate); “In the mighty throng I will praise you” (Ps. 35:18). Secondly
        he touches on carnal affection, when he says, Do I make my plans like a
        worldly man, i.e., according to carnal affection, ready to say Yes and
        No at once, i.e., to affirm and deny: “Some suspect us of acting in
        worldly fashion” (2 Cor. 10:2); “A double-minded man is unstable in all
        his ways” (Jas. 1:7-8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        38. – Having enlarged upon their accusation, he excuses himself, saying,
        As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.
        In regard to this he does two things: first, he declares that he did not
        lie; secondly, he shows how he did not lie (v. 21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        39. – He shows in two ways that he had not lied, namely, from his
        character and from the cause [for his not lying]. From his character,
        because we should not suppose that a person would easily lie, if he has
        never been found to be a liar. According to this explanation, As surely
        as God is faithful, is spoken with the force of an oath. As if to say:
        God is my witness that my word, namely, my preaching, to you has not
        been Yes and No, i.e., there is no falsity in it: “A faithful God,
        without deceit, just and upright is he” (Deut. 32:4). But if God is
        faithful is taken for the truth of the divine promise, then the sense
        is: God is faithful, i.e., he keeps his promises, but he had promised to
        send you preachers of the truth: “I will give you shepherds after my own
        heart” (Jer. 3:15). Therefore, since I was sent by him, our word to you
        has not been Yes and No.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        40. – In regard to the cause, he excuses himself for two reasons,
        namely, from the motive and the efficient cause. His motive for not
        lying is that a person who assumes an office is naturally moved to what
        suits that office and not to what is contrary; but it is obvious that
        the Apostle’s office is to preach the truth. Therefore, he is not moved
        to the contrary of the truth, which is to lie. In regard to this he does
        three things: first, he proves the truth of his word by the word of
        Christ; secondly, he proves the truth of Christ by the word of God;
        thirdly, he concludes to what he intended (v. 20b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        41. – He says, therefore: I say that our words should be regarded as
        true, and true they are, because we have preached Christ, in whom there
        is no falsehood. And this is what he says, For the Son of God, Jesus
        Christ, whom we preached among you, Silvanus, by me, i.e. to say
        principally, and Silvanus, secondarily (he is the Silas of Ac. 18:5),
        and Timothy mentioned above. For those two were with the Apostle when he
        first converted them. He, namely, the Son of God, was not Yes and No,
        i.e., there was not falsity, for he did nothing unbecoming, but in him
        it is always Yes, i.e., the truth, for truth and being are convertible:
        “I am the way and the truth and the life” (Jn. 14:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        42. – But because there might be some doubt about his statement that
        there was no falsity in Christ, he at once proves this, saying, For all
        the promises of God find their Yes in him. He proves this in the
        following way: it is obvious that there can be no falsity in that which
        is the manifestation of the divine truth; but the Son of God came to
        manifest the divine truth in the promises made by God to be fulfilled
        through him. Therefore there is no falsity in him. And that is what he
        says: there is not in the Son of God Yes and No, because all the
        promises of God, namely made to men, find their Yes in him, i.e., in
        Christ, i.e., they are verified and fulfilled in Christ: “I tell you
        that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God’s
        truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs”
        (Rom. 15:8)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        43. – From this, therefore, the Apostle concludes that his words are
        true, because he preaches the Son of God, in whom is the truth. That is
        why through him, namely, Christ, we utter the Amen, i.e., that which is
        true: “The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness” (Rev.
        3:14); “He who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the
        God of truth, amen” (Is. 65:16). This truth we say to God, i.e., to the
        honor of God, namely, manifesting his truth to the glory of God and our
        glory, because our glory is to show and preach the word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        44. – Then when he says, but it is God who establishes us with you in
        Christ, and has anointed us, the Apostle proves that he has not lied by
        the efficient cause. For although a man by his free will can employ his
        tongue for speaking truth or falsity, God can establish a man so well in
        the truth, that he would speak nothing but the truth. Therefore, if God
        established someone in the truth, it is obvious that he could not say
        anything false; but God establishes us in the truth. And therefore he
        says, it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, i.e., in the true
        preaching of Christ. As if to say: if Christ were outside us, we could
        lie, but because he is with us and we in Christ, we do not lie: “It is I
        who keep steady its pillars” (Ps. 75:3). Therefore we are in Christ in
        two ways, namely, by grace and by glory: by grace, inasmuch as we have
        been anointed with the grace of the Holy Spirit and made members of
        Christ and joined to him; by which grace Christ as man was also
        anointed: “God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
        above your fellows” (Ps. 45:7). And from the fullness of that anointing
        it has overflowed to all of us as “the precious oil on the head”, namely
        of Christ, “has flowed down on the beard, the beard of Aaron” (Ps.
        133:2). Therefore, he says that God has anointed us. He anointed us, I
        say, as kings and priests: “You made them a kingdom and priests to our
        God” (Rev. 5:10); “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
        nation” (1 Pet. 2:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        45. – But the union which is according to glory we do not yet have in
        reality, but in sure hope, inasmuch as we have a firm hope of attaining
        to this union. And we have a twofold certainty of hope resulting from
        the hope of this union. One is by a sign, the other by a pledge. [The
        first is] by an evident sign, which is of faith. Hence he says, he has
        put his seal upon us with the sign of Christian faith: “Put a mark on
        their foreheads” (Ez. 9:4), i.e., the sign of the cross: “Till we have
        sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads” (Rev. 7:3). And
        this is done through the Holy Spirit: “Anyone who does not have the
        Spirit of Christ does not belong to him” (Rom. 8:9). Therefore the
        special and certain sign of obtaining eternal life is configuration to
        Christ: “Set me as a seal upon your heart” (Sg. 8:6). Or he sealed us
        with the sign of life. [The second is] by the greatest pledge, i.e., of
        the Holy Spirit; and so he says and given us his Spirit in our hearts as
        a guarantee, and we are certain that no one can take him from us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        46. – But note that there are two things to be considered in a pledge,
        namely, that it produces a hope of obtaining the reality, and that it is
        as valid as the reality or more so. And these two things are in the Holy
        Spirit, because if we consider the substance of the Holy Spirit, he is
        as valid as eternal life, which is God, because he is as valid as the
        three persons. But if we consider the manner in which [he] is possessed,
        then it produces the hope but not the possession of eternal life,
        because we do not yet have him perfectly in this life. Therefore we are
        not perfectly happy until we have him perfectly in heaven: “You were
        sealed with the promised Holy Spirit” (Eph. 1:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        47. – The when he says, but I call God to witness, he gives his excuse
        for not coming; and this is by oath which is greater. In regard to this
        he does three things: first, he states the excuse; secondly, he answer a
        tacit question (v. 24a); thirdly, he explains what he says (v. 24b). He
        excuses himself with a double oath: one of attestation, when he says, I
        call God to witness; the other of execration, when he says, against me,
        i.e., against my soul: “For God is my witness” (Rom. 1:9). As witness, I
        say, I call upon God, because I refrained from coming, i.e., after the
        first time or after I departed from you; and this I did to spare you,
        namely, because he knew that they were incorrigible. Hence, if he had
        gone then, he would either have punished them, and they perhaps would
        have left the faith altogether, or he would not have punished them, and
        then he would have been giving them occasion to sin more. But because
        someone could say, Why do you say spare us? Are you our lord? He removes
        this, saying, not that we lord it over your faith; we work with you for
        your joy. As if to say: I do not say this as a lord, but as a helper:
        “Not as those domineering over those in your charge, but being examples
        to the flock” (1 Pet. 5:3). A helper, I say, for your joy, or for your
        improvement. Why he says, of your faith, he explains, saying, for you
        stand firm in your faith, i.e., you stand in that grace of Christ by
        faith.

        48. – After giving a general excuse for his delay in visiting the
        Corinthians, the Apostle now gives the cause of his delay and how he
        spared them. In regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions
        that one cause of his delay was that he might not pain them by coming;
        secondly, he shows that another cause was that the fruit he hoped for
        from others and which was beginning to ripen, might not be hindered (v.
        12). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows that the
        cause of his delay in general was to avoid paining them; secondly, he
        speaks in particular about a certain person who had grieved him (v. 5).
        In regard to the first he does three things: first, he tells why he
        postponed his visit; secondly, he gives the reason for his statement (v.
        2); thirdly, he explains what he said (v. 4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        49. – He says, therefore: I have said that it was in order not to grieve
        you that I did not come to you. Therefore, I made up my mind, i.e.,
        about what I mentioned when I sent the other letter: “Reason is the
        beginning of every work, and counsel precedes every undertaking” (Sir.
        37:16); not to make you another painful visit, i.e., not to cause you
        pain. The reason he did not wish to grieve them is the same one whereby
        the Lord did not wish his disciples to fast, namely, in order that they
        be drawn to Christ and be joined to him not by fear but by love. For the
        Lord wished to strengthen and nourish them in the faith in all sweetness
        and heartfelt desire, so that, being thus established in love, they
        would not easily turn away from him because of tribulations, for “many
        waters cannot extinguish love” (Sg. 8:7). For the same reason the
        Apostle does not want to pain them on this account.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        50. – He assigns the reason for what he says, namely, that he does not
        want to pain them, when he says, for if I cause you pain, who is there
        to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? In regard to this he
        does two things: first, he deals with the reason why he did not wish to
        pain them; secondly, he shows why he tells them this (v. 3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        51. – He says, therefore: the reason why I did not wish you to fall into
        sadness was that your sadness pains me, and I rejoice in your
        consolation; and you only console me when I am with you. Hence, if I had
        come and pained you, I would be sad at your sadness; then there would be
        no one among you to gladden me, because you would be sad on my account.
        For one who is sad does not easily console another person: “A wise son
        makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother” (Prov.
        10:1); “He who loves wisdom makes his father glad” (Prov. 29:3). Or in
        another way, there are two kinds of sadness. One is according to the
        world, and the other according to God who produces repentance leading to
        salvation. The Apostle is not speaking of the first, but of the second.
        He says: I will be consoled if I cause you pain, i.e., if by scolding
        you I bring you to repentance; but if I had come and seen you
        unrepentant of your sins, I would have had no consolation, because no
        one is sad and repentant because of me, i.e., because of my correction
        and rebuke.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        52. – But the reason I write this to you is that you so adjust
        yourselves, that when I come, I will not be sad at seeing you
        uncorrected, in addition to the sadness I experienced when I heard that
        you had sinned. In regard to this he does two things: first, he gives
        his admonition; secondly, he shows that he is confident it will be
        obeyed (v. 3b). The admonition is this: I wrote as I did, namely, that I
        am pained at the sin you committed: “he was vexed in his righteous soul
        day after day with their lawless deeds” (2 Pet. 2:8), in order that you
        might prepare and arrange yourselves by correction, so that when I came
        I might not suffer pain at your sins from those who should have made me
        rejoice, i.e., I ought to rejoice and be glad in your presence: “There
        is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents” (Lk.
        15:10). The confidence he had that they would follow his admonition is
        indicated when he says, for I felt sure of all of you. As if to say: I
        have this confidence in you, that you will be so disposed, that when I
        come, all of you will give me reason for joy; and you should do this
        cheerfully, that my joy would be the joy of you all, i.e., it would
        contribute to your joy, or it is for the sake of your joy, which you
        have from the recovery of grace: “Rejoice with those who rejoice” (Rom.
        12:15)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        53. – But because someone might be in doubt at his saying, so that when
        I came I might not suffer pain, and ask what sort of pain he had for
        them, he explains this saying, for I wrote you out of much affliction
        and anguish of heart. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
        mentions the pain he has already suffered; secondly, he answers a tacit
        question (v. 4b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        54. – First, therefore, he says: I would be pained if I found you
        uncorrected—a greater pain than I had when you sinned and I was obliged
        to sadden you with a sharp rebuke: for I wrote you in the first epistle
        out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, which I
        shed for you when you were already dead in sin: “O that my head were
        waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears” (Jer. 9:1); “It is a disgrace
        to be the father of an undisciplined son” (Sir. 22:3); “The righteous
        man perishes and no one lays it to heart” (Is. 57:1). But it should be
        noted that he mentions two things that amplify his pain, namely,
        affliction and anguish, because one added to the other increases
        sadness. For sometimes a person is sad but without anguish, namely, when
        he is pricked by some adversity as though by a very sharp thorn; and yet
        various ways of escape seem open to him, because if no way is open,
        anguish is joined to affliction. He says, therefore, for I wrote you out
        of much affliction, with which he was pricked by your deeds and your
        evil, and anguish of heart, because he could not see where a remedy
        could easily be found: “Trouble and anguish have come upon me” (Ps.
        119:143).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        55. – But because they could say, O Apostle, you even write these things
        to pain us, he anticipates this, saying, not to cause you pain do I
        write these things to you, but to let you know the abundant love that I
        have for you. For there are two signs of love, namely, to rejoice in the
        good of another and to be pained at his evil; and I have these toward
        you: “For the love of Christ controls us” (2 Cor. 5:14). More abundantly
        than you think, or more abundantly than toward others.

        5 But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in
        some measure—not to put it too severely—to you all. 6 For such a one
        this punishment by the majority is enough; 7 so you should rather turn
        to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive
        sorrow. 8 So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. 9 For this is why
        I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in
        everything. 10 Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have
        forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the
        presence of Christ, 11 to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us;
        for we are not ignorant of his designs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        56. – After giving the reason for his delay, namely, to avoid paining
        them, and after telling them of his sadness, the Apostle then treats
        here of the one causing his sadness. In regard to this he does three
        things: first, he speaks more fully of the guilt of the one who causes
        this sadness; secondly, of his punishment for the injury he inflicted
        (v. 6); thirdly, he urges them to have mercy on this person (v. 7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        57. – He says, therefore: I have written to you with many tears, which I
        shed because of the sadness I fell and because of the punishment to be
        inflicted on the sinner, but if any one has caused me pain, he, namely,
        the heinous fornicator of whom he writes in 1 Corinthians (5:1): “It is
        actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that
        is not found even among pagans”: that one, I say, even if he has caused
        sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure, i.e., he has
        caused it not to me alone, but you and us. Not all, but in some measure.
        And I say this, not to put it too severely to you all, i.e., that I may
        not lay this burden on all of you by speaking derisively. As if to say:
        you are not so good or love me so much that all of you would weep over
        my sadness and over the sin of a brother. Or, not to put it too severely
        to you all, not only those who did not grieve over the sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        58. – Or it could be said and better: he has caused it not to me, but in
        some measure. For it should be noted that sometimes a person is
        completely saddened and sometimes not. He is completely saddened when he
        is engrossed by pain with his grief. This is the sadness that works
        death, as he says below (7:10), but that, according to the Philosopher,
        does not happen to a wise man. He is not completely sad when, although
        he is sad about some evil he is suffering or seems to be on its way, he
        nevertheless rejoices for other good reasons. This sadness is according
        to God and does happen to a wise man. Therefore, because the Apostle
        says that he was very sad, he adds that he was sad in some measure, as
        though not entirely, lest they suppose that he was altogether engrossed
        by sadness, which does not befit a wise man. According to this, the
        meaning is: He, i.e. the fornicator, has pained me on account of his
        sin, but he has not pained me entirely. For although I grieved for him
        because of his sin, yet I take joy in you because of the many good
        things you do, and in him because of his repentance. I say, in some
        measure, that I may not burden you all, i.e., that I may not lay this
        burden on you, namely, that you should grieve me.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        59. – But lest they should wish to punish him more on account of the
        Apostle’s sadness, he shows them that the punishment was sufficient,
        saying, for such a one, namely, he who pained me so much by sinning,
        this punishment by the majority is enough, i.e., such a harsh public
        correction that he was excommunicated from the Church and delivered to
        Satan (1 Cor. 5:5). Therefore this punishment is enough for the above
        reasons. Or it can be called sufficient, not as to God’s judgment, but
        as was expedient for the time and the person. For it is better to
        observe such a spirit of leniency in correcting, that the fruit of
        correction follows on the penance, than to correct so harshly that the
        sinner despairs and falls into worse sins. Therefore is says in Sirach
        (21:4): “Terror and violence will lay waste riches.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        60. – Therefore, because that punishment was sufficient and he did
        penance, he urges them to show mercy, saying, so you should rather turn
        to forgive and comfort him. Here he does three things: first, he
        commands them to spare the sinner; secondly, he gives the reason (v. 7);
        thirdly, he urges them to observe this admonition (v. 8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        61. – He says first, therefore: I say that the punishment is sufficient
        for him, so much that you should rather turn to forgive him: “Forgive,
        and you will be forgiven” (Lk. 6:37); “Forgiving one another, as God in
        Christ forgave you” (Eph. 4:32). You should not only forgive, but what
        is more, you should comfort him, and this by recalling to themselves the
        example of sinners who were restored to the state of grace, such as
        David, Peter, Paul and Magdalene, and through the Word of God: “For I
        have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord GOD; so turn,
        and live” (Ez. 18:32); “Admonish the idlers, encourage the fainthearted,
        help the weak, be patient with them all” (1 Th. 5:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        62. – He gives the reason for this admonition, saying, or he may be
        overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. For some are sometimes so steeped in
        sorrow because of sin and punishment of sin, that they are overcome,
        when they have no one to comfort them; and this is bad, because it does
        not result in the hope for the fruit of repentance, namely reformation,
        but in despair he delivers himself over to all sins, as Cain, when he
        said: “My punishment is greater than I can bear” (Gen. 4:13); “Who,
        despairing, have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to
        practice every kind of uncleanness” (Eph. 4:19). For this reason,
        despair is called a dangerous thing in 2 Samuel (2:26), so that David
        said in Psalm 69 (v. 15): “Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep
        swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.” Therefore, in order
        to prevent this, he says, comfort him, so that he will cease sinning:
        “This will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin” (Is. 27:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        63. – Then the Apostle urges them not only by reason, but from other
        causes to do this, when he says, so I beg you to reaffirm your love for
        him. And he urges them in three ways: first, by his appeal, saying, so,
        i.e., that he not be overwhelmed, I, who can command, beg you: “Though I
        am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for
        love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you” (Phlm. 1:8-9). Evil prelates do
        the opposite: “With force and harshness you have ruled them” (Ez. 34:4).
        To reaffirm your love for him, which happens if you show your charity
        for him and not hate him for his sins, or despise him, but for your
        consolation make him hate his sin and love justice: “Strengthen your
        brethren” (Lk. 22:32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        64. – Secondly, he urges them with a command, saying, for this is why I
        wrote, namely, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient
        in everything. He says, in everything, namely, whether they are pleasing
        or displeasing to you. For he had first commanded them to excommunicate
        him, and they obeyed the Apostle’s command. But now he commands them to
        be sparing; hence he says, whether you are obedient in everything.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        65. – Thirdly, he urges them by reminding them of a gift, when he says,
        any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. As if to say: you should do
        this because I also have done it. For if you have forgiven someone and
        asked me to forgive, I have forgiven. And this is what he says: any one
        whom you forgive, I also forgive.

        66. – And this is obvious, for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven
        anything, has been for your sake in the [person] of Christ. In this he
        touches four things required for such pardon or forgiveness. The first
        is discernment, so that pardon is not granted indiscriminately and
        rashly; hence he says, if I have forgiven anything, namely, in the
        proper way: “Let your eyes look directly forward” (Prov. 4:25). The
        second is the end, because it should be done not for love or hatred, but
        for some benefit to the Church or others; hence he says, it has been for
        your sake. The third is authority, because it should not be done on
        one’s own authority, but Christ’s, who forgives sin by authority, but
        the others to whom it has been entrusted, forgive as ministers and
        members of Christ; hence he says, in the [person] of Christ, namely, not
        by my own authority. Yet whatever is forgiven, Christ forgives: “If you
        forgive the sins of any they are forgiven” (Jn. 20:23). The fourth is
        need; hence he says, to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us.
        For the devil had deceived many: some by leading them to commit sins,
        and others by excessive rigor against sinners; so that if Satan cannot
        get them for having committed sin, he at least destroys those he already
        has by the severity of prelates who drive them to despair by not
        correcting them in a compassionate way. Hence, he destroys these, and
        the others he puts in the snare of the devil: “Be not righteous
        overmuch” (Ecc. 7:16); “Your adversary the devil prowls around like a
        roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Pet. 5:8). And this will
        happen to us if we do not forgive sinners. Therefore that we might not
        be deceived by Satan, to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us,
        I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for we are not ignorant of
        his designs, namely, those of Satan. This is true in general, but in
        particular no one can know his thoughts but God alone: “Who can strip
        off his outer garment? Who can penetrate into the midst of his mouth?”
        (Jb. 41:13, Vulgate).

        12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, a door was
        opened for me in the Lord; 13 but my mind could not rest because I did
        not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to
        Macedonia. 14 But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in
        triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him
        everywhere. 15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are
        being saved and among those who are perishing, 16 to one a fragrance
        from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is
        sufficient for these things? 17 For we are not, like so many, peddlers
        of God’s word; but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the
        sight of God we speak in Christ.

        67. – Having stated the first reason for his delay, namely, that he
        might avoid coming to them in sadness, he now states the second reason,
        which is the fruit he was producing elsewhere. In regard to this he does
        two things: first, he mentions his travels; secondly, their result (v.
        14). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the
        obstacle he met at Troas; secondly, his journey into Macedonia (v. 13b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        68. – He says, therefore: When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of
        Christ, i.e., to preach Christ: “But I chose you and appointed you that
        you should go and bear fruit” (Jn. 15:16), a door was opened for me,
        i.e., men’s minds were prepared and disposed to receive the words of
        preaching and Christ: “for a wide door for effective work has opened to
        me” (1 Cor. 16:9); “Behold, I stand at the door and knock” (Rev. 3:20).
        But not in anyone, but in the Lord, because this preparation of the
        human mind is accomplished by God’s power. For although the ease with
        which minds are prepared is the cause of conversion, God is the cause of
        that ease and of the preparation: “Convert us to yourself, O Lord, that
        we may be converted” (Lam. 5:21, Vulgate). When, I say, a door was thus
        opened for me in the Lord my mind [spirit] could not rest, i.e., I was
        unable to do what my spirit wished, i.e., dictated. For the spirit is
        said to have rest, when it achieves what it wishes, just as the flesh is
        said to rest when it has what it desires: “Soul, you have ample goods
        laid up for many years; take your ease” (Lk. 12:19). The Apostle does
        not say, I had no rest in my flesh or my body, but in my mind, i.e., in
        my spiritual will, which is to establish Christ in the hearts of men.
        And I was hindered because I saw hearts prepared and disposed, and was
        unable to preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        69. – Then he tells why he had no rest in his spirit, when he adds,
        because I did not find my brother Titus there, i.e., because of Titus’
        absence. And this for two reasons. One reason was that although the
        Apostle knew all their languages, so that he could say: “I thank God
        that I speak in tongues more than you all” (1 Cor. 14:18), he was more
        skilled in Hebrew than in Greek, but Titus more in Greek. Therefore, he
        wanted to have him present to preach in Troas. And because he was
        absent, for the Corinthians had detained him, he says, my spirit could
        not rest. But because God’s gifts are not imperfect, and the gift of
        tongues was specifically given to the apostles for preaching throughout
        the whole world: “Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their
        words to the end of the world” (Ps. 19:4), the other reason is better,
        namely, that many things remained for the Apostle to do in Troas. For on
        the one hand, he had to preach to those who were prepared to receive
        Christ by faith; and on the other, he had to resists the adversaries who
        opposed him; therefore, because he could not do these things alone, he
        was grieved by the absence of Titus, who could concentrate on preaching
        and converting the good, while the Apostle withstood the adversaries.
        And he is at pains to write this to them in order to suggest that not
        only the first, but also the second reason for his delay was due to
        them. For on account of their hardness and quarreling, they delayed
        Titus for a long time. Hence he says, because I did not find my brother
        Titus there, either in Christ or in my co-worker: “A brother helped is
        like a strong city” (Prov. 18:19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        70. – Because I did not find Titus in Troas, I did not stay there; I
        took leave of them who were converted and in whom a door had been
        opened, and I went on to Macedonia, where I expected to find him. But
        his reason for going into Macedonia is given in Acts (16:9), where it
        says: “A man of Macedonia was standing beseeching him and saying, ‘Come
        over to Macedonia and help us.’”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        71. – Then when he says, But thanks be to God, he describes the progress
        of his journey, and does two things: first, he describes the order of
        his progress; secondly, he excludes the false apostles from that
        progress (v. 16b). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he
        hints at the progress he made; secondly, he explains something he had
        said (v. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        72. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle did not
        attribute to himself the progress and fruit he had produced, or to his
        own power, but to God: “On the contrary, I worked harder than any of
        them, though it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me” (1
        Cor. 15:20): “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Th. 5:18); “Always
        and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to
        God the Father” (Eph. 5:20). Who in Christ always leads us in triumph,
        i.e., makes us triumph in preaching Christ against our adversaries. Here
        it should be notes that preachers of truth should do two things: namely,
        to exhort in sacred doctrine and to refute those who contradict it. This
        they do in two ways: by debating with heretics and by practicing
        patience toward persecutors. The Apostle touches on these in order;
        hence he says, who leads us in triumph, as to those who contradict: “We
        are more than conquerors” (Rom. 8:37); “It is not on the size of the
        army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven” (1
        Macc. 3:19); and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of
        him everywhere, as to exhorting in sacred doctrine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        73. – A Gloss explains the fragrance of the knowledge of him, i.e., of
        his Son; but it is better to suppose that this is said to distinguish
        between knowledge of God obtained by other sciences and that obtained by
        faith. For the knowledge of God obtained by other sciences enlightens
        the intellect only by showing that God is the first cause, that he is
        one and wise and so on. But the knowledge of God obtained by faith both
        enlightens the intellect and delights the affections, because it not
        only says that God is the first cause, but that he is our Savior, that
        he is our Redeemer, that he loves us and that he became incarnate for
        us: all of which inflame the affections. Therefore is should be said
        that the fragrance of the knowledge of him, i.e., the knowledge of his
        sweetness, he spreads to those who believe by everywhere, because that
        fragrance is diffused far and wide: “Like a vine I cause loveliness to
        bud” (Sir. 24:17); “See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field
        which the Lord has blessed” (Gen. 27:27).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        74. – But because some might say, What is the fragrance of God in every
        place? For there are many places in which our preaching is not accepted.
        The Apostle explains this, saying: I do not care, because whether they
        accept our preaching or not, the knowledge of God is manifest everywhere
        through us, because we are the aroma of Christ to God, namely, to the
        honor of God. He says this in a likeness to the Law, where it is said
        that a sacrifice becomes the sweetest fragrance of sweetness to God. As
        if to say: we are a holocaust offered to God as a fragrance of sweetness
        among those who are being saved, namely, that they not perish, which is
        theirs from God; and among those who are perishing, which is theirs from
        themselves. Hence, it is written in Hosea (13:9, Vulgate): “Destruction
        is your own, O Israel, your help is only in me”. But is that fragrance
        related to the good and the wicked in the same way? No, but to one a
        fragrance from death to death, i.e., of envy and malice, which are the
        occasion of bringing them to eternal death, i.e., those who envy the
        good reputation of the Apostle and strive against the preaching of
        Christ and the conversion of the faithful: “This child is set for the
        fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken
        against” (Lk. 2:34). To the other a fragrance from life to life, of love
        and good opinion leads them to eternal life, namely, to those who
        rejoice and are converted by the preaching of the Apostle: “For the word
        of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are
        being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18). Thus, from the
        fragrance of the Apostle the good live and the wicked die, as it is read
        that serpents die from the smell of flourishing vines.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        75. – Then when he says, Who is sufficient for these things? He excludes
        the false apostles from the progress, saying, Who of those false
        apostles is sufficient for these things? which we true apostles
        accomplish. As if to say: None: “But to me your friends, O God, are
        exceedingly honorable” (Ps. 138:17, Vulgate). But on the other hand, it
        says in Proverbs (27:2): “Let another praise you, and not your own
        mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.” Gregory, in his commentary on
        Ezekiel, answers this by saying that the saints praise themselves for
        two reasons, and not for their own glory and vanity. The first reason is
        that they not despair in tribulations, as Job, when his friends tried to
        bring him to despair, recalled to his mind the good things he had done,
        in order to comfort himself and not despair. Hence, he said: “I have
        made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look upon a virgin?”
        (31:1). We read of a holy father, that when he was tempted to despair,
        he recalled to mind the good things he had done, in order to comfort
        himself; when he was tempted to pride, he recalled the evil he had done,
        in order to be humbled. The second reason is for profit, namely, that he
        obtain a greater reputation and that his teaching be believed more
        readily. This is the reason why the Apostle praises himself here. For
        the Corinthians had preferred false apostles to him and disdained him.
        As a result they were not ready to obey him. Therefore, to assure that
        they would not disdain but obey him, he prefers himself to them and
        praises himself, saying, Who is sufficient for these things? as we are.
        Not the false apostles, because even though they preach, they adulterate
        God’s word—which we do not do.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        76. – Hence, he says, for we are not, like so many, namely, the false
        apostles, peddlers of God’s word, mingling contrary doctrines, as the
        heretics, who although they confess Christ, do not admit that he is true
        God. This is what the false apostles do, who say that along with the
        Gospel the legal observances must be kept. Hence he says, for we are
        not, like so many, peddlers [adulterers] of God’s word, i.e., preaching
        for gain or for praise. For thus are women called adulteresses, when
        they receive seed from another man for the propagation of children. In
        preaching, the seed is nothing less than your end or intention.
        Therefore, if your end is gain, if your intention is your own glory, you
        adulterate God’s word. This the false apostles were doing who were
        preaching for gain: “We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with
        God’s word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend
        ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God” (2 Cor. 4:2).
        But the apostles preached neither for monetary gain nor their own glory,
        but for the praise of God and the salvation of their neighbor. Hence, he
        adds, but as men of sincerity, i.e., with a sincere intention; not for
        gain and without corrupted admixtures: “We have behaved in the world,
        and still more toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity” (2 Cor.
        1:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        77. – He points out three aspects of this sincerity: the first is taken
        from the dignity of the one who sent them. For it is expected of a
        messenger of the truth to speak the truth; hence he says, as
        commissioned by God, i.e., with that sincerity which befits a messenger
        of God: “Whoever speaks as one who utters oracles of God” (1 Pet. 4:11).
        The second is taken from the authority of the one presiding, before whom
        he stands. Hence he says, in the sight of God, in whose presence we
        should speak with sincerity: “As the Lord the God of Israel lives,
        before whom I stand” (1 Kg. 17:1). The third is taken from the dignity
        of the subject of which he speaks. For the preaching of the apostles is
        about Christ; therefore, it should be sincere, as also Christ and God
        are. Hence, he says, we speak in Christ alone, and not in the ceremonies
        of the Law, as false apostles do: “For I decided to know nothing among
        you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2).

        1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some

        our letter of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and
        read by all men; 3 and you show that you are a letter from Christ
        delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living
        God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. 4 Such is
        the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. 5 Not that we are

        78. – After presenting his excuse, by which he won the good will of his
        hearers, the Apostle continues toward his main intention, namely, to
        treat about the ministers of the New Testament. In regard to this he
        does two things: first, he commends the dignity of the good ministers;
        secondly, he expands on the guilt of the evil ministers (chap. 10ff.).
        In regard to the first he does two things: first, he commends the
        ministry of the New Testament; secondly, he commends the exercise of
        this ministry in others by exhorting them to this (chap. 6). In regard
        to the first he commends the ministry of the New Testament from three
        aspects: first, in this chapter, from its dignity; secondly, from its
        exercise (chap. 4); thirdly, from its reward (chap. 5). In regard to the
        first he does two things: first, he removes an objection; secondly, he
        commends the ministers of the New Testament (v. 6). In regard to the
        first it should be noted that the Apostle intended to commend the
        ministers of the New Testament, of which he is one. Therefore, lest the
        Corinthians object that in doing this he wishes to commend himself, he
        at once removes this, saying, Are we beginning to commend ourselves
        again? Here he does two things: he first raises the question and then he
        answers it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        79. –The question is this: I say that we do not adulterate the Word of
        God as the false apostles do, but we speak with sincerity as from God.
        But in saying this, are we beginning to commend ourselves again?, i.e.,
        are we saying this because we want to procure our glory and not that of
        God? And he says, again, because in the first epistle he had commended
        himself enough, when he said (3:10): “Like a skilled master builder I
        laid a foundation.” Therefore, we are not saying this to seek our own
        glory, but God’s: “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a
        stranger, and not your own lips” (Prov. 27:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        80. – He answers this when he says, Or do we need? Here he shows that he
        is not happy to commend himself. In regard to this he does two things:
        first, he shows that he does not need man’s commendation; secondly, that
        he does not require it of them (v. 4). In regard to the first he does
        two things: first, he shows that he does not need their commendation;
        secondly, he assigns the cause of this (v. 2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        81. – He says, therefore: I say that we do not begin to commend
        ourselves, because we do not need commendation. And this is what he
        says: Do we, the true ministers, need as some do, namely the false
        apostles, letters of recommendation, i.e., praise, to you by others, or
        from you to others? But on the other hand, he says in Colossians (4:10):
        “Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, greets you.” Even papal legates always
        carry letters of recommendation. Therefore it is not an evil. I answer
        that to accept such letters from famous persons, who are commended and
        honored by reason of them alone, until they become known by their good
        works, is not evil: that is what papal legates do. But the Apostle was
        already so well known and recommended among them by his works, that he
        did not need letters of recommendation.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        82. – Therefore he at once gives the reason for this, saying, you
        yourselves are our letter of recommendation; as if to say: I have a good
        letter; I do not need others. In regard to this, he does two things:
        first, he shows what that letter is which he has; secondly, he explains
        this (v. 3). In regard to the first he does two things: first he shows
        what that letter is; secondly, he shows that it is sufficient for
        commending him (v. 3b). He says, therefore, you are our letter, i.e.,
        the letter through which our dignity is made manifest, by which we are
        commended, so that we do not need other letters: “You are our glory” (1
        Th. 2:20); “My little children, with whom I am again in travail, until
        Christ be formed in you” (Gal. 4:19). But is this letter sufficient?
        Yes, because it is written on your hearts. Here he touches on two things
        causing the sufficiency of such letters. One is that it should be
        understood and known by the one for whom it is sent; the other that he
        still seeks, and not that he knows himself to have it. As to this he
        says, written on our hearts, because we always have you in mind, having
        a special care for you: “I hold you in my heart” (Phil. 1:7). The other
        is that he to whom it is sent may read and know it; hence, he says, to
        be known and read by all men. To be known, I say, because you have been
        instructed and converted by us; but it is read, because by our example
        even others imitate you: “Write the vision; make it plain upon tablets,
        so he may run who reads it” (Hab. 2:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        83. – Then he explains how this letter is known, saying, you show that
        you are a letter from Christ, and in regard to this he does three
        things. First, he explains whose letter it is; secondly, how it was
        written; thirdly, on what. He shows whose it is when he says, from
        Christ. Hence, he says, you show that you are a letter from Christ,
        i.e., informed and led by Christ, principally and authoritatively: “For
        you have one teacher” (Matt. 23:8), but by us secondarily and
        instrumentally. Hence he adds, delivered by us: “This is how one should
        regard us, as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1); “What then is Apollos?
        What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed” (1 Cor. 3:5) He shows
        how it was written, not with ink, i.e., not mixed with errors, as the
        letters of the false apostle; not changeable and imperfect as the Old
        Law, which led no one to perfection (cf. Heb. 7:19); for black ink is
        that by which error is understood, and delible by which changeableness
        is understood. It is written not with ink, I say, but with the Spirit of
        the living God, i.e., by the Holy Spirit, by whom you live and by whose
        teaching you have been instructed: “In whom you were sealed with the
        promised Holy Spirit” (Eph. 1:13). He suggests where it is written, when
        he says, not on tablets of stone, as the Old Law, to exclude hardness;
        as if to say: not in the stony hearts of the hard-hearted, as the Jews:
        “You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always
        resist the Holy Spirit” (Ac. 7:51); but on tablets of human hearts,
        i.e., hearts opened by charity, and human, i.e., made receptive as a
        result of filling and understanding: “I will take out of your flesh the
        heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh” (Ez. 36:26).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        84. – Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
        Above, the Apostle excused himself, that he was not seeking his own
        glory, because he did not need it; here he proves that he is not seeking
        his own glory. Indeed, everything good he does he attributes not to
        himself but to God. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
        attributes all the good he has and does to God; secondly, he gives the
        reason for this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        85. – He says, therefore: I say that we do not need letters of
        recommendation and that you are our letter ministered by us. Nor do we
        seek our glory, but Christ’s. Such is the confidence, i.e. to say such
        things, that we have through Christ toward God, i.e., we refer it to
        God. Or I have such confidence in God, by whose power I say these
        things, because he works in me, and the confidence we have through
        Christ, through whom we have access to the Father, as it says in Romans
        (5:2), who unites us to God: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,
        whose trust is the Lord” (Jer. 17:7). And I have this confidence because
        I am united to God through Christ: “I will act confidently in him” (Ps.
        11:6, Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        86. – But the cause of this confidence is that whatever I do, I
        attribute to the very beginning of the work to God. Therefore, he says,
        not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from
        us, much less say and accomplish. For in the pursuit of any work there
        is first an assent, which is done by thinking, then discussion by word,
        and finally accomplishment by work. Hence if a person does not have the
        thinking from himself but from God, there is no doubt that not only the
        completion of a good work is from God, but even the very beginning: “He
        who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of
        Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6). This is contrary to the Pelagians, who say
        that the beginning of a good work is from us, but its completion is from
        God: “O Lord, you have wrought for us all our works” (Is. 26:12). But
        lest this seem to take away free will, he says, of ourselves, i.e., on
        our part, and commends divine grace when he says, as coming from us,
        i.e., as though it came from us, rather than God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        87. – The Philosopher also teaches that a man can never do any good
        through his free will without God’s help. The reason is that in the
        things we do it is necessary to seek that for which we do it. But there
        can be no infinite process, for we must come to something which is
        first, e.g., to counsel. Thus, therefore, I do good, because there is in
        me the counsel to do so, and this is from God. Hence, he says that the
        counsel of something good is from something above man, moving him to act
        well; and this is God, who moves men and all things that act to their
        actions; but men are moved in one way, and other things in another. For
        since motion of this kind is something received into the thing moved, it
        is necessary that this be done according to the mode of its nature,
        i.e., of the thing moved. And therefore he moves all things according to
        their natures. Therefore, those things whose nature is to have free will
        and have dominion over their actions, he moves in such a way that they
        act freely, as rational and intellectual creatures. But others not
        freely, but according to the mode of their nature. But although we are
        not sufficient to think anything of ourselves as coming from ourselves,
        yet we have a certain sufficiency, namely that by which we are able to
        will the good, and to begin to believe, and this is from God: “What have
        you that you did not receive?” (1 Cor. 4:7).

        6 He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a
        written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills, but the
        Spirit gives life. 7 Now if the dispensation of death, carved in letters
        on stone, came with such splendor that the Israelites could not look at
        Moses’ face because of its brightness, fading as this was, 8 will not
        the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendor? 9 For
        if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the
        dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. 10 Indeed,
        in this case, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor at
        all, because of the splendor that surpasses it. 11 For if what faded
        away came with splendor, what is permanent must have much more splendor.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        88. – Having commended the ministry of the New Testament, the Apostle
        then commends its ministers. First, he stipulates two things, which
        correspond to the above words. For he had mentioned a gift received from
        God when he said, our competence is from God, and the confidence born of
        this gift when he said, such is the confidence that we have through
        Christ toward God. First, therefore, he determines the things pertaining
        to the gift received; secondly, those pertaining to the confidence born
        of it (v. 12). In regard to the first he does three things: first, he
        discloses the gift received from God, namely, the ministry of the New
        Testament; secondly, he describes the New Testament (v. 6b); thirdly,
        from the dignity of the New Testament he shows the dignity of its
        ministers (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        89. – He says, therefore: I say that our sufficiency is from God who has
        made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant: “Men shall speak of
        you as the ministers of our God” (Is. 61:6). And in this we hold the
        place of angels: “Who make angels your messengers, fire and flame your
        ministers” (Ps. 104:4). But he not only made us ministers, but fit ones.
        For God gives to each being the things through which it can attain to
        the perfection of its nature. Hence, because God constituted ministers
        of the New Testament, he made them fit to exercise this office, unless
        he was impeded on the part of the receivers: “Who is sufficient for
        these things” (2 Cor. 2:16), namely, as are the Apostles instituted by
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        90. – He describes what this New Testament is when he continues, not in
        a written code but in the Spirit. He describes it in regard to two
        things, namely, as to that in which it consists and as to its cause for
        which it has been given: for the written code kills. In regard to the
        first it should be noted that the Apostle speaks profoundly, for it is
        stated in Jeremiah (31:31): “I will make a new covenant with the house
        of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I
        made with their fathers”; and later on (v. 33): “I will put my law
        within them, and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their
        God and they shall be my people.” The Old Testament, therefore, is
        written in a book, later to be sprinkled with blood, as it says in
        Hebrews (9:19): “He took the blood of calves and goats and sprinkled
        both the book itself and all the people, saying: ‘This is the blood of
        the covenant which God commanded you.’” So it is clear that the Old Law
        is a covenant of words, but the New Covenant is a covenant of the Holy
        Spirit, by whom the love of God is poured out in our hearts [Et sic
        patet, quod vetus lex est testamentum litterae. Sed Novum Testamentum
        est testamentum Spiritus Sancti, quo charitas Dei diffunditur in cordis
        nostris], as it says in Rom. 5:5. Consequently, when the Holy Spirit
        produces charity in us, which is the fulness of the Law, it is a New
        Covenant, not in a written code, i.e., not written down, but in the
        Spirit, i.e., through the Spirit who gives life: “The law of the Spirit
        of life” (Rom. 8:2), i.e., life-giving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        91. – The reason why the New Testament was given by the Spirit is
        indicated when he says, for the written code kills, not as a cause but
        as an occasion. For the written Law only gives knowledge of sin: “For
        through the Law comes knowledge of sin” (Rom. 3:20). But as a result of
        merely knowing sin, two things follow. For the Law, although sin is
        known by it, does not repress concupiscence, but is the occasion of
        increasing it, inasmuch as concupiscence is enkindled the more by
        something forbidden. Hence such knowledge kills, when the cause of
        concupiscence has not yet been destroyed. As a result it adds to the
        sin. For it is more grievous to sin against the written and natural law
        than against the natural law only: “But sin, finding opportunity in the
        commandment, wrought in me all kinds of concupiscence” (Rom. 7:8). But
        although it is the occasion of killing inasmuch as it increases
        concupiscence and increases the sin, the Law is not evil, because at
        least it forbids evil; nevertheless, it is imperfect, inasmuch as it
        does not remove the cause. Therefore, the Law without the Spirit
        inwardly impressing the Law on the heart is the occasion of death;
        hence, it was necessary to give the Law of the Spirit, who gives life by
        producing charity in the heart: “It is the Spirit that gives life” (Jn.
        6:63).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        92. – From these, therefore, he shows the dignity of his ministry. He
        does two things in this regard. First, he shows that the ministry of the
        New Testament is preferred to the Old; secondly, that it is not only
        preferred, but that in comparison to the Old Testament, the latter has,
        as it were, nothing of glory (v. 10). In regard to the first, he does
        two things. First, he shows that the ministry of the New Testament is
        preferred to the Old; secondly, he assigns the reason for this (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        93. – In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle argues
        from a statement in Exodus (34:24), where our text says that Moses had
        his face horned, so that the people of Israel could not come near.
        Another version says that his face shone, and this is better. For it
        should not be supposed that he literally had horns, as some depict him,
        but he is described as horned because of the rays which seemed to be
        like horns. He argues from this in the following way: first, by a
        similarity and by arguing from the lesser. For it is obvious that if
        something less has glory, then much more something which is greater. But
        the Old Testament is less than the New: therefore, since the former was
        in glory, so that the Israelites could not look at Moses’ face, it seems
        that the New is much more in glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        94. – That the Old Testament is less than the New he proves in three
        ways. First, from its effect, because the former is a covenant of death,
        but the latter of life, as has been said. In regard to this he says, If
        the dispensation of death, i.e., the Old, which is the occasion of
        death; and this corresponds to what he said, namely, that the written
        code kills, but the Spirit gives life. Secondly, as to the way it was
        delivered, for the Old was delivered written on stone tablets, but the
        New was impressed by the Spirit on human hearts. He suggests this when
        he says, carved in letters, i.e., perfectly formed, on stone, i.e., on
        tablets of stone. This corresponds to his statement, not in a written
        code but in the Spirit. Thirdly, as to perfection: for the glory of the
        Old Testament is without assurance, because the Law brought no one to
        perfection. But in the New there is glory with the hope of a better
        glory, i.e., eternal: “My salvation will be forever” (Is. 51:6). This is
        suggested when he says, fading as this was: “If you receive
        circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you” (Gal. 5:2). He
        states the conclusion when he says, will not the dispensation of the
        Spirit be attended with greater glory? which is plain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        95. – Then he assigns the reason for all these when he says, For if
        there was glory in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of
        justice must far exceed it in glory. This is his reasoning: Glory is
        owed more to justice than to condemnation, but the ministry of the New
        Testament is a ministry of justice, because it justifies by giving life
        within. The ministry of the Old Testament is a ministry of condemnation,
        as being its occasion: the written code kills, but the Spirit gives
        life. Therefore, since the dispensation of condemnation, i.e., the
        ministry of the Old Testament, is the occasional cause of condemnation,
        as has been said, is in glory, which appeared on the face of Moses, it
        is obvious that much more abundant in glory, i.e., gives an abundance of
        glory to its ministers, is the dispensation of justice, i.e., of the New
        Testament, by which the Spirit is given through whom is given justice
        and the fulfillment of the virtues: “The wise shall possess glory”
        (Prov. 3:35).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        96. – It is customary here to compare Moses and Paul; but if the
        Apostle’s words are considered carefully, this is not necessary, because
        ministries not persons are being compared.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        97. – But because the false apostles could say that even though the
        ministry of the New Covenant is greater than that of the Old, it is not
        much greater. Therefore, it is good for us to continue in that ministry,
        which they did, because they observed the ceremonies of the Law along
        with the Gospel. Therefore the Apostle rejects this when he says,
        indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at
        all, because of the glory that surpasses it. In regard to this he does
        two things. First, he shows that the ministry of the New Testament
        exceeds that of the Old beyond all comparison. Secondly, he assigns the
        reason for this (v. 11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        98. – He says, therefore, I have said that the ministry of justice
        abounds in glory to such a degree that the glory of the Old Testament
        should not be called glorious, for what once had glory has come to have
        no glory at all by reason of the glory that surpasses it. This is
        explained in two ways. First, that that glory is nothing in comparison
        to that of the New Testament, because such glory was not conferred on
        all the ministers, but on Moses alone, and it did not shine on Moses
        entirely, but in part, i.e., on his face alone. Therefore, it has come
        to have no glory at all, i.e., should not be glorified because of the
        glory that surpasses it, i.e., in comparison to the excelling glory of
        the New Testament, which abounds in grace, so that men purified by it
        might not see the glory of a man but of God. It is explained in a second
        way by punctuating it thus: that which was glorious in this part has
        come to have no glory: as if to say, for in this part, i.e., in respect
        to this particular nature, that we are servants, has come to have no
        glory, i.e., that was not glorious which shone in the Old Testament: and
        this by reason of the glory that surpasses it, which is in the New,
        because it is the glory of God the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        99. – Then he assigns the cause of this when he says, For if what faded
        away came with glory, what is permanent must have much more glory. His
        reasoning is thus: that which was given to pass away is nothing in
        relation to that which is given to remain always. If, therefore, the Old
        Testament, which is rendered void, is done away with: “But when the
        perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10). For with
        glory the ministry of Moses came, at least with a particular glory. And
        it is obvious that the New Testament remains, because it is begun here
        and completed in heaven: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words
        shall not pass away” (Lk. 21:33). It will be much more in eternal glory,
        in which it will be perfected; it will be, I say, for us who are its
        ministers.

        12 Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, 13 not like Moses, who
        put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not see the end of
        the fading splendor. 14 But their minds were hardened; for to this day,
        when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted,
        because only through Christ is it taken away. 15 Yes, to this day
        whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their minds; 16 but when a man
        turns to the Lord the veil is removed. 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit,
        and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 18 And we all,
        with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed
        into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes
        from the Lord who is the Spirit.

        100. – Having laid down what pertains to commending the gift received
        from God, he now lays down what pertains to commending the confidence
        born of that gift. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
        mentions the confidence born of the gift; secondly, he compares the
        confidence in the Old and in the New Testament (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        101. – He says, therefore, Since we have such a hope, because of what
        has been said to us, namely, of seeing the glory of God: “In this hope
        we were saved” (Rom. 8:24), we are very bold [multa fiducia utimur],
        i.e., we confidently do the things which pertain to the use of this
        ministry, from which our hope grows: “The righteous are bold as a lion”
        (Prov. 28:1); “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord” (Jer. 17:7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        102. – Then as he preferred the one gift to the other, so he prefers the
        confidence [fiducia] of the New Testament to that of the Old (v. 13). In
        regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions a fact about the
        Old Testament; secondly, he explains it (v. 13b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        103. – The fact he proposes is mentioned in Exodus (34:33), where it
        says that when he spoke to the people, Moses veiled his face, because
        the children of Israel could not look upon him because of the splendor
        of his face. Hence he says, not like Moses, who put a veil over his
        face. As if to say: I say that we are very bold, and such as did not
        happen to us as Moses did to them, namely, not revealing his face to the
        people, because the time to reveal the splendor of truth had not yet
        come. Therefore, we have confidence [fiduciam] without the veil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        104. – Then he explains what he had said about the veil, saying, which
        is made void, for that veil was the dimness of the figures, which was
        made void by Christ. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
        mentions the voiding of this veil; secondly, how this voiding still
        prevails among the Jews (v. 14); thirdly, how this has no place among
        the ministers of the New Testament (v. 18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        105. – He says, therefore, that Moses put a veil, namely, of the figure,
        over his face; this veil is made void, i.e., is taken away by Christ,
        namely, by fulfilling in truth what Moses delivered in figure, because
        all things happened to them in a figure. For thus Christ by his death
        removed the veil of the killing of the paschal lamb. Therefore, as soon
        as he gave up his spirit, the veil of the Temple was rent. Likewise by
        sending the Holy Spirit into the hearts of believers so that they might
        understand spiritually what the Jews understood carnally. He removed the
        veil, when he opened their mind to understand the Scriptures (Lk.
        24:45).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        106. – What effect this voiding had on the Jews is shown (v. 14). In
        regard to this he does two things. First, he shows that it was not
        removed from them in the state of unbelief; secondly, he shows that it
        will be removed when they are converted (v. 16). In regard to the he
        does two things: first, he shows why this voiding has no place among the
        Jews; secondly, from this he shows that they still have the veil (v.
        15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        107. – He says, therefore, that it is removed for those who believe, but
        not for the unbelieving Jews. The reason for this is that their minds
        were hardened, i.e., their reasoning power is dull and their senses weak
        and clouded, so that they cannot see the brightness of the divine light,
        i.e., of divine truth, without the veil of figures. The reason for this
        is that they close their eyes so as not to see, because the veil of the
        Temple was rent. Therefore, this is due to their sin of unbelief, and
        not to a weakness in the truth; because with the removal of the veil the
        truth is manifested very clearly to all who open the eyes of their mind
        through faith: “A hardening has come upon part of Israel” (Rom. 11:25);
        “For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see,
        and that those who see may become blind” (Jn. 9:39). For this was
        foretold by Isaiah (6:10): “Make the heart of this people fat, and their
        ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear
        with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be
        healed.” And indeed their minds are so dulled to the truth that to this
        day they do not understand the truth manifested to us. But the same veil
        remains which was in the Old Testament before the veil of the Temple was
        rent, when they read the Old Testament, because they understand it no
        differently than before. For they still rely on figures, so as not to
        reveal the truth, i.e., not understand. Thus they still believe that the
        veil of God is not a figure, but the truth, which namely is lifted as to
        believers through Christ, i.e., in the faith of Christ. But it remains
        in them, because they do not believe that Christ has come.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        108. – Then when he says, Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil
        lies over their minds, he shows how even among the Jews the veil
        remains, as to unbelievers, although it has been removed by Christ. In
        regard to this it should be noted that a veil is said to be put on
        something in two ways: either because it is put on the thing seen, so
        that it cannot be seen; or because it is put on the one seeing, so that
        he may not see. But the veil was put on the Jews of the Old Law in both
        ways. For their eyes have been blinded not to see the truth because of
        their hardness; and the Old Testament had not yet been fulfilled,
        because the truth had not yet come. As a sign of this the veil was on
        Moses’ face and not theirs. But with the coming of Christ the veil was
        removed from the face of Moses, i.e., from the Old Testament, because it
        was not fulfilled: but it has not been removed from their hearts. Hence,
        he says, to this day the veil remains. As if to say: the veil has been
        removed from the believers of the Old Testament, but still when Moses is
        read, i.e., when the Old Testament is explained to them: “For from early
        generations, Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is
        read every sabbath in the synagogues” (Ac. 15:21), the veil, i.e.
        blindness, lies over their hearts: “A hardening has come upon part of
        Israel” (Rom. 11:25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        109. – But when and how that veil shall be removed from them is shown
        when he says, but when a man turns to the Lord the veil is removed.
        First he describes how to remove this veil; secondly, the reason for
        this (v. 17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        110. – He says, therefore, that this veil is still upon them; not that
        the Old Testament is veiled, but because their hearts are veiled.
        Therefore if it is to be removed, nothing remains but that they be
        converted. Hence, he says, but when a man turns, namely, some of them,
        to God through faith in Christ, the veil is removed by their conversion:
        “A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God” (Is.
        10:21); and this is also stated in Romans (9:27). And note that when he
        treated of blindness, he spoke in the plural, saying over their hearts;
        but when he speaks of conversion, he speaks in the singular, saying, but
        when a man turns, to show how easy evil is and how difficult the good,
        as though few will be converted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        111. – But the reason why they are converted and the veil removed in
        this manner is because God wills it. For they could claim that God put
        the veil on them and therefore it cannot be removed. But the Apostle
        shows that it cannot only be removed, but even that it is removed by him
        who is the Lord. Hence, he says, now the Lord is the Spirit. This can be
        understood in two ways. In one way, so that Spirit is taken as the
        subject, as though saying: the Spirit, i.e., the Holy Spirit, namely who
        is the author of the Law, is the Lord, i.e., works by his own free will:
        “The Spirit blows where it wills” (Jn. 3:8); “The Spirit, who apportions
        to each one individually as he wills” (1 Cor. 12:11). And where the
        Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom; as if to say: because the Spirit
        is the Lord, he can give freedom to enable us freely to use the writings
        of the Old Testament without a veil. Therefore, those who do not have
        the Holy Spirit cannot use it freely: “You were called to freedom” (Gal.
        5:13); “Live as free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext
        for evil” (1 Pet. 2:16). It can be understood another way so that by the
        Lord is meant Christ, as though saying: the Lord, i.e., Christ, is
        Spirit, i.e., has spiritual power. Therefore, where the Spirit of the
        Lord is, i.e., the law of Christ spiritually understood, not in a
        written code, but impressed on the heart by faith, there is freedom from
        every obscurity of the veil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        112. – It should be noted that by occasion of these words, namely, where
        the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, and of those found in 1
        Timothy (1:9): “The law is not laid down for the just”, some have
        erroneously said that spiritual men are not bound by the precepts of the
        divine law. But this is false, for God’s precepts are the rule of the
        human will. But there is no man or angel whose will does not need to be
        ruled and directed by divine law. Hence, it is impossible for any man
        not to be subject to God’s precepts. But the statement that “the law is
        not laid down for the just” means that the law was not laid down “for
        the just” who are led by an internal habit to do what the law of God
        commands, but because of the unjust. Nevertheless, this does not mean
        that the just are not bound to it. Similarly, where the Spirit of the
        Lord is there is freedom, is explained thus: the free man is one who
        exists for himself, but the servant exists for the sake of the master.
        Therefore, whoever acts of himself acts freely, but one who is moved by
        another does not act freely. Therefore, one who avoids evils, not
        because they are evil, but because of God’s commandment, is not free.
        But one who avoids evils because they are evils is free. But this is
        done by the Holy Spirit who perfects man inwardly with a good habit, so
        that from love he avoids evil, as if the divine law had commanded.
        Consequently, he is called free, not as though he is not subject to the
        divine law, but because he is inclined by a good habit to do what the
        divine law ordains.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        113. – Then when he says, and we all, with unveiled face, beholding the
        glory of the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree
        of glory to another, he shows how the faithful of Christ are altogether
        free of this veil. He says, therefore: I say that this veil will be
        removed from them, when a person may be converted as we are; not a
        particular one, but we all who are Christ’s faithful: “To you it has
        been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for others
        they are in parables” (Lk. 8:10). With unveiled face, not having a veil
        upon the heart, as they. By face is meant the heart or the mind, because
        just as a person sees bodily with the face, so spiritually with the
        mind: “Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of your law”
        (Ps. 119:18). The glory of the Lord, not of Moses: for glory signifies
        brightness, as Augustine says. But the Jews saw some glory on the face
        of Moses as a result of his speaking with God. But this glory is
        imperfect, because it is not the glory with which God is glorious: and
        this is to know God himself. Or the glory of the Lord, i.e., the Son of
        God: “The glory of a father is a wise son” (Prov. 10:1, Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        114. – Beholding, i.e., speculating, which is not taken from the word
        which means “watch tower” (specula), but from “mirror” (speculum), i.e.,
        knowing the glorious God himself by the mirror of reason, in which there
        is an image of God. We behold him when we rise from a consideration of
        ourselves to some knowledge of God, and we are transformed. For since
        all knowledge involves the knower’s being assimilated to the thing
        known, it is necessary that those who see be in some way transformed
        into God. If they see perfectly, they are perfectly transformed, as the
        blessed in heaven by the union of enjoyment: “When he appears we shall
        be like him” (1 Jn. 3:2); but if we see imperfectly, then we are
        transformed imperfectly, as here by faith: “Now we see in a mirror
        dimly” (1 Cor. 13:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        115. – Therefore he says, into his likeness, that is, as we see, we are
        transformed, I say, from one degree of glory to another. In this he
        distinguishes a triple degree of knowledge in Christ’s disciples. The
        first is from the clarity of natural knowledge to the clarity of the
        knowledge of faith. The second is from the clarity of the knowledge of
        the Old Testament to the clarity of the knowledge of the grace of the
        New Testament. The third is from the clarity of natural knowledge and of
        the Old and New Testaments to the clarity of eternal vision: “Though our
        outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every
        day” (2 Cor. 4:16). But how does this come about? Not by the letter of
        the law, but from the Lord who is the Spirit: “For all who are led by
        the Spirit of God are sons of God” (Rom. 8:14); “Let your good Spirit
        lead me on a level path” (Ps. 143:10).

        1herefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose
        heart. 2 We have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways; we refuse to
        practice cunning or to tamper with God’s word, but by the open statement
        of the truth we would commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the
        sight of God.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        116. – Having shown the dignity of the New Testament ministry, the
        Apostle now discusses the exercise of this ministry. In regard to this
        he does two things. First, he shows that the exercise of this ministry
        should consist in doing good; secondly it should consist also in
        enduring evils patiently (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two
        things. First, he lays down the use of this ministry; secondly, he
        excludes an objection (v. 3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        117. – He says, therefore: because this ministry is of such great
        dignity in itself and in its ministers, therefore having this ministry,
        i.e., this dignity of administering spiritual things: “This is how one
        should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of
        God” (1 Cor. 4:1); “Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I
        magnify my ministry” (Rom. 11:13); having it, I say, not from ourselves
        or from our merits, but by the mercy of God which we have obtained from
        God for this: “I received mercy” (1 Tim. 1:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        118. – Then when he says, we do not lose heart, he describes the
        exercise of this ministry, which should be engaged in doing good; and
        this in regard to two things: first, as to avoiding evil; secondly, as
        to doing good (v. 2b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        119. – He teaches us to avoid evil both in conduct and in doctrine, when
        we exercise this ministry. As to conduct in two ways, namely in our
        actions and in our intentions. But if a person avoids doing evil and has
        a good intention, he avoids evil completely. But evil is avoided in our
        activity by enduring evils patiently in adversity. Hence, he says, we do
        not lose heart by impatience: “Let us not grow weary in well-doing”
        (Gal. 6:9); “For when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Cor. 12:10). It is
        also avoided in prosperity by making moderate use of the things that are
        going well for us. Hence he says, we have renounced disgraceful,
        underhanded ways, i.e., we remove from ourselves whatever makes a man
        base and dishonorable, namely, things unclean and foul and not only open
        but even hidden: “Therefore put away all filthiness” (Jas. 1:21); “For
        it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret” (Eph.
        5:12). Evil conduct is avoided in our intention, if it is a right
        intention. In regard to this he says, we refuse to practice cunning,
        i.e., fraud and pretense and hypocrisy. That is what the false apostles
        do, who pretend one thing outwardly, but do something else inwardly in
        the heart: “Dissemblers and crafty men provoke the wrath of God” (Job
        36:13, Vulgate). Evil is avoided in doctrine when the Lord’s word is
        proposed in the proper way. In regard to this he says, or to tamper with
        God’s word. This is explained in two ways. First, not mixing false
        doctrine with the doctrine of Christ, as the false apostles do when they
        teach that the ceremonies of the Law must be observed along with the
        Gospel. Secondly, not preaching for gain and for one’s own glory. The
        first of these is a wolf and the second a hireling, but one who preaches
        the truth and for the glory of God is a shepherd. Hence Augustine says:
        “The shepherd should be loved and the wolf avoided, but the hireling
        must be tolerated for the present.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        120. – But because perfect justice requires more than avoiding evil, but
        doing good, he says something about doing good in the exercise of this
        ministry. The first good is against evil teachings; the second against
        evil conduct; the third against an evil intention. Against evil
        teaching, which must be avoided, they perform the good of manifesting
        the truth. In regard to this he says, by the open statement of the
        truth: as if to say, we do not lose heart but, avoiding evil, we walk
        and act in the manifestation of the truth, i.e., we manifest the pure
        truth: “For this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the
        truth” (Jn. 18:37); “Those who show me forth shall have everlasting
        life” (Sir. 24:31, Vulgate). Against evil conduct they perform good
        works. In regard to this he says, we would commend ourselves to every
        man’s conscience. We do not do this by saying good things about
        ourselves, because it is not easy to believe a person who recommends
        himself, but by doing good, because we do such works, so that by the
        works themselves we make ourselves commendable to every man’s
        conscience: “Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles” (1 Pet. 2:12).
        Against an evil intention we do good by making ourselves commendable not
        only to every man’s conscience, but even in the sight of God, who sees
        the heart.: “For it is not the man who commends himself that is
        accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends” (2 Cor. 10:18); “Providing
        good things not only before God but before all men” (Rom. 12:17,
        Vulgate).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        121. – According to Augustine in a Gloss, the Apostle fulfills God’s
        commandment in this: “Let your light so shine before men, that they may
        see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven”
        (Matt. 5:16); “Beware of practicing your piety before men” (Matt. 6:1):
        the first by saying, we would commend ourselves to every man’s
        conscience; but the second by saying, in the sight of God: “For he is
        not a real Jew who is one outwardly” (Rom. 2:28). Or this whole passage
        can be read in the following manner without interrupting the text:
        Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose
        heart, namely in doing good. But we have renounced disgraceful,
        underhanded ways. Furthermore by the open statement of the truth,
        keeping the same method of explanation as already given.

        3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are
        perishing. 4 In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds
        of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of
        the glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God. 5 For what we preach is
        not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants
        for Jesus’ sake. 6 For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of
        darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the
        knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        122. – Here the Apostle answers a tacit objection. For someone could say
        to him: you say that you do not grow faint in manifesting the truth of
        Christ. But this does not seem true, because many people contradict you.
        To this question, therefore, he responds. And in regard to it he does
        two things: first, he responds to this question; secondly, he removes a
        doubt which seems to follow from his answer (v. 5). In regard to the
        first he does three things. First, he shows from whom Christ’s truth is
        hidden; secondly, the reason for this hiding (v. 4); thirdly, he shows
        that it is not due to a deficiency in the truth of the Gospel that it is
        hidden (v. 4b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        123. – He says therefore: I have said that we do not faint in
        manifesting the truth; but even if our gospel, which we preach, is
        veiled, it is not veiled from all, but it is veiled only to those who
        are perishing, namely, who offer an obstacle to its manifestation to
        them: “For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing,
        but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        124. – The cause of this concealment is not on the part of the Gospel,
        but on account of their own guilt and malice; and this is what he adds:
        in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
        unbelievers. This can be explained in three ways: in one way so that the
        god of this world, i.e. God, who is the Lord of this world and of all
        things by creation and nature: “The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness
        thereof, the world and those who dwell therein” (Ps. 24:1), has blinded
        the minds of the unbelievers, not by producing malice, but by the merit,
        or rather demerit of preceding sins, by withdrawing his grace: “Make the
        heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
        lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
        with their hearts, and turn and be healed” (Is. 6:10). Therefore he
        hints at their preceding sins when he says, of unbelievers, as though
        their unbelief is the cause of this blindness. In a second way, so that
        the god of this world, i.e., the devil, who is called the god of this
        world, i.e., of those who live in a worldly manner, not by reason of
        creation but by imitation, because worldly persons imitate him: “They
        follow him that are on his side” (Wis. 2:25, Vulgate). Here he blinds
        them by suggesting, by attracting and by inclining to sins. And so, when
        they are already in sin, they work in the darkness of sin, lest they
        see: “Darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God”
        (Eph. 4:18). In the third way thus: God has the nature of the ultimate
        end and fulfillment of the desires of every creature. Hence, whatever a
        person assigns to himself as an ultimate end in which his desire rests,
        can be called his god. Hence, when you have pleasure as end, pleasure is
        called your god, and the same for pleasures of the flesh and for honors.
        Then it is explained so that the god of this world, i.e., that which men
        living in a worldly way set up as their end, say pleasure or riches and
        the like. And God blinds their minds, inasmuch as he prevents them from
        seeing the light of grace here, and the light of glory in the future:
        “Fire”, namely of concupiscence, “has fallen on them, and they shall not
        see the sun” (Ps. 57:9, Vulgate). Thus, therefore, the blindness of
        unbelievers is not on the part of the Gospel, but from the sin of
        unbelievers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        125. – Therefore, he adds, to keep them from seeing the light of the
        gospel of the glory of Christ. Here it should be noted that God the
        Father is the source of all light: “God is light and in him is no
        darkness at all” (1 Jn. 1:5). From this fountain of light is derived the
        image of this light, namely the Son, the Word of God: “He reflects the
        glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature” (Heb. 1:3).
        Therefore, this brightness of glory and image of the fountain of light
        took our flesh and accomplished many glorious and divine works in this
        world. The disclosing of this light is the Gospel. Hence, the Gospel is
        also called the knowledge of the glory of Christ, which knowledge has
        the power to enlighten: “Wisdom is radiant and unfading” (Wis. 6:12). As
        far as it is concerned, it shines upon all and enlightens all. But those
        who place an obstacle are not enlightened. And this is what he says: the
        god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them
        from seeing, namely, with their unbelieving minds, the light of the
        gospel, which enlightens because it is the glory of Christ, i.e. his
        brightness: “We have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the
        Father” (Jn. 1:14). This glory is Christ’s, inasmuch as he is the
        likeness [image] of God: “He is the image of the invisible God” (Col.
        1:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        126. – Note, according to a Gloss, that Christ is the most perfect image
        of God. For in order that something be perfectly an image of something,
        three things are necessary, and these three are perfectly in Christ.
        First, a likeness; second, origin; third, perfect equality. For if there
        is unlikeness between the image and that of which it is the image, and
        one does not arise from the other, or even if there is not perfect
        equality according to the same nature, then the notion of perfect image
        would not be there. For the likeness of a king on a coin is not called a
        perfect image of the king, because equality according to the same nature
        is lacking; but the likeness of a king in his son is called a perfect
        image of the king, because it possesses the three marks mentioned
        Therefore, since those three are present in Christ, the Son of God,
        because namely he is similar to the Father, arises from the Father and
        is equal to the Father, he is in the highest degree and perfectly called
        the image of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        127. – Then when he says, For what we preach is not ourselves, the
        Apostle settles a doubt. For some could say to the Apostle, contrary to
        what was said here: above you said that your Gospel was hidden; now you
        say that the Gospel of Christ enlightens. Therefore, if it is granted
        that the Gospel of Christ enlightens, it cannot follow that your Gospel
        is hidden. To settle this he does two things. First he shows that his
        own Gospel and Christ’s are the same; secondly, he shows how it is that
        his own Gospel enlightens (v. 6)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        128. – He says, therefore: I say that the manifestation of the
        brightness of Christ is the Gospel of Christ and our Gospel. It is ours
        as preached by us; it is Christ’s truly as the one preached in the
        Gospel. Hence it is that what we preach is not ourselves, i.e., we do
        not commend ourselves nor for ourselves, i.e., we do not use our
        preaching for our praise or gain, but we refer it all to Christ and his
        praise: “We preach Christ crucified” (1 Cor. 1:23); “That I may tell of
        all your works,” not mine, “in the gates of the daughter of Zion” (Ps.
        73:28). But Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for
        Jesus’ sake. As if to say: we preach Jesus as Lord, but ourselves as
        servants, the reason being that we principally seek the praise of Christ
        and not our own. For a servant is one who exists for the profit of the
        master. That is why a minister of the Church, who does not seek the
        honor of God and the welfare of his subjects, is not a true ruler, but a
        tyrant. For whoever rules well should be as a servant seeking the honor
        and profit of his subjects: “The elder shall serve the younger” (Gen.
        25:23); “For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave
        to all” (1 Cor. 9:19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        129. – Then when he says, For it is the God who said, he shows the
        source of his Gospel’s power to enlighten. Here we should note the order
        of the Apostle’s procedure. It is this: at one time, namely, before
        being converted to Christ, we were darkness, just as you and the others,
        upon whom the brightness of Christ’s glory did not shine. But now, after
        Christ has called us to himself by his grace, that darkness has been
        taken away from us, and now the power of the glory of Christ’s
        brightness shines in us, and it shines on us in such a way that not only
        are we enlightened so that we can see, but we enlighten others.
        Therefore, from the spiritual grace and abundant splendor of the
        brightness of the glory of Christ in us, our Gospel has the power to
        enlighten.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        130. – And this is what he says: I say that our Gospel enlightens, for
        it is the God who said, i.e., who made by a single command, let light
        shine out of darkness, by separating the elements, when he enlightened
        the dark chaos by the light he made: “He said, ‘let there be light’”
        (Gen. 1:3): “I made an unfailing light to rise in the heavens” (Sir
        24:6). He, I say, has shone in our hearts, i.e., in our minds,
        previously darkened by the absence of the light of grace and by the
        obscurity of sin: “To enlighten those that sit in darkness and in the
        shadow of death” (Lk. 1:79). He has shone, I say, not only to enlighten
        us, but to give the light, i.e., that we might enlighten others: “To me,
        though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given”
        (Eph. 3:8); “You are the light of the world” (Matt. 5:4). To give the
        light, I say, of the knowledge, i.e., that we make others know of the
        glory of God, i.e., of the clear vision of God, in the face of Christ. A
        Gloss: i.e., “through Jesus Christ”, who is the face of the Father,
        because without him the Father is not known. But it is said better thus:
        to illumine the holy brightness of God, which indeed shines in the face
        of Jesus Christ, i.e., so that by that glory and brightness Jesus Christ
        may be known. As if to say: in summary, God has shone upon us to
        enlighten us, so that Jesus Christ may be known and preached among the
        Gentiles.

        131. – Above, he discussed the use of the ministry of the New Testament
        in regard to doing good; here he discusses its use in regard to enduring
        evil. In regard to this he does two things: first, he points to the
        endurance of the evils they suffered; secondly, he explains this (v.
        11). In regard to the first he does three things: first, he shows the
        reason why they are exposed to tribulations by God; secondly, he shows
        that they should act patiently under these tribulations (v. 8); thirdly,
        he gives the reason for this patience (v. 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        132. – He says, therefore: God has shone on our minds to give light to
        others, and this light is our greatest treasure: “It is an unfailing
        treasure for men” (Wis. 7:14); “Abundance of salvation, wisdom and
        knowledge” (Is. 33:6). But we do not have that greatest treasure in a
        precious place, but in a lowly fragile thing, in order that its power
        may be attributed to God. Hence, he says, We have this treasure, i.e.,
        that light by which we enlighten others, in earthen vessels, i.e., in
        our frail and lowly body: “For he knows our frame; he remembers that we
        are dust” (Ps. 103:14); “Like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you
        in my hand, O house of Israel” (Jer. 18:6); “Yet, O Lord, you are our
        Father, we are the clay” (Is. 64:8). Therefore we have it in earthen
        vessels to show that the transcendent power of that light belongs to
        God, i.e., attributed to God, and not believed to belong to us. For if
        we were rich or powerful or noble according to the flesh, any great good
        we did would be attributed not to God but to ourselves. But now, because
        we are poor and contemptible, such excellence is attributed to God and
        not to ourselves. Therefore, God wants us to be held in contempt and to
        be exposed to tribulations: “Lest they should say, ‘Our hand is
        triumphant, the Lord has not wrought all this’” (Deut. 32:27); “That no
        human being might boast in the presence of God” (1 Cor. 1:29); “You sent
        them as your forerunners not to speak” (Wis. 12:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        133. – Then when he says, we are afflicted in every way, he shows their
        patience in the things they suffer. In regard to this he does two
        things: first, he points out the evils they suffer in general; secondly,
        he mentions them in particular (v. 8b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        134. – He says, therefore: truly we have this treasure in earthen
        vessels, because we are afflicted in every way. As if to say: no type of
        tribulation has missed us: “Through many tribulations we must enter the
        kingdom of God” (Ac. 14:22). Nor is this strange, for it says in Luke
        (24:26): “Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these
        things and enter into his glory?” And although we suffer in this way, we
        are not crushed. He speaks as a traveler who becomes distressed, when he
        cannot find a way out of a narrow place. As if to say: men who trust
        only in the world are distressed, if they are troubled on all sides by
        the world, because no way of relief is open to them, since they trust
        only in the world. But we, although we are troubled in the world, yet
        because we trust in God and hope in Christ, escape by the help of God.
        That is why we are not distressed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        135. – Then when he says, perplexed, but not driven to despair, he lists
        the tribulations in particular. Now there are four things by which men
        are wont to be troubled; and the apostles were also troubled by them,
        namely, by external things, by the disquiet of their state, by injury to
        their reputation, and by affliction of their body. Therefore, in regard
        to the first he says, we are perplexed, i.e., impoverished. As if to
        say: we are so poor that we lack necessities: “To the present hour we
        hunger and thirst” (1 Cor. 4:11). But we are not driven to despair,
        i.e., abandoned by God, who is our treasure. For riches are no sought
        for their own sake, but for a sufficiency of life. Hence, men who live
        without God’s help and without hope, are destitute, if they lack riches.
        But those who trust and hope in God alone, no matter how perplexed they
        be, are not destitute: “As having nothing and possessing everything” (2
        Cor. 6:10). But this is not all, for along with this we are disquieted:
        persecuted, namely, from place to place: “When they persecute you in one
        town, flee to the next” (Matt. 10:23), but not forsaken by God, because
        he offers help: “I will never fail you nor forsake you” (Heb. 13:5):
        “You, O Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you” (Ps. 9:10). Along
        with this we are injured in our reputation, because we are humiliated,
        i.e., scorned and regarded as nothing: “The hour is coming when whoever
        kills you will think he is offering service to God” (Jn. 16:2); “Blessed
        are you when men hate you” (Lk. 6:22). But because when a man is scorned
        and there is reason for it, the scorned one is usually ashamed. But when
        there is not cause, he is not ashamed. And there was no reason for their
        being scorned, hence he continues, but not ashamed. As if to say: since
        there is no reason, we do not care: “In you, O Lord, have I hoped; let
        me never be put to shame” (Ps. 31:2). But as though these were trifles,
        he adds to the amount of tribulation, saying: struck down into the
        dangers of death, but not destroyed, i.e., we do not cease doing good;
        or we are not destroyed because God sustains us: “We have become, and
        are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things” (1
        Cor. 4:13); “When you shall think yourself consumed, you shall rise as
        the daystar” (Job 11:17, Vulgate); “We are accounted as sheep for the
        slaughter” (Ps. 44:22).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        136. – Then when he says, always carrying in the body the death of
        Jesus, he gives the reason for this patience. Here it should be noted
        that in Christ the process was this: having from the beginning of his
        conception a flesh that could suffer, he both suffered and died, yet
        within he was leading a spiritual life. But after the resurrection that
        spiritual and glorious life flowed into the body, so that his body
        became glorious and immortal, because “Christ being raised from the dead
        will never die again” (Rom. 6:9). Hence we can think of two states in
        the body of Christ, namely, of death and of glory. Hence, he says that
        we endure the perils of death and suffering patiently, in order to
        attain to the glorious life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        137. – And this is what he says: always carrying, i.e., in all things
        and everywhere, the death of Jesus, i.e., for Jesus, or in the likeness
        of Jesus’ death: “I bear on my body the marks of Jesus” (Gal. 6:19),
        because we have suffered for the truth, as Jesus did. In our body, not
        only in our mind: “For your sake we are slain all the day long” (Ps.
        44:23). That the life of Jesus, i.e., the life of grace which Jesus
        gives, or the life of glory which Jesus reached by his sufferings: “Was
        it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter
        into his glory?” (Lk. 24:26), may also be manifested, i.e., be evident
        even to enemies. He says therefore, in the future, namely, in the
        resurrection, or even now the life of grace, in our bodies, and not only
        in our souls: “When they had broken the wine jars, the lamps appeared”
        (cf. Jdg. 7:20). Therefore Ambrose says: “They did not fear to die on
        account of the promised resurrection.” Bearing about, i.e., carrying it
        about and enduring, because wherever we go, we suffer and do not give
        up. And this so that the life of Jesus, which is now hidden in our
        hearts, may be manifested in our bodies, namely, when “He will change
        our lowly body to be like his glorious body” (Phil. 3:21); “You have
        died and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3); “If we die
        with him, we shall also live with him” (2 Tim. 2:11).

        11 For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus’
        sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
        12 So death is at work in us, but life in you. 13 Since we have the same
        spirit of faith as he had who wrote, “I believed, and so I spoke,” we
        too believe, and so we speak, 14 knowing that he who raised the Lord
        Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his
        presence. 15 For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to
        more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.

        138. – Having mentioned the patience of the apostles in the midst of
        evils, and revealed the cause of their patience, the Apostle now
        explains them. First, he explains what he said about the hope of glory;
        secondly, what he said about his own patience (v. 16). In regard to the
        first he does two things. First, he shows the hope of glory that he has;
        secondly, he shows the source of this hope (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        139. – In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows how
        he bears the mortification of Jesus in his body; secondly, how he bears
        the life of Jesus (v. 11b); thirdly, what he and others have obtained
        from this (v. 12). He says therefore: I say that we bear the death of
        Jesus in our bodies; not that we might die, but because while we live
        with bodily life or powers, we are always being given up to death or
        dangers of death; and this for Jesus’ sake: “We are accounted as sheep
        for the slaughter” (Ps. 44:22). But how we carry the life of Jesus in
        our body is explained when he says, so that the immortal and
        incorruptible life of Jesus may be manifested in our now mortal flesh,
        so that our mortal flesh may put on immortality at the resurrection:
        “This mortal nature must put on immortality” (1 Cor. 15:53). What
        results from this is mentioned when he continues, so death is at work,
        i.e., exercises its sway, in us, but life, namely, the present one,
        works in you, because you live in prosperity: “We are fools for Christ’s
        sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong” (1
        Cor. 4:10). And death works in us a great good, namely, the attainment
        of spiritual life: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of
        his saints” (Ps. 116:15). But the earthly life that you love works in
        you a great evil, namely, eternal death: “The wage of the righteous
        leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin” (Prov. 10:16): “He who
        loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will
        keep it for eternal life” (Jn. 12:25). Or another way: there were two
        things in Christ, namely, bodily death and spiritual life. He says
        therefore, so death is at work in us. As if to say: not only does
        spiritual life work in us, inasmuch as we imitate him spiritually, but
        death is at work, i.e., because of the hope of the resurrection and for
        the love of Christ, the marks of Christ’s death appear in us, inasmuch
        as we are exposed to the sufferings of death: “For your sake we are
        slain all the day long” (Ps. 44:22). But in you, only the life of Christ
        works, through which faith and the spiritual life are planted in you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        140. – Then (v. 13) the Apostle shows how he acquired this hope of
        certainty. In regard to this he does two things. First, he states the
        cause of the certainty; secondly, he concludes to the certainty itself
        (v. 14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        141. – Now the cause of this certainty is the Spirit instilling faith
        into their hearts. First, therefore, he mentions this cause; secondly,
        he explains it with an example (v. 13b). He says therefore: the reason
        we hope and do not faint is that we have the same spirit of faith which
        the ancients had, because although the times have changed, the Spirit
        and the faith have not changed, except that they believed that the
        Christ would come and suffer, whereas we believe that he has already
        come and suffered. And this Spirit is the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit
        of faith: “All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who
        apportions to each one individually as he wills” (1 Cor. 12:11). Having,
        therefore, this Spirit that the ancients had, we do the same things as
        they did and we believe. But what they did is described in Ps. 116:20,
        “I have believed”, namely, God perfectly. And this is what the ancients
        did: “And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not
        receive what was promised” (Heb. 11:39). And so, namely, for believing,
        I spoke, i.e., I confessed the faith: “For man believes with his heart
        and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved”
        (Rom. 10:10). But we do this because, since we believe, we speak and
        confess the faith and preach: “We cannot but speak of what we have seen
        and heard” (Ac. 4:20). Therefore the Holy Spirit is the cause of this
        certitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        142. – Finally, therefore, he reaches the intended conclusion, namely,
        the certitude itself. First, in regard to his own salvation; secondly,
        in regard to the salvation of others (v. 14b). He says therefore,
        knowing, i.e., having certain knowledge, that he who raised Jesus, i.e.,
        God the Father or the entire Trinity, will raise us also with Jesus,
        namely, to put on the same glory as Jesus, because since we are his
        members, we should be with the head: “Where I am, there shall my servant
        be also” (Jn. 12:26); “He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will
        give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in
        you” (Rom. 8:11). And I am certain not only of our salvation but of
        yours also, because he will bring us with you, i.e., we will be
        together. For just as we are members of Christ, so you are also through
        us: “And so we shall always be with the Lord” (1 Th. 4:17); “Wherever
        the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together” (Matt. 24:28).
        Therefore he says, with you, to urge them to good, inasmuch as he shows
        that they are not inferiors but equals.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        143. – And well can I say this with certainty, because all things are
        for your benefit. For all things, the sufferings we endure, the graces
        we receive from God, are for your sake, namely, that you be instructed
        by our example. And this, therefore, so that as grace extends from us,
        in you to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving to the glory
        of God, i.e., that many may thank God for so great a favor: “Always and
        for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God
        the Father” (Eph. 5:20).

        16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our
        inner nature is being renewed every day. 17 For this slight momentary
        affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
        comparison, 18 because we look not to the things that are seen but to
        the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient,
        but the things that are unseen are eternal.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        144. – Having mentioned the patience which the Apostle showed in
        tribulations and manifested the reward they expected, he then treats of
        the cause of patience and the mode or reason for patience. In regard to
        this he does three things. First, he hints at the patience of the
        saints; secondly, the cause of patience (v. 16b); thirdly, the reward of
        patience (v. 17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        145. – In regard to the first he intends to show that the patience of
        the saints is unconquerable. Hence, he says, so, i.e., because we know
        that he who raised Jesus from the dead will raise us and place us with
        you; therefore we do not lose heart, namely, in our tribulations, i.e.,
        we are reduced to the state in which we cannot bear and endure more for
        Christ. For to lose heart is the same as not being able to bear: “I was
        wearied, not being able to bear it” (Jer. 20:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        146. – But the reason why we do not fail is that although we fail as to
        the outward man, we are always renewed as to the inward man. Hence, he
        says, though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being
        renewed every day. Here it should be noted that by occasion of these
        words a certain heretic, Tertullian by name, said that the rational
        soul, which is in the body of a man, has a bodily shape and bodily
        members, just as the body has; and this is called the inward man. This,
        of course, is false. Hence, to understand the passage, it must be known
        that even according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 9.9, and
        according to the way we speak, each thing is said to be that which is
        most important in it. For example, the most important thing in the city
        is the power and the council, so that whatever the power and council do,
        the city is said to do. Now something can be judged the most important
        thing in man either in truth or according to appearance. In truth the
        most important thing in man is the mind. Hence, according to the
        judgment of spiritual men, the mind is called the inward man. But
        according to appearance, the most important thing is the outward body
        with its senses. Hence, according to the judgment of those who consider
        only bodily and sense-perceptible things and savor earthly things, and
        whose god is the belly, the body with the sense is called the outward
        man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        147. – Therefore, it is according to this manner that the Apostle is
        speaking here when he says, though our outer nature, i.e., the body with
        its sentient nature, is wasting away, in tribulations, fasts,
        abstinences and watchings: “Our old self was crucified with him” (Rom.
        6:6); “Rottenness enters into my bones” (Hab. 3:16), yes this man, who
        is inner, namely, the mind or reason strengthened with the shield of
        faith, is being renewed. This should be understood in the following way:
        oldness is the road to corruption: “And what is becoming obsolete and
        growing old is ready to vanish away” (Heb. 8:13). But human nature was
        established in wholeness, and if it had continued in that wholeness, it
        would have always been new. But through sin it began to be corrupted. As
        a result, whatever followed, such as ignorance, difficulty in doing
        good, inclination to evil, punishment, and so on, all pertain to
        oldness. Therefore, when such a human nature gets rid of the results of
        sin, it is said to be renewed. Such riddance begins in the saints here,
        but is perfectly completed in heaven. For here the oldness of sin is put
        off; for the spirit removes the oldness of sin and is subjected to the
        newness of justice. Here the intellect removes errors and assumes the
        newness of truth. It is according to this that the inner man, namely,
        the soul, is renewed: “Be renewed in the spirit of your minds” (Eph.
        4:23). But in heaven, even the oldness of punishment is removed. Hence,
        there will be a complete renewal there: “Your youth is renewed like the
        eagle’s” (Ps. 103:5). But because the saints advance daily in purity of
        conscience and knowledge of divine things, he says, every day:
        “Ascending in his heart” (Ps. 84:7, Vulgate). Consequently, patience is
        unconquerable, because it is renewed from day to day.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        148. – The third point, namely, the cause of this patience, is
        recognition of a reward. This recognition is most efficacious, because,
        according to Gregory, it lessens the force of a scourge. And this is
        what he says: For this [present], slight momentary affliction is
        preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison. As if
        to say: the tribulations we suffer here are nothing, if we look to the
        glory we obtain from them. Hence, he compares the condition of the
        saints in this life to the condition of those in heaven and mentions
        five things in each state that correspond.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        149. – First, the condition of the present life in the saints is of
        itself slight and, as it were, imperceptible. Hence, he says, this,
        i.e., the least: “For a brief moment I forsook you” (Is. 54:7). Likewise
        it is transitory; hence he says, present, i.e., in this life, which is
        one of affliction and toil: “The life of man is warfare” (Job 7:1,
        Vulgate). Likewise it lasts a short time; hence he says, momentary: “For
        a moment I hid my face from you” (Is. 54:8). For the whole time of this
        present life compared to eternity is only momentary. Likewise it is
        light; hence he says, slight. For although he said above (1:8): “We were
        crushed,” because the body is heavy, yet it is very light to a spirit on
        fire with charity. Hence Augustine says: “All that is heavy and huge
        love makes easy and almost nothing.” Likewise it is penal; hence he
        says, [of our] affliction: “I will bear the indignation of the Lord
        because I have sinned against him” (Mic. 7:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        150. – But as to the state of happiness, he lays down five things,
        because in contrast to what is this, he places beyond all measure: “I
        consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth
        comparing to the glory that is to be revealed to us” (Rom. 8:18). But on
        the other hand: “He will give to each one according to his works” (Matt.
        16:27). Therefore it will not be beyond all measure. I answer that the
        word “according” does not denote an equality of amount, as though a
        person will be rewarded so much for so much merit, but an equality of
        proportion, so that one who merits more will receive more reward.
        Likewise, against that which is in the present he places exceedingly,
        i.e., in an excellent state without disturbance: “I will make you ride
        upon the heights of the earth” (Is. 58:14). Against that which is
        momentary, he places eternal: “Everlasting joy shall be upon their
        heads” (Is. 35:10). Against that which is light he places a weight. He
        says, weight for two reasons: first, because a weight inclines and draws
        to its motion all things under it. In the same way eternal glory will be
        so great that it will make the whole man glorious in soul and in body.
        There will be nothing in man that does not follow the impulse of glory.
        Or it is called weight, because it is precious, for only precious things
        are weighed. Against that which is called tribulation he places of
        glory. Or of glory can be common to the other four, which are said of
        the state of glory, so that of tribulation is common to the four which
        are said of the present life. It is preparing, namely, above the
        tribulations we suffer, for these are the cause and merit for which God
        confers that glory on us. And so the patience of the saints is
        unconquerable, their reward ineffable, and the recompense of their
        reward right and delightful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        151. – Hence he says, because we look not to the things that are seen
        but to the things that are unseen. As if to say: although the things we
        hope for are still to come, and in the meantime our body is corrupted,
        nevertheless, we are renewed, because we do not pay attention to those
        temporal things, but to eternal. And this is what he says: it works in
        us a weight of glory. In us, I say, not looking, i.e., not paying
        attention, to the things that are seen, i.e., earthly things, but to the
        things that are unseen, namely, heavenly things: “Forgetting what lies
        behind and straining forward to what lies ahead” (Phil. 3:13); “Eye has
        not seen nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, God has prepared
        for those who love him” (1 Cor. 2:9). And why do we look on heavenly
        things? Because the things that are seen, i.e., earthly things, are
        transient and temporal, but the things that are unseen, namely, heavenly
        things, are eternal: “My salvation will be forever” (Is. 51:6).

        152. – After commending the ministry of the New Testament, both as to
        its dignity and its use, the Apostle now commends it as to its reward.
        For although he had already said something about the reward, it was
        partial and incomplete; so now he deals with it at greater length. In
        regard to this he does three things: first, he treats of the reward;
        secondly, of the preparation for and reception of the reward (v. 9);
        thirdly, the cause of each, namely, of the preparation and of the reward
        that is expected (v. 18). In regard to the first he does two things:
        first, he mentions the reward expected; secondly, he expresses a desire
        for the expected reward (v. 2)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        153. – Since the awaited reward is inestimable, namely, of heavenly
        glory, he says, For we know. As if to say according to a Gloss
        [Lombard]: indeed he works in us a weight of glory, because this glory
        will be not only in our souls, but in our bodies. For, i.e., because we
        know, i.e., are certain, because we already have it in hope, that if our
        earthly tent, i.e., the body. For as has been said, man is called a
        mind, since that is the most important thing in man. Now this mind is to
        the body as a man is to a house. For just as the man living in a house
        is not destroyed, when the house is destroyed, but he continues to
        exist, so when the body is destroyed, the mind, i.e., the rational soul,
        is not destroyed, but continues to exist. The body, therefore, is called
        the earthly tent we live in: “Those who dwell in houses of clay, whose
        foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth” (Job 4:19).
        Is Destroyed, i.e., dissolved. We know, I say, we have a building from
        God, i.e., prepared by God; a building, I say, a house not made with
        hands, i.e., not a work of man or of nature, but an incorruptible body,
        which we shall assume. It is not made with hands, because
        incorruptibility in our bodies is the result of a divine action alone:
        “He will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body” (Phil.
        3:21). Eternal in the heavens, i.e., a house prepared for us from all
        eternity: “A tabernacle that shall never be destroyed in heaven” (Is.
        33:20, Vulgate); “Your reward shall be great in heaven” (Matt. 5:12).
        This exchange, namely, to get a heavenly home for an earthly one, is
        what Job desired: “All the days of my service I would wait, till my
        release should come” (Job 14:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        154. – The explanation is based on a Gloss, but it does not agree with
        the Apostle’s meaning, nor with what preceded and what follows. For when
        he is dealing with one continuous subject, he does not interject
        another. Therefore, let us see what the Apostle really means, for he
        wants to show that the saints are reasonable in enduring the
        tribulations by which the present life is destroyed, because this
        results in obtaining glory at once, and not a glorified body, as the
        Gloss says. Therefore he says: the reason we endure these things is that
        we know, i.e., we hold it as certain, that if the earthly tent we live
        in, i.e., the body, is destroyed, i.e., corrupted by death, we have at
        once, not in hope but in reality, a better house, namely, a building, a
        house not made with hands, i.e., heavenly glory, not a glorified body.
        Of this house it says in John (14:2): “In my Father’s house are many
        rooms.” This house is from God, not made with hands, because eternal
        glory is God himself: “Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to
        save me” (Ps. 31:2), and eternal in the literal sense, because it is the
        eternal God. In the heavens, i.e., on high, because as soon as the body
        is dead, the holy soul obtains this glory, not in hope but in reality.
        For thus even before the body is dissolved, we have this home in hope.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        155. – Thus, the reward of the saints is wonderful and desirable,
        because it is heavenly glory. Hence, he links the desire of the saints
        with this reward, saying: Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our
        heavenly dwelling. Here he does three things. First, he expresses the
        desire of grace for its reward; secondly, he shows that the desire of
        grace is retarded by the desire of nature (v. 4); thirdly, he shows that
        the desire of grace overcomes the desire of nature (v. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        156. – The desire of grace is fervent: Here indeed we groan, and long to
        put on our heavenly dwelling. As if to say: this is the real proof that
        we have a house not made with hands, because if the desire of nature is
        not in vain, much less is the desire of grace in vain. Therefore, since
        we have a most fervent desire of grace for heavenly glory, it is
        impossible for it to be in vain; and this is what he says, we groan,
        i.e., groaning we desire, namely with our soul’s desire that we are
        delayed: “Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech” (Ps. 120:5). We groan, I
        say, and long to put on our dwelling, i.e., the enjoyment of glory,
        which is from heaven, i.e., heavenly. It is called a dwelling because
        the saints dwell in that glory as their place of consolation: “Enter
        into the joy of the Lord” (Matt. 25:21). In saying, to put on, he is
        stating that the heavenly home of which he spoke above is not something
        separated from man, but something inhering in him. For a man is not said
        to put on a house, but clothes, but he inhabits a house. In this way he
        shows that the desire is for something that inheres, because it is put
        on, and something which contains and exceeds because it is inhabited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        157. – But because he did not merely say, “put on” (indui), but “put on
        over” (superindui), he gives the reason for this, when he says, so that
        by putting it on we may not be found naked. As if to say: if the soul
        were to put on a heavenly dwelling, in such a way that the earthly
        dwelling were not taken off, i.e., in such a way that our body were not
        dissolved by death, the attainment of that heavenly dwelling would be
        “to be put on over”. But because it is necessary to be divested of that
        earthly dwelling, if the heavenly is to be put on, it cannot be a
        “putting on over”, but simply a “putting on.” Hence he says, so that by
        putting it on we may not be found naked. As if to say: we would indeed
        be putting on over, if we were found clothed and not naked. For a naked
        person is not said to be clothed over, but to be clothed. But a Gloss
        [Lombard] explains it as a spiritual dress, saying: “We desire to be
        clothed over, and this will indeed be done, but under this condition,
        that we be found clothed, namely, with the virtues, and not naked,
        namely, of the virtues.” Of this clothing it says in Colossians (3:12):
        “Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion,
        kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.” As if to say: no one will
        attain to this glory, unless he has the virtues. But this explanation
        does not seem to agree with the Apostle’s intention.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        158. – Thus, therefore, the desire of grace burns for a reward, but it
        is retarded by the desire of nature. He shows this when he says: For
        while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety. Herein,
        therefore, he first shows the condition of the natural desire; secondly,
        he shows that even this condition of the natural desire is from God (v.
        5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        159. – The condition of the desire is natural, delaying the desire of
        grace, because we would prefer to be found clothed and not naked, i.e.,
        we would prefer that the soul attain to glory without the body’s being
        dissolved by death. The reason for this is that there is a natural
        desire in the soul to be united to the body; otherwise, death would not
        be a punishment. And this is what he says: For while we are still in
        this tent, i.e., who live in this mortal body: “Since I know that the
        putting off of my body (tent) will be soon” (2 Pet. 1:14), we sigh,
        i.e., inwardly in the heart, and not outwardly with our voice: “We moan
        and moan like doves” (Is. 59:11), because it is hard to think of death,
        and yet burdened as with something against our desire, in that we cannot
        attain to glory without the putting off of the body. This is so much
        against our natural desire that, as Augustine says, not even old age
        itself could remove the fear of death from Peter. And so he says, not
        that we would be unclothed, namely, of our earthly tent, but that we
        would be further clothed with super-heavenly glory, or, according to a
        Gloss, with a glorified body. But because it could seem unbecoming that
        the body, on the one hand should be corruptible of its very nature, if
        it had not been dissolved before, and, on the other hand, glorified, he
        mentions the way in which he would like this to happen, saying, so that
        what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. As if to say: we do not
        desire to be clothed over in such a way that the body remains mortal,
        but so that the glory take away corruption altogether from the body
        without its dissolution. Hence he says, so that what is mortal, i.e.,
        the very corruption of the body, may be swallowed up by life, i.e.,
        glory: “Death is swallowed up in victory” (1 Cor. 15:54).

        5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us
        the Spirit as a guarantee. 6 So we are always of good courage; we know
        that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, 7 for
        we walk by faith, not by sight. 8 We are of good courage, and we would
        rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. 9 So whether we
        are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. 10 For we must
        all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may
        receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        160. – Here he discloses the author of the supernatural desire for a
        heavenly dwelling. For the cause of a natural desire that we be not
        despoiled is that the soul is naturally united to the body, and vice
        versa. But the desire to be clothed upon with a heavenly dwelling is not
        from nature but from God. Hence, he says, he who has prepared us for
        this very thing is God. As if to say: we wish to put on the heavenly
        dwelling, but in such a way as not to lose the earthly one. And yet it
        is God who effects in us the desire to be thus clothed over: “God is at
        work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Phil.
        2:13). The reason for this is that upon every nature follows a desire
        suited to the end of that nature, as something heavy naturally tends
        downward and seeks to rest there. But if a thing’s desire is above its
        nature, that thing is not moved to that end naturally, but by something
        else, which is above its nature. Now it is evident that to enjoy eternal
        glory and to see God by his essence, although it is appropriate to a
        rational creature, is above its nature. Therefore, the rational creature
        is not moved to desire this by nature, but by God himself, who prepared
        us for this very thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        161. – How this is accomplished he adds, saying, who has given us the
        Spirit as a guarantee [pledge]. In regard to this it should be noted
        that God produces natural desires and supernatural desires in us: the
        natural, when he gives us a natural spirit suited to human nature: “God
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (Gen. 2:7); but he gives
        the supernatural desires when he infuses in us the supernatural spirit,
        i.e., the Holy Spirit. Therefore he says, who has given us the Spirit as
        a guarantee, i.e., the Holy Spirit producing in us the certainty of this
        thing, with which we desire to be filled: “You were sealed with the Holy
        Spirit, which is the guarantee of our inheritance” (Eph. 1:13-14). He
        says, pledge, because a pledge has as much value as the thing for which
        it is given; but it differs from the thing for which it is given in this
        way, namely, that the thing is possessed with a fuller right, when it is
        already had, than the pledge is. For the thing is possessed as one’s
        own, but the pledge is kept and held as though giving assurance that the
        thing will be possessed. So it is with the Holy Spirit: because the Holy
        Spirit has as much value as heavenly glory. But there is a difference in
        the way he is possessed, because now we have him as a surety of
        obtaining that glory; but in heaven we shall have him as something now
        possessed by us. For then we shall have him perfectly, but now
        imperfectly. In this way, therefore, is grace’s desire deferred by a
        natural desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        162. – But is it hindered? No, but grace’s desire conquers. Hence, he
        says, so we are always of good courage, knowing that while we are at
        home in the body we are away from the Lord. As if to say: there are two
        desires in holy men, one by which they desire a heavenly dwelling, the
        other by which they do not wish to be despoiled. If these were
        compatible, they would not be contrary, and one would not be delayed by
        the other. But the Apostle shows that they are incompatible and that one
        must prevail over the other. In regard to this he does two three things:
        first, he shows the incompatibility of these desires; secondly, he
        enters a proof (v. 7); thirdly, he shows which of them conquers (v. 8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        163. –He shows their incompatibility when he says, so we are always of
        good courage [always daring], knowing that while we are at home in the
        body we are away from the Lord. Properly speaking, to dare is to involve
        oneself in dangers of death and not to yield through fear. But although
        the saints naturally fear death, yet they dare to face the dangers of
        death and not yield because of a fear of death: “The righteous are bold
        as a lion” (Prov. 28:1); “In his days he feared not the prince” (Sir.
        48:13, Vulgate). Knowing this, namely, that he strengthens our boldness
        not to fear death for Christ, that while we are at home in the body we
        are away, i.e., far away from God: “Woe to me because my stay has been
        prolonged” (Ps. 120:5, Vulgate). We are absent inasmuch as we are
        outside our native land, which is God. Otherwise, we would not be
        described as away from him. And this is not from our nature, but from
        his grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        164. – That we are absent from the Lord is proved, when he says, for we
        walk by faith, i.e., we pass through this life in faith, and not by
        sight: because faith deals with things not seen. For the word of faith
        is as a lamp with which the road is lit in this life: “Your word is a
        lamp to my feet, and a light for my steps” (Ps. 119:105). But in heaven
        there will be no such lamp, because the radiance of God, i.e., God
        himself, has enlightened it (Rev. 21:23). Therefore, we shall then see
        him by sight, i.e., in his essence. But he says, we walk by faith,
        because faith is concerned with things unseen: “Faith is the substance
        of things hoped for; the conviction of things not seen” (Heb. 11:1). But
        as long as the soul is united to the body, it does not see God in his
        essence: “No man shall see me and live” (Ex. 33:20). Hence, inasmuch as
        we assent by believing the things we do not see, we are said to walk by
        faith and not by sight. Thus, therefore, the incompatibility of the two
        desires is plain, because we cannot, along with this body, be clothed
        over by the heavenly habitation, the proof of this being that we walk by
        faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        165. – He follows with the victory of the one desire, namely, of grace,
        when he says, we are of good courage and would rather be away from the
        body. This should be read as follows: knowing what was said above, i.e.,
        that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord [we dare
        and have a good will]. He says two things: one implies the repugnance he
        has in willing, a repugnance caused by the fear of death. For where
        there is no fear, there is no daring. For the fear of death springs from
        our nature’s desire, but the daring of grace’s desire. Therefore, he
        says, we dare. The other implies an imperfection of the soul in
        desiring, because unless we desired properly, the fear of death would
        not be overcome, since it is quite natural. Therefore, it is not only
        necessary to dare, but also to have a good will, i.e., to will gladly.
        For although, according to the Philosopher, in the act of courage, joy
        is not required for the perfection of the virtue as it is in the other
        virtues, but only not to be sad. Yet because the courage of the saints
        is more perfect, they are not only not sad at the dangers of death, but
        they rejoice: “My desire is to depart and be with Christ” (Phil. 1:23).
        But what do we dare? Rather to be away from the body, i.e., to be
        separated from the body by its dissolution, which is contrary to the
        desire of nature, and at home with the Lord, i.e., to walk by sight,
        which is the desire of grace. He desired this who said in Psalm 42 (v.
        5): “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        166. – Note that he concludes to the same two things he proposed at the
        beginning, namely, that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed,
        which is the same as what he says here, namely, to be away from the
        body; and that we have a building from God, not made with human hands,
        in heaven, which is the same as being at home with the Lord.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        167. – By these words is refuted the error of those who say that the
        souls of dead saints are not at once after death brought to the vision
        of God and into his presence, but they reside in mansions until the day
        of judgment. For the saints dared and desired in vain to be away from
        the body, if they would not be present to God when separated from the
        body. Therefore, the answer is that the saints see the essence of God
        immediately after death and dwell in a heavenly mansion. Thus,
        therefore, it is plain that the reward which the saints await is
        inestimable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        168. – He follows this with an account of the preparation for the reward
        which is accomplished by the struggle against temptations and by
        exercising good works (v. 9). But the saints are prepared for this
        reward in three ways. First, by pleasing God; secondly, by helping their
        neighbor (v. 11); thirdly, by removing carnal affections from themselves
        (v. 16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        169. – They please God by resisting evil. Hence he says, so, namely,
        because our whole desire is to be present with God, we contend, i.e., we
        make great effort, i.e., we strive and fight against the temptations of
        the devil, the flesh and the world: “Strive to enter by the narrow gate”
        (Lk. 13:24). To please him, namely, God, with whom we desire to be
        present, whether we are at home or away: because unless we strive to
        please him in this life, while we are absent, we shall not be able to
        please him or be present with him in the other life: “There was one who
        pleased God and was loved by him” (Wis. 4:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        170. – Then when he says, For we must all appear, he adds the cause for
        why the saints strive to please God. This cause is taken from a
        consideration of the future judgment, when we must all be manifested.
        Here the Apostle mentions five marks of the future judgment. The first
        is its universality, because no one will be exempted from that judgment;
        hence he says, we must all, i.e., all men, good and bad, great and
        small: “So each of us shall give account of himself to God” (Rom.
        14:12); “And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the
        throne, and books were opened” (Rev. 20:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        171. – But there are two objections against this. First, because it does
        not seem that unbelievers will come to judgment, for one who does not
        believe has already been judged, as it says in John (3:18). Secondly,
        because some will be there as judges: “You who have followed me will
        also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel” (Matt.
        19:28). Therefore, not all will be before the tribunal to be judged. I
        answer that there are two things in a judgment, namely, a discussion of
        merits, and as to this not all will be judged, because those who have
        completely renounced Satan and all him pomps, and have clung to Christ
        in all things, will not be judged, because they are gods already. But
        those who did not adhere to Christ in any way, neither by faith nor
        works, will also not need discussion. But those who have something with
        Christ, namely, faith, and in something have withdrawn from him, namely
        by evil works and wicked desires, will be discussed as to the things
        they committed against Christ. Hence, as to this, only sinful Christians
        will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ. But sentence will
        also be pronounced during the judgment; and as to this, all will be
        manifested. But it seems that children will be exempt, because he says,
        so that each one may receive good or evil according to what he has done
        in the body. But children have done nothing in the body. This is
        answered by a Gloss [Lombard]: for they will not be judged for the
        things they did by themselves, but for the things they did through
        others, when they believed or did not believe, were baptized or not
        baptized through them. Or they will be condemned for the sin of their
        first parents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        172. – Secondly, he mentions the certainty of the judgment. For in human
        judgment many can be deceived, when they are judged evil, whereas they
        are good; or good, whereas they are evil. The reason for this is that
        hearts are not manifest. But in that judgment there will be absolutely
        perfect certainty, because there will be a manifestation of hearts.
        Hence, he says, be manifested: “Therefore do not pronounce judgment
        before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the
        things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the
        heart” (1 Cor. 4:5). Thirdly, he tells why the judgment will be
        necessary, because no one shall be able to escape that judgment either
        by another’s intercession or by contumacy: “That you may know that there
        is a judgment” (Job 19:29); “For God will bring every deed into
        judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil” (Ec. 12:14).
        Fourthly, he discloses the authority of the judge; hence, he says,
        before the judgment seat [tribunal] of Christ, who will come to judge
        men in the same form in which he was judged by men, so that appearing in
        human form, he may be seen by the good and by the evil; for the wicked
        cannot see the glory of God: “And has given him authority to execute
        judgment, because he is the Son of man” (Jn. 5:27). “Tribunal” implies
        juridical power, and is taken from an ancient custom of the Romans, who
        chose three tribunes of the people, whose function was to pass judgment
        on the excesses of consuls and senators. Their places were called
        tribunals. Fifthly, he speaks of the equity of the judge, because there
        will be rewards or punishments according to one’s merits. Hence, he
        says, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he
        has done: “He will render to each one according to his works” (Rom.
        2:5). He says, in the body, not only for things accomplished with bodily
        movement, but for those accomplished by the mind; otherwise, unbelievers
        would not be punished. Therefore, when he says, in the body, it is
        understood to mean things performed while he lived in the body.

        11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we
        are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. 12
        We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to be
        proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who pride
        themselves on a man’s position and not on his heart. 13 For if we are
        beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for
        you. 14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced
        that one has died for all; therefore all have died. 15 And he died for
        all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him
        who for their sake died and was raised.

        173. – Having shown how the saints prepare themselves for the reward of
        eternal glory by pleasing God, the Apostle now shows how they prepare
        themselves for this by helping their neighbor. In regard to this he does
        two things. First, he shows his own solicitude for the salvation of his
        neighbor; secondly, he assigns the cause of this solicitude (v. 14). In
        regard to the first he does three things. First, he mentions the care he
        has for the salvation of his neighbor by persuading them; secondly, he
        excludes a false opinion (v. 12); thirdly, he shows that even in the way
        he teaches he intends the welfare of his neighbor (v. 13). In regard to
        the first he does two things. First, he mentions his zeal to benefit his
        neighbor; secondly, he explains this (v. 11b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        174. – He says therefore: I say that we must be manifested before the
        tribunal of Christ, and this consideration induces men to fear the
        judgment. Hence, he says, therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, i.e.,
        how purely and chastely the Lord Jesus should be feared, we persuade men
        to fear and believe: “When I consider, I am in dread of him” (Job
        23:15); “Who would not fear you, O King of the nations” (Jer. 10:7);
        “But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your
        fear, and let him be your dread” (Is. 8:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        175. – But because someone could say that it is not from a good
        conscience, but for his own advantage that he persuades men, he shows
        that this is false by appealing to two testimonies, namely, of God, when
        he says, but what we are is known to God, i.e., that he is speaking from
        fear of God, for God sees the intention of our heart: “The heart is
        deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand
        it? I the LORD search the mind and try the heart” (Jer. 17:9-10); “For
        he himself knew what was in man” (Jn. 2:25). And by the testimony of
        their consciences; hence he says, I hope it is known also to your
        conscience. Truly I hope, because I have shown myself to you in such a
        way that you might know we are approved and might firmly hold this, even
        though you do not admit it by mouth: “Commending ourselves to every
        man’s conscience in the sight of God” (2 Cor. 4:2)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        176. – Then because they might suppose that the Apostle said this to
        commend himself, he removes this false supposition, saying, we are not
        commending ourselves to you again, i.e., we are not saying this for our
        commendation, as though trying to commend ourselves again. For above (in
        chapter three and in 1 Corinthians 3) he said certain things for his
        commendation: “For it is not the man who commends himself that is
        accepted, but the man whom the Lord commends” (2 Cor. 10:18). But we say
        this for your benefit. As if to say, but giving you cause to be proud of
        us, i.e., matter for glorifying. For the false apostles took glory in
        elation, saying that they were taught by the apostles, who were from the
        Lord, namely, by Peter and James, who were pillars of the faith, thus
        detracting from the Apostle, as though he had not been with the Lord
        Jesus, and wishing to destroy his teaching. Therefore, in order that the
        Corinthians, too, might have something in which to glory against those
        false apostles, namely, the grace given to the Apostle, so as to refute
        them and not be seduced by them, he said this. Hence, he continues, so
        that you may be able to answer those, i.e., against them, or to those
        reprimanding, what you can speak.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        177. – To them, I say, who pride themselves on a man’s position and not
        on his heart [who glory in face and not in heart]. This can be explained
        in three ways. First, they glory in face, i.e., in the external
        observances of the Law, because that is what they taught, and not in
        heart, i.e., in the virtue of Christ, which is in the heart, unlike the
        Apostle, who in virtue of the cross of Christ, said: “Far be it from me
        to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal. 6:14).
        Likewise they glory in face, i.e., in the presence of men, as hypocrites
        do, and not in heart, i.e., in the testimony of conscience, as the
        Apostle says above (2 Cor. 1:12): “For our boast is this, the testimony
        of our conscience.” Or they glory in face, because they pretend some
        things outwardly, which they do not feel in the heart, namely, that they
        claimed to have been instructed by the apostles and were following their
        doctrine, which on the contrary they were trying to destroy. It is
        clear, therefore, how the Apostle procured the salvation of his neighbor
        by teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        178. – Now we must see how he procured their salvation even in the way
        he taught. Hence he says, for if we are beside ourselves, it is for God;
        if we are in our right mind [if we are sober], it is for you. This is
        explained in two ways: in one way so that the Apostle calls himself
        transported when he speaks to them by commending himself, and sober when
        he is not speaking of his own commendation. According to this he is
        saying: no matter how we teach, it is either for the honor of God or the
        benefit of his neighbor; for if we are beside ourselves, i.e., commend
        ourselves, it is for God, i.e., for the honor of God or for observing
        God’s judgment; if we are in our right mind [if we are sober], i.e., not
        saying great things about ourselves, this is for you, i.e., for your
        profit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        179. – But there is another and more literal sense. I say that we give
        you opportunity for glorying in us, because in everything we do and even
        in the way we do it, we intend your good. Hence it should be noted that
        the apostles were midway between God and the people: “While I stood
        between the Lord and you at that time” (Deut. 5:5). Therefore, they were
        required to draw from God whatever they poured out upon the people.
        Hence it was necessary that sometimes they raised themselves to God by
        contemplation to obtain heavenly things, and sometimes conformed
        themselves to the people to deliver what they had received from God; and
        all this tended to their profit. Hence he says, for if we are beside
        ourselves, i.e., raised to the state of receiving gifts of graces, and
        this in order to be united to God, which is done by means of temporal
        things: “I said in my vision” (Ps. 116:11, Vulgate); Dionysius: “Divine
        love causes ecstasy.” If we are in our right mind, i.e., adapt ourselves
        to you by delivering God’s precepts, it is for you, i.e., for your
        benefit. This sobriety is not opposed to inebriation in wine, which
        brings wars on earth, but to that inebriation which is from the Holy
        Spirit and draws men to divine things and about which Song of Songs
        (5:1) says: “Eat, O friends, and drink: drink deeply, O lovers!” For
        that sobriety is for the benefit of our neighbor, but the inebriation is
        for the love of God. Such a descent was signified by the descent of the
        angels on the ladder which Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12): “You will see heaven
        opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
        man” (Jn. 1:51).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        180. – Then when he says, For the love of Christ, the Apostle indicates
        the cause of his solicitude, namely, the love of Christ. In regard to
        this he does two things. First, he shows that he is pressed by the
        charity of Christ to procure the salvation of his neighbor; secondly, he
        indicates the source from which the charity of Christ is kindled (v.
        14b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        181. – He says, therefore: I say that whether we be beside ourselves, it
        is for God; or whether we be sober, it is for you, i.e., for your
        benefit. The reason for this is that the love of Christ controls
        [presses] us to this. He says, presses, because it is the same as
        stimulates. As if to say: the love of God, as a goad, stimulates us to
        do what charity commands, namely, to procure the salvation of our
        neighbor: “Those who are led,” i.e., stirred, “by the Spirit of God are
        sons of God” (Rom. 8:14); “Its flashes are flashes of fire” (Song 8:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        182. – Then he indicates the cause of his solicitude, namely, the love
        of Christ, adding, because we are convinced that one has died for all.
        First, he assigns the reason for this; secondly, he explains it (v. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        183. – He says, therefore: I say that we do all things for you, because
        the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one,
        namely Christ, has died for all, then we ourselves should so live, i.e.,
        for your benefit, that we are even dead to ourselves, i.e., we care
        nothing about ourselves, but about Christ and the things of Christ: “God
        shows his love for us” (Rom. 5:8); “Christ also suffered for you,
        leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps” (1 Pet.
        2:21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        184. – What follows from this, namely, therefore all have died, is
        explained in three ways. First, as if to say that all have died with the
        death of sin in Adam. For it would not have been necessary for Christ to
        suffer for all, if all were not dead with the death of Adam’s sin: “For
        as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor.
        15:22). Secondly, as if to say: all have died, namely, to the old life.
        For Christ died to remove sins; therefore, all should die to the old
        life, namely, of sin, and live the life of justice: “The death he died
        he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So
        you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ
        Jesus” (Rom. 6:10-11). Thirdly, and more literally, all have died, i.e.,
        each person should regard himself as though dead to himself: “You have
        died and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        185. – He explains this interpretation when he says, and he died for
        all: “He died that we might live to Christ” (see 2 Cor. 5:15; 1 Th.
        5:10; 1 Jn. 4:9)). Hence he continues, that those who live might live,
        namely, with a natural life, no longer for themselves, i.e., solely for
        themselves and their own good, but for him who for their sake died and
        was raised, namely, for Christ, i.e., he should direct his whole life to
        the service and honor of Christ: “It is no longer I who live, but Christ
        who lives in me” (Gal. 2:20); “Forget not the kindness of your surety,
        for he has given his life for you” (Sir. 29:20, Vulgate). The reason for
        these things is that everyone who acts takes the rule of his work from
        the end. Hence, if Christ is the end of our life, we should regulate our
        life not according to our will but according to Christ’s will. For this
        is what Christ himself said: “For I have come down from heaven, not to
        do my own will, but the will of him who sent me” (Jn. 6:38)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        186. – But note that he says two things, namely that Christ died and
        that he rose for us; wherein two things are required of us. For since he
        dies for us, we, too, should die to ourselves, i.e., deny ourselves for
        him: “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up
        his cross daily and follow me” (Lk. 9:23). This is the same as saying:
        let him die to himself. But because Christ rose for us, we should so die
        to sin and to the old life and to ourselves that we might rise to the
        new life of Christ: “So that as Christ was raised from the dead by the
        glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life” (Rom. 6:4).
        This is why the Lord not only said, “Let him deny himself and take up
        his cross,” but added, “and follow me,” namely, in newness of life, by
        advancing in the virtues: “They shall go from virtue to virtue” (Ps.
        84:7, Vulgate).

        16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view;
        even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we
        regard him thus no longer. 17 Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is
        a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come.

        187. – Having indicated how the saints prepare themselves for receiving
        heavenly glory by pleasing God and helping their neighbor, the Apostle
        then shows how they prepare themselves for the same thing by giving up
        carnal affection. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
        mentions the putting off of carnal affection; secondly, he excludes an
        objection (v. 16b); thirdly, he concludes to what he intended (v. 17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        188. – He says therefore: inasmuch as I am so certain of eternal glory,
        From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of view
        [according to the flesh]. Here it should be noted that according to the
        flesh is a restriction and can be explained in two ways according to the
        possible connections that can be made. In one way, so according to the
        flesh is connected with no one. In this case, a Gloss explains it thus:
        we regard, i.e., approve of no one according to the flesh, i.e., living
        carnally. This is the way “flesh” is taken in Romans (8:9): “You are not
        in the flesh, you are in the Spirit.” In another way, we regard, i.e.,
        approve of, no one according to the flesh, i.e., living according to the
        carnal observances of the Law. This is the way “flesh” is taken in
        Philippians (3:4): “Who have confidence in the flesh,” i.e., the carnal
        observances of the Law. In a third way, we regard, i.e., consider, no
        one according to the flesh, i.e., according to the corruption of the
        flesh. For although the faithful still have corruptible flesh, yet in
        hope they already have an incorruptible body. Hence, they do not
        consider themselves from the point of view that they have corruptible
        flesh now, but that they shall have an incorruptible body. This is the
        way “flesh” is taken in 1 Corinthians (15:50): “Flesh and blood shall
        not inherit the kingdom of God.” But according to the flesh can be taken
        in another way, namely, as connected with the verb, we regard. Then the
        sense is this: I say that inasmuch as we should not live for ourselves
        but for him who died for us, then from now on, we regard no one
        according to the flesh, i.e., we do not follow carnal affection in
        anyone or regard him in this light. This is the way Deuteronomy (33:9)
        should be understood: “Who said of his father and mother, ‘I regard them
        not’; he disowned his brothers, and ignored his children.” In this way,
        according to the flesh is referred to the knower, but in the first
        explanation to the object known.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        189. – But because someone might insist that he at least knew Christ
        according to the flesh, he excludes this, saying: even though we once
        regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no
        longer. In regard to this it should be noted that Manicheus appealed to
        those words to support his error. For he said that Christ did not have a
        true body and was not born of the seed of David. This is the way
        Augustine puts it in the book, Against Faustus: If anyone alleged
        against him the words of the Apostle to the Romans (1:3), “Who was
        descended from David according to the flesh,” and to Timothy (1 Tim.
        3:16), “Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of our religion, which
        was manifested in the flesh” (and 2 Tim 2:8), “Remember Jesus Christ,
        risen from the dead, descended from David, as preached in my gospel,” he
        answered that the Apostle was first of the opinion that he was of the
        seed of David and that he had a true body, but he changed that opinion
        later to correct himself; that is why he said, even though we once
        regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no
        longer, i.e., we have changed our opinion and no longer believe that.
        But Augustine disproves this in two ways. First, because no one says,
        “we regarded,” but “we are of the opinion,” when speaking of something
        he falsely held. Therefore, when the Apostle uses the words, “we
        regarded” it does not seem that he once held something false. Secondly,
        because the Apostle says, we regard no one from a human point of view.
        Therefore, if what Manicheus says were true, the Apostle would have
        known no one to have a true body, which is false. Therefore what
        Manicheus says is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        190. – Consequently, it must be explained otherwise according to the
        truth, and this in two ways. In one way so that flesh is taken for the
        corruption of the flesh: “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
        God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable” (1 Cor. 15:50).
        Then the sense is this: if we once regarded Christ from a human point of
        view, i.e., to have corruptible flesh before the passion, we regard him
        thus no longer, namely, that he has corruptible flesh, because it says
        in Romans (6:9): “Christ being raised from the dead will never die
        again; death no longer has dominion over him.” In another way according
        to a Gloss [Lombard], so that the clause, even though we once regarded
        Christ from a human point of view, is referred to Paul’s condition
        before his conversion; then what follows, we regard him thus no longer,
        refers to his state after conversion. Then the sense is this: both I and
        other Jews once, i.e., before my conversion, knew Christ according to
        the flesh, i.e., according to what we thought of Christ in the Law. But
        now, i.e., after I was converted, we regard him thus no longer, i.e.,
        this opinion ceased. Indeed I believe that he is true God and that he
        should not be worshipped with carnal observance. Hence, he said to the
        Galatians (5:2): “If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no
        advantage to you.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        191. – It can also be explained another way, so that the statement, even
        though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, is made by
        the Apostle in the person of all the apostles of Christ. In this way it
        seems to correspond to the last explanation of the statement, we regard
        no one from a human point of view. Hence it should be noted that when
        Augustine explains John (16:17): “It is to your advantage that I go
        away,” where the Lord’s reason is given as being, “For if I do not go
        away, the Counselor will not come to you,” he says that this was because
        the disciples were attracted toward him as a man in the flesh to a
        friend in the flesh. As a result, they could not be raised to a
        spiritual love, which causes one to suffer many things even for a person
        who is absent. Therefore, in order to plant in them a spiritual
        affection, which is from the Holy Spirit, and root out the carnal one,
        the Lord said to them: “Peace be with you” (Jn. 20:21). Therefore, the
        Apostle in the person of all the disciples recalled this and said, even
        though we once regarded, i.e., if we have clung to Christ at one time,
        namely, when he was present with us in his bodily presence, according to
        the flesh, i.e., with carnal love, we regard him thus no longer, i.e.,
        that affection ceased in us by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to
        us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        192. – Then when he says, Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he concludes
        from the foregoing that a certain effect follows, namely, newness in the
        world. Hence he says, if anyone is in Christ, i.e., in the faith of
        Christ, or through Christ, he is a new creation [creature]: “For in
        Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail,
        but faith working through love” (Gal. 5:6). Here it should be noted that
        renewal by grace is called a creature. For creation is a change from
        nothing to existence. But there are two kinds of existence, namely, of
        nature and of grace. The first creation was made when creatures were
        produced by God from nothing to exist in nature; and then the creature
        was new, but became old by sin: “He has made my flesh and my skin waste
        away” (Lam. 3:4). Therefore, a new creation was required by which we
        would be produced to exist in grace. This, too, is a creation from
        nothing because those who lack grace are nothing: “And if I understand
        all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to
        remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing” (1 Cor. 13:2); “In
        his tent,” i.e., of sin, “dwells that which is none of his” (Job 18:15).
        Augustine says: “For sin is nothing, and men become nothing, when they
        sin.” So it is clear that the infusion of grace is a creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        193. – If then any creature is made new through him, the old has passed
        away, behold, the new has come. This of course was taken from Leviticus
        (26:10), where it says: “And you shall clear out the old to make way for
        the new.” From this he argues thus: if all things have been made new,
        and according to the Law when new things come, the old things shall be
        cast away, then if there be any new creature, the old has passed away,
        i.e., they should pass away from it. But the old things that should pass
        away are the legal observances: “So that we serve not under the old
        written code but in the new life of the Spirit” (Rom. 7:6), and in the
        errors of the Gentiles: “The old error is gone” (Is. 26:3, Vulgate);
        likewise the corruption of sin: “We know that our old self was crucified
        with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no
        longer be enslaved to sin” (Rom. 6:6). When such things pass from us,
        the virtues contrary to these vices should be renewed: “And he who sat
        upon the throne said, ‘Behold, I make all things new’” (Rev. 21:5).

        18 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and
        gave us the ministry of reconciliation; 19 that is, in Christ God was
        reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against
        them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. 20 So we are
        ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you
        on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. 21 For our sake he made him
        to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the
        righteousness of God.

        194. – After discussing the saints’ reward and how they prepared
        themselves to receive it, the Apostle now treats of the cause of both
        and does three things. First, he shows that the Author of all these
        things is God; secondly, he recalls the benefit conferred by Christ (v.
        18b); thirdly, the use of the benefit (v. 20)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        195. – He says therefore: I have said that we intend the salvation of
        our neighbor and that the old things have passed away; but all this is
        from God the Father, or from God as author: “For from him and through
        him and to him are all things” (Rom. 11:36); “Every good endowment and
        every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights”
        (Jas. 1:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        196. – Then he mentions the benefits received from God (v. 18): first,
        he mentions the benefit received; secondly, he explains it (v. 19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        197. – He recalls two benefits conferred by Christ: one is common and
        the other is special. Common to the whole world was reconciliation to
        God. And this is what he says, all this is from God, namely, God the
        Father, who reconciled us to God, i.e., made peace between us and God.
        And this is by Christ, i.e., by the Incarnate Word. For men were enemies
        of God because of sin, but Christ removed this enmity from their midst,
        satisfying for sin and producing harmony: “Whether on earth or in
        heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross” (Col. 1:20). Therefore
        he says, through Christ: “We were reconciled to God by the death of his
        Son” (Rom. 5:10). But a special gift was conferred on the apostles,
        namely, that they are ministers of this reconciliation. Hence he says,
        and gave us, the apostles and vicars of Christ, the ministry of
        reconciliation: “Who has made us competent to be ministers of a new
        covenant” (2 Cor. 3:6); “Let the mountains,” i.e., the apostles, “bear
        prosperity for the people” (Ps. 72:3), namely, from the Lord.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        198. – Then when he says, that is, he explains what he has said. First,
        the first thing; secondly, the second (v. 19b). He says therefore: I say
        that God reconciled us to himself in this way. For there were enmities
        between God and man on account of sin, as has been said: “But your
        iniquities have made a separation between you and your God” (Is. 59:2).
        Therefore, sin being destroyed by the death of Christ, the enmities were
        dissolved. And this is what he says: That is, in Christ God by oneness
        of essence: “I am in the Father and the Father in me” (Jn. 14:11). Or in
        Christ God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ: “We were
        reconciled to God by the death of his Son” (Rom. 5:10). This he did, not
        counting their trespasses against them, i.e., not retaining in his
        memory their sins, actual or original, to punish them, for which Christ
        fully satisfies., According to this he is said to have reconciled us to
        himself, inasmuch as he does not impute our sins to us: “Blessed is the
        man to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity (Ps. 32:2). Then when he says,
        and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation, he explains the
        second thing, namely, the benefit conferred on the apostles. As if to
        say: he has given us the mystery of reconciliation in this way, namely,
        that he has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation, i.e., he has
        given the power and has inspired in our hearts to announce to the world
        that this reconciliation was made by Christ. By doing this we induce men
        to conform themselves to Christ by baptism: “Behold, I have put my words
        in your mouth” (Jer. 1:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        199. – Then when he says, So we are ambassadors for Christ, he indicates
        the use of the benefit. First, as to the second benefit conferred on the
        apostles; secondly, as to the first benefit conferred on all (v. 20b).
        He says therefore: since God has established the word of reconciliation,
        we ought to use it. This is why we are ambassadors for Christ: “For
        which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I
        ought to speak” (Eph. 6:20). Our fitness for this ambassadorship is from
        God’s power, which is in me. Hence he says, God making his appeal
        through us, because God, who speaks in us, makes us fit for this
        ambassadorship: “For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your
        Father speaking through you” (Matt. 10:20); “Since you desire proof that
        Christ is speaking in me” (2 Cor. 13:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        200. – The when he says, we beseech you, he describes the use of the
        first benefit. First, he exhorts to its use; secondly, he shows the
        source of his power to reconcile to God (v. 21). He says therefore:
        inasmuch as God has produced a reconciliation and we are ambassadors of
        God in this, we beseech you on behalf of Christ. He speaks gently, even
        though he could have commanded: “Convince, rebuke, and exhort, be
        unfailing in patience and in teaching” (2 Tim. 4:2); “Accordingly,
        though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
        yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you” (Phm. 1:8-9). We beseech
        you, I say, on behalf of Christ, i.e., for the love of Christ, to be
        reconciled to God. But this seems contrary to his statement that God has
        reconciled us to himself. Therefore, if he reconciled us, what need is
        there to be reconciled? For we are already reconciled. I answer that God
        reconciled us to himself as efficient cause, namely, on his part, but in
        order that it be meritorious for us, it is necessary that reconciliation
        be made on our part, namely, in baptism and in penance. And then we
        cease from sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        201. – Where we get the faculty to reconcile to God is indicated by the
        fact that he gave us the power to live justly and abstain from sins. By
        doing this we are reconciled to God. Hence he says, for our sake, he
        made him to be sin who knew no sin. As if to say: you can be reconciled
        to God, because he, namely, Christ, who knew no sin: “He committed no
        sin; no guile was found on his lips” (1 Pet. 2:22); “Which of you
        convicts me of sin?” (Jn. 8:46). For our sake, he made him to be sin.
        This can be explained in three ways. In one way because it was the
        custom of the Old Law to call a sacrifice for sin “sin”: “They feed on
        the sin of my people” (Hos. 4:8), i.e., the offerings for sin. Then the
        sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., the victim of sacrifice for sin.
        In another way, because sin is sometimes taken for the likeness of sin,
        or the punishment of sin: “God sending his own Son in the likeness of
        sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh” (Rom. 8:3).
        Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., made him assume mortal
        and suffering flesh. In a third way, because one thing is said to be
        this or that, not because it is so, but because man considers it such.
        Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., made him regarded a
        sinner: “He was numbered with the transgressors” (Is. 53:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        202. – He did this, so that in him we might become the righteousness
        [justice] of God, i.e., justified by God. Or justice, because he not
        only justified us, but also willed that others be justified by us. The
        justice, I say, of God, not ours. And in Christ, i.e., through Christ.
        Or another way, that Christ himself be called justice. Then the sense is
        this: that we might become the righteousness [justice], i.e., cling to
        Christ by love and faith, because Christ is justice itself. But he says,
        of God, to exclude man’s justice, by which a man trusts in his own
        merits: “For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God,
        and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s
        righteousness” (Rom. 10:3). In him, namely, in Christ, i.e., by Christ,
        because he was made justice for us (1 Cor. 1:30).

        203. – Having commended the ministry of the apostleship, the Apostle now
        carries out the ministry entrusted to him for the benefit of his
        subjects. In regard to this he does two things. First, he exhorts them
        in general to do all the things that are commonly necessary for a good
        life; secondly, he urges them in particular to help the saints in
        Jerusalem (chap. 8). In regard to the first he does two things. First,
        he urges them to goods that are present; secondly, he commends them for
        the good they have done in the past (chap. 7). In regard to the first he
        does three things. First, he admonishes them in general that the grace
        of God should not be used in vain; secondly, he shows that the grace of
        God has been conferred on them (v. 2); thirdly, he teaches them in
        particular how to use the grace mentioned (v. 3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        204. – He says therefore: from the fact that we have the faculty to do
        good, and this by the grace of God, and we are ambassadors of Christ for
        this purpose, therefore, working together [helping] by preaching, by
        examples and by exhortations: “A brother helped is like a strong city”
        (Prov. 18:19); or helping, namely, God: “We are God’s helpers” (1 Cor.
        3:9). But this seems contrary to Isaiah (40:9): “Who has directed the
        Spirit of the Lord?” (Is. 40:13). Therefore it is not correct to say,
        helping God. I answer that to help God can be taken to mean that a
        person gives God the power to do something. In this sense, no one helps
        God or can help him; or to mean that a person carries out his
        commandment. Then holy men are said to help God by carrying out his
        commands. We, I say, so helping do entreat [exhort] you: “He that
        exhorts, in his exhortation” (Rom. 12:8), not to accept the grace of God
        in vain. As if to say: let not the reception of grace be useless and
        vain for you, which it is when a person does not perceive the fruit of
        the grace he received. This fruit is twofold: the remission of sins:
        “And this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin” (Is. 27:9);
        and that a man by living righteously attain to heavenly glory: “The
        return [fruit] you get is sanctification” (Rom. 6:22). Therefore,
        whoever does not use the grace he has received for avoiding sin and
        obtaining eternal life, receives the grace of God in vain: “I did not
        run in vain or labor in vain” (Phil. 2:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        205. – But lest anyone doubt that he has received this grace from God,
        the Apostle proves that they have already received or are prepared to
        receive it, saying: For he says, “At the acceptable time I have listened
        to you. In regard to this he does two things. First, he quotes the
        Prophet; secondly, he adapts the quotation to his thesis (v. 2b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        206. – He says therefore: I say that you should be prepared to receive
        this grace fruitfully, which has been conferred on you or prepared for
        you, for the Lord says as much in Is. (44:8): “In a time of favor I have
        answered you.” In regard to this it should be noted that the Lord is
        said to make grace for us either by hearing us in our petitions or by
        helping us in our actions. But he hears that we might receive what we
        ask: “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all men
        generously and without reproaching, and it will be given him” (Jas.
        1:5); “If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt
        in the land of silence” (Ps. 94:17). This grace is of two kinds:
        prevenient and cooperating, i.e., subsequent, which it is necessary for
        us to obtain. First of all, prevenient grace, which we ought to desire
        in order to be accepted by God: “Therefore let every one who is godly
        offer prayer to you” (Ps. 32:6). As to this he says, At an acceptable
        time, i.e., for accepting and being put in the state of grace, for in
        that acceptable time that is done which is done gratuitously: “So also
        David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons
        righteousness apart from works” (Rom. 4:6). I have listened to you,
        i.e., accepted you. Or at an acceptable time, i.e., in the time of
        grace; and in this way prevenient grace is the name given to the grace
        by which we are freed from sin, and subsequent grace that by which we
        the virtues and perseverance in good are conferred on us. Secondly, we
        need cooperating grace, such as David requested in Ps. 23 (v. 6):
        “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.” As
        to this he says, and helped you on the day of salvation, for the time
        before Christ was not day but night: “The night is far gone, the day is
        at hand” (Rom 13:12). But the time of Christ is called the day, and not
        only the day, but the day of salvation. For before there was not
        salvation, because no one reached the end of salvation, namely, the
        vision of God. But now, when salvation has been born in the world, men
        attain to salvation: “And you shall call his name Jesus, for he will
        save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21); “Work out your salvation”
        (Phil. 2:12). And this is done by the help of cooperating grace, by
        which we arrive at eternal life through our works: “For God is at work
        in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        207. – Then he adapts this text to his purpose, saying, Behold, now is
        the acceptable time. As if to say: the things which the Lord says by the
        prophet about the time of grace are now being fulfilled, because behold,
        now is the acceptable time, i.e., for being adorned with grace, through
        which we are heard by God, because the fulness of time has already come,
        namely, of the Incarnation of Christ (Gal. 4:4); and this as to the
        first part of the quotation: “At an acceptable time, O God” (Ps. 69:13).
        Behold, now is the day of salvation, in which, helped by cooperating
        grace, we can work for the attainment of eternal salvation: “We must
        work the works of him who sent me” (Jn. 9:4); “As we have the
        opportunity, let us do good to all men” (Gal. 6:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        208. – Then when he says, we put no obstacle, he teaches them the way to
        use grace conferred on them; first, in general, namely, that they not
        receive it in vain; secondly, in particular (v. 4b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        209. – He says therefore: use grace in such a way as putting no obstacle
        in any one’s way. For grace is given for two things: to avoid evil and
        to do good. Therefore, he teaches these two things, namely, that we
        avoid evil, in regard to which he says, putting no obstacle in any one’s
        way. This can be explained in two ways: in one way as referring to the
        apostles. As if to say: we, helping you, do exhort you. We, I say,
        giving no offense to any one, because if we were to offend others by a
        wicked life, our ministry would be blamed and our preaching ridiculed:
        “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you” (Rom.
        2:24); “If one’s life is despised, it follows that his preaching is
        scorned” (Gregory). Hence, a public and notorious sinner should beware
        of preaching; otherwise, he would commit sin: “But to the wicked God
        says: ‘What right have you to recite my statutes, or take my covenant on
        your lips?’” (Ps. 50:17). In another way as referring to his subjects.
        As if to say: we exhort you, that you not receive the grace of God in
        vain; you, I say, putting no obstacle in any one’s way, i.e., not doing
        anything that would scandalize others: “Give no offense to Jews or to
        Greeks or to the church of God” (1 Cor. 10:32); “Decide never to put a
        stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother” (Rom. 14:13). The
        reason for this is so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
        i.e., our apostleship. For when subjects behave badly, the blame is put
        on the prelates: “Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles” (1 Pet.
        2:12). Or that the common ministry in regard to you and us, who are
        ministers of God, not be blamed. We, I say, are ministers of God to
        fulfil his will in you and in others, but you to fulfil it well in
        yourselves only: “You shall be called the priests of the LORD, men shall
        speak of you as the ministers of our God” (Is. 61:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        210. – Then when he says, but as servants of God we commend ourselves in
        every way, he teaches them how to use the grace they received for doing
        good. He says therefore: let us give no offense to anyone, but we
        commend ourselves, both you and we, in work and word and in all things
        which pertain to the virtues, such ministers of God as we ought to be,
        i.e., let us conform ourselves to God by doing his will: “Like the
        magistrate of the people, so are his officials” (Sir. 10:2); “This is
        how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the
        mysteries of God” (1 Cor. 4:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        211. – Then when he says, through great endurance, he shows in
        particular how we should exhibit ourselves as ministers of God in using
        the grace conferred on us. And this as to three things: first, as to
        outward actions, secondly, as to greater devotion (v. 11); thirdly, as
        to avoiding unbelievers (v. 14). In regard to the first he does three
        things in keeping with the three things in which external activity
        consists: first, it consists in enduring evil, and concerning this he
        says, through great endurance; secondly, in doing good (v. 6); thirdly,
        in mutual cooperation of good with bad (v. 7b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        212. – To endure evils the virtue of patience is necessary; hence, he
        says, through great endurance [in much patience]. In regard to this he
        does three things. First, he exhorts them to patience, because it says
        in Ps. 91 (v. 15): “They will be well off that they may proclaim” (Ps.
        92:14-15, Vulgate); “By your endurance [patience] you will gain your
        lives” (Lk. 21:19). He says, in much, on account of the many
        tribulations they meet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        213. – Secondly, he shows the matter patience deals with in general, and
        this in two ways, namely in evils that come upon them, in regard to
        which he says, in afflictions [tribulations]: “Patient in tribulation”
        (Rom. 12:12); “By many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God”
        (Ac. 11:21); and in the lack of necessities; hence, he says, in
        hardships [necessities], namely, of things necessary for life: “Bring me
        out of my distresses” (Ps. 25:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        214. – Thirdly, he shows in particular the material with which patience
        is concerned. First, with things that pertain to tribulations which are
        voluntary, and this as to the soul. Hence, he says, in calamities
        [distresses], namely of the heart, when we are so beset with
        tribulations that there is no way of escape: “Destitute, afflicted,
        ill-treated” (Heb. 11:37), and then as to the body; hence, he says, in
        beatings, namely, inflicted by others, and in prisons: “And when they
        had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison” (Ac.
        16:23); “Far more imprisonments, with countless beatings” (2 Cor.
        11:23). In tumults, namely, of an entire people in an uproar: “For we
        are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause
        that we can give to justify this commotion” (Ac. 19:40). Secondly, in
        things that pertain to necessities. But necessity is sometimes
        voluntary, and so he says, in labours, by working with his own hands
        among the Corinthians, so as not to burden them with his support,
        because they were avaricious; and among the Thessalonians, to give them
        an example of work because they were idle: “You yourselves know that
        these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me”
        (Ac. 20:34). In watchings, for the sake of preaching: “Through many a
        sleepless night” (2 Cor. 11:27). In hunger [fasting], sometimes
        voluntary and sometimes involuntary because of need: “I pommel my body
        and subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        215. – But this seems to be contrary to what is said in Matt. (11:30):
        “My yoke is easy and my burden is light,” whereas he says here, in much
        tribulation. Therefore, it is not sweet but very distasteful. I answer
        that these are hard in themselves, but they are made sweet by love and
        an inward fervor of spirit. Hence, Augustine says: “All huge and
        difficult tasks love makes easy and almost nothing.”

        6 By purity, knowledge, forbearance, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine
        love, 7 truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of
        righteousness for the right hand and for the left; 8 in honor and
        dishonor, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors,
        and yet are true; 9 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold
        we live; as punished, and yet not killed; 10 as sorrowful, yet always
        rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
        possessing everything.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        216. – Having set down the things which pertain to enduring evils, he
        now mentions those which pertain to the observance of good. Now the
        goodness of a work consists in three things, namely, in the perfection
        of virtues, and this pertains to the heart; in speaking the truth, and
        this pertains to the mouth; and in the virtuous activity which pertains
        to a work. First, therefore, the Apostle shows how they conduct
        themselves in matters pertaining to the perfection of the virtues, which
        consists in the heart; secondly, in those which pertain to the virtue of
        the mouth (v. 7); thirdly, in those which pertain to the perfection of a
        work (v. 7b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        217. – In regard to the first he sets down four virtues: first of all
        the virtue of chastity, which holds a prominent place in the virtue of
        temperance: in regard to this he says, in purity [chastity], namely, of
        mind and body. Here it should be noted that immediately after many
        labours, watches and fasts he mentions chastity, because a person who
        wills to have the virtue of chastity must be given to labours, continue
        in watchings, and be worn out with fasts: “But I pommel my body and
        subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be
        disqualified” (1 Cor. 9:27); “Strive for peace with all men, and for the
        holiness without which no one will see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14). But if
        anyone should ask why he makes no mention of the other virtues, but only
        of temperance, the answer is that he does mention them implicitly,
        because when he says, “in much patience, in tribulations” (v. 4), they
        pertain to the virtue of courage; when he says, “by the armor of
        justice” (v. 7), there is reference to the virtue of justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        218. – Secondly, he mentions the virtue of knowledge; therefore he says,
        in knowledge. If this is taken as referring to the knowledge by which a
        person knows how to behave well in the midst of a wicked and perverse
        nation, it pertains to the virtue of prudence. But if knowledge is taken
        as referring to the certitude with which the faithful are certain about
        the things which pertain to their knowledge of God, it pertains to the
        virtue of faith. Both are necessary for Christians, for without prudence
        and faith, men easily slip into sins: “Therefore my people go into exile
        for want of knowledge” (Is. 5:13); “And I will give you shepherds after
        my own heart” (Jer. 3:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        219. – Thirdly, he mentions the virtue of hope when he says,
        longsuffering, which pertains to the perfection of hope. For a
        longsuffering person is nothing less than a person who is always hopeful
        of obtaining a good that is difficult and waits patiently if it delay;
        and this is by the Holy Spirit: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
        joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
        self-control” (Gal. 5:22-23); “For all endurance and patience with joy”
        (Col. 1:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        220. – Fourthly, he mentions charity, which has two effects, namely, one
        inward and one outward. In the inward effect it has sweetness toward
        one’s neighbor: for it is unseemly for a person not to be sweet toward
        those he loves; therefore he says, in kindness [sweetness], in our
        behavior toward others, and gentle: “A pleasant voice multiplies
        friends, and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies” (Sir. 6:5). Not in
        the sweetness of the world, but in that which is caused by the love of
        God, i.e., by the Holy Spirit; hence he says, in the Holy Spirit, i.e.,
        which the Holy Spirit causes in us: “O how good and sweet is your
        Spirit, Lord, in all things” (Wis. 12:1, Vulgate). In the outward effect
        it has truth without pretense, i.e., that a person not pretend outwardly
        the contrary of what he has within; hence he says, in genuine love: “Let
        us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth” (1 Jn. 3:18);
        “And above all these put on love” (Col. 3:14). The reason for this is
        because, as it says in Wis. (1:5): “For the Holy Spirit of discipline
        will flee from deceit.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        221. – Then he shows how they should act in things which pertain to the
        truth of the mouth, namely, that they be truthful. Hence, he says,
        truthful speech, namely, speaking and preaching what is true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        222. – But how they should act in regard to the perfection of a work, he
        tells them when he says, in the power of God, i.e., in let us not put
        confidence in our own works, but only in the power of God: “For the
        kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power” (1 Cor. 4:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        223. – Then when he says, with the weapons of righteousness, he shows
        how they should act in doing good in prosperity and adversity; and this
        pertains to the virtue of justice. First, he shows this in general;
        secondly, he explains it in particular. He says therefore, that we
        should show ourselves as God’s ministers in much patience and what is
        more with the weapons of righteousness [by the armor of justice]. Here
        it should be noted that justice ordains and makes a man keep his place
        for the right hand, i.e., in prosperity, namely, that he not be lifted
        up; and for the left hand, i.e., in adversity, namely, that he not be
        cast down: “In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret of
        facing plenty and hunger, abundance and want” (Phil. 4:12). Then he
        explains this by the two sides, prosperity and adversity, saying, in
        honor and dishonor. Here it should be noted that in temporal affairs
        prosperity and adversity consist in three things, namely, the pride of
        life, in the concupiscence of the flesh, and in the concupiscence of the
        eyes: “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust
        of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the
        world” (1 Jn. 2:16). He treats these in order. First, he shows how they
        should act in prosperity and adversity as pertaining to the pride of
        life; secondly, in things which pertain to the concupiscence of the
        flesh (v. 9); thirdly, pertaining to the concupiscence of the eyes (v.
        10b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        224. – Now there are two things which pertain to pride, namely,
        excellence of state and of works. Hence he says, in honor, i.e., by a
        condition of excellence. As if to say: let us show ourselves as God’s
        ministers, namely, by the glory of God, that is, in prosperity: “The
        LORD of hosts has purposed it, to defile the pride of all glory” (Is.
        23:9). That the apostles seemed glorious is shown in Acts (chap. 14),
        when Paul and Barnabas were taken as gods. And dishonor, which is on the
        left. As if to say: let us neither be lifted up by glory nor, if we are
        contemptible, be cast down: “God chose what is low and despised in the
        world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are” (1
        Cor. 1:28). As to reports about works, he says, in ill repute and good
        repute. Here it should be noted that, as Gregory says, a man should not
        be the cause of his own bad reputation among those who are outside;
        rather he should try to acquire a good reputation, as Sir. (41:15) says:
        “Better is the man who hides his folly than the man who hides his
        wisdom,” and this for the sake of others, because we need to have a good
        reputation among those who are outside (1 Tim. 3:7). But if anyone
        happens to fall into bad repute unjustly, he should not be fainthearted
        or abandon holiness on that account. But if he has a good reputation
        among unbelievers, he should not be proud but take a middle path between
        the two. Then he explains the two things he mentioned. First, the evil
        reputation they had and to what a degree. Hence he says, as imposters
        and yet true. As if to say: some regard us as deceivers and some as
        honest. But this is not strange, because even in the case of Christ some
        said that he was good, and some that he was not, but that he was
        deceiving the multitude, as it says in Jn. (7:12). Secondly, he shows
        how they were noble and ignoble. Hence he says, as unknown and yet well
        known, i.e., approved by the good and unknown, i.e., despised by the
        evil: “We have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the
        offscouring of all things” (1 Cor. 4:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        225. – Then he discusses the things which pertain to the concupiscence
        of the flesh and mentions three things which the flesh desires: first,
        it desires a long life; as to this he says, as dying, i.e., although we
        are exposed to the dangers of death: “And often near death” (2 Cor.
        11:23), and behold we live in virtue and faith. Therefore, Hab. (2:4)
        says: “But the righteous live by their faith”; “I shall not die, but I
        shall live” (Ps. 118:17). Secondly, it desires health and repose; as to
        this he says, as punished and yet not killed. As if to say: although we
        are chastised with many stripes by the Lord, yet he has not delivered us
        over to death: “The Lord has chastened me sorely, but he has not given
        me over to death” (Ps. 118:13); “Indeed all who desire to live a godly
        life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12). Thirdly, it
        desires joy and pleasantness; as to this he says, as sorrowful, yet
        always rejoicing. For although in outward things and things which
        pertain to the flesh, we suffer sadness and bitterness, yet inwardly we
        have continual joy, which grows in us by the consolations of the Holy
        Spirit and by the hope of an eternal reward: “Count it all joy, my
        brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2); “You will have pain,
        but your pain will turn into joy” (Jn. 16:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        226. – Then he discusses the things which pertain to the concupiscence
        of the eyes, and in regard to this he mentions two things. One of these
        is in relation to others, and according to this the right hand in riches
        consists in a man abounding, so that he can minister to others from his
        riches. But the left hand consists in a man’s being so poor that he must
        beg from others. Hence he says that in these temporal things we are as
        poor, i.e., receiving from others; but as to spiritual things, yet
        making many rich. He does not say, “all,” because not all are ready to
        be enriched: “Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth” (Prov.
        13:7). The second is in relation to themselves, and according to this,
        prosperity in riches is to possess many; but the left side is that he
        have absolutely nothing. In regard to this he says that in external
        things they are as having nothing, namely, in temporal things, because
        they have forsaken all things for Christ: “If you would be perfect, go,
        sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
        in heaven” (Matt. 19:21). But inwardly and in spiritual things,
        possessing all things, namely, by an inner greatness of heart. And this
        is so because they lived not for themselves, but for Christ.
        Consequently, all that were Christ’s they regarded as their own. Hence,
        since all things are subject to Christ, they possessed all things, and
        all things tended to their glory: “Every place that the sole of your
        foot will tread upon I have given to you” (Jos. 1:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        227. – Note in regard to the foregoing that the Apostle employs a
        remarkable manner of speaking. For he, as it were, always sets one thing
        against another, and temporal against spiritual. But yet in temporal
        things he always adds a condition, namely, as or as though, but in the
        opposite spiritual things he adds nothing. The reason for this is that
        temporal things, whether they be good or evil, are changeable and
        apparent, and they have only a likeness to good and evil. Hence he says,
        as imposters and as unknown, because they were not so in reality, but
        only in men’s opinion. Consequently, they were transitory good or evils.
        But spiritual goods are existent and true; therefore, he adds no
        condition to them.

        11 Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide. 12 You are
        not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. 13
        In return—I speak as to children—widen your hearts also. 14 Do not be
        mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and
        iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? 15 What accord has
        Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
        16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the
        temple of the living God; as God said, “I will live in them and move
        among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 17
        Therefore come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord,
        and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, 18 and I will be a
        father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord
        Almighty.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        228. – After teaching them the use of grace as to good outward actions,
        the Apostle now instructs them about this use in regard to internal
        devotion, which consists in joy of heart, which causes the heart to
        enlarge. In regard to this he does three things. First, he offers
        himself as an example of this enlargement; secondly, he shows that they
        have no contrary example, nor could they have (v. 12); thirdly, he
        exhorts them to enlarge their hearts (v. 13). In regard to the first he
        does two things: first, he gives a sign of an expanded heart; secondly,
        he mentions the expansion of heart he had (v. 11b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        229. – Now the sign of an expanded heart is an open mouth, because it
        adheres immediately to the heart. Hence, the things we express by the
        mouth are express signs of the thoughts of the heart: “For out of the
        abundance of the heart the mouth speaks” (Matt. 12:34). And this is what
        he says: our mouth is open to you. For the mouth is closed sometimes
        when the things in the heart are not outwardly apparent, but it is
        opened when the things in the heart are manifested: “After this Job
        opened his mouth” (Job 3:1); “And he opened his mouth and taught them”
        (Matt. 5:2). But that it might not seem to pertain to the vice of vanity
        that he manifest himself, he gives a reason, saying, to you, i.e., for
        your benefit we manifest to you the secrets of our heart: “Not seeking
        my own advantage, but that of many” (1 Cor. 10:33).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        230. – The cause of this enlargement comes from enlarging and widening
        the heart. Hence he says, our heart is wide [enlarged]: “The raising of
        the eyes is the enlarging of the heart” (Prov. 21:4, Vulgate). But
        sometimes the heart is narrow, namely, when it is pressed together and
        confined in a small place, as when a person cares for nothing but
        earthly things and scorns the heavenly, not being able to grasp them
        with his mind. But sometimes is it wide, namely, when a person seeks and
        desires great things. Such was the case with the Apostle, who did not
        regard the things which are seen, but desired heavenly things. Hence he
        says, our heart is enlarged, i.e., expanded for desiring great things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        231. – Then he shows that they have no contrary example from the
        Apostle, saying, You are not restricted by us [straightened]. As if to
        say: from the fact that we show you the largeness of our heart, you do
        not have an example or a reason why you should be straightened. But if
        you do this, then indeed you are straightened, but not by us, but in
        your own affections, i.e., by yourselves. Here it should be noted that
        to be straightened is the same as to be enclosed in something, from
        which no exit appears. But they have been deceived by a false apostle to
        such a degree that they did not believe salvation was possible without
        observing legal ceremonies. As a result, they became slaves, whereas
        they had been free according to the faith of Christ. Hence, the
        confinement of this slavery did not come to them from the Apostle, but
        from their bowels, i.e., from the hardness of their hearts: “Do not weep
        for me, but weep for yourselves and your children” (Lk. 23:28).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        232. – Then he urges them to enlarge their hearts, saying, In return
        [having the same recompense], widen your hearts also. As if to say: if
        you had been deceived and straightened by a false apostle, then do not
        continue in that state, but try to have a large heart, as we have,
        because you love the same recompense as we. Therefore he says, having
        the same recompense as we: “For we know that as you share in our
        sufferings, so also you share in our consolation” (2 Cor. 1:7). I speak
        as to children, and not to enemies, as to children of God, namely, heirs
        of eternal life: “And if children, then heirs” (Rom. 8:17). Having the
        same recompense, I say, widen your hearts also, i.e., have a large heart
        and free with the freedom of the Spirit, which is in the faith of
        Christ, and be not straightened in the slavery of legal observances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        233. – Then when he says, Do not be mismated with unbelievers, he
        teaches them the use of grace as to avoiding unbelievers. In regard to
        this he does three things. First, he exhorts them; secondly, the reason
        for the exhortation (v. 14b); thirdly, he confirms this reason with an
        authority (v. 16b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        234. – He says therefore, Do not be mismated [bear the yoke] with
        unbelievers. Here it should be noted that a yoke is anything which binds
        several to do something. Hence, because some come together sometimes to
        do something good, which is from God, and some to do something evil,
        which is from the devil, we speak of God’s yoke and the devil’s yoke.
        God’s yoke is charity, which binds a man to serve God: “Take my yoke
        upon you” (Matt. 11:29). But the devil’s yoke is for doing evil: “The
        yoke of his burden” (Is. 9:4). Therefore he says this: Do not be
        mismated, i.e., do not take part in works of unbelief, with unbelievers;
        and this for two reasons. First, because there were some among them who
        considered themselves wiser, not refraining from idolatry; as a result
        they scandalized the lowly. But there were others who took part with the
        Jews in the traditions of their elders. Hence, the Apostle exhorts them
        and says, do not be mismated with unbelievers, i.e., do not communicate
        with the Jews in the traditions of the Law or with Gentiles in the
        worship of idols, for both groups were unbelievers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        235. – He gives the reason for this when he says, For what partnership
        have righteousness and iniquity? This is based on two distinctions: one
        regards the cause and the other the state. The distinction as to cause
        is twofold, namely, as to habitual and as to efficient cause. The
        habitual cause is also twofold: one as to effect, and this is what he
        says: For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity [justice with
        injustice]? As if to say: you should not bear the yoke with unbelievers,
        because there is one habit in you and another in them. In you it is the
        habit of justice; in them it is the habit of iniquity. But the higher
        justice is to render to God what is his, and this is to worship him.
        Hence, since you worship God, the habit of justice is in you. But the
        greatest iniquity is to take from God what is his and give it to the
        devil: “I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly” (Is. 1:13); “What
        has straw in common with wheat” (Jer. 23:28). The other habitual cause
        is in regard to the intellect; and this distinction is that the faithful
        are enlightened with the light of faith, but unbelievers are in the
        darkness of errors. As to this he says, Or what fellowship has light
        with darkness? As if to say: it is not right for you to communicate with
        them, because it is not a suitable fellowship, because you are light
        through knowledge of the faith: “For once you were darkness, but now you
        are light in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8), but they are darkness through
        ignorance: “The way of the wicked is like deep darkness” (Prov. 4:19).
        Hence, from the beginning the Lord separated the light from the
        darkness, as it says in Gen. (1:18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        236. – As to the efficient cause he says, What accord has Christ with
        Belial? As if to say: you are the servants of Christ and his members:
        “Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it” (1 Cor.
        12:27), but they are members of the devil. The devil is called Belial,
        without a yoke, because he refused to submit to God’s yoke: “For long
        ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds” (Jer. 2:20). That there
        cannot be concord between Christ and Belial is clear from Christ’s
        words: “For the ruler of this world is coming; he has no power over me”
        (Jn. 14:30), as well as from the devil’s words: “What have you to do
        with us, O Son of God?” (Matt. 8:29).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        237. – Another distinction regards the state of faith. In regard to this
        he says, Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? As if to
        say: there is not the same part on both sides, because the part of the
        believer is God, whom he has as a reward and as the end of his
        happiness: “The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup” (Ps. 16:5). But
        the part of the unbeliever is earthly goods: “Because this is our
        portion and this is our lot” (Wis. 2:9); “And he will punish him and put
        him with the hypocrites” (Matt. 24:51). As to the state of grace he
        says, What agreement has the temple of God with idols? As if to say:
        there is no agreement. Hence, you are a temple of God by grace: “Do you
        not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?”
        (1 Cor. 3:16). Therefore, you should not communicate with unbelievers,
        who are temples of idols. But it should be noted that in Ez. 25, the
        Lord forbids idols to be worshipped in God’s temple. Much more then are
        men forbidden, whose souls are God’s temple, to violate them by
        partaking of idols: “If any one destroys God’s temple, God will destroy
        him” (1 Cor. 3:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        238. – Then when he says, For you are the temple of the living God, he
        strengthens his reason with an authority. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he confirms what he had concluded by reason of an
        admonition; secondly, he confirms the admonition itself (v. 17). In
        regard to the first he does two things. First, he reviews what he
        intends to prove; secondly, he quotes an authority to support his
        conclusion (v. 17c).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        239. – He says therefore: rightly do I say that there is no agreement
        between the temple of God and idols, i.e., you should not take part in
        them, because you are the temple of the living God, and not of a dead
        one, as idolaters are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        240. – To prove this he cites an authority, proving this very point from
        the use to which a temple is put. For the use of a temple is that God
        dwell in it, because a temple is a place consecrated for God to dwell
        in: “The Lord is in his holy temple” (Ps. 11:4). This authority is taken
        from Lev. (26:11), which says: “And I will make my abode among you”. In
        this authority four things are touched as pertaining to this use. The
        first pertains to operating grace, which consists in God’s being is
        someone through grace; and this is what he says, I will live in them,
        namely, in the saints, adorning them with grace. For although God is
        said to be in all things by his presence, power, and essence, he is not
        said to dwell in them, but only in the saints through grace; the reason
        being that God is in all things by his activity, inasmuch as he joins
        himself to them as giving esse and conserving it, but in the saints by
        their very activity, by which they attain to God and in a way comprehend
        him, which is to love and to know. For those who know and those who love
        have within themselves the thing known and loved. The second pertains to
        cooperating grace, by which the saints make progress with God’s help; as
        to this he says, I will move among them, i.e., I will promote them from
        virtue to virtue, for this progress is impossible without grace: “By the
        grace of God I am what I am” (1 Cor. 15:10). For just as operating grace
        makes us to be something in the being [esse] of justice, so cooperating
        grace makes us progress in that being [esse]. The third pertains to
        God’s benefits: and this is either the benefit of his protection through
        providence; hence, he touches this when he says, and I will be their
        God, i.e., I will protect them by my providence: “Happy the people whose
        God is the Lord” (Ps. 144:15), or the benefit of recompense. As if to
        say: I will be their God, i.e., I will give them myself as a reward:
        “Your reward shall be very great” (Gen. 15:1); “Therefore God is not
        ashamed to be called their God” (Heb. 11:16). The fourth pertains to
        correct worship and service offered by the saints; as to this he says,
        and they shall be my people, i.e., they will worship me and obey me as
        mine and not another’s: “We are the people of his pasture, the sheep of
        his hand” (Ps. 95:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        241. – Or they could refer to bodily presence; then it is explained this
        way: For I will live in them by assuming flesh: “The Word became flesh
        and dwelt among us” (Jn. 1:14), and I will move among them bodily by
        living with them: “Afterward she appeared upon earth and lived among
        men.” (Bar. 3:37), and I will be their God by glory: “For what great
        nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to
        us” (Deut. 4:7). And they shall be my people, i.e., they will worship me
        in faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        242. – Then when he says, Therefore come out from them, he confirms this
        admonition with another authority. In regard to this he does two things.
        First, he confirms the admonition by an authority; secondly, he
        indicates the reward promised to those who heed the admonition (v. 18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        243. – He says therefore, i.e., because you are temples of God, come out
        from them: “Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing;
        go out from the midst of it” (Is. 52:11). Here he says three things: go
        out, be separated from them, and do not touch anything unclean, because
        there are three ways we should behave toward unbelievers. First, we
        should go out from them by abstaining from sins: “Ho! ho! Flee from the
        land of the north” (Zech. 2:6). But the Donatists say that we must
        depart bodily from an evil society. But this is not true. Hence, the
        Apostle’s words must be understood of a spiritual separation and are
        explained in this way: go out spiritually by not following their life:
        “As a lily among brambles” (S of S 2:2), and this in order to avoid the
        very occasions of sin given by them. Hence he says, be separate, i.e.,
        be far from consenting to them: “For I have come to set a man against
        his father” (Matt. 10:35); “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these
        wicked men” (Num. 16:26). Thirdly, to rebuke them when they do wrong;
        hence he says, touch nothing unclean, i.e., do not consent to them in
        evil: “They not only do them but approve those who practice them” (Rom.
        1:32); “Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead
        expose them.” (Eph. 5:11). And this because “whoever touches pitch will
        be defiled [by it]” (Sir. 13:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        244. – Two rewards are promised to those who heed this admonition,
        namely, familiarity with God and adoption by God. Familiarity with God,
        because I will welcome you. As if to say: go out confidently, because I
        will welcome you as mine: “For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
        but the LORD will take me up” (Ps. 27:10); “Blessed is he whom thou dost
        choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts!” (Ps. 65:5); “Behold my
        servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights” (Is. 42:1).
        Divine adoption, because he adopts us as sons, because he says, I will
        be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters: “For you did
        not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have
        received the spirit of sonship” (Rom. 8:15). He says, sons, as to the
        perfect, and daughters, as to the imperfect; and this is taken from 2
        Sam. (7:14), where it says of Solomon: “I will be his father, and he
        shall be my son.”

        1 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
        every defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the
        fear of God. 2 Open your hearts to us; we have wronged no one, we have
        corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. 3 I do not say this
        to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die
        together and to live together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        245. – Having informed the Corinthians how to behave in the future, the
        Apostle now commends them on the good they have accomplished in the
        past. But in order to connect the past with the future, he first
        concludes his admonition; secondly, he commends them (v. 4). In regard
        to the first he does three things. First, he gives the admonition;
        secondly, he gives himself as an example to have the admonition obeyed
        (v. 2); thirdly, he states his intention in admonishing them (v. 3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        246. – In regard to the first he does three things. First, he gives them
        a motive for observing the admonition, and this is a promise made to
        them. Hence, he says, Since we have these promises, beloved, namely,
        that God may dwell in you, and that you may receive us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        247. – Secondly, he gives the admonition, when he says, let us cleanse
        ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, because those
        promises are given only to those who are clean; and so let us cleanse
        ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, i.e., of carnal and
        spiritual vices: “Purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the
        Lord” (Is. 52:11). Here it should be noted that every sin which is
        consummated in carnal delight is carnal, while that which is consummated
        in spiritual delight is spiritual. That is why carnal sins, if they are
        considered in their consummation, are two in number, namely, gluttony
        and lust; but the others are spiritual sins. But if they are considered
        in their origin, then all sins can be considered carnal, because all of
        them have their origin in a conception of the flesh. In this sense he
        speaks to the Galatians (5:19): “Now the works of the flesh are plain:
        fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity,
        strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy,
        drunkenness, carousing, and the like.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        248. – Thirdly, he mentions how they can fulfil the admonition when he
        says, making holiness perfect in the fear of God. For someone could say:
        were we not cleansed in baptism? That is why he added, making holiness
        perfect, i.e., let us perfect the original cleansing in baptism. For the
        same is holy that is clean: “Be holy, for I am holy” (Lev. 11:44). Let
        us perfect, I say, because philosophers have tried to be perfect and
        have failed, because they were unable to avoid sins. For no matter how
        many other sins they avoided or how well they exercised the acts of the
        virtues, the sin of unbelief remained in them. Consequently, cleanness
        is made perfect only in the true worship of God. And this is what he
        says: in the fear, i.e., in the worship, of God: “The fear of God has
        set itself over all things” (Sir. 25:14, Vulgate). But this seems
        contrary to Col. (3:14): “And above all these put on love, which binds
        everything together in perfect harmony.” Therefore, sanctification is
        not perfected in the fear of God, but in the love of God. I answer that
        he is speaking here of filial fear, which is the effect of charity, and
        not of servile fear, which is contrary to charity. He says, in the fear,
        to teach us to love God with a certain reverence and carefulness. For
        love causes security, which sometimes begets negligence; but one who
        fears is always careful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        249. – Then when he says, open your hearts to us, he offers himself as
        an example. As if to say: take us as an example: “Be imitators of me as
        I am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1). For I have guarded myself against
        uncleanness by holiness, because I have injured no one. Here it should
        be noted that a person might injure his neighbor in three ways, but Paul
        did not injure them in any of these ways. First, in his person, as to
        this he says, we have wronged no one, namely in his person, as wicked
        masters do: “Who tear the skin from off my people” (Mic. 3:2). Secondly,
        in their reputation by inducing them to evil by example and persuasion;
        as to this he says, we have corrupted no one: “Bad company ruins good
        morals” (1 Cor. 15:33). Thirdly, by stealing their goods; as to this he
        says, we have taken advantage of no one: “That no man transgress and
        wrong his brother in this matter” (1 Th. 4:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        250. – Then when he says, I do not say this to condemn you, he discloses
        his intention. As if to say: I do not say this to condemn you, but to
        correct you. For past evils are wont to be recalled sometimes for
        condemnation, when there is no further hope of correction; and sometimes
        for amendment, so that they will be corrected. And this is the way he
        speaks here: I do not say this to condemn you: “I say this for your own
        benefit” (1 Cor. 7:35). The reason for this is because I rejoice in your
        good: for I said before that you are in our hearts: “You yourselves are
        our letter of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and
        read by all men” (2 Cor. 3:2); “It is right for me to feel thus about
        you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with
        me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation
        of the gospel” (Phil. 1:7). You are, I say, in our hearts, namely, to
        die together and to live together. This can be understood of the death
        of guilt and of natural death. Of the death of guilt, not that we are
        prepared to die with you, i.e., not that when you sin, we want to sin,
        but we take your death of guilt with as much pain as our own: “Who is
        weak, and I am not weak?” (2 Cor. 11:29); “I die everyday” (1 Cor.
        15:31). And to live together, because I take as much joy in your good
        life in grace as in my own. Of natural death: then to die together it
        taken to mean that I am prepared to die for you: “I will most gladly
        spend and be spent for your souls” (2 Cor. 12:15); to live together,
        i.e., I desire you to be companions in eternal life: “If we have died
        with him, we shall also live with him” (2 Tim. 2:11).

        4 I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled
        with comfort. With all our affliction, I am overjoyed. 5 For even when
        we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at
        every turn—fighting without and fear within. 6 But God, who comforts the
        downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 7 and not only by his
        coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he
        told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I
        rejoiced still more. 8 For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do
        not regret it (though I did regret it), for I see that that letter
        grieved you, though only for a while. 9 As it is, I rejoice, not because
        you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        251. – Having given an admonition derived from what went before, the
        Apostle now gives his commendation. In regard to this he does two
        things: first, he commends them, secondly, he explains it (v. 5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        252. – He commends them by showing his love, which springs from the good
        works the Corinthians did. For in the hearts of those who love there are
        four feelings (affectus) that usually arise from the good works, which
        the lovers accomplish. First, the feeling of confidence. Hence, he says,
        I have great confidence in you, inasmuch as I am confident that, having
        begun well, you will always get better. Consequently, from the good
        things I have heard about you I hope for greater things to come: “And I
        am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion
        at the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6); “Though we speak thus, yet in
        your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to
        salvation” (Heb. 6:9). And this confidence is good and salutary:
        “Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward”
        (Heb. 10:35).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        253. – Secondly, from this confidence he conceives a feeling of glory;
        for as a result of loving a friend’s good as his own, a person glories
        in that good as he glories in his own. And this is especially true here,
        because he is the cause of their goods, as a teacher is the cause of his
        disciple’s doctrine. Hence he says, I have great pride in you: “The
        glory of a father is a wise son” (Prov. 10:1, Aquinas Latin).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        254. – Then as a result of these two feelings he conceives a feeling of
        consolation, when the one who rejoices and glories in his own goods or
        in those of his friend has a remedy against sadness. This consolation is
        a cure for sadness; and according to the Philosopher every delight
        weakens or entirely destroys sadness. If the delight is contrary to the
        sadness, it totally swallows up the sadness; but if it is not contrary,
        it weakens or diminishes it. This is why when a person is sad, his
        sadness is lessened whenever something joyful is announced to him.
        Therefore, because he heard joyful things about the Corinthians, he
        says, I am filled with comfort, having heard of your amendment: “For as
        we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we share
        abundantly in comfort too” (2 Cor. 1:5); “So if there is any
        encouragement in Christ, any incentive of love, any participation in the
        Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same
        mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind” (Phil.
        2:1-2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        255. – Fourthly, there finally arises a feeling of exuberant joy, for
        although sadness is lessened by certain delights, it is not entirely
        displaced unless there is great joy. But although the Apostle had
        endured many tribulations, yet because he found great joy in the good
        actions of the Corinthians, not only was sadness entirely absorbed, but
        his joy superabounds. Hence he says, With all our affliction, I am
        overjoyed, i.e., my joy overcomes every tribulation that was in my soul:
        “For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus
        at his coming?” (1 Th. 2:19); “Be patient in tribulation” (Rom. 12:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        256. – Then when he says, For even when we came, he explains his
        commendation. But he said that he experienced two things, namely, joy
        and tribulation. First, therefore, he makes manifest his tribulation;
        secondly, his consolation (v. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        257. – He enlarges upon his tribulations for two reasons, namely,
        because the cure was removed, and because the tribulations were
        multiplied. Because of the removal of the cure he says: For even when we
        came, etc. As if to say: indeed I have tribulation, because I am
        consoled by no one, for even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had
        no rest. Here he is referring to the persecution he suffered in
        Macedonia, when he freed a certain possessed maidservant, as we read in
        Acts (16:16). He says, our bodies had no rest, but not “our spirit,”
        because the saints always have peace in spirit. For even in adversity
        the soul, which suffers in the body, rests in the hope of a reward to
        come, although it suffers many things contrary to the desires of the
        flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        258. – But he enlarges upon his tribulations by reason of their number
        when he says, we were afflicted at every turn, i.e., every type of
        tribulation in the body and in the soul: “In the world you have
        tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (Jn.
        16:33). That he had suffered all tribulations he explains when he says,
        fighting without and fear within, i.e., outside myself the combat of
        persecutions, but within, i.e., in the heart, the fear of evil, fearing
        persecutions in the future: “In the open the sword shall bereave” (Deut.
        32:25) But this seems contrary to Prov. (28:1): “But the righteous are
        bold as a lion.” I answer that he is without dread as to the spirit, but
        not as to the flesh. Or without, i.e., outside the Church, combats are
        started by unbelievers; but fear within, lest those who are in the
        Church fall away from the faith on account of persecutors. Or without,
        i.e., in public, fighting, because we are attacked by obvious enemies;
        fear within, which is produced in us by those who call themselves
        friends but are not. For as Boethius says in The Consolation: “No pest
        can inflict more harm than a friendly enemy”; “A man’s foes will be
        those of his own household” (Matt. 10:36).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        259. – Then when he says, But God, who comforts, he states the reason
        for his consolation, which he applauds from two aspects, namely, from
        the gratifying presence of Titus and from the consolation of Titus (v.
        7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        260. – He says therefore: although we were gravely afflicted here, God,
        who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, whose
        presence was very pleasing and a great help to me: “Who comforts us in
        all our affliction” (2 Cor. 1:4). He says, who comforts the downcast
        [humble], because he does not comfort the proud but resists them, as it
        says in James (4:6) and 1 Pet. (5:5). But he comforts the humble by
        giving grace, which is the consolation of the Holy Spirit: “To comfort
        all who mourn” (Is. 61:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        261. – And not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he
        was comforted in you. Here he gives another reason for the Apostle’s
        consolation, namely, the consolation of Titus. The reason for this
        comfort is twofold: first, the amendment of the Corinthians, which they
        had in Titus’ presence; secondly, the devotion they showed to Titus (v.
        13b). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions his
        comfort in the repentance of the Corinthians; secondly, he explains
        something he has said (v. 9b). In regard to the first he does three
        things. First, he mentions the comfort of Titus; secondly, the reason
        for the comfort (v. 7b); thirdly, the effect of the comfort on the mind
        of the Apostle (v. 7c).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        262. – He says therefore: God not only comforted us in the coming of
        Titus, but also in the comfort with which Titus was comforted by you and
        in you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        263. – The reason for this comfort is that Titus himself was comforted
        in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me.
        Here he mentions three praiseworthy things to counter the three
        blameworthy things that were in them. For they were lazy in regard to
        the good; against this he says, he told us of your longing to make more
        progress. They were also prone to evil; against this he says, your
        mourning, namely for sins committed: “Make mourning as for an only son”
        (Jer. 6:26). Finally, they were easily deceived by the false apostles;
        against this he says, your zeal against the false apostles for love of
        me. For previously you were zealous for them against me.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        264. – Then when he says, so that I rejoiced still more, he mentions the
        feeling he conceived from Titus’ consolation, namely, one of joy. Hence,
        in regard to this he does three things: first, he mentions the joy he
        felt; secondly, he intimates his doubts; thirdly, the reason for the
        joy. He says therefore: I was so pleased with the things Titus related
        to me, that I rejoiced still more in that than I grieved in my
        tribulations. For spiritual things must be preferred to temporal things.
        Or that I rejoiced still more for having saddened you than I sorrowed
        before. For they had sinned by fornication, and the Apostle has rebuked
        them, as is evident from the first epistle (chaps. 5-6). But at that
        time he wondered what effect that sadness would have, whether good or
        bad; therefore, in his wonder he felt sad. But later, seeing that good
        had come from it, he was glad. Hence, he says: For even if I made you
        sorry with my letter, I do not regret it now, because you have been
        corrected. And though I did regret it before, namely, when I was
        uncertain whether the sadness would bring you to correct yourselves or
        to despair, seeing that that letter grieved you, though only for a
        while, now I am glad, because you have been converted. Then he gives the
        reason for his joy, because I am not glad that you were made sorrowful,
        but at the effect, namely, your amendment, because you were grieved not
        unto despair, but you were grieved into repenting; just as a physician
        is not glad at the bitterness of the medicine, but at the effect,
        namely, health: “As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing” (2 Cor. 6:10).

        earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, what eagerness to
        clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal,
        what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves guiltless in
        the matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        265. – Having mentioned the comfort the Apostle and Titus experienced at
        the grief of the Corinthians, because it ended in repentance and not in
        despair, he now gives the reason for his comfort by commending their
        sorrow. In regard to this he does two things. First, he commends their
        sorrow; secondly, from this he concludes to his intent (v. 12). In
        regard to the first he does two things: first, he commends their sorrow
        on the part of its cause; secondly, on the part of its effect (v. 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        266. – The cause on account of which he commends their sorrow is that it
        was according to God. Therefore he says: although for a time I was sorry
        for the epistle, nevertheless I rejoice now, for you felt a godly grief.
        Here it should be noted that sorrow and joy and generally every emotion
        arise from love; for a person is sad when he lacks what he loves. The
        kind of love determines the kind of sorrow it causes. But there are two
        kinds of love: one by which God is loved, and from this arises a sorrow
        which is according to God; the other is that by which the world is
        loved, and from this arises a worldly sorrow. The love by which we love
        God makes us serve him gladly, honor him carefully and set some time
        apart for God joyfully. But because sin hinders us from serving God, we
        devote no time to him or seek his honor, the love of God causes sorrow
        for sin: and this is sorrow according to God. This sorrow was not in you
        to produce evil and loss, but fruit and merit. Hence, he says, that you
        suffered no loss through us, because you profit not only from the good
        and pleasant things we bestow on you, but also from the fact that we
        correct and sadden you: “For the moment all discipline seems painful
        rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of
        righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (Heb. 12:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        267. – The when he says, For godly grief, he commends their sorrow
        because of its effect, which is the reward of eternal life. In regard to
        this he does two things. First, he mentions the effect in general;
        secondly, what their experience teaches (v. 11). In regard to the first
        he does two things. First, he mentions the effect of sorrow which is
        according to God; secondly, of sorrow which is according to the world
        (v. 10b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        268. – He says therefore: I say that our sorrow was not a loss for you,
        i.e., for godly grief produces a repentance, I say, that leads to
        salvation, i.e., eternal salvation, which is a steadfast salvation
        belonging to the blessed: “But my salvation will be for ever, and my
        deliverance will never be ended” (Is. 51:6); and this is the work of
        penance: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matt. 3:2). He
        says, steadfast, to exclude temporal, which is transitory and common to
        men and beasts: “Man and beasts you save, O Lord” (Ps. 35:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        269. – But against what he says, that sadness which is according to God
        works penance, it seems that the very sorrow according to God is
        penance. For penance is sorrow over evil and is according to God.
        Therefore it does not work penance. I answer that penance has three
        parts, the first of which is sorrow, namely grief and compunction over
        sins; the other two are confession and satisfaction. Therefore, when he
        says that sorrow works penance, it is to be understood that compunction
        or sorrow for sin works penance in us, i.e., the other parts of penance,
        namely, confession and satisfaction. Or we might say that sorrow
        according to God is more common than penance, because penance is about
        one’s own sins, but one sorrows according to God for his own sins and
        those of others. Thus, therefore, the effect of sorrow according to God
        is eternal salvation, but the effect of sorrow according to the world is
        death. For since a person who loves the world is made an enemy of God,
        as it says in Jas. (4:4), the love of the world causes death. For a
        person is sorrowful according to the world, not because he offended God
        by sin, but because, being caught in his sin, he is punished for it and
        exposed; and this sadness should be avoided in sins (Sir. 30:24,
        Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        270. – Then (v. 11) he explains this effect from the experience learned
        from them. As if to say: a truly steadfast salvation, because it is
        clear from experience that it works in us many things that lead to
        salvation. He mentions six of these things, one of which is general,
        namely, carefulness. For when a person is free of care, it is easy for
        him to become negligent; but when he is sad and fearful, he is careful.
        Hence he says, For see, i.e., you have experienced in your own case,
        what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you to avoid evil and
        to do good: “He has shown you, O man, what is good” (Mic. 6:8); and
        then, “walk carefully with your God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        271. – The other five are special: some pertain to internal feeling and
        some to external action. Of those that pertain to inward feeling, some
        are for the removal of sin, and some for the attainment of good. For a
        true penitent should depart from evil and do good. In regard to the
        removal of evil he lists three, the first of which is to desist from
        evil; as to this he says, what eagerness to clear yourselves, against
        those who induce us to evil: “Resist him, firm in your faith” (1 Pet.
        5:9). Or according to a Gloss, to defend me against the false apostle:
        “Take the whole armor of God” (Eph. 6:13). The second is that a man be
        indignant against himself for the sins he has committed; as to this he
        says, what indignation. For indignation at oneself works sorrow
        according to God: “And my wrath upheld me” (Is. 63:5). The third is that
        he live in continual fear of the future, so as to be wary; as to this he
        says, what alarm at falling again, namely, that the same thing might
        happen in the future: “The fear of God came upon all” (Sir. 25:14,
        Vulgate). As to the attainment of good he lists two things. The first is
        desire for what is good; as to this he says, what longing [desire], by
        which a man is inclined to do good: “The desire of the righteous ends
        only in good” (Prov. 11:23). Secondly, good rivalry, by which one
        strives to imitate those who are good; as to this he says, what zeal to
        imitate me and other good men: “But earnestly desire the higher gifts”
        (1 Cor. 12:31)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        272. – Of those which pertain to outward action he mentions two. The
        first is that they take revenge on themselves for having sinned; and
        this is useful. For since every evil must be punished either by man or
        by God, if he [God] does not punish here, it is better that a man punish
        in himself the evil that he has done than that God do it, because as it
        says in Heb. (10:31): “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of
        the living God.” As to this he says, what punishment, i.e., because you
        punish sinners and even yourselves: “But I pommel my body and subdue it,
        lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified” (1 Cor.
        9:27); (Is. 26:18). The second is that he refrain from sin altogether;
        hence he says, At every point you have proved yourselves, namely, with
        faith leading you, guiltless in the matter, i.e., of being a Christian:
        “But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way” (2 Cor. 6:4);
        “He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
        be holy and blameless before him” (Eph. 1:4); “He who walks in the way
        that is blameless shall minister to me” (Ps. 101:6). Or in the matter
        about which you were corrected, for the favor you did for the
        fornicator; but later by punishing and condemning him you showed that
        you were undefiled in this.

        12 So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did
        the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in
        order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of
        God. 13 Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort we
        rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his mind has been set
        at rest by you all. 14 For if I have expressed to him some pride in you,
        I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true,
        so our boasting before Titus has proved true. 15 And his heart goes out
        all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, and the
        fear and trembling with which you received him. 16 I rejoice, because I
        have perfect confidence in you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        273. – Here the Apostle assigns the reason why he rejoices over them;
        then he draws his conclusion, in which he does two things. First, he
        discloses the intention he had in writing; secondly, he reveals the joy
        he had over their amendment (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        274. – He says therefore: from the fact that you are undefiled, it is
        apparent that although I wrote to you to rebuke you in my epistle, it
        was not only on account of the one who did the wrong by staining his
        father’s chamber with incest, as it says in 1 Cor. (chap. 5), nor on
        account of the one alone who suffered the wrong, namely, on account of
        the father, as if not on account of the zeal for revenge only, but I did
        this that our solicitude might be revealed, which we have for you, i.e.,
        that you might know how careful we are for you. And I say this in the
        sight of God, as an oath with God as witness: “For I want you to know
        how greatly I strive for you” (Col. 2:1). Or another way: I have not
        written to you only for the sake of him that did the wrong, that he
        might be corrected, or for him that suffered it, that he might be
        placated, but that our solicitude for you might be revealed, namely, to
        you who were indignant for the insult and for the punishment inflicted
        on the fornicator: be reconciled to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        275. – Then he concludes to the joy he had at their correction when he
        says, therefore we were comforted. As if to say: because I obtained this
        from writing to you, namely, that you are corrected, therefore, we were
        comforted, i.e., we took comfort. For a man is joyful when he obtains
        what he desired and intended: “But by the grace of God” (2 Cor. 1:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        276. – Then when he says, and besides our own comfort, he states the
        second cause of his comfort, which is taken from the devotion they
        showed to Titus. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
        mentions the joy he felt at Titus’ joy; secondly, the reason for the joy
        (v. 14); thirdly, the matter over which Titus rejoiced (v. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        277. – He says, therefore: we did rejoice at your amendment, and besides
        our own comfort, we rejoiced still more than we were disturbed by the
        tribulation, at the joy of Titus: and this because his mind has been set
        at rest by you all. For a prelate’s spirit is refreshed when his
        subjects are obedient to him and revere him: “Refresh my heart in
        Christ” (Phlm. 20). Set at rest, I say, by you all, because all are
        either amended or there is a hope of amendment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        278. – He assigns the reason for this joy from two aspects: one is on
        the part of the Apostle, namely, because he was found to be truthful.
        For the Apostle had commended the Corinthians to Titus before he went to
        them. But now, because Titus found them to be just as the Apostle had
        said, he rejoiced that his words were true. And this is what he says,
        for if I have expressed to him some pride in you, by commending you, I
        was not put to shame, i.e., I do not blush as having said something
        false. For when a person is found to be a liar, he is ashamed: “A man
        skilled in words may be hated” (Sir. 37:20). But just as everything we
        said to you was true, i.e., as I have preached the truth to you, so our
        boasting before Titus has proved true. The other reason is on the part
        of the Corinthians. For friends desire that those whom they love be
        loved by everyone. Therefore, because Titus loved the Corinthians for
        their devotion, the Apostle rejoices over this and says, and his heart
        goes out all the more to you. As if to say: I not only rejoice because I
        was found to be right, but also because his heart, i.e., his charity and
        great love, goes out all the more to you than before, because he has
        seen your progress; or, more abundantly than towards others: “Put on
        then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness,
        lowliness, meekness, and patience” (Col. 3:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        279. – He discloses that the matters over which he rejoiced were their
        obedience and reverence: obedience, when he says, as he remembers the
        obedience of you all; for this also he praised you: “To obey is better
        than sacrifice” (1 Sam. 15:22); “Listen to me, your father, O children”
        (Sir. 3:1). But their reverence when he says, and the fear, namely,
        filial and not servile, with fear of soul and trembling of body with
        which you received him: “For I bear you witness that, if possible, you
        would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me” (Gal. 4:15). And
        because you acted that way toward him, I rejoiced, for I was found to be
        right and he loves you. Hence, I rejoice, because I have perfect
        confidence in you, not only in good will, but also in good works, that
        you will act well in the future: “In your case, beloved, we feel sure of
        better things that belong to salvation” (Heb. 6:9).

        1 We want you to know, brethren, about the grace of God which has been
        shown in the churches of Macedonia, 2 for in a severe test of
        affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have
        overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their part. 3 For they gave
        according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of
        their own free will, 4 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part
        in the relief of the saints— 5 and this, not as we expected, but first
        they gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 6
        Accordingly we have urged Titus that as he had already made a beginning,
        he should also complete among you this gracious work. 7 Now as you excel
        in everything—in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness,
        and in your love for us—see that you excel in this gracious work also. 8
        I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others
        that your love also is genuine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        280. – Having exhorted them to good in general, he now exhorts them to a
        particular good, namely, to contribute to the things being collected for
        the saints at Jerusalem. For, as it says in Acts (chap. 5), and
        suggested in Gal. (2:10), the apostles had charged Paul and Barnabas to
        preach the word of salvation to the Gentiles and exhort them to help the
        saints in Jerusalem, who having sold all their possessions and placed
        them at the feet of the apostles, were in dire need. It is to this that
        he induces them now, and he does two things. First, he urges them to
        give; secondly, he advises them how to give, namely, quickly and
        generously (chap. 9) In regard to the first he does two things. First,
        he treats of what should be given; secondly, of the ministers by whom
        these things will be collected (v. 16). In regard to the first he does
        two things. First, he exhorts them to give; secondly, he rejects any
        excuse (v. 13). He uses three things to urge them to give. First, the
        example of others who gave; secondly, the example of Christ (v. 9);
        thirdly, their own benefit (v. 10). In regard to the first he does three
        things. First, he gives the example; secondly, he shows how he was moved
        by this example (v. 6); thirdly, he suggests that they follow this
        example (v. 7). In regard to the first it should be noted that in order
        to induce the Corinthians to contribute generously, he proposes to them
        the example of the Macedonians and commends them for two things, namely,
        their patience in adversity and their generosity in giving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        281. – In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle urges
        them to give alms, so that their merit may grow. Consequently, he did
        this at a time when they could merit, namely, in the time of grace, for
        that is when alms are meritorious. Therefore he says, We want you to
        know, brethren, about the grace, i.e., the gratuitous gift, of God,
        namely, the bestowing of alms. He calls this a grace, because every good
        we do is from God’s grace. Which grace was not given to them but to me,
        namely, inasmuch as it was by my management and care and urging that the
        Macedonians were moved to this: “To me, though I am the very least of
        all the saints” (Eph. 3:8). It was shown, I say, to me in the churches
        of Macedonia, i.e., among the faithful in Macedonia.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        282. – It was a grace as to two things. First, as to patience, because,
        i.e., for in a severe test of affliction, they have had an abundance of
        joy. Here he lays down the conditions of perfect patience: one is that a
        person be constant, so that he will not be cast down by fear of
        tribulation or by the very experience of tribulation. Hence he says, for
        in a severe test of affliction, they were constant. The other is that
        they rejoice in those tribulations, as we read of St. Lawrence. As to
        this he says, they had an abundance of joy, i.e., the Macedonians:
        “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas.
        1:2); “Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation”(Rom. 12:12). Or:
        in a severe test of affliction, not that which they suffered, but which
        he saw suffered in Macedonia, they have had an abundance of joy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        283. – Secondly, it is a grace as to their generosity in almsgiving; as
        to this he says, and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth
        of liberality on their part. Here he does two things: first, he mentions
        their generosity; secondly, he explains what he had said (v. 3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        284. – He says therefore: not only were they patient in tribulations,
        namely, the Macedonians, but they were also liberal, considering their
        extreme or very noble poverty. According to a Gloss, the raising of the
        spirit above temporal things and a contempt for them makes poverty
        profound. And so their poverty was very profound, because they did not
        have riches and scorned them: “Has not God chosen those who are poor in
        the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom” (Jas. 2:5). This
        poverty, I say, overflowed, i.e., grew into riches by giving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        285. – But the explanation found in this Gloss does not seem to accord
        with the Apostle’s intention; therefore, it must be explained another
        way. Here it should be noted that there are two causes which make a man
        sufficiently ready to give: one is from an abundance of riches, or from
        a contempt for riches. Consequently, in a poor man contempt for riches
        produces the same effect as abundance in a rich man. Hence he says,
        their extreme poverty so overflowed, i.e., produced the effect of
        abundance, in a wealth of liberality on their part, because their heart
        was solely on God. And from this arose their contempt for riches: “The
        integrity of the upright guides them” (Prov. 11:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        286. – Then when he says, For they gave according to their means, he
        explains what he said by commending their generosity as to three things,
        namely, as to the quantity given, the will to give, and the order of
        giving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        287. – As to the quantity given, it was beyond their power. Hence, he
        says: truly I abounded in riches, for they gave according to their
        means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, because they gave so
        much that they were in need later. Or it might be said, and better, that
        there is an internal power of the soul and an external power, namely,
        the amount of one’s riches. The internal power is the soul’s readiness
        to give; hence he says, I can testify that of their own free will that
        they were willing to give according to the internal power of their soul
        and beyond the external power of their riches: “So you will be laying up
        a good treasure for yourself against the day of necessity” (Tob. 4:9).
        But on the other hand, whoever gives beyond his power gives
        immoderately; therefore, he is not worthy of praise. I answer that power
        in giving can be considered in two ways, namely, absolutely and
        according to a proportion. Therefore, when a person gives more than
        others of his proportion, he does not sin; but if he gives absolutely
        above his power, then he gives immoderately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        288. – Thus does he commend their generosity as to the quantity given;
        but he commends it as to their will to give, when he says, of their own
        free will: “Speak to the people of Israel, that they take for me an
        offering; from every man whose heart makes him willing you shall receive
        the offering for me” (Ex. 25:2). They were willing in the sense that
        they asked us, begging us earnestly. As if to say: they not only asked,
        but they induced us by reasons that they might have the favor of taking
        part in the relief of the saints, i.e., be allowed to give their own to
        the poor saints in Jerusalem, not considering that they were doing a
        favor for us, but we for them: “Do not neglect to do good and to share
        what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God” (Heb. 13:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        289. – He also commends their generosity as to the order of giving,
        because they not only gave what they owned, but they first gave
        themselves. For this should be the order of giving, namely, that a man
        be first acceptable to God, for if a man is not pleasing to God, his
        gifts are not acceptable: “And the Lord had regard for Abel and his
        offering” (Gen. 4:4). Therefore he says, and this, not as we expected.
        As if to say: they were truly willing, because not as we expected, i.e.,
        not with the intention we considered, that is, that they would give in
        reparation for sin; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, by
        amending their life, and to us, by obeying in all things, by the will of
        God, which is that man be subject to his vicars: “Obey your leaders and
        submit to them” (Heb. 13:17). A Gloss says that their offerings would
        not have been acceptable, unless they had first given themselves to God.
        Therefore, it seems that alms should not be accepted from sinners. I
        answer that they should not be accepted, when they are given with the
        intention of being nourished in their sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        290. – Having given the example of the Macedonians, he then shows how he
        was moved by this example, when he says, Accordingly we have urged
        Titus. As if to say: we were so moved by this display of generosity by
        the Macedonians, that we desired Titus to make you partakers of that
        grace, namely, that as Titus had already made a beginning, to urge you
        to do good after he saw you amended and to induce you to communion, he
        should also complete among you, and particularly that gracious work of
        giving alms, that it not be lacking to you: “And I am sure that he who
        began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus
        Christ” (Phil. 1:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        291. – Then when he says, Now as you excel in everything, he urges them
        to be influenced by this example. Here he does two things. First, he
        urges them to be prompted by the example of the Macedonians to give
        alms; secondly, he removes a suspicion (v. 8)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        292. – He says therefore: Now as you excel in everything—in faith, in
        utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for us—see
        that you excel in this gracious work also. As if to say: just as you
        surpass the Macedonians in all other graces, so you should surpass them
        in this, namely, in giving alms. And this is what he says: as you excel
        in all other things: first, in things pertaining to the intellect; and
        as to this he says, in faith, by which they believe, and in utterance,
        by which they confess: “For man believes with his heart and so is
        justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved” (Rom. 10:10);
        in knowledge of the Scriptures: “In every way you were enriched in him
        with all speech and all knowledge” (1 Cor. 1:5). Secondly, in things
        pertaining to works; as to this he says, in all earnestness, namely, in
        doing good: “Never flag in zeal” (Rom. 12:11) Thirdly, in things
        pertaining to the effect; as to this he says, and in your love
        spiritually dwelling in us superabundantly: “And above all these put on
        love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony” (Col. 3:14).
        As, I say, you abound in all those things, so I asked Titus to see that
        in this gracious work, namely, of alms, you may also excel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        293. – But because there might be a suspicion that he was ordering them
        to give alms, contrary to what is stated in Ezek. (34:4): “With force
        and harshness you have ruled them,” he removes this, saying: I say this
        not as a command, i.e., what I asked Titus, or the fact that I say this
        to you, I did not do as though commanding: “Not as domineering over
        those in your charge but being examples to the flock” (1 Pet. 5:3). But
        I say this to prove, i.e., desiring to prove, by the earnestness of
        others, namely, the Macedonians, that your love also is genuine. Here it
        should be noted that a good disposition refers not only to an aptitude
        to learn easily, but also to acting well, the reason being that in order
        to act well, a knowledge which directs is necessary. Therefore, just as
        in learning, a person is said to have a good disposition, if he quickly
        grasps the words of the teacher, so in doing good a person is said to
        have a good disposition, if he is quickly moved to do good by the
        example of others. That is why the Apostle says, to prove that your love
        also is genuine, i.e., how prompt a will you have for giving when moved
        by the example of the Macedonians: “I do not write this to make you
        ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children” (1 Cor. 4:14).

        9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
        rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might
        become rich. 10 And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you
        now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire,
        11 so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your
        completing it out of what you have. 12 For if the readiness is there, it
        is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he has
        not. 13 I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, 14
        but that as a matter of equality your abundance at the present time
        should supply their want, so that their abundance may supply your want,
        that there may be equality. 15 As it is written, “He who gathered much
        had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        294. – Here he uses the example of Christ to induce the Corinthians to
        give alms, saying: I wish to approve your good disposition, namely, for
        giving to the poor, and you should do this by reason of Christ’s
        example. For, that is, because you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, which he conferred on the human race: “Grace and truth came
        through Jesus Christ” (Jn. 1:17). This is called grace, because whatever
        the Son of God assumed of our punishments, all must be imputed to grace,
        because he was not anticipated by anyone’s goodness, or compelled by
        anyone’s power, or induced by any necessity of his own. But it is grace,
        because he for your sake he became poor [needy]. He says, needy, which
        is more than poor; for a needy person is one who not only has very
        little, but is destitute; but a poor man is one who has a little.
        Therefore, to signify the extent of his poverty, he says, he became poor
        [needy], namely, in temporal things: “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay
        his head” (Lk. 9:58); “Remember my affliction” (Lam. 3:19). He was made
        needy not from necessity but willingly, because that grace would not
        then be a grace. Hence he says, though he was rich, namely, in spiritual
        goods: “The same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who
        call upon him” (Rom. 10:12); “Riches and honor are with me” (Prov.
        8:18). He says, being, and not “having been,” lest it seem that Christ
        lost his spiritual riches when he assumed poverty. For he assumed this
        poverty in such a way that he did not lose those inestimable riches:
        “Both rich and poor together” (Ps. 49:2). Rich is spiritual things, poor
        in temporal things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        295. – The reason he willed to be made needy is added, when he says, so
        that by his poverty you might become rich, i.e., that through his
        poverty in temporal things, you might become rich in spiritual things.
        And this for two reasons: for an example and for a sacrament. For an
        example, indeed, because if Christ loved poverty, we also should love it
        because of his example. But by loving poverty in temporal things, we are
        made rich in spiritual things: “Has not God chosen those who are poor in
        the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has
        promised to those who love him?” (Jas. 2:5). This is why he says, so
        that by his poverty you might become rich. For the sacrament, however,
        because everything Christ did or endured was for our sake. Hence, just
        as by the fact that he endured death, we were delivered from eternal
        death and restored to life, so by the fact that he suffered need in
        temporal things, we have been delivered from need in spiritual things
        and made rich in spiritual things: “That in every way you were enriched
        in him with all speech and all knowledge” (1 Cor. 1:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        296. – Then when he says, And in this matter I give my advice, he
        induces them to give on their part. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he shows the benefit they will obtain from this;
        secondly, he shows that this is desired from itself, namely, that they
        would give alms (v. 10b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        297. – He says therefore: considering this benefit, I give my advice,
        i.e., I urge you to give alms not only for the benefit of the saints in
        Jerusalem but also for your benefit: “The good counsels of a friend are
        sweet to the soul” (Prov. 27:9, Vulgate). And this is because it is best
        for you. For the good of piety is more beneficial to the doer than to
        the one to whom it is done, because the doer obtains a spiritual benefit
        from it, but the recipient a temporal one. And just as the spiritual is
        preferred to the temporal, in works of piety the profit to the giver is
        preferred to the benefit of the recipient: “Godliness is of value in
        every way” (1 Tim. 4:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        298. – But this is not only profitable to them, but they also wanted
        this; hence he says, now to complete what a year ago you began not only
        to do but to desire. Here he does three things. First, he reminds them
        of their good start; secondly, he urges them to the due end (v. 11);
        thirdly, he explains something he had said (v. 12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        299. – He says therefore: in truth you should give alms gladly, because
        this is not only profitable to you, but you began not only to do but to
        desire this spontaneously, namely, to give alms, a year ago, i.e.,
        before I came to you. As if to say: it is better to will than to do: “So
        a word is better than a gift” (Sir. 18:16). Therefore, you should be
        eager to give.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        300. – And because you are eager to give, therefore, now complete in
        deed what you had in your intention; otherwise that willingness is in
        vain: “Let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth” (1
        Jn. 3:18); “And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will
        bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6). The
        reason for this is so that your readiness in desiring it, i.e., the
        judgment of your will, according to a Gloss is prompt, may be matched by
        your completing it. Or another way, so that mind is taken for will, and
        then the sense is: as you were prompt in willing, so be prompt in
        accomplishing, and this out of what you have, i.e., according to your
        means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        301. – Then he explains what he means by out of what you have, saying,
        For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man
        has. As if to say: I say that you should be prompt to give, but I do not
        wish to burden you in this matter, namely, that you would give beyond
        your means, because perhaps your will inclines you to this; but in this
        matter the work cannot follow the will. Therefore he says, out of what
        you have. For, i.e., because, if the readiness is there, it is
        acceptable according to what a man has, the reason being that the will
        is accepted in the accomplishment of the work; but the work is not
        perfected except from what a man has; hence he says, it is acceptable
        according to what a man has: “If you have much, give generously; if you
        have a little, then try to impart a little gladly” (Tob. 4:9, Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        302. – Then when he says, I do not mean, he removes a suspicion. For
        someone could say: if we give alms to the saints in Jerusalem, they will
        live in idleness, while we suffer a loss and become wretched. Therefore
        the Apostle first removes the suspicion; secondly he shows his intention
        (v. 13b); thirdly, he confirms it by authority (v. 14b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        303. – He removes this suspicion when he says, I do not mean that others
        should be eased and you burdened. As if to say: I do not urge you to
        give alms in order that others might be refreshed, as they live in
        idleness off your alms, while you are burdened, impoverished, because
        you would be afflicted. But do they commit sin who give everything to
        others and they are later afflicted with poverty? It seems so from these
        words of the Apostle. I answer that according to a Gloss, it would be
        better to give all to the poor and be afflicted with Christ. But what
        the Apostle says here is out of condescension, because they were weak
        and might perhaps have fallen away if they were pressed by need.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        304. – He discloses his intention when he says, but that as a matter of
        equality your abundance at the present time should supply their want. As
        if to say: I do not seek your affliction, but an equality, namely, that
        your abundance supply their want. This can explained in three ways.
        First, as an equality of quantity; secondly, an equality of proportion;
        thirdly, an equality of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        305. – An equality of quantity, because they, i.e., the Corinthians,
        abounded in temporal things and were wanting in spiritual things; but
        the saints in Jerusalem abounded in spiritual things and were lacking in
        temporal things. Therefore he desired that an equality of quantity be
        established between them, namely, that those who abounded in temporal
        things give half of everything to those in need of them, while the
        others should give half of their spiritual things to them, so that they
        would be equally rich. Therefore, he says rather, that as a matter of
        equality of quantity, i.e., from a half-share of your goods at the
        present time, which is short, let your abundance of earthly goods supply
        their want in spiritual goods, i.e., that you may be partakers of
        eternal life: “Make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous
        mammon” (Lk. 16:9); “In dividing the lot, give and take” (Sir. 14:15);
        i.e., give temporal things and accept spiritual things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        306. – As an equality of proportion it is explained in the following
        way, and better: you Corinthians have an abundance of temporal goods,
        but the saints of Jerusalem an abundance of spiritual goods. I wish,
        therefore, that as a matter of equality, not according to quantity, but
        according to proportion, namely, that as they are sustained by your
        alms, so may you be enriched by their prayers to God. For just as they
        are not as rich in your temporal goods as you are rich, so neither are
        you as rich in their spiritual goods as they are. And so he says: but by
        an equality in the present time your abundance of earthly things should
        supply their want of earthly good, so that their abundance of spiritual
        things may supply your want: “If we have sown spiritual good among you,
        is it too much if we reap your material benefits?” (1 Cor. 9:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        307. – It is explained as an equality of will in this way: but by an
        equality your abundance at the present time should supply their want,
        i.e., I desire an equality of will to be in you, that just as they are
        willing to communicate to you the things in which they abound, so you
        would have the will to communicate to them the things in which you
        abound.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        308. – Then he confirms this with an authority; hence he says, As it is
        written, namely in Ex. (16:18): “He who gathered much”, i.e., had
        collected more manna than an omer, “had nothing over”, i.e., did not
        have more than his sufficiency; “and he who gathered little had no
        lack”, i.e., he did not fall short of it, because all had an equal
        abundance, as it says in Ex. (16:18). And so neither he who had

        16 But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the
        heart of Titus. 17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but being
        himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord. 18 With him
        we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his
        preaching of the gospel; 19 and not only that, but he has been appointed
        by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are
        carrying on, for the glory of the Lord and to show our good will. 20 We
        intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are
        administering, 21 for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord’s
        sight but also in the sight of men. 22 And with them we are sending our
        brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but
        who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in
        you. 23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker in your
        service; and as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches,
        the glory of Christ. 24 So give proof, before the churches, of your love
        and of our boasting about you to these men.

        309. – After dealing with the collections, to which they should
        contribute, the Apostle then deals with the ministers by whom the
        collections should be made. In regard to this he does two things. First,
        he names them; secondly, he recommends them to the Corinthians (v. 24).
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he names Titus;
        secondly, Barnabas (v. 18); thirdly, Apollos (v. 22). Concerning Titus
        he commends two things, namely, his earnest care and the sign of his
        earnest care (v. 17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        310. – He says therefore, in regard to Titus: I have said above that I
        have asked Titus to prove that grace collecting alms, because it has a
        bearing on the care entrusted to me by the apostles, in which I have
        also found him careful. But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest
        care for you into the heart of Titus, as I have, for exhorting you and
        promoting you to works of mercy, because he is as solicitous as I to
        prove this grace for you: “And we desire each one of you to show the
        same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end”
        (Heb. 6:11); “The leader, in diligence” (Rom. 12:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        311. – But the sign of this carefulness is that when I asked him, he
        consented to my exhortation; hence he says, For he not only accepted our
        appeal, and because he carried out what I asked; hence he says, but
        being himself very earnest, of his own accord more than by my
        exhortation, he is going to you, although at first he refused to go on
        account of your sins: “Never flag in zeal” (Rom. 12:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        312. – Then when he says, With him we are sending the brother, he treats
        of the second minister. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        commends him; secondly, he gives the reason why he is sending such
        earnest messengers (v. 20)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        313. – This brother, according to some, is Luke, and according to
        others, Barnabas. Whoever it is, he recommends him on three points,
        namely, on his reputation, because of his fame, that is, Luke’s, is in
        the gospel written by him among all the churches, because it was
        approved by the apostles. Or whose fame, namely, Barnabas’, is in the
        preaching of the gospel among all the churches, because he preached to
        Jews and Gentiles. Hence it is said of Barnabas in Acts (4:38), that he
        was a good man, full of faith and the Holy Spirit. He also commends him
        on his companionship, because not only that, i.e., not only is he
        famous, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in
        this gracious work, i.e., of my preaching, for which we traveled as
        pilgrims over the world: “We know that while we are at home in the body
        we are away from the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6). And this is true of Luke,
        because he was one of the seventy-two disciples and a companion of Paul.
        It is also true of Barnabas, because it was said by the Holy Spirit in
        Acts (13:2): “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I
        have called them.” And he was made a companion for this gracious work,
        namely, to collect the alms, of for this gracious work of preaching, of
        which it says in Eph. (3:8): “To me, though I am the very least of all
        the saints.” He also commends him from his office, because he is a
        minister of grace which we are carrying on: “This is how one should
        regard us, as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1); “Who has made us
        competent to be ministers of a new covenant” (2 Cor. 3:6). But that
        grace is administered for the glory of the Lord, namely, that our Lord
        be glorified by the alms collected after the conversion of many people
        by our preaching, because, as it says in Prov. (14:28): “In a multitude
        of people is the glory of a king.” Likewise it is administered in order
        that our will be fulfilled, because we want this to be done; hence, he
        says, and to show our good will, i.e., predestined by God, who from
        eternity predestined us to have such a will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        314. – Then when he says, We intend, he assigns the cause for why he is
        sending such solemn messengers. First, he assigns the reason for this;
        secondly, he proves it (v. 21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        315. – He says therefore: the reason we are sending such solemn
        messengers is this, that you may know that this affair is in our heart.
        Hence he says, We intend that no one should blame us. As if to say: to
        avoid the accusation that could be lodged against us by others either
        for negligence, if we did not send solemn messengers, or of fraud, if we
        did not send trustworthy men. But they are energetic and prompt and
        trustworthy, because they were given by the churches and chosen by the
        Holy Spirit: “We put no obstacle in any one’s way, so that no fault may
        be found with our ministry” (2 Cor. 6:3). But he says, about this
        liberal gift, namely, of alms, or of converted Gentiles: “As each has
        received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God’s
        varied grace” (1 Pet. 4:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        316. – Then he proves this, saying: for we aim at what is honorable not
        only in the Lord’s sight but also in the sight of men, namely, that the
        good works may be seen by them. And he does this by providing carefully
        and by imitating good men: “Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold
        fast to what is good” (Rom. 12:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        317. – Then when he says, And with them we are sending our brother, he
        deals with the third messenger, namely, Apollos, and he does two things.
        First, he commends him for his diligence, when he says, whom, namely,
        Apollos, we have often tested and found earnest in many matters for your
        salvation, but who is now more earnest than ever. For as is apparent
        above, Apollos was the first one after the Apostle to preach to the
        Corinthians: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth” (1
        Cor. 3:6). But being disturbed at their sin, he departed and put aside
        the carefulness he had previously for them. But now, hearing of their
        conversion, he became more diligent than ever for their salvation:
        “Eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph.
        4:3); “The leader, in diligence” (Rom. 12:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        318. – Secondly, he discloses the cause of the diligence he assumed,
        because Apollos is confident of you from the things Titus has said about
        you, commending you. Hence, he says, because of his great confidence in
        you. As for Titus, he is my partner, and because he gladly went in
        fellowship with Titus and Luke, or Barnabas, and because he was induced
        to do this by the apostles of the Church, who are in Judea. And
        therefore he says: as for our brethren, they are messengers of the
        churches of Judea, that is, they induced him to have a care for you;
        which churches are the glory of Christ, i.e., to the glory of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        319. – Then when he says, so give proof, he recommends those messengers
        to the Corinthians, saying: because I have sent such men to you, so give
        proof, before the churches, of your love and of our boasting about you
        to these men, i.e., show by your deeds that you have charity toward
        them, and that he has truthfully commended you, and that he was right in
        boasting about you, before the churches, where I have been and to whom I
        have preached; or: before the churches, because what you do to them will
        be made known to all the churches.

        1 Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for
        the saints, 2 for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to
        the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last
        year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them. 3 But I am sending the
        brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case,
        so that you may be ready, as I said you would be; 4 lest if some
        Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we be
        humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident. 5 So I thought
        it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange
        in advance for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not
        as an exaction but as a willing gift. 6 The point is this: he who sows
        sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will
        also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must do as he has made up his mind,
        not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        320. – Having exhorted the Corinthians to give alms to the saints in
        Jerusalem, the Apostle now admonishes them how to give, namely,
        cheerfully and abundantly. Hence, in order that they might give
        properly, he has sent them important messengers. In regard to this he
        does two things. First, he excludes the supposed cause for sending the
        messengers; secondly, he gives the true one (v. 3). In regard to the
        first he does three things. First, he excludes a suspicion; secondly, he
        assigns the cause for this (v. 2); thirdly, he proves the cause (v. 2b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        321. – As to the first, because someone could say to the Apostle: you
        urge us to receive your messengers cordially, but why do you not rather
        urge us to give alms properly. Therefore, rejecting this, he says: it is
        not necessary for me to urge this now, i.e., because, it is superfluous
        for me to write to you about the offering for the saints.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        322. – And the reason for this is because I know your readiness to help
        them: “My heart is steadfast, O God”(Ps. 108:1). That your mind is ready
        I prove by two things. First, from our boasting of you, for unless I
        knew that you were ready for this, I would not have boasted to them
        about you. Therefore he says, of which, namely, the promptitude of your
        mind: “For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience” (2 Cor.
        1:12); “I have great confidence in you” (2 Cor. 7:4). I boast about you
        to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia, in which Corinth is the
        metropolis, has been ready since last year to give. Secondly, from the
        effect, because you have provoked many to do this by your example. Hence
        he says, and your zeal, i.e., the desire to imitate you, has stirred up
        most of them, for since they heard of your progress after your
        amendment, many were provoked to make progress: “Iron sharpens iron, and
        one man sharpens another” (Prov. 27:17); “For a good purpose it is
        always good to be made much of” (Gal. 4:18); “But earnestly desire the
        higher gifts” (1 Cor. 12:31).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        323. – Then when he says, But I am sending the brethren, he establishes
        the true cause for why he was sending such solemn messengers. First, he
        lays down the general reason; secondly, the special reason (v. 3b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        324. – Concerning the first he does two things. First, he assigns the
        true cause, saying: the reason why I have sent them is not that I
        believe you are not willing to help the poor, but that our boasting
        about you may not prove vain, if you should fail: “For I would rather
        die than have any one deprive me of my ground for boasting” (1 Cor.
        9:15). That it not be made void, I say, in this case, because it is
        evident to me that in the other virtues and good deeds you will not void
        by glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        325. – Secondly, when he says, so that you may be ready, as I said you
        would be, he urges them to give in the proper way. First, he urges them
        to give readily; secondly, that they may give abundantly (v. 5);
        thirdly, that they may give cheerfully (v. 7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        326. – In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions how
        to give; secondly, he assigns the reason (v. 4). The way to give is
        promptly; hence he says, I sent the ministers so that you may be ready,
        as I said you would be, namely, after the example of the Macedonians:
        “And those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast” (Matt.
        25:10); “Do not say to your neighbor, ‘Go, and come again, tomorrow I
        will give
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        it’ – when you have it with you” (Prov. 3:28). The reason for this is
        lest if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready,
        we be humiliated. As if to say: it will be to your shame if you have
        promised and not paid. But even if you can stand it and you do not care
        about your shame, at least think of our embarrassment, who say that you
        are prepared.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        327. – Then when he says, So I thought it necessary, he urges them to
        give abundantly. In regard to this he does two things. First, he gives
        the admonition; secondly, he gives the reason for it (v. 6)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        328. – He says therefore: lest our boasting be voided and you be put to
        shame, I thought it necessary to urge the brethren, namely, Titus and
        Apollos, to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift
        [blessing] you have promised, namely, the alms, which is called a
        blessing because it is a cause of eternal blessedness. For by the act of
        giving a man is blessed by the Lord: “He will receive blessing from the
        Lord” (Ps. 24:4); and by men: “The lips of many shall bless him that is
        liberal of his bread” (Sir. 31:28, Vulgate); “He who has a bountiful eye
        will be blessed” (Prov. 22:9). And he calls this a blessing to be
        prepared, as a willing gift, i.e., abundantly, not as an exaction, i.e.,
        not sparingly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        329. – The reason why they should give abundantly is because, I say, he
        who sows sparingly, i.e., who gives little in this world, will also reap
        sparingly, i.e., will receive little in the other world. And he says,
        sows, because our seeds are whatever good we do; and again, if little is
        sown, not much is gathered: “For he who sows to his own flesh will from
        the flesh reap corruption” (Gal. 6:8); but multiplied: And he who sows
        bountifully, i.e., abundantly, will also reap bountifully, i.e., the
        generous reward of God. But will not all reap abundantly? Yes, as to the
        quantity of the reward, because all will abound and no one will reap
        sparingly. But he says, bountifully, in proportion to those sowing well:
        “Star differs from star in glory” (1 Cor. 15:41). All will reap
        abundantly as to the substantial reward, but sparingly as to the
        accidental reward, in which the saints will differ: “As it is written,
        ‘He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had
        no lack’” (2 Cor. 8:15), because sometimes a person gives sparingly and
        with great charity, and reaps abundantly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        330. – Then when he says, each one must do, he exhorts them to give
        cheerfully and joyfully. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        urges them to give joyfully; secondly, he gives the reason (v. 7b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        331. – He says therefore: I say that you should prepare what you intend
        to give as a gift, i.e., abundantly, and as worthy of a blessing, and
        not as an exaction, i.e., not sparingly. He says this, because what is
        done spontaneously cannot be done with covetousness. Therefore he adds,
        Each one must do as he has made up his mind, as though without
        covetousness, because each one of you should give his alms as he has
        made up, i.e., decided beforehand, in his mind [heart], namely,
        conferring with himself. Not reluctantly or under compulsion: as if to
        say: let each one give willingly, not as being forced. Here he mentions
        the two things opposed to a voluntary action, namely, sadness and
        necessity. For a voluntary action is destroyed by violence, which is of
        two kinds, namely, simple and mixed. It is simple, when someone is
        absolutely compelled to do something against his will. To remove that
        violence he says, not reluctantly, which would be present if they gave
        as though compelled by the command of the Apostle. As if to say: do not
        permit my command to compel you to give, but let your ready will move
        you to do this: “Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the
        Lord’s offering” (Ex. 35:5). But a mixed violent action happens when one
        is not absolutely forced to do something against his will, but in a
        qualified sense, namely, that he would incur great harm, unless he did
        it; for example, if a ship would sink, unless the cargo were thrown
        overboard. Therefore in one sense it is done willingly, and in another
        sense by force, inasmuch as he is compelled by fear of a greater loss.
        Therefore, to remove this he says, not under compulsion, i.e., not
        making it a mixed violent action. As if to say: not from fear of shame,
        but from the joy you have conceived because of the love you have towards
        the saints: “With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee” (Ps.
        54:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        332. – Then when he says, For God loves a cheerful giver, he gives the
        reason, which is this: everyone who rewards gives a reward for things
        worthy of a reward; but only acts of the virtues are such. But in the
        acts of the virtues there are two elements, namely, the species of the
        act and the manner of acting, which is taken on the side of the one
        acting. Hence, unless both are found in an act of virtue, that act is
        not said to be absolutely virtuous, just as a person is not said to be
        perfectly just according to the virtue, when he does works of justice,
        unless he acts with delight and with joy. And although with men, who see
        only what is obvious, it is enough that one perform an act of justice
        according to the very species of the act, say an act of justice;
        nevertheless, with God, who sees the heart, it is not enough merely to
        perform the act of a virtue according to the species, but he must also
        act according to the proper manner, namely, with delight and joy.
        Therefore, it is not the giver, but the cheerful giver that God loves,
        i.e., approves and rewards, and not the sad and grumbling one: “Serve
        the Lord with gladness” (Ps. 100:2); “For the Lord is the one who
        repays” (Sir. 35:11); “He who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness”
        (Rom. 12:8).

        8 And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so
        that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in
        abundance for every good work. 9 As it is written, “He scatters abroad,
        he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever.” 10 He who
        supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply
        your resources and increase the harvest of your righteousness. 11 You
        will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us
        will produce thanksgiving to God; 12 for the rendering of this service
        not only supplies the wants of the saints but also overflows in many
        thanksgivings to God. 13 Under the test of this service, you will
        glorify God by your obedience in acknowledging the gospel of Christ, and
        by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others; 14
        while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing
        grace of God in you. 15 Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        333. – Here he gives the reason for the three ways of giving. In regard
        to this he does two things. First, he assigns the reason taken on their
        part; secondly, the reason taken on God’s part (v. 11). In regard to the
        first he does two things. First, he gives the reason; secondly, he
        confirms it (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        334. – The reason is this: whoever gives something which is multiplied
        for him should give promptly, abundantly and cheerfully, just as when we
        see men sowing seed abundantly and promptly and cheerfully, because they
        gather it up again multiplied. Since therefore alms are multiplied for
        those who give them, you should give them promptly, joyfully and
        abundantly. That they are multiplied is evident, because God is able to
        provide you with every blessing. As if to say: do not be afraid to give,
        as though you will be burdened with need and regret having given,
        because God is able to provide you with every blessing of the Holy
        Spirit in abundance, namely, the grace by which you will always rejoice
        in the good work you have done. He says therefore, so that you may
        always be provided in abundance for every good work, i.e., have an
        abundant will to give alms, just s you have for the other works of the
        virtues, and also that you have a full sufficiency of external goods;
        hence he says, always having enough of everything, i.e., considering
        yourself to have: “He gives to all men generously and without
        reproaching, and it will be given him” (Jas. 1:5); “But if we have food
        and clothing, with these we shall be content” (1 Tim. 6:8). Of that
        sufficiency it says below (2 Cor. 12:9): “My grace is sufficient for
        you.” But concerning the multiplication it says in Is. (30:25): “And he
        will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground”; “And every
        one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or
        children or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and
        inherit eternal life” (Matt. 19:29).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        335. – Then when he says, As it is written, he proves his reason in two
        ways, namely, by authority and from experience. He proves it by an
        authority when he says: rightly should this reason move you, because, As
        it is written, “He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his
        righteousness endures for ever.” But a Gloss adduces this authority in a
        sense different from the Apostle’s intention; for the Gloss says: I say
        that you shall abound for every good work, namely, by the giving of
        alms, because, As it is written, “He scatters abroad, he gives to the
        poor.” But the Apostle wishes to refer this to his statement that God is
        able to make every grace abound in you; and this, because he who
        scattered abroad and given to the poor, his justice remains forever: “Do
        good to a godly man, and you will be repaid” (Sir. 12:2). In the
        authority cited we note to whom should be given, namely, to the poor,
        i.e., to the needy: “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite
        your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors, lest
        they also invite you in return, and you be repaid” (Lk. 14:12); how to
        give, namely, he scatters abroad, i.e., not all to one person, but
        divided among many: “If I give away all I have” (1 Cor. 13:3); “Is it
        not to share your bread with the hungry” (Is. 58:7); his righteousness
        [justice], i.e., the reward for justice, endures forever: “But one who
        sows righteousness gets a sure reward” (Prov. 11:18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        336. – He confirms his reason by experience when he says, He who
        supplies seed to the sower and bread for food. As if to say: you know
        from experience that what you give in alms you have from the Lord;
        therefore you should give gladly for the love of God: “For all things
        come from you, and of your own have we given you” (1 Ch. 29:14). He
        suggests three things in regard to this. The first is that someone could
        say: if we give now what we have, what is necessary for daily food will
        be wanting to us. But he rejects this, saying: he not only supplies seed
        to the sower, but bread for food, i.e., the necessities of life: “He who
        gives food to all flesh” (Ps. 136:24). The second is that they could
        say: if we give much, we will not have enough to give again. The Apostle
        answers this, saying that they will not want, but he will multiply your
        sowing, from which you can give more alms. The third is that someone
        could say: if we give now, the will to give will be lost, and we will
        regret having given, and so we shall lose everything. But he removes
        this, saying: he will increase the harvest of your righteousness
        [justice], i.e., he will increase the ability to give alms and the will
        from which your justice proceeds, to such a degree that you will always
        be prepared and ready to give alms, and the fruit will be the most in
        comparison with the small seed: “Honor the LORD with your substance and
        with the first fruits of all your produce” (Prov. 3:9); “I will command
        my blessing upon you” (Lev. 25:21); “Godliness is of value in every way”
        (1 Tim. 4:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        337. – The when he says, You will be enriched in every way, after having
        assigned the reason why they should give promptly, abundantly and
        cheerfully on the part of the donors, he then assigns the reason on
        God’s part, for whom they ought to give. First he assigns the reason
        they should give; secondly, he explains it (v. 12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        338. – In the reason to be assigned, three things are to be considered,
        the first of which is their enrichment, which corresponds to what has
        gone above. For he had said above: he will multiply your sowing and
        increase the fruits of your justice; and he recalls the first, saying:
        You will be enriched in every way, i.e., both in bodily and spiritual
        goods: “That in every way you were enriched in him” (1 Cor. 1:5). But
        lest anyone suppose that his end should be placed in an abundance of
        temporal riches or that he should possess spiritual goods in idleness
        without using them, he refers this first to another second thing: have
        great generosity directed by a simple spirit, so that the giving comes
        from temporal goods but the simplicity from spiritual goods: “The
        integrity of the upright guides them” (Prov. 11:13). But this should
        itself be referred to another end, namely, to God; therefore he adds in
        the third place, which, namely, simple abundance, through us will
        produce thanksgiving to God: “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Th.
        5:18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        339. – Then when he says, for the rendering of this service, he explains
        the reason mentioned above, namely, how their abundance works
        thanksgiving to God. First he shows this; secondly, the reason for
        thanks (v. 13); thirdly, he breaks out in thanksgiving (v. 14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        340. – He says therefore: I say that your abundance works thanksgiving
        to God, for the rendering of this service of yours, by which you help
        the saints, has many good results: “As a matter of equality your
        abundance at the present time should supply their want” (2 Cor. 8:14).
        Not only does this good follow therefrom, but also the fact that they
        pray for you and give thanks to God, proving and approving your service.
        And this is what he says: but also overflows in many thanksgivings to
        God, which are given by many, not only by the perfect, but by the poor
        believers who give thanks to God in the Lord, who moves them to this,
        seeing and approving your ministry: “So that many will give thanks on
        our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers” (2
        Cor. 1:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        341. – This thanksgiving is given for three reasons. First, for their
        faith, which they have received; hence he says: I say that they abound
        in thanksgiving, the faithful glorifying God by your obedience in
        acknowledging the gospel of Christ, i.e., the confession of your faith,
        by which you confess and believe in Christ: “Let your light so shine
        before men” (Matt. 5:16); “The word of a man who hears will endure”
        (Prov. 21:28). Secondly, on account of their abundance; hence he says,
        glorifying God also for the generosity of your contribution for them,
        namely, the holy poor, and for all others, namely, the faithful in need,
        and given with a simple and pure spirit: “Let him who is taught the word
        share all good things with him who teaches” (Gal. 6:6); and “Let us do
        good to all men” (Gal. 6:10). Thirdly, on account of what these saints
        have from God that they may give thanks to God; hence he says:
        glorifying God also in their praying for you, i.e., they glorify God for
        the fact that those holy men pray for you; the men, I say, who are
        desirous of seeing you in eternal happiness; and this because of the
        surpassing grace of God in you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        342. – From this the Apostle breaks forth in thanksgiving to God,
        saying: Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!, that is, for the
        charity which is especially seen in you who even help those who thus
        thank God and pray for you. This gift is inexpressible, because it
        cannot be said how profitable it is, for “What no eye has seen, nor ear
        heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those
        who love him” (1 Cor. 2:9).

        1 I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of

        I am away!— 2 I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show
        boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who
        suspect us of acting in worldly fashion. 3 For though we live in the
        world we are not carrying on a worldly war, 4 for the weapons of our
        warfare are not worldly but have divine power to destroy strongholds. 5
        We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle to the knowledge of God,
        and take every thought captive to obey Christ, 6 being ready to punish
        every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        343. – After dealing with the good ministers of Christ and of the faith,
        the Apostle now attacks false ministers and false apostles. First, he
        attacks these; secondly, those who, being deceived by them, have adhered
        to them (chap. 13). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he
        gives the reason, excusing himself from the task imposed on him;
        secondly, he gives the evidence for the fact (v. 7). In regard to the
        first he does two things. First, he refuses to make a test; secondly, he
        excuses himself with a reason (v. 2b). In regard to the first he does
        three things. First, he entreats them; secondly, he interjects what is
        imposed on them by the false apostles (v. 1b); thirdly, he refuses the
        test (v. 2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        344. – He says therefore: I, Paul, myself, who am urging you and others
        to give alms; I myself, I say, entreat you, by the meekness and
        gentleness of Christ. Of the mildness of Christ, Matt. (11:29) has:
        “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in
        heart, and you will find rest for your souls”; of his modesty, Wis.
        (11:21) has: “For it is always in your power to show great strength, and
        who can withstand the might of your arm?” For modesty consists in
        nothing less than observing the measure in acting. But he makes special
        mention of Christ’s mildness and modesty, because the false apostles and
        the Corinthians accused Paul of acting humbly when he was among them,
        but when he was absent he wrote very harshly. Therefore, he mentioned
        those two qualities of Christ to show that the Apostle also has them and
        observes them after the example of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        345. – Hence, he introduces the vice ascribed to him, saying, I, Paul,
        myself, i.e., truly humble, because Paul means humble and quiet: “For I
        am the least of the apostles” (1 Cor. 15:9); hence, “I myself”, i.e.,
        truly Paul: “But thou art the same” (Ps. 102:27); “There is one that
        humbles himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit” (Sir.
        19:23); “For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be
        disorder and every vile practice” (Jas. 3:16). I, I say, entreat you,
        who when face to face with you, i.e., outwardly, as you say, am humble
        among you, acting humbly while I am present with you, but when I am
        away, namely, when there is no fear of being injured by any of you, am
        bold toward you, i.e., act boldly, writing harsh epistles to you: “But
        the righteous are bold as a lion” (Prov. 28:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        346. – Then when he says, I beg of you, he refuses to make a test. For
        they believed that the Apostle acted humbly among them because of fear;
        hence, he says: you believe so, but I beg of you—since you would like to
        experience whether I, if it were necessary, would do when I am present
        as I do in my absence. And so he says: I may not have to show boldness
        when I am present, i.e., when I am among you, to do anything, if it is
        necessary, with such confidence as I count on showing, i.e., as
        confidently as I am thought by you to be bold, i.e., to act boldly and
        confidently against some uncorrected persons, by rebuking and correcting
        through letters: “He exults in his strength” (Job 39:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        347. – Then he excuses himself with a reason, saying: who suspect us of
        acting in worldly fashion. As if to say: although I am not willing to
        justify myself for your sake with a test, nevertheless, there is a
        reason at hand to justify me. In regard to this he does three things.
        First, he gives the reason why they lay this charge against him;
        secondly, he destroys the reason (v. 3); thirdly, he confirms it with a
        reason (v. 4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        348. – The reason why this charge is laid to him, namely that he is
        humble when present but harsh and severe when absent, is that they
        consider that the Apostle acts in a worldly manner, i.e., walks
        according to the flesh. And because every person works according to what
        rules the work, and the end should be the rule, it follows that everyone
        directs his own work to the end he intends. Therefore, those who place
        their end in carnal goods are said to walk according to the flesh. And
        because these things can be taken from them, men who tend to carnal
        things behave gently and humbly toward others. Therefore, because they
        believed that the Apostle walked according to the flesh, they supposed
        that this was the reason he behaved humbly among them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        349. – But this reason is null and void; therefore, he destroys it,
        saying: For though we live in the world we are not carrying on a worldly
        war [according to the flesh]. As if to say: we cannot deny that we are
        in the flesh, because in Rom. (8:12) he says: “So then, brethren, we are
        debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh,” but that we
        are ruled according to the flesh, by placing our end or our intention in
        carnal goods, this is false, because we are not carrying on a worldly
        war, i.e., we do not regulate our life, which is a warfare (Job 7:1)
        according to the flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        350. – That we are not carrying on a worldly war he proves when he says,
        for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly [carnal]; and first of
        all, from the weapons of warfare, as a fighter has weapons suitable to
        his warfare. Now it is plain that the weapons of those who fight
        according to the flesh, or wage war, are riches, pleasures, and worldly
        and temporal honors and power. But since our weapons are not of this
        sort, for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but have divine
        power [are mighty to God], i.e., according to God or to the honor of
        God, therefore, we do not war according to the flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        351. – But secondly, when he says, but have divine power to destroy
        strongholds, he indicates the power of spiritual armor, which is evident
        from its threefold effect. The first effect is that rebellious persons
        are put to shame by those arms; in regard to this he says, to destroy
        strongholds. As if to say: the power of God is quite capable of
        destroying the rebellious: “That he may be able to give instruction in
        sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it” (Titus 1:9);
        “See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck
        up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to
        plant” (Jer. 1:10). Men fortify themselves against God in two ways: some
        with astute plans, such as tyrants, who plot with their evil designs to
        destroy the things of God, that they may exercise their tyranny; as to
        this he says, we destroy arguments [counsels], namely, of tyrants: “He
        takes the wise in their own craftiness” (Job 5:13). But others through
        pride or profundity of their own talent; as to this he says, and every
        proud obstacle [height], namely, of their pride: “Do not be haughty”
        (Rom. 12:16), i.e., proud things, or by profundity of intellect, both of
        lawyers and philosophers: “Neither height nor depth” (Rom. 8:39); “Woe
        to those who are wise in their own eyes” (Is. 5:21). Every proud
        obstacle to the knowledge of God, i.e., the faith, which is knowledge of
        God, because they attack things said about God, namely, the virgin birth
        and other of God’s marvels: “For the earth shall be full of the
        knowledge of the Lord” (Is. 11:9); “Who have not learned what some call
        the deep things of Satan” (Rev. 2:24); “So do not become proud, but
        stand in awe” (Rom. 11:20).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        352. – The second effect is the conversion of unbelievers to the faith;
        as to this he says, and take every thought captive to obey Christ. This
        happens when a man submits all he knows to the ministry of the Christ
        and of the faith: “To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with
        fetters of iron” (Ps. 149:8); “Put your feet into her fetters, and your
        neck into her chains” (Sir. 6:25), i.e., into the teaching of the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        353. – The third effect is the correction of sinners; as to this he
        says, being ready to punish every disobedience, i.e., having the
        readiness and free will to punish all disobedience: “And two-edged
        swords in their hands” (Ps. 149:6). This will occur when your obedience
        is complete, i.e., when you are perfectly obedient, because if you are
        willing to obey, there will be no reason for punishing the disobedience
        of others and your own. Or we shall take revenge on disobedience, when
        your obedience is complete, i.e., when your disobedience shall be
        destroyed; for contraries are cured by contraries.

        7 Look at what is before your eyes. If any one is confident that he is
        Christs, let him remind himself that as he is Christs, so are we. 8 For
        even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave
        for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to
        shame. 9 I would not seem to be frightening you with letters. 10 For
        they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence
        is weak, and his speech of no account.” 11 Let such people understand
        that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. 12 Not that
        we venture to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend
        themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare
        themselves with one another, they are without understanding.

        354. – Above, the Apostle excused himself by reason; here he excuses
        himself by the evidence of the fact. In this regard he does two things.
        First, he submits his excuse to his hearers to judge; secondly, he
        pursues his cause (v. 7b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        355. – He says therefore: although reason shows that the charge laid
        against me by the false apostles is false, nevertheless, if some among
        you are not convinced by reason and refuse to acquiesce to it, at least
        look at, i.e., consider, the things that are before your eyes, i.e.,
        that are evident, concerning me. But he submits the judgment of his
        cause to them in order to indicate how secure he is in his heart: “Turn,
        I pray, let no wrong be done” (Job. 6:29). But this is contrary to Jn.
        (7:24): “Do not judge by appearances.” Therefore it is not proper for
        him to say, what is before your eyes. I answer that the phrase, what is
        before your eyes [according to outward appearance], is taken there for
        things that appear outwardly in a man, namely, for that which appear to
        be true, according to which a man should not judge, because sometimes
        the contrary is present in the heart: “Beware of false prophets, who
        come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves” (Matt.
        7:15). But here it is taken for the Gospel’s truth itself and the
        evidence of the fact according to which judgment can be made. A Gloss
        explains it another way, namely, according to outward appearance, i.e.,
        of the false apostles, see, i.e., look to. As if to say: consider the
        facts about them, because it is impossible that among the many good
        things they pretend they not do some things from which you can recognize
        their wicked intention: “Thus you will know them by their fruits” (Matt.
        7:20).

        356. – Then when he says, For even if I boast, he pursues his cause. But
        it sometimes happens that a person is moved against someone because the
        former is deceived by the authority of someone who gives himself out as
        being great. This is the way the Corinthians, deceived by the false
        apostles who claimed greater authority than Paul, were stirred up
        against him, because they had come from Judea and were among the first
        converts. Therefore the Apostle does two things. First, he deflates the
        authority of those false apostles; secondly, he pursues his cause (v. 9)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        357. – He says therefore: see this, I say, according to outward
        appearance, that if any one of the false apostles is confident that he
        is Christs on account of some great thing he has done or some spiritual
        gift he has received from Christ, let him remind himself, i.e.,
        carefully consider in his heart, that as he is Christs, so are we. As if
        to say: whatever is found in them is also found in us; hence we also
        should be considered as Christ’s: “And I think I have the Spirit of God”
        (1 Cor. 7:40); “Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not
        belong to him” (Rom. 8:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        358. – But we are not only Christ’s, as they are, but we can glory more
        that we are Christ’s than they can. And this is what he says: for even
        if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord has given
        us: “He is a chosen instrument of mine” (Ac. 9:15); “For he who worked
        through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also
        for the Gentiles” (Gal. 2:8). He gave me, I say, this special power to
        convert the Gentiles, for building you up, i.e., the church, and not for
        destroying you, as the false apostles do, who abuse the power given to
        them by using it for a purpose contrary to that for which it was given.
        For although the power was given for building up the Church in faith and
        charity, they seek their own glory and not Christ’s; consequently, they
        destroy. They did this by preaching that the ceremonies of the Law must
        be observed and by making a profit. Therefore, if I glory more in that
        power which I have in which I seek Christ’s glory, I shall not be put to
        shame, namely, for such commendation of myself, because I do not do it
        for ostentation, but out of necessity, so that by showing that my
        authority is great and that of the false apostles null, no man may be
        deceived by them again.

        359. – Note here that according to Gregory there are two cases in which
        a person may commend himself without sinning, namely, when he is
        provoked by reproaches and is treated with contempt, and this in order
        that he not despair, seeing that he is treated with contempt, and be
        able to refute his adversaries. This is the way Job commended himself,
        as it is clear from (27:6), where he says: “My heart does not reproach
        me for any of my days” Likewise, when a person is preaching the truth
        and an adversary of the truth contradicts him and hinders the
        manifestation of the truth, in that case the preacher should commend
        himself and show his authority in order to refute him and draw his
        hearers to the truth. The Apostle does this in many places and also
        here.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        360. – Then when he says, I would not seem to be frightening you, he
        pursues his cause with the evidence of the facts. In regard to this he
        does three things. First, he shows that the charge lad against him is
        false; secondly, the reason he says this (v. 12); thirdly, he explains
        the reason (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        361. – In regard to the first it should be noted that, as has been said,
        it was charged that the Apostle, when he was present, was humble out of
        fear or to win their favor; but when he was absent, he wrote harshly to
        them. But the Apostle says that this is not so, and that if they would
        carefully weigh the things that appear, they would find him to be in
        fact as he appears in his epistles; and they can test this, if they
        wish. And that is what he says: but that I would not seem to the false
        apostles or by you, as it were, to be frightening you, or to make you
        fearful, with the letters which we sent to you; which fear we would not
        cause you when we were present. For they, namely, the false apostles,
        say that his letters, namely, Paul’s, are weighty, i.e., punishing
        harshly and severely, and strong, i.e., without fear, but his bodily
        presence is not such, for it is weak, i.e., feeble and humble, and his
        speech, namely, his preaching and conversation and exhortation, is of no
        account.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        362. – But let such people, i.e., who say such things about me,
        understand this, i.e., know for certain, that what we say by letter when
        absent we do when present, i.e., we will be such when we come to you as
        we are by epistle when absent, if it is necessary. Now the reason the
        Apostle acted humbly toward them is given in 1 Cor. (2:3): “And I was
        with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling,” which he did,
        because they were not firm in faith and he wanted to strengthen them by
        the gentleness of his manner. Furthermore, the reason he spoke plain
        words and did not preach subtle things to them is suggested in 1 Cor.
        (3:1): “But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as
        men of the flesh, as babes in Christ.” For they were not yet ready for a
        more profound doctrine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        363. – Then when he says, Not that we venture, he indicates the reason
        behind what he says, saying: I say that we are not like the false
        apostles, nor is the charge they lay against us true, because I do not
        say any more than I have to say. Hence, he says: Not that we venture,
        i.e., say that we are one of them, to class or compare ourselves with,
        i.e., make ourselves like some, that is, the false apostles who commend
        themselves to you only. And yet they are not commended by others and by
        their deeds contrary to what is stated in Prov. (27:2): “Let another
        praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.”
        But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves
        with one another, they are without understanding. But we measure
        ourselves against ourselves, i.e., according to what is in us we measure
        our deeds and our statements. As if to say: we say things about
        ourselves that are proportionate to ourselves, i.e., in keeping with our
        deeds: “But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast
        will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor” (Gal. 6:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        364. – But on the other hand, he said above (4:2): “We would commend
        ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.” Therefore, it
        was not proper for him to say what he did. I answer that it is one thing
        to commend himself to their conscience and another to their ears. For we
        commend ourselves to their ears by words alone; and this is evil. The
        Apostle and just men commend themselves in the first way; but in the
        second way the false apostles and hypocrites.

        has apportioned us, to reach even to you. 14 For we are not

        first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ. 15 We do not
        boast beyond limit, in other men’s labors; but our hope is that as your
        faith increases, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, 16 so that
        we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work
        already done in another’s field. 17 “Let him who boasts, boast of the
        Lord.” 18 For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted,

        365. – Having indicated the reason behind the things he had said, the
        Apostle now explains that reason. For he had said that he measures
        himself by himself and did not go beyond that measure. But a person
        could be excessive in two ways in glorying and commending himself.
        First, in regard to that about which he glories; for example, if he
        glories about something he does not have. Secondly, in regard to that in
        which he glories; for example, if a person has something from someone
        else, but glories in himself as though he has it of himself. Thus the
        Apostle shows that he did not go beyond the measure in glorying or
        praising himself. In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
        states his proposition; secondly, he proves it (v. 14); thirdly, he
        draws the conclusion (v. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        366. – He says therefore: I say that we measure and compare ourselves to
        ourselves, namely, by doing what our office demands. But in doing this
        we will not boast beyond limit [our measure], i.e., when we exercise our
        power and commend ourselves: “You shall do no wrong in judgment, in
        measures of length or weight or quantity” (Lev. 19:35); but will keep to
        the limits God has apportioned us. A Gloss [Lombard] explains this of
        the limit of the Apostle’s prelacy and says: according to the measure,
        i.e., according to the people measured out to him by God, the people
        whose prelate and rule of conduct he is. But this same thing can be
        taken more universally, such that the measure of the rule is the
        quantity of grace. Then the sense is this: but we glory according to the
        limits God has apportioned us, i.e., according to the amount of grace
        God has given us: “But grace was given to each of us according to the
        measure of Christ’s gift” (Eph. 4:7). This grace is a rule keeping us
        from being lifted up or separated from God. Which God has apportioned
        us, because whatever good we do in preaching the Gospel and in
        converting you and others, it is all from God, granted to me for you and
        others: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth” (1 Cor.
        3:6). A measure, I say, to reach even to you, because you are under the
        measure of grace granted to me, by which you have been converted to
        Christ and obey the Gospel. Therefore, what he is proposing is this,
        namely, that he is not going beyond the measure of glorying and praising
        himself that he is their prelate and that they were converted by him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        367. – That this is so, namely, that it reaches even to them, he proves
        when he says: For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did
        not reach you. As if to say: of course we glory, but we do not stretch
        beyond ourselves in our grace or glory or power, as if we do not reach
        to you in our power and ministry: we were the first to come all the way
        to you with the gospel of Christ, i.e., in the preaching of Christ’s
        Gospel: “For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the Gospel” (1
        Cor. 4:15); “Are you not my workmanship in the Lord” (1 Cor. 9:1); “For
        he who worked through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked
        through me also for the Gentiles” (Gal. 2:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        368. – Therefore he draws the conclusion, saying: therefore, when I
        glory in you, I am not glorying beyond measure. Hence he says: We do not
        boast beyond limit, in other men’s labours, where someone else laid the
        foundation of faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        369. – Then when he says, but our hope is that as your faith increases,
        our field among you may be greatly enlarged, he shows that he is not
        going beyond the measure, when he glories about the future. But it
        should be noted that a preacher has two reasons for glorying in his
        preaching: one is that those converted by his preaching are making
        progress; the other is that other people are converted by his converts,
        because as it says in Ex. (cf. 36:10): “Curtain is joined to curtain”;
        “And let him who hears say, ‘Come’” (Rev. 22:17). For one is easily
        converted when he sees others converted. In regard to those two things
        the Apostle hopes that his glorying in the Corinthians will be
        increased. First, in regard to their progress; hence he says: I say that
        we do not glory beyond measure over your conversion caused by us in the
        past, but will hope to be greatly enlarged in the future, i.e., for our
        glory to be increased in your increasing faith, and in the progress of
        your good works: “Long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may
        grow up to salvation” (1 Pet. 2:2). Secondly, we hope to be magnified in
        the conversion of others by you; therefore he says, abundantly, i.e., in
        the abundance of preaching not only among you but even in lands beyond
        you; and this according to our rule, i.e., according as Christ has
        enjoined us to preach not only to you but to all the Gentiles “Go into
        all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation” (Mk. 16:15).
        Without boasting of work already done in another’s field, i.e., we do
        not hope to glory, nor do we glory in another man’s rule. As if to say:
        not in things prepared by others, i.e., whom others have brought to the
        faith, but I will bear fruit among those to whom others have not
        preached: “Thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where
        Christ has already been named” (Rom. 15:20). But to the contrary, Peter
        preached at Rome before Paul preached there. I answer that he does not
        say this as though refusing to preach where another has preached; but he
        says that he intends to preach even where no other have preached.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        370. – Then when he says, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, he
        shows that he is not going beyond the measure as to that in which he
        glories, saying: if I glory in him in whom one should glory, I am not
        going beyond. But since one should glory in God, Let him who boasts,
        boast of the Lord: “Let him who glories glory in this, that he
        understands and knows me” (Jer. 9:24). This can be explained in three
        ways: in one way, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, so that in the
        Lord denotes the object in which he glories. As if to say: let him glory
        in the fact that he possesses the Lord by knowing and loving. In another
        way, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, i.e., according to God; and
        one glories in this way when he glories in the things of God and not in
        evil, as the one who is asked in Ps. (52:1, Vulgate): “Why do you glory
        in malice?” In the third way, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord,
        i.e., let him regard himself as having his glory from God, referring to
        God everything that redounds to his own glory: “What have you that you
        did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were
        not a gift?” (1 Cor. 4:7). This is the way it is taken here when he
        says: Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord. As if to say: I glory in
        the foregoing, but not as though I had this from myself and not from
        God. And this is also your measure, because all your good has sprung
        from us. And indeed we should glory in the Lord, not imputing our glory
        to ourselves, but to God. For it is not the man who commends himself
        that is accepted, i.e., approved by God or by men: “Let another praise
        you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips” (Prov.
        27:2), but the man whom the Lord commends, i.e., makes commendable by
        good works and miracles. For God is the cause of the entire good done by
        me.

        371. – After defending himself against the false charges placed against
        him by the false apostles, the Apostle, in order to refute them, that
        is, the false apostles, and render his own testimony more honorable, now
        commends himself to the Corinthians. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he assigns the reason for his commendation; secondly, he
        makes the commendation (v. 21b). In regard to the first he does three
        things. First, he asks that they bear with his foolishness; secondly, he
        states why he must commend himself in order not to seem foolish (v. 2);
        thirdly, he suggests that, granted he is foolish, they should bear with
        it (v. 16). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he
        mentions his desire so that his request may be easier to grant;
        secondly, he makes the request (v. 1b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        372. – The Apostle’s desire is that the Corinthians bear with him as he
        commends himself; therefore he begins with an optative expression: I
        wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. In regard to this
        it should be noted that the moral precepts deal with actions which,
        since they are particular and variable, cannot be confined within the
        limits of one general reason and rule with no exceptions. But sometimes
        it is necessary to do something beside the common rule in some case that
        crops up. But when something is done beside the common rule in this way,
        wise men, who consider the cause of it, are not troubled and do not
        think it was done foolishly. For example, the moral precept forbids
        killing, but sometimes it is necessary to kill evil men. When this is
        done, wise men commend it or do not think it was wicked to have done so,
        but the undiscerning and less wise, not considering the cause why one
        acted in this manner, are disturbed and think it was foolish to do. So
        when the wicked are killed, fools and heretics condemn it, saying it was
        a wicked thing to do. Therefore, because the common law is that a man
        should not commend himself, as it says in Prov. (27:2): “Let another
        praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips”,
        it could happen in some case beside this common rule, that a man
        commends himself and is acting praiseworthily; nevertheless, the
        undiscerning regard it as folly. Therefore, since the Apostle was
        confronted with a case in which he should commend himself, he urges them
        not to lay it to his folly, saying, I wish you would bear with me in a
        little foolishness. He says, little, because were he to commend himself
        without cause, it would be the utmost folly. Again, if he commended
        himself for a reason entirely urgent, then there would be no folly
        involved. But because he is commending himself for a reason not
        altogether urgent, since he could refute the false apostles in some
        other way, and because he is commending himself very much, there seems
        to be some folly there; and that is what he says, in a little
        foolishness: “I have been a fool! You forced me to it” (2 Cor. 12:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        373. – But although I am foolish, do bear with me. And they should do
        this because subjects should uphold their prelates and vice versa: “Bear
        one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ” (Gal. 6:2);
        “Forbearing one another in love” (Eph. 4:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        374. – Then, saying I feel a divine jealousy, he shows the need for this
        commendation. In regard to this he does three things. First, he shows
        that a commendation of this sort springs from zeal, to exclude folly;
        secondly, he says that this zeal is not irregular, to avoid indiscretion
        (v. 3); thirdly, he rejects their excuse (v. 4). In regard to the first
        he does two things. First, he mentions the holy zeal he has for them;
        secondly, the cause of this zeal, because his office obliged him (v.
        2b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        375. – His zeal, therefore, is holy, because I feel a divine jealousy
        for you, i.e., I love you fervently with the jealousy of God, i.e., to
        God’s honor, not mine. In regard to this it should be noted that
        jealousy taken as being the same as zeal is nothing more than a good or
        evil movement of the spirit concerning itself with the state of one’s
        neighbor, and implies a fervor of love. Consequently, zeal is an intense
        love that does not permit any sharing of the beloved. If it does not
        permit any sharing of an evil, say of a vice or some imperfection, but
        it alone wishes to have the beloved exclusively, then the zeal is good
        and the jealousy good. Thus it says in 1 Cor. (12:31): “But earnestly
        desire the higher gifts”; “For a good purpose it is always good to be
        made much of” (Gal. 4:18); “I have been very jealous for the Lord, the
        God of hosts” (1 Kg. 19:10); “For zeal for your house has consumed me”
        (Ps. 69:10). But if it does not allow a sharing in something excellent
        or in some worldly prosperity, because someone wants it all for himself,
        then the zeal is evil and the jealousy evil. Now a person is sometimes
        jealous for his wife, to keep her for himself. This is the way the
        Apostle was jealous on behalf of his people, whom he saw prepared for a
        fall and, although espoused to Christ, wished to be prostituted to the
        devil. Consequently, he would not permit Christ, the true spouse, to
        suffer their being shared with the devil; hence he says, a divine
        jealousy. As if to say: Not for me but for Christ, who is the spouse:
        “He who has the bride is the bridegroom” (Jn. 3:29); “I have been very
        jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts” (1 Kg. 19:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        376. – Then he shows from what source the responsibility to be zealous
        arose, when he says: for I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a
        pure bride to her one husband. As if to say: it is proper for me to be
        jealous for you with the jealousy of God, because I am the groomsman of
        this wedding between you and Christ, i.e., I effected the espousals made
        by faith and charity: “I will betroth you to me in faithfulness” (Hos.
        2:20). Therefore, it is my duty to protect you. So whoever converts the
        people by faith and charity, espouses them to Christ. I have betrothed
        you, I say, not to many, because she that adheres to many is defiled:
        “You have played the harlot with many lovers” (Jer. 3:1), but to one
        husband, Christ, that is, to a perfect man filled with the virtues: “The
        Orient is his name” (Zech. 6:12, Vulgate). Christ is called one husband
        because he is unique both as to the manner of conception (as to the
        manner of being born), and as to the fullness of grace: “One man among a
        thousand I found” (Ecc. 7:28). To that husband, I say, I have espoused
        you to present you a virgin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        377. – Note that he passes from the plural, I have betrothed you, to the
        singular, to present you as a pure bride, thus showing that from all the
        faithful is formed one body and one Church, which ought to be a virgin
        in all its members. For in all, virginity is taken for bodily integrity
        and chastity for mental integrity; for sometimes a person is a virgin in
        body, but not chaste in mind. Thus the Church shows herself a virgin
        when she perseveres in the faith and the sacraments without being
        corrupted by idolatry and unbelief: “At the head of every street you
        built your lofty place and prostituted your beauty” (Ez. 16:25). She
        shows herself chaste when, persevering in the sacraments and in the
        faith of Christ, she presents herself pure in body and in work: “That he
        might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle
        or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish” (Eph.
        5:27).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        378. – But because the Corinthians could say: it is not necessary for
        you to protect us, and your zeal is not reasonable, because we can take
        care of ourselves very well, he discloses the cause of his zeal saying,
        but I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your
        thoughts will be led astray [corrupted]. Here it should be noted that in
        paradise Adam and Eve were married, but Eve was corrupted by the
        serpent, not with violence, but with craftiness, inasmuch as he promised
        something false and urged something wicked: false, when he said, “You
        will be as gods” (Gen. 3:5), and ‘No, you will not die” (Gen. 3:4), even
        though they did incur guilt as a result; wicked, when he persuaded her
        to transgress the and ignore God’s command. The Apostle, speaking
        according to this likeness, says that the Church is like Eve, whom the
        devil has sometimes persecuted openly by tyrants and potentates, and
        then “like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour,” as it says in 1
        Pet. (5:8); and sometimes he molests the Church in secret by heretics
        who promise the truth and pretend to be good, and then as the serpent
        deceived Eve with his subtility by promising false things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        379. – Therefore he says, I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve,
        casting her out of paradise, by his cunning with false promises: “Adam
        was not deceived, but the woman” (1 Tim. 2:14), so, i.e., by like
        deceptions of heretics, your thoughts [senses] will be led astray. He
        says, your senses, because just as in a natural marriage a spouse takes
        precautions against his bride’s being corrupted carnally, so in this
        spiritual marriage the Apostle fears that the senses of the heart will
        be spiritually corrupted: “Bad company ruins good morals” (1 Cor.
        15:33). Or the spiritual senses referred to in Wis. (1:1): “Think of the
        Lord with uprightness”; “Do not be children in your thinking” (1 Cor.
        14:20). And from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ [from the
        simplicity that is in Christ]. That is simple which lacks composition.
        Therefore, the false apostles formed one sect with Judaism and the
        Gospel, commanding that the ceremonies of the Law be observed along with
        the Gospel. Therefore, they fall from the simplicity of Christ, who,
        being seduced by the false apostles, observe those ceremonies along with
        the Gospel; and this the Apostle feared about the Corinthians: “The
        integrity of the upright guides them” (Prov. 11:3).

        4 For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we
        preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you
        received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted,
        you submit to it readily enough. 5 I think that I am not in the least
        inferior to these superlative apostles. 6 Even if I am unskilled in
        speaking, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to
        you in all things. 7 Did I commit a sin in abasing myself so that you
        might be exalted, because I preached God’s gospel without cost to you? 8
        I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve
        you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        380. – Having described the zeal he had for the Corinthians and proved
        it reasonable, the Apostle now rejects their excuse. In regard to this
        he does two things. First, he proposes their excuse; secondly, he
        removes it (v. 5)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        381. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the Corinthians
        might suppose that he has zeal for them, because he feared that they
        might set aside his teaching on account of the false apostles’ teaching;
        hence they could say: it is obvious that lesser goods should be
        discarded in favor of greater goods. Therefore, if the false apostles
        teach better doctrines, you should not be disturbed if we acquiesce in
        them. Hence, he proposes this excuse by showing that no one is better
        than the Apostle in teaching and preaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        382. – For the Apostle preached and taught three things. First, that
        they were Christ’s: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus
        Christ as Lord” (2 Cor. 4:5); secondly, that they have the Spirit of
        Christ: “Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong
        to him” (Rom. 8:9); thirdly, that they received the Gospel of Christ:
        “For I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the power of God for
        salvation to every one who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the
        Greek” (Rom. 1:16). If, therefore, the false apostles preach and teach
        something better to you, you would do right and would be excusable; but
        they do not do this. And this is what he says: For if some one comes and
        preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a
        different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different
        gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough. As if
        to say: I fear that a false apostle might come to you unsent, but of
        himself, as a thief and a robber: “All who came before me are thieves
        and robber” (Jn. 10:8); “I did not send the prophets, yet they ran”
        (Jer. 25:21); “And how can men preach unless they are sent?” (Rom.
        10:15). If, I say, such a preacher preaches to you another Christ,
        namely, more excellent than the one we have preached, which cannot be,
        because as it says in 1 Cor. (8:6): “And one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
        whom are all things and through whom we exist”; and this as to the
        first. Or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received,
        namely, better than the one you have received from us, i.e., by our
        ministry, which cannot be, because as it says in 1 Cor. (12:11): “All
        these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each
        one individually as he wills”; and this as to the second. Or if you
        accept a different gospel, i.e., another preaching or doctrine, from the
        one you accepted from us: “I am astonished that you are so quickly
        deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a
        different gospel” (Gal. 1:6). If, I say, they did other and better
        things for you, you submit to it readily enough, i.e., you would be
        right in excusing yourselves. But because another, i.e., better Gospel
        cannot be delivered to them, the Apostle excommunicates the Galatians,
        if they receive another Gospel: “If any one is preaching to you a gospel
        contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed” (Gal. 1:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        383. – Then when he says, I think that I am not in the least inferior,
        he removes this excuse. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        shows that he did not do less for them than the others; secondly, that
        he did more (v. 7). In regard to the first he does three things. First,
        he shows that he did nothing less in deed than the other apostles;
        secondly, he suggests that he was not lacking the means to do this (v.
        6); thirdly, he presents the evidence for both (v. 6b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        384. – He says therefore: you would be right in allowing yourselves to
        be seduced by them, if they preached something better to you; but this
        is not true. For, i.e., because I think that I am not in the least
        inferior to these superlative apostles, i.e., than Peter and John, whom
        they considered great. He compares himself to the great apostles, both
        because Paul seemed to them and was regarded by them as less than they,
        on the ground that they had been with Christ, and Paul not; and because
        the false apostles claimed to have been sent by them. Therefore, by
        showing himself equal to the great apostles, he removes their error and
        refutes the false apostles: “I worked harder than any of them” (1 Cor.
        15:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        385. – But lest perhaps they should say to him: whence did you obtain
        the faculty to do this, since you are unskilled in our speech? He shows
        that the faculty is due to the vastness of his knowledge, saying, even
        if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge: “So also our
        beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him” (2
        Pet. 3:15). But this should be noted, namely, that the false apostles,
        seeking their own glory and pursuing gain, tried to attract people by
        ornate and subtle and exquisite words, trying only to stroke their ears
        gently. But the Apostle, because he was not seeking his own advantage
        but only the spread and growth of the faith, proposed the word of faith
        in such a way that all could understand, adjusting himself to the
        condition and capacity of his hearers. Hence, because they were not
        capable of lofty doctrine in the beginning, he proposed the faith to
        them not in subtle terms but in a way they could understand, namely,
        plainly and clearly. That is why they said he was rude in speech: “Not
        with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power”
        (1 Cor. 1:17). On this account the Apostle says: although I be rude in
        speech, as it seems to you, this was not due to a lack of knowledge but
        for your sake by way of dispensing it, because I “could not address you
        as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ” (1 Cor.
        3:1) Or according to the letter, it must be said that the Apostle
        stuttered, and on this account the false apostles ridiculed him.
        Therefore he says: for even if I am unskilled in speaking, i.e., have a
        speech impediment, I am not in knowledge: “I am slow of speech and of
        tongue” Ex. 4:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        386. – But the fact that I did no less than the great apostles is
        evident from the things I have done for you; hence, he says: in every
        way we have made this plain to you in all things, who have experienced
        what I have done: “You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord” (1
        Cor. 9:2); “The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all
        patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works” (2 Cor. 12:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        387. – Then when he says, Did I commit a sin, he shows that he has done
        more than all the others; and this because he preached without payment.
        In regard to this he does two things. First, he states the fact;
        secondly, he assigns the reason of the fact (v. 11). In regard to the
        first he does two things. First, he shows the fact as to the past;
        secondly, as to the future (v. 9b). He shows the past fact in two ways:
        first in general, and second in particular (v. 7b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        388. – He says therefore: I am correct in saying that I have done no
        less than the others, unless you think I did less and acted wrongly,
        because I lessened my authority in not accepting payments from you. But
        if this were so, I would have done evil. Therefore he shows that it is
        not evil, and this is what he says: Did I commit a sin in abasing myself
        and lessening my authority? As if to say: No: “The greater you are,
        humble yourself in all things, and you will find grace in the sight of
        God” (Sir. 3:20, Vulgate); “For though I am free from all men, I have
        made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more” (1 Cor. 9:19);
        “Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the
        kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 18:4). The reason for humbling myself is not
        for my own gain but for your improvement; hence he says: so that you
        might be exalted, i.e., be strengthened in faith. But the Corinthians
        were very covetous, and if he had accepted payment from the very
        beginning, they might perhaps have left the faith. Likewise, the false
        prophets preached for monetary profit. Therefore, in order that the
        Corinthians receive the Apostle, and the false prophets remove the
        occasion for profit, the Apostle preached for free and without subsidy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        389. – Then he explains in detail what he had said in general. In regard
        to this he does two things. First, he shows how he preached to them
        without charge during his first visit with them; secondly, he shows that
        he did the same during the long stay he made with them (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        390. – In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions the
        humiliation, saying: in this did I humble myself, because I preached
        God’s gospel without cost to you, i.e., without charge; but not for a
        reward, because this is not praiseworthy. For although all could take
        personal payments from those to whom they preached the word of God, yet
        no one should preach for the reward or the payment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        391. – Secondly, because they could say: where did you obtain your
        support? He answers that it came from the other churches, saying: I
        robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve
        you. By this he convinces them that they could not say to the Apostle
        that it is unlawful for him to take from them. For if it is taken from
        others for serving them, it is much more lawful for him to take from
        them. From this it is apparent that a papal legate visiting one part of
        his jurisdiction can accept stipends, and that the Pope can take
        subsidies from various parts of the world to relieve the needs of some
        country. The reason is that the Church is as one body. But we see in a
        natural body that, when strength is failing in one member, nature
        administers humors and strength by taking from other members.

        9 And when I was with you and was in want, I did not burden any one, for
        my needs were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I
        refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. 10 As the
        truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine shall not be silenced in
        the regions of Achaia. 11 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows
        I do! 12 And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the
        claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission
        they work on the same terms as we do. 13 For such men are false
        apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of
        Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel
        of light. 15 So it is not strange if his servants also disguise
        themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to
        their deeds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        392. – Having shown that when he first preached to them during his first
        visit, he preached to them without charge, he now shows that not even
        during his long stay among them did he accept any payments from them.
        First, he shows this; secondly, he answers a tacit question (v. 9b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        393. – He says therefore: I took no payments from you not only when I
        first came to you, but also when I was with you for some time and was in
        want, in order to show that he did not forego the payments, because he
        was rich: I did not burden any one by taking anything from anyone. This
        reveals the cause why he forewent it, namely, because the Corinthians in
        their innate avarice considered it a burden to minister to him: “We have
        not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an
        obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ” (1 Cor. 9:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        394. – But they could ask: Where did you get what you needed? So he
        answers: from the other churches. Therefore I took nothing, because my
        need was supplied from the wage I earned by working at night with Aquila
        and Priscilla, for he practiced the tentmaker’s art, from which he
        furnished his necessities: “You yourselves know that these hands
        ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me” (Ac.
        20:34). Therefore, that which was lacking you did not give, but my needs
        were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia, namely, the
        Philippians, who were very generous; for which the Apostle commended
        them in the epistle to the Philippians (4:15): “No church entered into
        partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only.” But the
        Corinthians were avaricious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        395. – Then when he says, So I refrained, he shows how he plans to act
        toward them in this matter in the future, saying that he does not want
        to be a burden to them. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        gives his general reason; secondly, he confirms it (v. 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        396. – He says therefore: not only have I preached the Gospel to you
        without charge and was a burden to no one, so I refrained and will
        refrain from burdening you in any way; and so I will keep myself, not
        rebuking you sharply or correcting you severely or accepting anything:
        “I coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel” (Ac. 20:33); “I have not
        taken one ass from them, and I have not harmed one of them” (Num.
        16:15); and Samuel says: “Testify against me before the Lord and before
        his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or whom
        have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken
        a bribe to blind my eyes with it?” (1 Sam. 12:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        397. – That he will continue to do so he confirms in two ways. First, by
        reason of the one who speaks in him, namely, Christ, who is the truth
        from which nothing false can come; hence he says, As the truth of Christ
        is in me. As if to say: what I say is true, because the truth of Christ
        speaks in me: “Since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me” (2
        Cor. 13:3). Or this can be taken as an oath, as if to say: God, who is
        truth, and who is in me searching my heart is my witness that I will
        keep myself so: “For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in
        the gospel of his Son” (Rom. 1:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        398. – Secondly, from the fact that he does not intend to lessen his
        glory, but to increase it. For the Apostle attributed to himself before
        Christ as his great glory that he alone of all the apostles preached to
        the Corinthians without payment; hence he says: I will not burden
        anyone; this boast of mine shall not be silenced, i.e., lessened,
        namely, that I preached to you free and that I refrained from what is
        lawful for your salvation which is Christ’s glory, because he is
        glorified in me by this, or because I particularly have this glory with
        Christ. This would have been broken off in the regions of Achaia, where
        Corinth was the metropolis, if he had taken anything from them, because
        they were avaricious: “For I would rather die than have any one deprive
        me of my ground for boasting” (1 Cor. 9:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        399. – Then when he says, And why?, he presents the cause why he did not
        take payment from them. First, he excludes the false cause; secondly, he
        gives the true one (v. 12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        400. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the false apostles
        charged the Apostle with not taking payment from the Corinthians,
        because he did not love them and because he did not intend to help and
        serve them. He says therefore: Why do I do this? Because I do not love
        you?, i.e., is it from any hatred I bear towards you, as the false
        apostles claim? God knows that I love you and that I do not do this out
        of hatred: “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you” (Jn. 21:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        401. – Therefore, having removed the false cause, he gives the true one,
        And what I do I will continue to do. First he states the true cause;
        secondly, the reason for it (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        402. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the false
        apostles, as has been stated, were seeking their own profit and glory;
        therefore, in order to be held in reverence, they tried to follow the
        example of the Apostle outwardly or even excel him, if they could.
        Therefore the Apostle says: if you wish to imitate me, let them imitate
        me in taking nothing. And because he knew that the false apostles
        preached in order to take and, consequently, would not preach if their
        gain ceased, he says: And what I do I will continue to do, and what I
        shall do is not out of hatred, but in order to undermine the claim of
        those, namely, the false apostles, who desire from my example to have an
        occasion for taking what is yours. For he knew, according to Ambrose,
        that they would not preach very willingly, if they received nothing;
        whereas on the contrary it is stated: “Give instruction to a wise man,
        and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man and he will increase
        in learning” (Prov. 9:9). And this that they may be found, that is, the
        false apostles, on the same terms as we, namely, not receiving money,
        even as we do not receive it. Indeed they glory in the fact that they
        imitate us; and I am unwilling, if they would imitate me completely,
        that they would receive: “I wish that all were as I myself am” (1 Cor.
        7:7), namely, not receiving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        403. – That in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we
        do. This is read in three ways. In one way thus: that they may be found
        to be such as we, not receiving, even as we do not receive; wherein,
        namely, in being such as we, they may glory, for they strive to be like
        the apostles. In a second way thus: that in that wherein they glory,
        namely, in receiving, because this is all they sought, they may be found
        even as we, i.e., similar to us, namely, by ceasing and desisting from
        receiving, that they may be like us. In the third way thus: that in that
        wherein they glory, namely, in not receiving, for they claim they
        receive nothing, they may be found even as we, i.e., not better than we,
        namely, lest they be able to prefer themselves to us in this. For such
        men are false apostles, deceitful workmen. This can be connected with
        what went before in three ways; in the first way thus: they do not glory
        and strive in the way we do, for such men are false apostles, deceitful
        workmen. In the second way thus: and indeed they stop receiving in order
        to be like us: for such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen. In
        the third way thus: so they glory in not receiving in order to seem like
        us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        404. – Having stated the true cause, he proves it by saying: For such
        men are false apostles, deceitful workmen. In regard to this he does
        three things. First he states the cause; secondly, he proves it (v. 14);
        thirdly, he shows the difference between false and true apostles (v.
        15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        405. – He says therefore: I am right in saying that I do this in order
        to cut off from them the occasion, for such men are false apostles,
        deceitful workmen, namely, false: “Look out for the dogs, look out for
        the evil-workers” (Phil. 3:2). Deceitful, i.e., shrewd, foxy, deceiving
        others under the guise of religion: “Your prophets have been like foxes
        among ruins, O Israel” (Ez. 13:4); “Catch us the foxes, the little
        foxes, that spoil the vineyards” (S. of S. 2:15); “Beware of false
        prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous
        wolves” (Matt. 7:15). And this is what he says: disguising themselves as
        apostles of Christ, i.e., bearing the outward signs of good apostles:
        “Holding the form of religion but denying the power of it” (2 Tim. 3:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        406. – He proves this, because just as the true apostles are sent by God
        and are transformed by him, so Satan disguises himself as an angel of
        light, who is their leader and inciter, showing himself to be an angel
        of God or sometimes Christ. Therefore it is no strange or great thing if
        his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness,
        i.e., pretend to be just: “Like the magistrate of the people, so are his
        officials” (Sir. 10:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        407. – But it should be noted that Satan sometimes transfigures himself
        so that he can be seen, as by St. Martin, in order to deceive men. But
        for this the discerning of spirits, which God conferred in a special way
        on St. Antony, is necessary and sufficient. One is able to know that it
        is Satan by the fact that a good angel urges one to good works from the
        very beginning and continues to do so, but a bad angel pretends good
        things in the beginning, but later, in order to fulfil his desire and
        accomplish what he intends, namely, to deceive, he induces and
        instigates to evil: “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the
        spirits to see whether they are of God” (1 Jn. 4:1). According to Joshua
        (5:13), when he saw an angel in the field, he said: “Are you for us, or
        for our adversaries?” Another sign is that a good angel, even though he
        causes one to be fearful in the beginning, immediately comforts and
        consoles, as he did Zechariah: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah” (Lk. 1:13),
        and the Blessed Virgin: “Do not be afraid, Mary” (Lk. 1:30). But an evil
        angel stupefies and leaves one desolate, in order the more easily to
        deceive and persuade him. But sometimes he transforms himself but cannot
        be seen; and this when he makes things, which are in themselves evil,
        appear good by perverting a man’s senses and inflaming concupiscence:
        “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way to
        death” (Prov. 14:12). This is the way he deceived a certain monk, who
        had resolved never to leave his cell. But the devil suggested to him
        that it would be good to go to Church and receive the body of Christ.
        Consenting to this suggestion, he broke his resolve by going to the
        Church. Later, recognizing that it was the devil, the monk congratulated
        himself for not being deceived, because he had left for a good purpose.
        Later on, he suggested to him that his father had died and left many
        riches to be distributed among the poor, and that he should go to the
        city. When he went there, he never returned and died in sin. Hence, it
        is very difficult for a person to be too careful, but one should have
        recourse to divine help: “Who can open the doors of his face? Round
        about his teeth is terror” (Job 41:14). As if to say: no one but God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        408. – Then he indicates the difference between good and bad ministers,
        which consists in this, that their end, namely, of Christ’s ministers
        and Satan’s, will correspond to their deeds; for the end of the good
        will be good, and of the evil, evil: “Their end is destruction” (Phil.
        3:19). Furthermore, the good will receive good things and the evil, evil
        things: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ” (2
        Cor. 5:10).

        409. – Having asked the Corinthians to bear patiently with his
        commendation, and shown that he did this out of the zeal he had for them
        because that zeal was reasonable and ordinate, the Apostle now presents
        another reason through which he shows that, given he is acting
        foolishly, they should nevertheless, put up with him. Hence, in this
        reason he proceeds on the supposition that he is foolish. In this part
        he does two things. First he makes his request; secondly, he gives the

        says, I repeat it, since my zeal is reasonable and I am acting
        reasonably in commending myself, let no one think me foolish. Secondly,
        he asks that, granted that he is acting foolishly, they should

        Therefore he says, but even if you do, i.e., if I am not reasonable in
        commending myself and on that account you want to regard me as foolish,
        nevertheless, accept, i.e., bear with me as a fool. He says, as, because
        although they may regard him as foolish, in this matter he is not really
        foolish. Accept me, I say, as a fool so that I too may boast a little.
        He says, a little, because further on he will commend himself on the
        glory which is according to the flesh, which is very little: “Man, who
        is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!” (Job 25:6); “How can he
        who is dust and ashes be proud?” (Sir. 10:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        411. – Then when he says, What I am saying, he assigns the reason for
        what he had said. But he had said three things, for which he wishes to
        give a reason. First, for the fact that he supposed it was foolish to
        commend himself; secondly, why he wishes to glory (v. 18); thirdly, that
        they should bear with him (v. 19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        412. – He says therefore: the reason why you should take me who am
        foolish is because what I am saying in this boastful confidence, i.e.,
        in this commendation according to the flesh, which is desired by some,
        as if they ought to subsist by it, I say not with the Lord’s authority,
        but as a fool. He speaks hypothetically, as if to say: if I were not
        reasonable in commending myself, then what I am saying for my
        commendation would not be with the Lord’s authority, i.e., according to
        the notion of divine wisdom; and then you would be right in not taking
        me as speaking according to God, but foolishly: “For it is not the man
        who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord
        commends” (2 Cor. 10:18); “Let another praise you, and not your own
        mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips” (Prov. 27:2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        413. – He indicates the reason why he commends himself and glories, when
        he says, since many boast of worldly things [according to the flesh], I
        too will boast. Here it should be noted that the false apostles, because
        they were Jews, gloried according to the flesh, saying that they were
        sons of Abraham. They hoped thereby to be held in reverence and
        authority by the Corinthians. Therefore, the Apostle says: granted that
        it is foolish for me to glory according to the flesh, yet because many,
        namely the false apostles, glory according to the flesh, I too will even
        glory according to the flesh: “Answer a fool according to his folly,
        lest he be wise in his own eyes” (Prov. 26:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        414. – But on the other hand, Seneca says: “The greatest of evils is to
        live by the example of evil men”; “You shall not follow a multitude to
        do evil”(Ex. 23:2). Therefore, the Apostle should not glory according to
        the flesh on the ground that the false apostles glory. I answer that
        although both are glorying about the same thing, the intention and end
        are not the same, because the false apostles commended themselves for
        their own glory and to acquire authority and gain; but the Apostle
        glories in order that the word of God preached by him might have greater
        authority and weight and bear fruit for Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        415. – Then he tells why they should bear with him, saying: you gladly
        bear with fools, being wise yourselves. First, he gives this reason,
        namely, that they should bear with him. For they could say: Why should
        we bear with you, if you are foolish? And the Apostle says that the
        reason is this: since you yourselves are wise in your own eyes and in
        your reputation, you gladly bear with, i.e., are wont to bear with,
        fools, namely, the false apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        416. – Secondly, he shows wherein they bear with the foolish and points
        out five cases of oppression imposed by the false apostles. The first is
        the yoke of slavery; as to this he says, for you bear it if a man, i.e.,
        the false apostles, makes slaves of you. As if to say: through Christ
        you were freed from the bondage of the Law, which is in fear, and were
        raised to the freedom of the sons of God, which is charity: “So,
        brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman” (Gal.
        4:31). And yet you suffer the false apostles, who take such liberty from
        you and reduce you to the slavery of the Law, because they compel you to
        observe the ceremonies of the Law: “Do not submit again to a yoke of
        slavery” (Gal. 5:1). With greater reason, then, should you bear with me,
        who want to preserve you in the freedom of Christ, than with the false
        apostles, who wish to reduce you to the slavery of the Law. The second
        is a very heavy burden, because the false apostles live sumptuously on
        your goods, but we do not: “I do not mean that others should be eased
        and you burdened” (2 Cor. 8:13). Therefore he says: or preys upon
        [devours] you: “Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because
        you devour the houses of widows, praying long prayers. For this you
        shall receive the greater judgment” (Matt. 23:14). The third oppression
        is depredation and despoilation, because they literally took everything
        from them with soft words and under the pretext of piety; as to this he
        says, or take advantage of you, i.e., smoothly deceive you by taking
        your property: “By fair and flattering words they deceive the hearts of
        the simple-minded” (Rom. 16:18). The fourth oppression is their
        excessive vaunting of themselves over them along with contempt for the
        Corinthians; therefore he says: or puts on airs by conducting himself in
        a conceited manner: “Do not exalt yourself through your soul’s counsel,
        lest your soul be torn in pieces like a bull” (Sir. 6:2). The fifth
        oppression is verbal abuse; for the false apostles not only oppressed
        them in these ways but added reproaches by saying insulting things to
        them and especially about their low estate. For because they were Jews
        and worshippers of the one true God, they called themselves noble and
        the Corinthians ignoble, because they were not of the seed of Abraham or
        circumcised, but descended from idolaters; as to this he says, or
        strikes you in the face, i.e., insults you publicly and says harmful
        things. For these harmful things, I was too weak, I must say, to my
        shame, and yet you bear with them and not with us, as if we were too
        weak for that and for the glory you have attributed to them by
        preferring them to us, especially since the false apostles say that the
        reason we do not say or do such things to you is that we are weak in
        this part, i.e., because we are lowly: “We are weak, but you are strong.
        You are held in honor, but we in disrepute” (1 Cor. 4:10).

        21b But whatever any one dares to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I
        also dare to boast of that. 22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
        Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 23 Are
        they servants of Christ? I am a better one—I am talking like a
        madman—with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless
        beatings, and often near death. 24 Five times I have received at the
        hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. 25 Three times I have been
        beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been
        shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been adrift at sea; 26 on frequent
        journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own
        people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the
        wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        417. – Having given the reasons for commending himself and the causes
        why they should bear with him, he now begins to commend himself. In
        regard to this he does two things. First, he shows himself equal to the
        false apostles and others who commended themselves; secondly, he prefers
        himself to them (v. 23b). The Apostle makes himself their equal in
        glory. But glory is of two kinds: one is according to the flesh and is
        slight and worthy of scorn; hence he says to the Philippians (3:7): “But
        whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ”; the
        other in according to Christ, because “it is great glory to follow the
        Lord” (Sir. 23:38, Vulgate), and this should be sought: “But far be it
        from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal.
        6:14). The Apostle therefore makes himself equal to them in regard to
        both glories: first, in regard to the first; secondly, in regard to the
        second (v. 23).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        418. – First, he shows himself equal to them in general, saying: receive
        me as one who is foolish, provided it is foolish, for I speak
        hypothetically; because whatever any one dares to boast of or to take
        for granted about himself and to commend himself, I can dare and commend
        myself on the same matters in which they commend themselves, because
        they have no better reason than I to commend themselves. I am speaking
        as a fool, i.e., I say that I am acting foolishly; yet he was acting
        wisely, because he was not doing this to boast, but to humiliate the
        false apostles: “I think that I am not in the least inferior to these
        superlative apostle” (2 Cor. 11:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        419. – Secondly, when he says, Are they Hebrews? So am I, he shows in
        detail that he is equal to them, indicating one by one the points in
        which he is equal to them, and in which the false apostles found glory.
        But they took glory and commended themselves on three points. First, in
        their nationality and tongue, because they called themselves Hebrews;
        secondly in their race, because they said they were of the race of
        Israel; thirdly, in the promise, because they said they were partakers
        of the promise to Abraham, since they were of his seed. So he shows that
        he is equal to them on these three points. First, as to nationality, as
        if to say: I am as they are. It should be noted that, as some say, they
        are called Hebrews from Abraham, because before him that name was
        uncommon. But it can be said, and perhaps better, that the word is
        derived from a certain Eber mentioned in Gen. (11:14-15): “Shelah had
        lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber,” and then Eber lived
        thirty-four years and begot Peleg. It was during this time that
        languages became distinct, and the language of the Hebrews remained in
        the family. Secondly, he shows himself equal to them in race, saying Are
        they Israelites? So am I, namely, according to rite. Thirdly, as to the
        third he says: Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Of these three
        things it says in Phil. (3:4): “If any other man thinks he has reason
        for confidence in the flesh, I have more, circumcised on the eighth day”
        as to the third point; “Of the people of Israel, of the tribe of
        Benjamin,” as to the second point; “A Hebrew born of Hebrews,” as to the
        first: “I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of
        the tribe of Benjamin” (Rom. 11:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        420. – Thus, it is clear that I am not inferior to them as to the glory,
        which is according to the flesh; nor even as to the glory which is
        according to Christ, because they are servants of Christ, i.e., they say
        so to deceive you; I am a better one: “This is how one should regard us,
        as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1); “Who has made us competent to be
        ministers of a new covenant” (2 Cor. 3:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        421. – Then when he says, I am talking like a madman, he prefers himself
        to all the apostles and to the false. First, in regard to evils endured;
        secondly, as to benefits received (chap.12). In regard to the first he
        does two things. First, he prefers himself as to evils endured;
        secondly, as to the manner in which he avoided evils (v. 32). In regard
        to the first he does three things. First, he proposes that he should be
        preferred to the others; secondly, he shows in what he should be
        preferred (v. 23c); thirdly, he confirms some of the statements (v. 30).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        422. – He says therefore: I am talking like a madman; because I commend
        myself and make myself equal to the others, how less wise will I seem to
        you, if I prefer myself to them. Therefore he says: not only am I a
        minister of Christ, as the others, but as one less wise according to
        your opinion, I say that I am a better minister of Christ than they; and
        as to this he says that he should be preferred to them: “I magnify my
        ministry” (Rom. 11:13) by placing it ahead of the ministry of the
        others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        423. – Then he indicates the matters in which he should be preferred,
        saying, with far greater labours. As if to say: in this I am more,
        because I am more obviously a minister of Christ. First, as to the evils
        inflicted; secondly, as to evils voluntarily assumed (v. 26). First, he
        mentions in general the evils inflicted, saying: I am more, namely, a
        proven minister; with far greater labours than they, even though they
        have undertaken some labours: “I worked harder than any of them” (1 Cor.
        15:10). Secondly, he lists those evils in detail. First, as to the
        squalor of prison, because far more imprisonments, namely, than they:
        “And when they had inflicted many blows upon them”—namely, on Paul and
        his companions—”they threw them into prison” (Ac. 16:23). Secondly, as
        to the pains of floggings, because with countless beatings, i.e., above
        the measure of human virtue, or above the measure of human custom: “In
        beatings, imprisonments, tumults, labors, watching, hunger” (2 Cor.
        6:5). But this seems to be contrary to what is stated in 1 Cor. (10:13):
        “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your
        strength.” Therefore, not above the measure of human virtue. I answer
        that God does not permit us to be tried without the held of divine
        grace; that is why the Apostle said in 1 Cor. (15:10): “Not I, but the
        grace of God which is with me.” Then as to the terror of death; hence he
        says, and often near death, i.e., in the dangers and terrors of death.
        Hence he said in Rom. (8:36): “For your sake we are being killed all the
        day long”; “I die daily for your glory” (1 Cor. 15:31, Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        424. – Then he manifests the two extreme dangers he underwent. And
        first, the danger of lashes; secondly, the danger of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        425. – But he shows the danger of lashes by citing those he suffered
        from his own, that is, from the Jews. Hence he says, Five times I have
        received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. It should
        be noted that, as it says in Deut. (25:2): “A number of stripes in
        proportion to his offense. Forty stripes may be given him, but not more;
        lest, if one should go on to beat him with more stripes than these, your
        brother be degraded in your sight.” This shows that men should be
        whipped for lesser sins, yet so that the victim never receive more than
        forty stripes. But the Jews, to appear merciful, always acted short of
        the Law, giving less than forty, according as it appeared to them.
        Therefore, because they hated Paul, whenever they flogged him, they
        omitted the least possible number of strokes below the Law’s limit,
        namely, giving only one less, i.e., thirty-nine. And this is what he
        received five times, namely, forty lashes less one. Secondly, he
        indicates the perils he endured from outsiders, namely, the Gentiles,
        saying: Three times I have been beaten with rods: “The magistrates tore
        the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods” (Ac.
        16:22); “The tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and
        ordered him to be examined by scourging”(Ac. 22:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        426. – Then he discloses the perils of death he faced; and first of all
        those inflicted by men, saying: Once I was stoned. This happened in the
        city of Lycaonia, where he was struck down with stones and almost
        killed: “They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing
        that he was dead” (Ac. 14:18). Secondly, the perils endured from the
        works of nature, and particularly from the sea. He amplifies these,
        first from their number, because three times I have been shipwrecked;
        secondly, from their duration, because a night and a day I have been
        adrift at sea, which is more grievous; for the text says that although
        he suffered shipwreck a number of times, he remained in the water for a
        day and a half under the protection of God’s power. Hence he could say
        with Jonah (2:4): “For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the
        seas, and the flood was round about me.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        427. – Having listed the evils inflicted from without, he then lists
        those he voluntarily assumed, when he says, on frequent journeys: first,
        external evils; secondly, internal evils (v. 28). He describes the
        external evils: first as to the evils that occur on journeys; secondly,
        as to those in houses (v. 27).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        428. – In regard to the first he mentions his frequent journeys, saying
        on frequent journeys, namely, I am proved a minister of Christ by
        enduring many hard and difficult things patiently: “From Jerusalem and
        as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ”
        Rom. 15:19). Along with these he traveled along many roads, going to
        Rome and into Spain: “For the sake of the words of your lips, I have
        kept hard ways” (Ps. 17:4, Vulgate). Secondly, he mentions the dangers
        from journeys: first, the lesser ones; secondly, the more serious danger
        from false brethren. Among the lesser dangers he mentions three things,
        in regard to which he suffered many dangers. First, in regard to their
        causes, and these either from natural causes; hence he says, dangers
        from rivers, for streams naturally rise in the winter and are swift and
        very dangerous; or from malicious violence; as to this he says, in
        danger from robbers, whom the devil roused against him to rob him of his
        clothing: “His troops come on together; they have cast up siegeworks
        against me, and encamp round about my tent” (Job 19:12). Secondly, he
        lists the dangers that inspire fear either from his own; hence he says,
        in danger from my own people, i.e., managed by the Jews: or from
        outsiders; hence he says, in danger from Gentiles, who wanted to capture
        him for preaching the one true God. Consequently, he had no rest from
        his own or from others: “My mother, you bore me, a man of strife and
        contention to the whole land!” (Jer. 15:10). Thirdly, he lists the
        dangers as to their places. First, as to cities he says, danger in the
        city, i.e., in cities stirred up against me, as at Ephesus and Corinth
        (Ac. 18 & 19); or as to a desert place; hence he says, danger in the
        wilderness, either from evil beasts, as when a viper bit his hand (Ac.
        28:3) as he was collecting sticks; or from want of food. Secondly, as to
        danger at sea, such as perils from plunderers and pirates: “Let those
        who sail the sea tell of its dangers” (Sir. 43:26, Vulgate). But he
        mentions a more serious danger, saying, danger from false brethren,
        i.e., from false Christians and heretics and false apostles: “Let every
        man beware of his neighbor” (Jer. 9:4).

        27 In toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and
        thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 28 And, apart from
        other things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all
        the churches. 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall,
        and I am not indignant? 30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things
        that show my weakness. 31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who
        is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie. 32 At Damascus, the
        governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to
        seize me, 33 but I was let down in a basket through a window in the
        wall, and escaped his hands.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        429. – Here he lists the evils voluntarily assumed, namely, those
        endured in homes, and he lists three evils opposed to the three goods
        which are necessary for domestic life. The first good is restful sleep;
        the second is sustenance from food; the third is the warmth of clothing.
        To restful sleep he opposes labor and watchings, in regard to which he
        says, in toil, i.e., manual labor: “You yourselves know that these hands
        ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me” (Ac.
        20:34), because he literally made his living with his own hands: “With
        toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of
        you.” (2 Th. 3:8). As to the weakness resulting from labor he says, and
        hardship [tiredness], which is a weakness and tiredness that follows
        upon labor or from a natural sickness: “My strength was dried up as by
        the heat of summer” (Ps. 32:4). But in regard to watchings he says,
        through many a sleepless night, because he devoted himself either to
        preaching at night or to manual labor. In Ac. (20:7) it says that he
        prolonged his sermon until midnight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        430. – To sustenance from food he opposes two forms of being denied
        food. One is due to necessity; hence he says, in hunger and thirst,
        namely, because he was unable frequently to obtain food and drink: “To
        the present hour we hunger and thirst” (1 Cor. 4:11); the other is
        voluntary; hence he says, often without food, i.e., voluntarily
        undertaken both for the good example and to tame the flesh: “I pommel my
        body and subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27). But this seems to be out of harmony
        with Matt. (6:33): “But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,
        and all these things shall be yours as well.” Why then in hunger and
        thirst? I answer that when it is expedient and for our benefit, they are
        added, i.e., temporal things; but sometimes it is expedient to lack
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        431. – To the warmth of clothing he opposes two things: one on the part
        of nature; hence he says, in cold; the other on the part of poverty,
        hence he says, and exposure. I am proved a minister of Christ: “We are
        ill-clad and buffeted and homeless” (1 Cor. 4:11); “In afflictions,
        hardships, calamities” (2 Cor. 6:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        432. – Then when he says, And, apart from other things, he lists the
        internal evils he assumed, namely, those caused by anxiety of heart
        because of the activities of the false apostles. Now a good prelate is
        concerned about two things affecting his subjects, namely, their safety
        and the defection. And the Apostle suffered affliction in regard to
        both; the first, when he says, and, apart from other things, there is
        the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. As if to
        say: in addition to what I suffer and have suffered from outside, the
        internal affliction is more oppressive, that is, solicitude for his
        subjects. Hence, he says, the daily pressure for all the churches is
        great and lies heavily upon him, because he was very solicitous:
        “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things” (Lk.
        10:41); “He that rules, with solicitude” (Rom. 12:8, Vulgate).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        433. – The second affliction he suffered concerned the failings of his
        subjects, and this he does in two ways, namely for spiritual failings;
        hence he says, Who is weak, namely, in faith and in goodness, and I am
        not weak? In heart, grieving over them as though over myself? “To the
        weak I became weak, that I might win the weak.” (1 Cor. 9:22); “O that
        my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep
        day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!” (Jer. 9:1).
        And for bodily failings; hence he says, Who is made to fall with the
        evil of punishment, i.e., who suffers afflictions, and I am not
        indignant [on fire] with the fire of compassion? This is the fire which
        the Lord came to cast upon the earth (Lk. 12:49).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        434. – And notice that he fittingly uses the word, “on fire”, because
        compassion proceeds from the love of God and neighbor, which is a
        consuming fire, because it moves one to alleviate the misfortunes of
        one’s neighbor, and it cleanses the soul with the compassion it
        engenders. Furthermore, our sins are loosed, while the charity of that
        compassion covers a multitude of sins. For a person sometimes falls into
        sin of himself, and then he is weakened; sometimes by the example of
        others, and then he is scandalized: “Woe to the man by whom the
        temptation comes!” (Matt. 18:7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        435. – Then when he says, if I must boast, he confirms some of the
        statements made above. Or say that above he speaks about the evils he
        commendably suffered; but here about the evils he prudently avoided. But
        because the avoidance of evils that arise against the faith seems to
        imply weakness, therefore, first, he states that he wishes to glory in
        those that imply weakness; secondly, he proposes an oath to confirm his
        statements (v. 31); thirdly, he shows how he avoided some evils (v. 32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        436. – First, therefore, he suggests that the things in which one should
        glory, if he must glory, saying: If, i.e., because I must, I must boast
        [glory], I will boast of the things that show my weakness. As if to say:
        others may glory in their race and other worldly things: “They glory in
        their shame, with minds set on earthly things” (Phil. 3:19), and I when
        compelled gloried in them. Yet if I must glory, I will glory in my
        weakness: “I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the
        power of Christ may rest upon me” (2 Cor. 12:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        437. – Secondly, he states that he is not lying and is calling on God to
        witness after the manner of an oath, so that they will believe his,
        saying, The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for
        ever, knows that I do not lie. Here he lays down three things. One by
        which to induce fear; hence he says, God: “Who would not fear thee, O
        King of the nations?” (Jer. 10:7); one by which he excites love, when he
        says, Father: “Every good endowment and every perfect gift is from
        above, coming down from the Father of lights” (Jas. 1:17); “If then I am
        a father, where is my love?”, or according to another version, “my
        honor?” (Mal. 1:5); thirdly, to inspire reverence and praise, who is
        blessed forever: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
        Christ” (2 Cor. 1:3). He, therefore, so revered, so worthy of love, so
        worthy of fear, knows that I do not lie, namely, in what I have said and
        will say: “Our word to you has not been Yes and No” (2 Cor. 1:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        438. – Then when he says, At Damascus, he shows the evils he avoided,
        and this in a certain particular danger. Here it should be noted that
        the Apostle first began to preach Christ in Damascus, where he was
        thrown to the ground and converted to the faith, as he was on his way to
        arrest Christians. Therefore, the Jews appealed to the governor of that
        city, who was representing Aretas the king, to arrest Paul and put him
        to death. So the governor ordered the city-gates to be watched day and
        night, as it says in Ac. (chap. 9). But the Christians who were there,
        desiring to save Paul, lowered him by the wall in a basket. This form of
        escape the Apostle touches on, when he says: truly I am not lying about
        what I am telling you now: for at Damascus, the governor under King
        Aretas, i.e., the governor who ruled at Damascus under king Aretas, was
        induced by the Jews to guard the city of the Damascenes to seize me, so
        that after I was apprehended, I would be delivered to the Jews and
        prevented from preaching. But I was let down in a basket through a
        window in the wall, and escaped his hands, namely, the governor’s. This
        was done in keeping with the Lord’s command: “When they persecute you in
        one town, flee to the next” (Matt. 10:23). In this way too did Michel
        let David down through a window to escape from Saul (1 Sam. 19:12), and
        Rahab let the spies down with a cord out of a window (Jos. 2:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        439. – But some object against the Apostle’s conduct: first, because he
        seems to have lacked confidence in the Lord and fled. I answer that as
        long as human help is available, a man should not run for divine help,
        because this would be tempting God; but he should use human help as much
        as he can. But the Apostle was not yet lacking human help. The second
        objection is based on Jn. (10:12): “He who is a hireling and not a
        shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves
        the sheep and flees.” Hence, it seems that Paul was not a good shepherd.
        I answer that sometimes the person of the prelate alone is sought, and
        sometimes the prelate along with all the people. When the prelate alone
        is sought, then he should entrust his duties to another and absent
        himself. This is what Paul did. Hence, a Gloss says that although he
        fled, he still took care of his people by commending them to the Good
        Shepherd seated in heaven and saving himself for their benefit by
        flight. But when the entire flock is sought, then he should prefer the
        benefit and safety of the flock to his own bodily safety. But note that
        there is a flight inspired by humility, when a person flees honors, as
        Christ fled when they sought to make him king (Jn. 6:15). In the same
        way Saul, when chosen, concealed himself at home (1 Sam. 10:22). Another
        is inspired by caution, namely, when a person flees dangers in order to
        be saved for greater ones. This is the way Elijah fled from Jezebel (1
        Kg. 19:3), and the way the Apostle fled from the hands of the governor.

        1 I must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go on to
        visions and revelations of the Lord. 2 I know a man in Christ who
        fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body
        or out of the body I do not know, God knows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        440. – Having commended himself for the evils he suffered, the Apostle
        continues to commend himself and shows the pre-eminence of his dignity
        in regard to good things received from God. For he first gloried in his
        weaknesses, but now in his good things. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he commends himself on the good things received from God;
        secondly, he begs pardon for this commendation, alleging that he is
        compelled to do this (v. 11). In regard to the first he does two things.
        First, he extols the greatness of the things conferred on him by God;
        secondly, he discloses the remedy given to him against the danger of
        pride (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he
        mentions a good divinely conferred; secondly, he shows how he behaved in
        regard to glorying in it (v. 5). In regard to the first he does two
        things. First, he shows in general that this was divinely bestowed;
        secondly, in particular (v. 2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        441. – The good divinely bestowed on the Apostle are revelations made to
        him by God; it is of these that he wishes to glory. Hence he says: If I
        must boast [glory], i.e., because I must glory for your sake, although
        in itself there is nothing to be gained by it, because a person who
        glories in a good he has received runs the risk of losing what he has:
        “Through this,” i.e., by vain glory, “are the treasures of the virtues
        opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.” (Sir. 43:15, Aquinas Latin).
        And this is signified in Hezekiah, when he showed the treasures of the
        Lord’s house to the messengers of the king in Babylon (Is. 39:2). And
        although, absolutely speaking, it is not expedient to glory,
        nevertheless, for some special reason a man may glory, as is clear from
        what has been stated above. Therefore he says: because I must boast
        [glory], I will leave off commending myself on my infirmities and come
        by commending myself to visions and revelations of the Lord.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        442. – Here it should be noted the difference between a vision and a
        revelation. For a revelation includes a vision, but not vice versa. For
        sometimes things are seen, the understanding and significance of which
        are hidden from the beholder; in that case it is only a vision, as in
        the visions of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, the vision of the ears of
        corn and of the statue was only a vision. But in regard to Joseph and
        Daniel, who understood the meaning of what was seen, it was a revelation
        and a prophecy. Both, however, namely vision and revelation, are
        sometimes produced by God: “There is a God in heaven who reveals
        mysteries” (Dan. 2:28); “It was I who multiplied visions” (Hos. 12:10);
        “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law” (Ps.
        119:18); but sometimes by an evil spirit: “They prophesied by Baal and
        led my people Israel astray” (Jer. 23:13). To the Apostle were made both
        vision and revelation, because he fully understood the secret things he
        saw. They were produced by the Lord and not by an evil spirit. Hence he
        says: I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. Now a
        revelation is a removing of a veil. But a veil can be of two kinds: one
        on the part of the beholder, and this is unbelief or sin or hardness of
        heart. Of this veil he said above (3:15): “Yes, to this day whenever
        Moses is read a veil lies over their minds”; the other is on the part of
        the object seen, namely, when spiritual things are proposed to someone
        under the figures of sense-perceptible objects. Concerning this it says
        in Num. (chap. 4) that the priests delivered the vessels of the
        sanctuary veiled to the Levites, because weaker persons cannot grasp
        spiritual things as they are in themselves. This is why the Lord spoke
        to the multitudes in parables (Matt. 13:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        443. – Then the Apostle describes these visions and revelations in
        details, speaking of himself as though of another person; hence he says,
        I know a man in Christ. He mentions two visions: the first begins here;
        the second at v. 3.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        444. – When speaking of the first vision, the Apostle makes use of a
        distinction, for he says in regard to this revelation that he knew
        certain things and other things not. But he knew three things, namely,
        the condition of the beholder; hence he says: I know a man in Christ;
        the time of the vision, that is, who fourteen years ago; and the high
        point of the vision, because he was caught up to the third heaven. And
        he says that he did not know the disposition of the beholder, whether in
        the body or out of the body I do not know.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        445. – Therefore let us see what he knew, so that through what is known
        we may more easily attain to what was not known. First of all, the
        condition of the beholder, which is praiseworthy, because he was in
        Christ, i.e., conformed to Christ. But on the contrary, no one is in
        Christ, unless he has charity, because “He who abides in love abides in
        God” (1 Jn. 4:16). Therefore, he knew that he had charity, which is
        contrary to what is stated in Ec. (9:1): “The righteous and the wise and
        their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate man does
        not know.” I answer that being in Christ can be taken in two ways: in
        one way by faith and the sacrament of faith according to Gal. (3:27):
        “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ,”
        namely, by faith and the sacrament of faith. This is the sense in which
        the Apostle knew that he was in Christ. In another way a person is said
        to be in Christ through charity, and in this way no one knows for
        certain that he is in Christ, except by certain tests and signs,
        inasmuch as he feels himself disposed and joined to Christ in such a way
        that he would not permit himself to be separated from him for any reason
        including death. This the Apostle experienced in regard to himself, when
        he said: “For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
        principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
        height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to
        separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 8:38).
        Hence, he could have had such signs that he was in the charity of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        446. – Secondly, the time of the vision, which was fitting, because it
        was fourteen years ago; for fourteen years had elapsed from the time he
        saw the vision, until he wrote this epistle, because when he wrote this
        epistle he had not yet been cast into prison. Hence it seems to have
        been written at the beginning of Nero’s reign, by whom he was killed
        much later. Hence if we go back fourteen years from the beginning of
        Nero’s reign, it is clear that the Apostle had these visions at the
        beginning of his conversion. For he had been converted to Christ in the
        same year that the Lord suffered. But Christ suffered near the end of
        Tiberius Caesar’s reign, who was succeeded at death by the emperor
        Caius, who lived four years, after which Nero became emperor. Therefore,
        between Tiberius and Nero there were four years. Adding two years from
        Tiberius’ reign, because he was not yet dead, when Paul was converted,
        and from Nero’s reign the eight years which had passed until he wrote
        this epistle, there were fourteen years between the time of his
        conversion to the time he wrote this epistle. Therefore, some say quite
        probably that the Apostle had these visions during those three days
        after he was struck down by the Lord, when he remained neither seeing
        nor eating nor drinking (Ac. 9:9). But he recalls the time of his
        conversion to show that if he was so pleasing to Christ from the time of
        his conversion that he revealed such things to him, then how much more
        pleasing was he after fourteen years, when he had grown in charity
        before God and in the virtues and graces?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        447. – Thirdly, let us see the high point of the vision, because he was
        caught up (raptus) to the third heaven. But it should be noted that it
        is one thing to be the victim of thievery and another to be rapt.
        Properly speaking, the former takes place when something is taken away
        from another in a secret way, hence, in Gen. (40:13) Joseph said: “For I
        was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews.” A person is properly
        speaking rapt when something is taken suddenly and by force: “As the
        torrent that passes swiftly (raptim)”, i.e., suddenly and rapidly, “in
        the valleys” (Job 6:15). Hence it is that plunderers who despoil
        violently are called ravagers (raptores). But note that a man is said to
        be rapt from men, as Enoch: “He was caught up (raptim) lest evil change
        his understanding or guile deceive his soul” (Wis. 4:11); sometimes the
        soul is rapt from the body: “Fool! This night your soul is required of
        you” (Lk. 12:20). Sometimes a person is said to be rapt by himself, when
        for some reason he is made to be outside himself; and this is the same
        as ecstasy. But a man is made to be outside himself both by his
        appetitive power and by his cognitive power. For by the former a person
        is in himself, when he cares only for things that are his own; but he is
        made to be outside himself when he does not care about things that are
        his own, but about things that pertain to others; and this is the work
        of charity: “Love does not insist on its own way” (1 Cor. 13:5).
        Concerning this ecstasy Dionysius says in the Divine Names (chap. 4):
        “Ecstasy is produced by divine love not permitting one to be a lover of
        self but of the beloved,” i.e., of the things loved. But a person is
        made to be outside himself according to the cognitive power when he is
        raised up above the human mode to see something. This is the rapture
        about which the Apostle is speaking here.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        448. – But it should be noted that a mode natural to human knowing is
        that a man know simultaneously with his mental power, which is the
        intellect, and with a bodily one, which is a sense. This is why a man in
        knowing has a free judgment of the intellect, when the senses are well
        disposed in their vigor and not hindered by a fettering, as happens
        during sleep. Therefore a man is made to be outside himself when he is
        removed from this natural disposition for knowing, namely, when the
        intellect, being withdrawn from the use of the senses and
        sense-perceptible things, is moved to see certain things. This occurs in
        two ways: first, by a lack of power, no matter how it is produced. This
        happens in phrenitis and other mental cases, so that this withdrawal
        from the senses is not a state of being elevated, but of being cast
        down, because their power has been weakened. But the other way is by
        divine power, and then it is, properly speaking, an elevation, because
        since the agent makes the thing it works on to be like itself, a
        withdrawal produced by divine power and above men is something higher
        than man’s nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        449. – Therefore, a rapture of this sort is defined as “an elevation
        from that which is according to nature into that which is above nature,
        produced in virtue of a higher nature.” In this definition are mentioned
        its genus, when it is called an elevation; the efficient cause, because
        it is by the power of a higher nature; and the two termini of the
        change, namely, the terminus from which and into which, when it is
        described as being from that which is according to nature into what is
        above nature. Thus it is clear what rapture is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        450. – Then he mentions the terminus reached by the rapture, when he
        says, to the third heaven. But it should be noted that the third heaven
        is taken in three ways: in one way according to the things below the
        soul; in another way according to the things in the soul; and in a third
        way according to things above the soul. Below the soul are all bodies,
        as Augustine says in the book On The True Religion. And so we can think
        of a threefold heaven: the ethereal, sidereal, and empyrean. In this way
        the Apostle is said to have been rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to see
        things in the empyrean heaven; not to exist there, because then he would
        have known whether he was in the body or out of the body. Or according
        to Damascene, who does not admit an empyrean heaven, we can say that the
        third heaven, to which the Apostle was rapt, is above the eighth sphere,
        so that he could clearly see the things which exist above all corporeal
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        451. – But if we take heaven according to the things in the soul itself,
        then we should call heaven some altitude of mind which transcends
        natural human knowledge. Now there are three kinds of sight, namely,
        bodily, by which we can see and know bodies; spiritual or imaginary, by
        which we see likenesses of bodies; and intellectual, by which we know
        the nature of things in themselves. For the proper object of the
        intellect is the “what it is” (quod quid est) of things. But such a
        sight of things, if it takes place according to the natural mode (e.g.
        if I see something visible, if I imagine something previously seen, or
        if I understand through phantasms) cannot be called heaven. But each of
        these is called heaven when they are above the natural faculty of human
        knowledge. For example, if you see something with your bodily eyes above
        the faculty of nature, then you are rapt into the first heaven. This is
        the way Belshazzar was rapt, when he saw the handwriting on the wall, as
        it is stated in Dan. (5:5). But if you are raised up by the imagination
        or spirit to know something supernaturally, then you are rapt to the
        second heaven. This is the way Peter was rapt, when he saw the linen
        sheet descending from heaven (Ac. 10:11). But if a person were to see
        intelligible things themselves and their nature, not through
        sense-perceptible things not through phantasms, he would be rapt to the
        third heaven.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        452. – But it should be noted that to be rapt to the first heaven is to
        be alienated from the bodily senses. Hence, since no one can be totally
        withdrawn from the bodily senses, it is obvious that no one can be rapt
        in the strict sense to the first heaven, but only in a qualified sense,
        inasmuch as it sometimes happens that a person is so engrossed in one
        sense that he is withdrawn from the act of the others. One is rapt to
        the second heaven when he is alienated from sense to see imaginable
        things; hence, such a person is always said to be in ecstasy. And so
        when Peter saw the linen sheet (Ac. 10:11), it is said that he was in
        ecstasy. But Paul is said to have been rapt to the third heaven, because
        he was so alienated from the senses and lifted above all bodily things
        that he saw intelligible things naked and pure in the way angels and
        separated souls see them. What is more, he saw God in his essence, as
        Augustine expressly says in Gen. ad Litt.12 and in a Gloss, and ad
        Paulinus in the book, De Videndo Deum. Furthermore, it is not probable
        that Moses, the minister of the Old Testament to the Jews saw God, and
        the minister of the New Testament to the Gentiles, the teacher of the
        Gentiles, was deprived of this gift. Hence he says above (3:9): “For if
        there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation
        of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor.” That Moses saw God in
        his essence is clear, for he begged God: “Show me your face” (Ex. 33:13,
        Vulgate). And although it was denied him at that time, it is not stated
        that the Lord finally denied him. Hence, Augustine says that this was
        granted him by reason of what is stated in Num. (12:6): “If there is a
        prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him in a vision, I
        speak with him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted
        with all my house.” For he saw God openly and not in a dark manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        453. – But would it have been possible for Paul to see God without being
        rapt? I answer: No, for it is impossible that God be seen in this life
        by a man not alienated from his senses, because no image or phantasm is
        a sufficient medium for showing God’s essence; therefore, he must be
        abstracted and alienated from the senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        454. – In a third way, by taking heaven according to things above the
        soul; in this way the three heavens are the three hierarchies of angels.
        According to this the Apostle was rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to see
        God’s essence as clearly as the angels of the higher and first hierarchy
        see him, because they see God in such a way as to receive illumination
        in God himself and to know the divine mysteries. This is the way Paul
        saw.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        455. – But if he saw God as the angels of the higher and first hierarchy
        do, then it seems that the Apostle was beatified and, consequently, was
        immortal. I answer that although he saw God in his essence, he was not
        absolutely beatified, but only in a qualified sense. Yet it should be
        noted that the vision of God by essence takes place by means of a
        certain light, namely, the light of glory, of which it says in Ps. 36
        (9): “In your light we see light.” But light is communicated to some
        things after the manner of a passing quality and to others after the
        manner of an inhering form, i.e., connaturally produced; but it is found
        in the air as a passing form and not as a permanent form, because it
        vanishes when the sun is absent. Similarly, the light of glory is
        infused in the mind in two ways: in one way, after the manner of a form
        connaturally made and permanent, and then it makes a mind beatified in
        the strict sense. This is the way it is infused in the beatified in
        heaven. Hence they are called comprehenders and, so to say, seers. In
        another way the light of glory affects a human mind as a passing
        quality; this is the way Paul’s mind in rapture was enlightened by the
        light of glory. Hence, the very name, “rapture,” suggests that this was
        done in a passing manner. Consequently, he was not glorified in the
        strict sense or had the mark of glory, because that brightness was not
        produced as a property. As a result it was not derived from the soul in
        the body, nor did he remain in this state permanently. Hence, when he
        was in rapture, he had only the act of the beatified, but he was not
        beatified. Thus it is clear what the Apostle saw in his rapture, namely,
        the condition of the beholder, the time of the vision, and the high
        point of the vision.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        456. – Then he tells what he did not know, namely, whether he was in the
        body or out of the body, although he says that God knew. Hence he says,
        whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. Some
        interpret this as meaning that the rapture referred to his body, saying
        that the Apostle did not say he did not know whether the soul was joined
        to the body in that rapture, but whether he was rapt according to the
        soul and body simultaneously, so as to have been transported bodily into
        heaven as Habakkuk was transported (Dan. 14:35-39), or whether it was
        according to the soul only that he enjoyed the vision of God, as it says
        in Ez. (8:3): “He brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem.” This was
        the way a certain Jew understood, as Jerome mentions in the Prol. to
        Dan. 3ff., where he says: “Finally, he says that even our Apostle does
        not dare to say that he was rapt in the body, but he said: whether in
        the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows.” But Augustine
        disproves this interpretation in Gen. ad Litt.12, because it does not
        agree with the other words of the Apostle. For the Apostle says that he
        was rapt to the third heaven; hence he knew for certain that it was the
        third heaven. Consequently, he knew whether that heaven was corporeal or
        incorporeal, i.e., an incorporeal thing. But if it was incorporeal, he
        knew that he could not have been rapt there bodily, because a body
        cannot exist in an incorporeal thing. But if it had been corporeal, he
        knew that the soul was not there without the body, because the soul
        joined to the body cannot be in a place where there is no body, unless
        the incorporeal heaven is called a likeness of the bodily heaven. But if
        that were the case, the Apostle would not have said that he knew he was
        rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to a likeness of heaven, because by that
        same token it could be said that he was rapt in the body, i.e., in the
        likeness of a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        457. – Therefore it must be admitted according to Augustine that no one
        set in this life and living this mortal life can see the divine essence.
        Hence, the Lord says: “For man shall not see me and live” (Ex. 33:20),
        i.e., no man will see me, unless he is entirely separated from the body,
        namely, in such a way that his soul is not in the body as a form, or if
        it is as a form, nevertheless his mind is totally and altogether
        alienated from the sense in such a vision. Therefore, it must be said
        that the Apostle says he does not know whether the soul was entirely
        separated from the body in that vision. Hence he says, whether out of
        the body, or whether his soul existed in the body as a form, but his
        mind was alienated from the bodily senses; hence, he says, whether in
        the body. Even others concede this.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        458. – Having spoken of the first rapture, the Apostle speaks of a
        second rapture. First, he mentions the rapture; secondly, its excellence
        (v. 4b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        459. – It should be noted that a Gloss says that this rapture was
        distinct from the first, and if one considers the matter well, two
        things are written of the Apostle to which these two raptures can be
        referred. For in Acts (chap. 9) it is recorded that he remained for
        three days without seeing and without taking food or drink; and the
        first rapture can be referred to this event, namely, that he was rapt to
        the third heaven at that time. But in Acts (chap. 22) it says that he
        was in a trance in the temple; hence the second rapture can refer to
        this. But this does not seem to be a similar case, because when he was
        in the trance, the Apostle had been cast into prison; but the Apostle
        wrote this epistle long before that. Therefore it must be said that this
        rapture differs from the first in regard to that into which he was rapt.
        For in the first rapture he had been rapt to the third heaven, but in
        the second to the paradise of God
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        460. – But if you take the third heaven in a corporeal sense according
        to the first acceptation of the heavens, as mentioned above, or if it
        was an imaginary vision, it could be called a bodily paradise, so that
        he was rapt to an earthly paradise. But this is against the author’s
        intention, according to whom we say that he was rapt to the third
        heaven, i.e., to a vision of intelligible things according to which they
        are seen in themselves and in their own natures, as has been said above.
        Hence, according to this we must not understand one thing by heaven and
        another by paradise, but one and the same thing by both, namely, the
        glory of the saints, but according to one thing in one case and
        according to another thing in the other case. For heaven suggests a
        certain loftiness accompanied by brightness, but paradise a certain
        joyful pleasantness. Now these two things are present in an excellent
        way in the saints and angels who see God, because there is present in
        them a most excellent brightness by which they see God, and a supreme
        agreeableness by which they enjoy God. Therefore, they are said to be in
        heaven as to the brightness and in paradise as to the pleasantness: “You
        shall see, and your heart shall rejoice” (Is. 66:14). Therefore, both of
        these were conferred on the Apostle, namely to be raised up to that most
        excellent clearness of knowledge, which he signifies when he says, to
        the third heaven, and to experience the agreeableness of the divine
        sweetness; hence he says, into paradise: “O how great is the multitude
        of thy sweetness, O Lord” (Ps. 31:20); “To him who conquers I will give
        some of the hidden manna” (Rev. 2:17). This sweetness is the delight
        experienced in enjoying God, and is mentioned in Matt. (25:13): “Enter
        into the joy of your master.” Thus the terminus of the rapture is clear,
        namely, into paradise, i.e., into that sweetness with which those who
        are in the heavenly Jerusalem are unceasingly refreshed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        461. – Then he mentions the excellence of that rapture, because he heard
        things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. This can be
        explained in two ways: in one way so that the word, “man,” is construed
        with “may” and “utter.” Then the sense is this: he heard secret words,
        i.e., he perceived an intimate understanding of God’s secret essence, as
        though by words, which words it is not lawful to be uttered by a man. In
        the other way, so that “man” is construed only with “may not”. Then the
        sense is this: he heard words, which it is not lawful to utter to a man,
        i.e., to an imperfect man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        462. – But it should be noted according to Augustine that Paul was rapt
        to a vision of the divine essence, which of course, cannot be seen by
        any created likeness. Hence, it is clear that what Paul saw of the
        divine essence cannot be described by any human tongue; otherwise, God
        would not be incomprehensible. Therefore, according to the first
        explanation it must be said: he heard, i.e., considered, secret words,
        i.e., the magnificence of the godhead, which no man can utter. He says
        “heard” for “saw” because that consideration was according to an
        interior act of the soul, in which the same is heard and seen, as it
        says in Num. (12:8): “For I speak to him mouth to mouth.” That
        consideration is called a vision, inasmuch as God is seen in it; and an
        utterance inasmuch as man in instructed about divine things in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        463. – And because such spiritual things are not to be disclosed to the
        simple and imperfect, but to the perfect, as it says in 1 Cor. (2:6):
        “Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom,” it is explained in the
        second way, so that the secrets he heard there it is not lawful to man
        to utter, i.e., to the imperfect, but to the spiritual, among whom we
        speak wisdom: “It is the glory of God to conceal things” (Prov. 25:2),
        i.e., the fact that it is necessary to conceal the marvelous things of
        God pertains to God’s glory. The Psalm is according to the translation
        of Jerome: “Your praise, O God, is silent to you” (cf. Ps. 108:2,
        Vulgate), that is, cannot be comprehended by our words.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        464. – Then when he says, On behalf of this man I will boast, he shows
        how he reacted to this glory. In regard to this he does three things.
        First, he shows that he did not glory in such revelations; secondly, he
        suggests that he has something else in which to glory (v. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        465. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the statement, on
        behalf of this man I will boast [glory], but on my own behalf I will not
        boast, can be read in two ways. In one way so that the Apostle is
        showing that he is the one in whom he glories, i.e., that he is the one
        who saw these visions. In another way, to show that it was someone else
        who saw these visions. For it should be noted that there are two things
        to consider in man, namely, the gift of God and the human condition. If
        a person glories in a gift of God as received from God, that glorying is
        good, as has been state above (10:17). But if he glories in that gift as
        though he had it of himself, then such glorying is evil: “What have you
        that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as
        if it were not a gift?” (1 Cor. 4:7). According to this, therefore, the
        Apostle says, on behalf of this man, namely, for the visions and gifts
        conferred on me by God, I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not
        boast, i.e., will not glory in them as though I were their source,
        because I had them from God. But if I must glory, I will glory in
        nothing except my weaknesses, i.e., I have nothing in which I can glory
        save in my own condition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        466. – But if it is explained as showing that it was someone else who
        saw, even if it was he, then the sense is as though he were speaking of
        someone, saying, on behalf of this man I will boast, i.e., for the man
        who saw this and who received these gifts I will glory; but on my own
        behalf, as wishing to show that I am such a one, I will not boast except
        of my weaknesses, i.e., in the tribulations I suffer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        467. – But because they could say to him, “O Apostle, it is not strange
        that you do not glory, because you have nothing in which to glory,” he
        shows that even besides these visions he has something in which to
        glory. Although I might glory in such a man and not in myself, yet I can
        rightfully glory in myself, for if I should wish to boast either in such
        tribulations or in other things bestowed on me by God, or even for my
        infirmity, I shall not be a fool, i.e., I will not act foolishly. Why?
        For I will be speaking the truth about the other things in which I can
        glory besides those visions. He says, I shall not be a fool, because he
        gloried in the things he had; for when a person glories in things he
        does not have, he is speaking foolishly: “For you say, I am rich, I have
        prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched,
        pitiable, poor, blind, and naked” (Rev. 3:17); and because he gloried
        with sufficient reason, as is clear from the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        468. – Then when he says, But I refrain from it, he indicates the reason
        he does not glory in everything, if he can glory, the reason being that
        he wishes to spare them. Hence he says, I refrain from it, so that no
        one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. As if to
        say: I could glory in many other things, but I forbear, i.e., I glory
        sparingly, of I forbear commending myself, lest I become burdensome to
        you. For God has conferred on me such things that if you knew them, you
        would regard me as much greater; and these are the many charismatic
        gifts which the Apostle had and for which the men of this world are wont
        to commend others and regard them as great more than for doing something
        pleasing. Hence he says, I do not wish to be commended on these gifts;
        therefore I refrain, i.e., I do not glory. Why? So that no one may think
        more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        469. – Or another way: man is known in two ways: by his manner of life
        and by his doctrine. Although he could have done so, the Apostle did not
        wish to say about himself certain things which went beyond his life and
        doctrine. Consequently, I refrain, so that no one may think more of me
        than he sees in me, i.e., in my outward conduct, or hears from me, i.e.,
        from the doctrine of my preaching and exhortation and instruction,
        because they might perhaps think him immortal or an angel: “A man of
        understanding remains silent” (Prov. 11:12): “A fool gives full vent to
        his anger, but a wise man quietly holds it back” (Prov. 29:11).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        470. – Or he says: But I refrain, on account of his detractors, namely,
        the false apostles, who said that he glories from elation without cause
        or for things that were not in him. Therefore, he says, But I refrain,
        i.e., I glory sparingly, so that no one, i.e., the false apostles, think
        of me as having an excessive spirit of elation, more than that which he
        sees in me or has heard from me, i.e., above the power of my merits: “O
        LORD, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high” (Ps.
        131:1); “The greater you are, the more humble yourself in all things”

        7 And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations,
        a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me,
        to keep me from being too elated. 8 Three times I besought the Lord
        about this, that it should leave me; 9 but he said to me, “My grace is
        sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” I will
        all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may
        rest upon me. 10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with
        weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        471. – Here he speaks of the remedy against pride. In regard to this he
        does three things. First, he mentions the remedy applied; secondly, he
        discloses his prayer to have the remedy removed (v. 8); thirdly, he
        tells the Lord’s answer giving the reason for the remedy applied (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        472. – In regard to the first it should be noted that very often a wise
        physician procures and permits a lesser disease to come over a person in
        order to cure or avoid a greater one. Thus, to cure a spasm he procures
        a fever. This the Apostle shows was done to him by the physician of
        souls, our Lord Jesus Christ. For Christ, as the supreme physician of
        souls, in order to cure greater sins, permits them to fall into lesser,
        and even mortal sins. But among all the sins the gravest is pride, for
        just as charity is the root and beginning of the virtues, so pride is
        the root and beginning of all vices: “Pride is the beginning of all sin”
        (Sir. 10:15, Vulgate). This is made clear in the following way. Charity
        is called the root of all the virtues, because it unites one to God, who
        is the ultimate end. Hence, just as the end is the beginning of all
        actions to be performed, so charity is the beginning of all the virtues.
        But pride turns away from God, for pride is an inordinate desire for
        one’s own excellence. For if a person seeks some excellence under God,
        if he seeks it moderately and for a good end, it can be endured. But if
        it is not done with due order, he can even fall into other vices, such
        as ambition, avarice, vainglory and the like. Yet it is not, properly
        speaking, pride, unless a person seeks excellence without ordaining it
        to God. Therefore pride, properly called, separates from God and is the
        root of all vices and the worst of them. This is why God resists the
        proud, as it says in Jas. (4:6). Therefore, because the matter of this
        vice, that is, pride, is mainly found in things that are good, because
        its matter is something good, God sometimes permits his elect to be
        prevented by something on their part, e.g. infirmity or some other
        defect, and sometimes even mortal sin, from obtaining such a good, in
        order that they be so humbled on this account that they will not take
        pride in it, and that being thus humiliated, they may recognize that
        they cannot stand by their own powers. Hence it says in Rom. (8:28): “We
        know that in everything God works for good with those who love him,” not
        by reason of their sin, but by God’s providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        473. – Therefore, because the Apostle had good reason for glorying in
        the spiritual choice by which he was chosen by God: “He is a chosen
        instrument of mine” (Ac. 9:15), and in his knowledge of God’s secrets,
        because he says that he was caught up into the third heaven where he
        heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter, and in
        enduring evils because he had “far more imprisonments, with countless
        floggings, and often near death” (2 Cor. 11:23), and in his virginal
        integrity, because “I wish that all were as I myself am” (1 Cor. 7:7),
        and especially in the outstanding knowledge with which he shone and
        which especially puffs one up: for these reasons the Lord applied a
        remedy, lest he be lifted up with pride. And this is what he says: to
        keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations: “Do not
        exalt yourself through your soul’s counsel, lest your soul be torn in
        pieces like a bull” (Sir. 6:2); “Being exalted I have been humbled and
        troubled” (Ps. 88:15, Vulgate). Furthermore, to show that these
        revelations were made to him, he says: a thorn was given me, i.e., for
        my benefit and my humiliation: “You have lifted me up and set me as it
        were upon the wind” (Job 31:22); there was given, I say, to me a thorn
        tormenting my body with bodily weakness, that the soul might be healed.
        For it is said that he literally suffered a great deal from pain in the
        ileum [pelvis]. Or a thorn in the flesh, i.e., of concupiscence arising
        from my flesh, because he was troubled a great deal: “For I do not do
        the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do... So I find it
        to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand... So
        then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I
        serve the law of sin” (Rom. 7:19, 21, 25). Hence, Augustine says that
        there existed in him movements of concupiscence which God’s grace,
        nevertheless, restrained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        474. – That thorn, I say, is a messenger of Satan, i.e., a wicked angel,
        for it was an angel sent by God or permitted, but it was Satan’s because
        Satan’s intention is to subvert, but God’s is to humble and to render
        approved. Let the sinner beware, if the Apostle and vessel of election
        was not secure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        475. – Now the Apostle was anxious to have this thorn removed and prayed
        that it might; hence he says: Three times I besought the Lord about
        this, that it should leave me. Here it should be noted a sick person,
        ignorant of the reason why a physician supplies a stinging plaster, asks
        him to remove it. But the physician, knowing its purpose, that is, for
        health, does not oblige him, caring more for his improvement. Similarly
        the Apostle, feeling that the sting was painful to him, sought the help
        of the unique physician to remove it. For he expressly and devoutly
        asked God three times to remove it, the thorn, from him: “We do not know
        what to do, but our eyes are upon you” (2 Chr. 20:12). Perhaps he asked
        this many times, but he asked him expressly and earnestly three times,
        or three times, namely, many times. For three is a perfect number. And
        of course it was right to ask, because “For he wounds, but he binds up”
        (Job 5:18); “Pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Lk. 22:46).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        476. – Then he states the Lord’s answer: but he, i.e., the Lord, said to
        me: My grace is sufficient for you. Here he does two things. First, he
        states the Lord’s answer; secondly, the reason for the answer (v. 9b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        477. – He says therefore, I asked, but the Lord said to me, my grace is
        sufficient for you. As if to say: it is not necessary that this bodily
        weakness leave you, because it is not dangerous, for you will not be led
        into impatience, since my grace strengthens you; or that this weakness
        of concupiscence depart, because it will not lead you to sin, for my
        grace will protect you: “Justified by his grace as a gift” (Rom. 3:24).
        And of course, God’s grace is sufficient for avoiding evil, doing good,
        and attaining to eternal life: “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1
        Cor. 15:10); “But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus
        our Lord” (Rom. 6:25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        478. – But on the other hand it says in Jn. (15:16): “Whatever you ask
        the Father in my name, he may give it to you.” Therefore, Paul either
        asked discreetly and deserved to be heard, or indiscreetly and hence
        sinned. I answer that a man can speak of one and the same thing in two
        ways: in one way according to itself and the nature of things; in
        another way according to its relation to something else. Hence, it
        happens that something evil according to itself and to be avoided is in
        relation to something else able to be sought. Thus, a medicine, inasmuch
        as it is bitter should be avoided, yet, when it is considered in
        relation to health, a person seeks it. Therefore a thorn in the flesh
        according to itself is to be avoided as troublesome, but inasmuch as it
        is a means to virtue and an exercise of virtue, it should be desired.
        But because that secret of divine providence, namely, that it would turn
        out to his advantage, had not been revealed to him yet, the Apostle
        considered that in itself it was bad for him. But God who had ordained
        this to the good of his humility did not oblige him, as far as his wish
        was concerned; indeed, once he understood its purpose, the Apostle
        gloried in it, saying, I will all the more gladly boast of my
        weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon [dwell in] me. And
        although he did not oblige him as to his wish, yet he heard him and does
        hear his saints to their advantage. Hence, Jerome says in the Letter to
        Paulinus: “The good Lord frequently does not grant what we wish, in
        order to bestow what we should prefer.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        479. – Then he gives the reason for the Lord’s response when he says,
        for my power is made perfect in weakness [infirmity]. This is a
        remarkable expression: virtue is made perfect in infirmity; fire grows
        in water. But this can be understood in two ways, namely, materially and
        by way of occasion. If it is taken materially, the sense is this:
        infirmity is the material on which to exercise virtue; first, humility,
        as stated above; secondly, patience: “The testing of your faith produces
        steadfastness” (Jas. 1:3); thirdly, temperance, because hunger is
        weakened by infirmity and a person is made temperate. But if it is taken
        as an occasion, infirmity is the occasion for arriving at perfect
        virtue, because a man who knows that he is weak is more careful when
        resisting, and as a result of fighting and resisting more he is better
        exercised and, therefore, stronger. Hence it says in Jdg. (3:1) that the
        Lord was not willing to destroy all the inhabitants of the land, but
        preserved some in order that the children of Israel might be exercised
        by fighting against them. In the same way, Scipio also did not wish to
        destroy the city of Carthage, in order that the Romans, having external
        enemies, would not have internal enemies, against whom it is more
        painful to wage war than against outsiders, as he said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        480. – Then the Apostle mentions the effect of this answer from the
        Lord, saying: I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that
        the power of Christ may rest upon me. He mentions two effects. One is
        glorying; hence he says: because my virtue is made perfect in infirmity,
        I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, i.e., given to me for
        my profit; and this because it joins me closer to Christ: “But far be it
        from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal.
        6:14); “But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth?”
        (Sir. 10:34. Vulgate). The reason I will glory gladly is that the power
        of Christ may rest upon me [dwell in me], i.e., that through infirmity
        the grace of Christ may dwell and be made perfect in me: “He gives power
        to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength” (Is.
        40:29).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        481. – The other effect is joy. Hence he says: For the sake of Christ,
        then, I am content with weaknesses. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he mentions the effect of joy; secondly, he assigns the
        reason for it (v. 10b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        482. – He mentions the effect of joy and the matter of joy. He says
        therefore: because the power of Christ dwells in me in all tribulations,
        I am content, i.e., I am greatly pleased and take joy in the infirmities
        I mentioned: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various
        trials” (Jas. 1:2). The weaknesses in which he rejoices abundantly on
        account of Christ’s grace are then listed. First, those which come from
        an internal cause, namely, his infirmities; hence he says, in my
        weaknesses: “Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made
        haste” (Ps. 16:5, Vulgate), namely, toward grace. Secondly, those that
        come from an external cause: first, as to the word, when he says, in
        insults: “Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that
        they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Ac. 15:4);
        then as to deed, and this either as to a lack of good things, when he
        says, in hardships, i.e., in the lack of things necessary and in the
        poverty by which he was pressed: “Contribute to the needs of the saints”
        (Rom. 12:13). Or as to experiencing evils inflicted, and this as to
        external things: “Blessed are those who are persecuted for
        righteousness’ sake” (Matt. 5:10), when he says, in bodily persecutions,
        which we experience from place to place and everywhere, as well as to
        internal things, saying, in calamities, i.e., in anxieties of soul: “I
        am straitened on every side” (Dan. 13:22, Vulgate). But in all these
        things the material which makes for joy is that they are for Christ. As
        if to say: I am pleased because I suffer for Christ: “But let none of
        you suffer as a murderer, or a thief” (1 Pet. 4:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        483. – He assigns the reason for this joy, when he says, for when I am
        weak, then I am strong, i.e., when as a result of what is in me or as a
        result of persecutions, I fall into any of the aforesaid, God’s help is
        applied to me to strengthen me: “Your consolations cheer my soul” (Ps.
        94:19); “Let the weak say, I am strong” (Jl. 3:10, Vulgate); “Though our
        outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every
        day” (2 Cor. 4:16). And in Ex. (1:12) it says that the more the
        Israelites were oppressed, the more they multiplied.

        pertain to his glory. First, he lays the blame for his glorying on the
        Corinthians; secondly, he explains and clarifies this (v. 11b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        485. – First, therefore, he says: I confess that in all these
        commendations I have been a fool, i.e., it seems to you that I have
        performed the work of a fool. But this was not done of myself or
        willingly; rather, I was compelled, and it was your fault, because you
        forced me to it, i.e., gave me the occasion. For subjects frequently
        compel their prelates to do things which seem unwise to do, although
        considering the time and place, they were done wisely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        486. – Then he explains what he had said in a general way, namely, that
        they were the cause of his commending himself, when he says: for I ought
        to have been commended by you. Here he says that they were the cause of
        his commending himself: first, by neglecting the good they should have
        done, in which he enlarges upon their ingratitude; secondly, by
        committing evil, in which he execrates their malice (v. 20). In regard
        to the first he does two things. First, he reminds them what they ought
        to have done by showing the cause (v. 11c); secondly, he rejects their
        excuse (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        487. – He says therefore: yes, you compelled me, because you should have
        done what I have done; hence he says: for I ought to have been commended
        by you, which you have not done when in was necessary, that is, when the
        false apostles by belittling me and preferring themselves rendered vile
        the doctrine and gospel of Christ delivered by me. Hence, because you
        did not commend me, then in order that the faith of Christ not die among
        you, I undertook to commend myself. But this is in conflict with his
        earlier statement (3:1): “Do we need, as some do, letters of
        recommendation to you, or from you?” So why would he wish to be
        commended by them? I answer that the Apostle did not need commendations
        for himself, but for others, namely, that in commending himself his
        doctrine would be held in greater authority and the false apostles
        refuted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        488. – But because they could say: “we did not commend you, because
        there is nothing commendable about you,” the Apostle proves to them that
        they had good cause to commend him, when he says: For I am not at all
        inferior to these superlative apostles, thus showing that there was much
        in him commendable. First, as to the past good things he did; secondly,
        as to the good things he intends to do (v. 14). First, in general as to
        all the churches; secondly, in particular as to what he did among them
        (v. 11d); thirdly he excludes an objection (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        489. – He says therefore: I deserved to be commended by you, because
        there are many things in me worthy of commendation, for I am not at all
        inferior, namely, Peter and James and John, who are superlative
        apostles, i.e., who seem to some to be worthier apostles than I. For the
        false apostles said that they had been taught by Peter and John, who had
        been taught by Christ, and that Peter and John observed the ceremonies
        of the Law; hence, that they too should observe them. But because I have
        done nothing else among you, either as to preaching or to converting
        believers or performing miracles and undertaking labours, but rather
        have done more, because “I worked harder than any of them” (1 Cor.
        15:10), for that reason I am more to be commended. Or they were called
        superlative apostles, that is, Peter, James and John, because they were
        the first ones converted to Christ: “Last of all, as to one untimely
        born, he appeared also to me” (1 Cor. 15:8). If it is taken in this
        sense, even then I have done nothing less than they, because in the
        short time after I was converted, I labored more.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        490. – But granting that I did nothing in regard to the other churches
        for which I might be commended, nevertheless I have done many special
        things among you, and for these you could have commended me; hence he
        says, even though I am nothing, i.e., granting that I did nothing in
        comparison to them, nevertheless, the effect of my power is present
        among you. First, as to our preaching, by which you were converted to
        the faith, and I am your apostle. Yet the signs of a true apostle, i.e.,
        of my preaching, were performed among you by God, inasmuch as believing,
        you were converted: “You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord” (1
        Cor. 9:2); “For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel”
        (1 Cor. 4:15). Secondly, by the manner of life through which faith is
        strengthened, because when one’s life agrees with his doctrine, the
        doctrine has greater authority, and the virtue of the preacher is more
        apparent through patience: “The learning of a man is known by patience”
        (Prov. 19:11, Vulgate); therefore he says, in all patience. Thirdly, as
        to working miracles; hence he says, with signs and wonders and mighty
        works: “And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord
        worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended
        it” (Mk. 16:20)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        491. – These three things are distinct, because “might” [virtus] is
        common to all miracles, for might is the full extent of a power.
        Therefore, something is called mighty [virtuosum] because it proceeds
        from great power [virtute]. Therefore, because miracles come from great
        power, namely the divine, they are therefore called “powers” [virtutes].
        But “sign” refers to a lesser miracle, and “wonder” to a greater one. Or
        he says “signs” as to miracles performed in regard to the present and
        “wonders” in regard to miracles concerning the future. Or signs and
        wonders refer to miracles done contrary to nature; for example, giving
        sight to the blind, raising from the dead, and so on. But mighty deeds
        are things according to nature, not performed in the way nature does, as
        for a sick man to be healed immediately, when one’s hands are placed on
        him; for nature produces the same effect step by step. Or mighty deeds
        mean the virtues of the mind, such as chastity and so on.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        492. – Then he excludes an objection, when he says, For in what were you
        less favored than the rest of the churches? For the Corinthians could
        answer and say: it is true that you have done many good and great
        things, but others have done more and greater things than you.
        Therefore, we are not willing to commend you to them or in comparison
        with them. But he excludes this, saying: For in what were you less
        favored than the rest of the churches? i.e., than the other churches of
        Christ have obtained through him in spiritual matters. As if to say:
        nothing, because they preached the faith and the Apostle preached the
        faith; they showed signs and wonders, and so did the Apostle. In fact
        not only do you not have less, but even more, because the other apostles
        live on the revenues of those to whom they preached, but not the
        Apostle. For he took nothing from the Corinthians; hence he says: except
        that I myself did not burden you by taking what was yours. As if to say:
        you received nothing less, unless perhaps you count it as less that I
        have not taken anything from you, which however is more: “You yourselves
        know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who
        were with me” (Ac. 20:34); “With toil and labor we worked night and day”
        (2 Th. 3:8); “Who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe” (Is. 33:15).
        But if you count this an injury, namely, that I refused to take anything
        from you (as I did not), because I did not love you, and it seems to you
        that I have done wrong, spare me. Hence he says in irony, forgive, that
        is, spare me this wrong! In this manner it says in Eph. (4:32):
        “Forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.”

        to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children. 15 I will
        most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you the more,
        am I to be loved the less? 16 But granting that I myself did not burden
        you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by guile. 17 Did I
        take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? 18 I
        urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take
        advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the
        same steps? 19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been

        493. – Here he shows that he is worthy of commendation in regard to good
        things he intends to do. He does three things. First, he states his
        resolution concerning the future good he intends to do; secondly, he
        assigns the reason for this resolution (v. 14c); thirdly, he applies a
        likeness to his reason (v. 14d).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        494. – It should be noted in regard to the first that sometimes it
        happens that the reason why some do not receive at one time is that they
        might be keeping themselves in reserve for another time, in which they
        can receive both more and more boldly. Therefore, lest they suppose
        something like this of the Apostle, namely, that he refused to take
        anything from them the first time, in order that he might receive more
        the second time, he says that he not only did this in the past, but is
        prepared to do the same in the future; hence he says, Here for the third
        time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden. As if to
        say: not even then will I burden you by taking what is yours: “So I
        refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way” (2 Cor. 11:9);
        “I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let it go” (Job. 27:6). He
        says, here for the third time I am ready to come, and not “this third
        time I am coming,” because he certainly was prepared to go to them a
        third time, yet he went only twice. For he was prepared to go the first
        time; he went and they were converted. He was ready a second time, but
        he was prevented on account of their sin. It was for this that he
        apologized in the beginning of this letter. Now he was ready to go a
        third time, and he went. Hence he went twice, but he was ready to go
        three times.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        495. – Then he gives the reason for this good resolution, when he says:
        for I seek not what is yours but you. The reasoning is this: it is clear
        that an artisan arranges his work according to the end he has in view,
        but when preachers preach, some intend revenue and temporal goods;
        consequently they arrange and direct all their preaching to this. Others
        intend the salvation of souls; consequently, they arrange their
        preaching according as they deem it expedient for the salvation of
        souls. Therefore, because the Apostle in his preaching aimed at the
        salvation of the Corinthians and he saw that it was expedient to take no
        revenue from them, both in order to shame the false apostles and also
        because they were covetous, he refused to take any revenue. Hence he
        assigns this reason: I will not burden you by taking anything, because I
        seek not what is yours by my preaching, but you and your salvation are
        what I aim to procure: “Not that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit”
        (Phil. 4:17). Therefore the Lord said to the apostles: “I will make you
        fishers of men” (Matt. 4:19), not of money. This is also prefigured in
        Gen. (chap. 47), where we read that Joseph brought some Egyptians for
        the service of the king, because the good preacher should be intent upon
        converting believers to the service of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        496. – He adapts a simile to this reasoning, when he says: for children
        ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children.
        First, he presents the simile; secondly, he adapts it (v. 15); thirdly,
        he criticizes their ingratitude (v. 15b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        497. – He says therefore: I do not seek what is yours. This is clear
        from a simile. For we observe that parents according to the flesh should
        lay up for their children, because children ought not to lay up for
        their parents, but parents for their children. Therefore, since I am
        your spiritual father and you are my children, I do not want you to lay
        up for me, but I for you.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        498. – But there is a question here about parents according to the
        flesh, for it says in Ex. (20:12): “Honor your father and your mother,”
        which includes that we must minister to their needs. Therefore the
        children are bound to lay up for their parents. I answer that this
        precept binds children to minister to and help their parents in
        necessity, but not to gather and lay up for them. For laying up and
        gathering have an eye on the future. But in nature the children succeed
        the parents and not vice versa, except in some sad cases. Therefore the
        love of parents naturally induces them to lay up for the children. It is
        in this way that the Apostle speaks; but in Ex. (chap. 20) the Lord is
        speaking about helping them in case of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        499. – Another question that arises concerns the statement that the
        children should not lay up for their parents, but the parents for the
        children. Therefore, since prelates are our spiritual parents, it seems
        that princes and others do wrong when they give their riches to
        prelates. I answer that they gave them to prelates not for themselves,
        but for the poor, and this is what the Lord teaches: “Lay up for
        yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and
        where thieves do not break in and steal” (Matt. 6:20). Hence they are
        given to prelates as dispensers to the poor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        500. – Then he applies the simile, in which he proposed two things: one
        is that the children should not lay up for the parents, and this is now
        clear. The other is that parents should lay up for and give to the
        children; in regard to this he says: therefore, because I am your
        father, I am ready to give to you, and this is what he says: I will most
        gladly spend good things on you, not only spiritual goods by preaching
        and giving examples, but even temporal goods, which he did, inasmuch as
        he preached to them and served them with the revenues of other churches.
        Every prelate should minister these three things to his subjects; hence
        the Lord said to Peter three times: “Feed my sheep” (Jn. 21:17), i.e.,
        food them by word, feed them by example, feed them by temporal
        subsidies. Not only will I give those things to you, but I am ready to
        die for your salvation; hence he says, and be spent for your souls:
        “Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
        friends” (Jn. 15:13); “He laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay
        down our lives for the brethren” (1 Jn. 3:16); “The good shepherd lays
        down his life for the sheep” (Jn. 10:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        501. – Then he criticizes their ingratitude when he says, If I love you
        the more, am I to be loved the less? As if to say: gladly will I be
        spent for you, although you are ungrateful, because although I love you
        the more, I am loved the less. This comparison can be explained in two
        ways. First, in this way: although I love you the more than the other
        apostles, yet I am loved the less, namely, by you, than the false
        apostles are loved, whom you love more than me. Thus it is evident that
        I love you more than they, because I seek only your salvation, but they
        seek only your goods. In another way thus: although I love you the more
        than the other churches, nevertheless I am love less by you than by the
        other churches: “For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the
        affection of Christ Jesus” (Phil. 1:8). That he loved the Corinthians
        more than he loved the other churches is clear from the fact that he
        labored more for them. But that for which we labor more, we love more.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        502. – Then when he says, But granting that I myself did not burden you,
        he removes a suspicion. First, he mentions the suspicion; secondly, he
        excludes it (v. 17); thirdly, he assigns the reason for the exclusion
        (v. 19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        503. – Their suspicion might be that the reason he did not take anything
        for himself was that others might take more from them. Therefore, he
        says: But granting, that is, granting that I myself, in my person and in
        those who are with me, did not burden you by taking anything, but as you
        believed, I was crafty and got the better of you by guile, i.e., I took
        many more of your goods through other persons. But this is false,
        because I have done nothing by guile: “For our appeal does not spring
        from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with guile” (1 Th. 2:3). For
        he was an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile (Jn. 1:47).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        504. – Then he excludes this suspicion when he says, Did I take
        advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? First, in
        general; secondly, in particular. In general in the following way: if I
        had wanted to snatch anything from you by others, I would have sent
        those who might obtain these things. But did I take advantage of you
        through any of those whom I sent to you, by using them to extort your
        goods? As if to say: No: “We have taken advantage of no one”(2 Cor.
        7:2); “That no man transgress, and wrong his brother in this matter” (1
        Th. 4:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        505. – He excludes their suspicion in particular when he says: I urged
        Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. As if to say: none of those
        whom I sent to you overreached you. For I sent Titus to you with
        entreaties. And this is what he says: I urged Titus to go, and sent the
        brother with him, namely, Barnabas or Luke: “With him,” namely Titus,
        “we are sending the brother,” namely one of those mentioned, “who is
        famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel” (2 Cor.
        8:18). But did Titus take advantage of you? As if to say: No: “But
        thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart
        of Titus” (2 Cor. 8:16). That Titus did not overreach them he proves by
        showing that Titus was of the same mind as the Apostle, and he mentions
        two points of similarity: first, in the heart; hence he says: Did we not
        act in the same spirit?, i.e., have the same will; or we were inspired
        by the same spirit to act well and correctly: “Since we have the same
        spirit of faith as he had who wrote, ‘I believed, and so I spoke,’ we
        too believe, and so we speak” (2 Cor. 4:13). Secondly, in work; hence he
        says: Did we not take the same steps, i.e., intent on the same works?
        That is to say, in the steps of Christ, for I walk in the steps of
        Christ: “I have kept his way,” namely, Christ’s, “and have not turned
        aside” (Job 23:11); “Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an
        example, that you should follow in his steps” (1 Pet. 2:21). And Titus
        follows my steps: “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1).
        Therefore, if he agrees with me in will and in work, and I have not
        overreached you and do not intend to overreach you, the conclusion is
        evident. That he did not overreach them is clear from Matt. (7:16): “By
        their fruits you shall know them.”

        506. – The he adds the reason, which excludes their opinion. First, he
        states their opinion; secondly, he excludes it (v. 19). Their opinion
        was that the Apostle, as one guilty and culpable, was writing all the
        words of this epistle to justify himself, and that they were not true,
        but merely invented to justify himself. Therefore, he sets down their
        opinion, saying: Have you been thinking all along, i.e., from the
        beginning of this epistle, that we have been defending ourselves before
        you, i.e., that the words of this epistle are not true, but are
        fabricated as an excuse?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        507. – But he excludes this: for a person who excuses himself in that
        way has two things: one is that he does not use true words, but
        fabrications; the other is that he was not wont to suffer the loss of
        reputation and glory. Hence, it is especially because of the loss of
        reputation that they make excuses. But neither of these is verified in
        us. Therefore, your opinion is not true. That neither of these is
        verified in us is clear, because we do not employ false words. This he
        proves first by God’s testimony, because it is in the sight of God that
        we are speaking. As if to say: God is my witness, that I speak the
        truth: “Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven” (Job 16:19) Secondly,
        by the testimony of Christ, because we have been speaking in Christ,
        i.e., by Christ in whom there is not falsity: “But as men of sincerity,
        as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ” (2 Cor.
        2:17). Furthermore, we do not seek our own glory or fear loss of
        reputation, because all things which I have said about my revelations
        and tribulations, I do or say for your upbuilding, namely, that you
        continue in virtue and expel the false apostles: “Let us then pursue
        what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.” (Rom. 14:19); “Let all
        things be done for edification.” (1 Cor. 14:26); “This voice has come
        for your sake, not for mine” (Jn. 12:30).

        20 For I fear that perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, and
        that you may find me not what you wish; that perhaps there may be
        quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and
        disorder. 21 I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before
        you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and
        have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and licentiousness which
        they have practiced.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        508. – Having cited as one of the causes for commending the failure of
        the Corinthians to do the good things they should have done and for
        which he rebuked their ingratitude, he now states the other cause which
        arose from what they did in regard to the evils they should have
        avoided. In regard to this he amplifies their wickedness and does two
        things. First, he mentions their fault in general; secondly, he explains
        it in detail (v. 20b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        509. – He says therefore: I have praised myself not only because you
        have failed to praise me, but also because of your danger, which
        consists in clinging to the false apostles, because by fostering sin
        among you they were exposing you to great danger. Therefore he says, I
        fear that perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, namely, just,
        but sinners and uncorrected, and that you will be displeasing to me and
        I to you, because sinners as sinners are not pleasing to a just man; and
        that you may find me, i.e., sad and meting out punishment, not what you
        wish to have me. For evil persons hate correction and the truth: “Have I
        then become your enemy by telling you the truth?” (Gal. 4:16). Thus
        their evil is clear in general, namely, that he feared lest they were
        not yet fully repentant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        510. – Then he manifests their sinfulness in particular, when he says,
        that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness,
        slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. In regard to this he does two
        things. First, he enumerates their present evils; secondly, he reminds
        them of past evils of which they have not yet repented.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        511. – In regard to the first it should be noted that after their
        conversion the Corinthians fell into sins of the flesh, as is evident
        from the one who had his father’s wife; and for this they were corrected
        by the first epistle, although not completely, because something still
        remained among them. In addition to this there remained among them many
        spiritual sins which are directly opposed to charity. Now charity does
        two things: first, it makes men’s hearts consent to one another;
        secondly, it induces men to mutual progress. Spiritual sins, on the
        other hand, set men disagreeing and make them offend one another. First,
        therefore, he lists the spiritual sins which pertain to dissention;
        secondly, those which make for offense (v. 20c). In regard to
        dissensions he proceeds in reverse order. For according to the right
        order, men first disagree, inasmuch as one wants one thing and another
        the contrary; secondly, they pass from this to inflicting injury,
        inasmuch as each one wants to obtain his desire; thirdly, when he cannot
        obtain his desire but fails, he burns with the zeal of jealousy [envy];
        fourthly, the result of this is verbal argument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        512. – It is from the last of these that the Apostle begins, saying,
        that perhaps there may be quarreling [contentions]. As if to say: not
        only do I fear your evils in general, but also in particular, lest
        perhaps there be among you contentions over the merits of prelates and
        baptizers: “It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife” (Prov.
        20:3). “Contention is an attack on the truth, accompanied by the
        confidence of shouting” (Ambrose). This contention springs from
        jealousy; hence he says, and jealousy by those who are inferior and have
        less: “For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be
        disorder and every vile practice” (Jas. 3:16); “Jealousy slays the
        simple” (Job 5:2); “But through the devil’s envy death entered the
        world” (Wis. 2:24). Envy comes from animosity; hence he says, anger, in
        revenge and inflicting injury: “Go not on the way with a bold man, lest
        he burden you with his evils” (Sir. 8:18, Vulgate). Animosity comes from
        dissensions; hence he says, selfishness, i.e., hatreds and conflicts of
        spirits: “Take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties, in
        opposition to the doctrine which you have been taught” (Rom. 15:17);
        “All of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you” (1 Cor.
        1:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        513. – Then he lists their present evils in regard to offending. But
        because such evils consist mainly in injuries from words and not from
        deeds, he passes over injuries from deeds and lists those from words.
        Here too he proceeds in reverse order, beginning from the last; and this
        is when a person explicitly says something evil of another. If this is
        in public, he is a detractor; hence he says, slander [detraction]:
        “Slanderers, haters of God” (Rom. 1:30). If it is in secret, he is a
        whisperer; hence he says, gossip [whisperings]. For whisperers are
        persons who discreetly sow discord: “The whisperer and the double tongue
        is accursed” (Sir. 28:5, Vulgate). These two proceed from evil words
        against others; therefore he says, conceit [swelling]. These swellings
        arise from seditions, which are the preparations made by the parties to
        a fight, because they are always quarrels among the proud; hence he
        says, disorder, i.e., uproars for fights: “An evil man always seek
        quarrels” (Prov. 17:11, Vulgate). Thus their wickedness is made clear in
        regard to present evils, which are many both in dissensions and in
        injuries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        514. – Then he manifests their wickedness in regard to past evils for
        which they have not repented, when he says: I fear that when I come
        again my God may humble me, i.e., afflict me, before you and I may have
        to mourn over many of those who sinned before, i.e., before the first
        epistle. And rightly do I mourn, because just as the glory of the father
        is in the glory of his children, so the father’s shame is the shame of
        the children. Thus did Samuel mourn over Saul: “How long will you grieve
        over Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel?” (1
        Sam. 16:1). And this because they have not repented or done penance for
        their past carnal sins, some of which are contrary to nature; hence he
        says, and have not repented of the impurity, i.e., lust contrary to
        nature. Some are committed with women no longer virgins, namely, widows
        or married women; hence he says, immorality [fornication]; others are
        committed by deflowering virgins; hence he says, and licentiousness
        which they have practiced continually: “Now the works of the flesh are
        plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness” (Gal. 5:19).

        sustained by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 2 I warned those
        who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent,
        as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will
        not spare them— 3 since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me.
        He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you. 4 For he was
        crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we are weak in
        him, but in dealing with you we shall live with him by the power of God.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        515. – Having said many things to the disadvantage of the false
        apostles, the Apostle now speaks against those who have been misled by
        them. In regard to this he does two things. First, he rebukes those who
        have been misled; secondly, he congratulates those who remained faithful
        (v. 11). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
        threatens a severe sentence; secondly, he discloses his judiciary power
        (v. 3); thirdly, he warns them to amend themselves (v. 5). In regard to
        the first he does three things. First, he promises his presence;
        secondly, he indicates the form of his judgment (v. 1b); thirdly, he
        threatens a severe sentence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        516. – Therefore, he first promises to come, saying, behold I am coming
        to you. As if to say: be assured that I am coming to you, so take care
        that I do not find you unprepared. He says: This is the third time, not
        that he had come a third time, but because he was prepared a third time
        to come; for he actually came only once so far, although he was ready to
        come the second time but was prevented: “But I will come to you soon, if
        the Lord wills” (1 Cor. 4:19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        517. – I will come, I say, and judge the wicked; in an orderly fashion,
        however, that by the evidence of two or three witnesses accusing or
        bearing witness against anyone, any charge of the accusers must be
        sustained. This is based on Deut. (17:6): “A person shall not be put to
        death on the evidence of one witness,” and Deut. (19:15): “A single
        witness shall not prevail against a man.” Or another way: in the mouth
        of two or three witnesses shall every word stand. As if to say: that
        which I say about my coming to you is as certain as the testimony of two
        or three. Thus there will be an order in the judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        518. – But he threatens a severe sentence, saying: I warned those who
        sinned before and all the others. Here he first suggests the judicial
        process to be followed, which requires that three warnings have been
        given. In regard to this he says: I have warned you before twice, as I
        warned them when present, namely, when I was among you, so I warn them
        now, that is, while absent. Thus he warns them three times. I warn, I
        say, those who sinned before and all the others. As if to say: I warn
        everyone. Secondly, having given the warning, he threatens the sentence;
        hence, he says, that if I come again I will not spare them. As if to
        say: those who sinned I spared the first time; but if they sin again, or
        have not done penance, I will not spare them again. This would be just,
        because a person who is forgiven once and sins again, if he were
        forgiven, would grow in malice and become insolent. Hence the wise man
        says in Prov. (13:24): “He that spares the rod hates his son.” As a
        result the Church has decreed that three admonitions must be given
        before it declares one excommunicated, because it happens that some,
        although they are in sin and offend, are corrected by a mere word of
        warning and make satisfaction. But if they are not influenced by
        warnings, the severity of sentence must be applied, lest they grow more
        insolent: “Because sentence against an evil deed is not executed
        speedily, the heart of the sons of men is fully set to do evil” (Ec.
        8:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        519. – Then, lest they belittle the Apostle’s power, he discloses his
        judicial power, saying: Do you desire proof that Christ is speaking in
        me? Here he does three things. First, he shows that he has delegation
        and power to judge from Christ; secondly, he shows Christ’s power (v.
        3b); thirdly, he shows that Christ’s power is distributed to others
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        520. – He says therefore: if I come, I shall not spare; rather, I shall
        judge most severely. And I can do this, because I have Christ’s
        authority to punish and forgive: “What I have forgiven, if I have
        forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ” (2
        Cor. 2:8); “So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal
        through us” (2 Cor. 5:20). Therefore, he says: Do you desire proof that
        Christ is speaking in me? As if to say: have no doubts about my power,
        because whatever I utter either by passing sentence or forgiving or
        preaching, I say from Christ: “Now therefore go, and I will be with your
        mouth” (Ex. 4:12); “For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none
        of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict” (Lk.
        21:15). Therefore, whatever a man says under the inspiration of the Holy
        Spirit, the Holy Spirit is said to do. Therefore, the Apostle, because
        he was moved by Christ to say this, attributed it to Christ as to the
        principal cause, saying, that Christ is speaking in me.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        521. – But lest there be any doubt about Christ’s power and might, and
        Apostle discusses the might of Christ, when he says, He is not weak in
        dealing with you, but is powerful in you. Herein he shows Christ’s power
        as to things which are manifested in them; secondly, as to things which
        are in Christ: For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power
        of God. He says therefore: I have judiciary power from Christ, who
        speaks in me, who is mighty in you by giving the gifts of grace, the
        distribution of the Spirit and many other things you have experienced;
        and not only is he not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you,
        because he has mightily delivered you from sin and turned you to good:
        “The LORD, strong and mighty” (Ps. 24:8); “Your power is at hand when
        you will” (Wis. 12:18, Vulgate); and a little before (v. 17): “For you
        show your strength when men doubt the completeness of your power.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        522. – Not only in you has Christ’s power appeared, but also in himself,
        inasmuch as he rose from the death of the cross, which he endured from
        human weakness, which he assumed in poverty and lives by the power of
        God, which is God: “The weakness of God is stronger than men” (1 Cor.
        1:25). Or by the power of God, namely, of the Father who is also the
        power of Christ, because the power of the Father and of the Son are the
        same: “I died, and behold, I am alive forevermore” (Rev. 1:18). But this
        power of Christ is also distributed to us, for we also are weak in him.
        As if to say: that power pertains to us also, because we are weak in
        him, i.e., as to its aim, inasmuch as we suffer many things and mortify
        ourselves and humiliate ourselves for him: “We are weak for Christ’s
        sake” (1 Cor. 4:10); “His bodily presence is weak” (2 Cor. 10:10);
        “Always carrying in the body the death of Jesus” (2 Cor. 4:10).
        Therefore, we shall live, i.e., shall be alive with him by the power of
        God in you, who are to be judged: “Through Jesus Christ and God the
        Father, who raised him from the dead” (Gal. 1:1). The sense is this: we
        are raised by the power by which Christ lives, and from that power we
        also have the power to judge among you; hence, we shall live with a
        happiness similar to his, and this by the power of God, which power is
        in you, i.e., in your consciences.

        to be ready, so that they will not experience a severe judgment. First,
        he gives the admonition; secondly, he assigns the reason for it (v. 10).
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he presents the
        admonition; secondly, he excludes a false suspicion (v. 7). In regard to
        the first he does two things. First, he advises them to examine
        themselves; secondly, he suggests what they will be able to find through
        such an examination (v. 5b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        524. – In regard to the first it should be noted that one who would
        appear in judgment securely should first examine himself on his deeds;
        in that way he can tell whether he will appear safely. Therefore the
        Apostle warns them that before they come to judgment, which will take
        place when he comes to them, they should examine themselves, saying:
        examine yourselves, i.e., examine and reflect on your acts: “Test
        everything; hold fast what is good” (1 Th. 5:21). He advises them to
        examine themselves on two points, namely, on faith; hence he says: to
        see whether you are holding to your faith, namely, which I have preached
        to you and you have received from me concerning the Lord Jesus Christ,
        or have fallen away and lapsed into another. This is necessary because
        in 1 Cor. (11:31) it says: “But if we judged ourselves truly, we should
        not be judged”; “Look at your way in the valley; know what you have
        done” (Jer. 2:23). Likewise all works, when he says: test yourselves,
        whether you be in good works, or whether your conscience bothers you for
        having done some evil. This is useful, because it says in 1 Cor. (2:28):
        “Let a man examine himself”; and in Gal. (6:4): “Let each one test his
        own work.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        525. – Then when he says, Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in
        you? he shows what they can find through such an examination. First,
        what they might find in themselves; secondly, what they might find in
        the Apostle (v. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        526. – In themselves they will be able to discover two things by this
        examination, because they will either know that they are keeping the
        faith, and thus they will be able to find and know that Christ is in
        them; and this is what he says: Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is
        in you? i.e., if you were to examine yourselves, would you know that you
        have the faith and recognize that Christ is in you? As if to say: Yes,
        because where faith in Christ is, there Christ is: “That Christ may
        dwell in your hearts through faith” (Eph. 3:17); “Do you not know that
        your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from
        God?” (1 Cor. 6:19). Or they will know that they are not keeping the
        faith and will find themselves reprobates; hence he says, unless indeed
        you fail to meet the test! i.e., you will find that you have Christ,
        unless you have lost the faith and are fallen from the state of
        previously having had the faith: “You have rejected me, says the LORD,
        you keep going backward” (Jer. 15:6); “For the wicked are not removed.
        Refuse silver they are called” (Jer. 6:29).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        527. – But here there is a literal question in regard to the statement:
        Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? For Christ only remains
        in those who have charity, as it says in 1 Jn. (4:16): “God is love, and
        he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him” If therefore
        we know that Christ is in us by faith, it is required that this be by
        formed faith. But this is contrary to Ec. (9:1): “Their deeds are in the
        hand of God; whether it is love or hate man does not know.” I answer
        that “Christ dwelling in us” can be taken in two ways, namely, in regard
        to the intellect or in regard to the affections [affectum]. If it is
        taken in regard to the intellect, then he dwells in us by unformed
        faith; and in this way we know there is nothing to prevent our knowing
        with certainty that Christ dwells in us, namely, when we know that we
        hold the faith which the Catholic Church teaches and holds. But if it is
        taken in regard to the affectivity, then Christ dwells in us by formed
        faith; and in this way no one can know that Christ dwells in him, or
        that he has charity, unless this certainty be granted to a person by
        revelation and a special grace. But there is nothing to prevent us from
        having a conjecture [coniecturum] that we are in charity, namely, when a
        person finds himself so ready and disposed that he would not wish to do
        anything against Christ in any way for something temporal: “Beloved, if
        our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God” (1 Jn.
        3:21). It is clear, therefore, that the Apostle is speaking in regard to
        the first way. Or he is even speaking of knowledge which is by a
        conjecture, as has been said. But his argument proceeds as to the second
        way and in regard to knowledge which is certain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        528. – What they might find in the Apostle is mentioned when he says, I
        hope you will find out that we have not failed. For since those
        Corinthians could say, “We are not reprobates, but we do not on that
        account hold to your teachings, because you are not right and should be
        repudiated.” Therefore he says, whatever the case may be with
        yourselves, I hope that from our life and doctrine, which we have
        disclosed to you, you will find out that we have not failed and have not
        taught evil or are excluded from the power we say we have: “A wise man,
        when you meet him, is known by his countenance” (Sir. 19:26, Vulgate);
        “You will know them by their fruits” (Matt. 7:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        529. – Then when he says, But we pray God, he excludes the suspicion.
        For he had threatened them with a severe judgment when he mentioned his
        power to judge, and suggested an examination, trusting that Christ was
        in them, unless they were reprobate. Nevertheless he leaves in doubt the
        question whether Christ be in them. And because they might believe and
        suspect that the Apostle would rejoice in their being reprobates, in
        order to appear greater in comparison to them and to exercise a more
        severe judgment, the Apostle removes this suspicion here: first, with a
        prayer he directs to God on their behalf; secondly, by the joy he
        conceived in their regard (v. 9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        530. – He prays, therefore, that they may be found innocent and not be
        examined with the severity of a judgment; therefore he says, But we
        pray, namely to God, that you may not do wrong. As if to say: do not
        suppose that we desire you to be reprobates, but we pray that you may do
        no evil. He prays also that he may appear weak, thus excluding any
        desire on the part of the Apostle for excellence in comparison to them;
        hence he says, not that we may appear to have met the test, i.e., we do
        not pray that we may be commended as approved in comparison to you, but
        rather that you may do what is right [good]: “And let us not grow weary
        in well-doing” (Gal. 6:9); “Be strong, and let your heart take courage”
        (Ps. 27:14), though we may seem to have failed, by losing the power to
        punish and judge, because where there is no guilt, we are all equal and
        one does not have power over another to judge. Therefore, the Apostle
        rather wishes that they be good than be subject to the power of his
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        531. – That he would lack this power of judging, if they are good, is
        shown when he says: For we cannot do anything against the truth. As if
        to say: we do not labor for anything but the truth, and for it we stand.
        But it is obvious that if we were to punish the innocent, we would be
        standing against the truth and against justice. Hence, since the Apostle
        could not do anything against the truth, but for the truth and for
        justice, it is clear that he will not punish the innocent. It should be
        noted, according to Augustine in a Gloss [Lombard], that two things are
        necessary for avoiding sins, namely, free will and God’s grace. For if
        free will were not needed, neither precepts nor prohibitions nor
        exhortations would ever be given to men; further, punishments would be
        given in vain. But grace, too, is necessary, because unless God ruled
        all by his grace, a man could not stand; furthermore, it would be in
        vain to pray that he not lead us into temptation. Consequently, the
        Apostle, indicating that both are necessary, prays God to obtain grace,
        and advises that they withdraw from evil with their free will, and do
        good; hence he says, we pray, as to the first, that you may not do
        wrong, as to the second.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        532. – Then when he says, For we are glad, he removes the false
        suspicion on account of the joy conceived over their good. First, he
        mentions the joy he conceives over their innocence; secondly, the prayer
        he utters for their perfection (v. 9b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        533. – He says therefore: we pray that you may appear approved, but we
        infirm; and this is clear from our emotion, because we rejoice that some
        among you are good and innocent, thus taking from us the power to judge
        and making us seem weak; and this is what he says: For we are glad when
        we are weak, i.e., not exercising our power, and you are strong, i.e.,
        acting so well and overcoming vices that you take away our power to
        judge. For when a person does evil, he subjects himself to the power of
        a judge; but by acting well, he casts it away from him: “Would you have
        no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will
        receive his approval” (Rom. 13:3); “We are weak, but you are strong” (1
        Cor. 4:10). Concerning that joy, it says in Phil. (2:17): “I am glad and
        rejoice with you all.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        534. – And not only do we rejoice in these things, but besides this what
        we pray for is your improvement. For in natural things we notice that
        each natural thing tends towards its own perfection, for which is had a
        natural desire; hence, to each thing is given the natural power to
        enable it to attain to its perfection. But God gives man grace, by which
        he may attain to his ultimate and perfect consummation, i.e., happiness,
        towards which he has a natural desire. Hence, when a person does not
        tend toward perfection, it is a sign that he does not have a sufficiency
        of God’s grace. Therefore, the Apostle, in order that they might grow in
        grace, prays that they be perfected: “And it is my prayer that your love
        may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment” (Phil.
        1:9); “That you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having
        done all, to stand” (Eph. 6:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        535. – Then, having given the admonition, he assigns the reason for it,
        saying, I write this while I am away from you, in order that when I come
        I may not have to be severe, i.e., I write these things to you in my
        absence to warn you, lest I be forced to do something against my will,
        which is that I may do nothing severe against you, except to the extent
        that I am compelled by you. Hence he says, that when I come among you I
        may not have to be more severe against you than I would wish or than you
        would wish: “For you admonished them and tried them as a father” (Wis.
        11:11, Vulgate); “I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold
        to you when I am away!— I beg of you that when I am present I may not
        have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against
        some” (2 Cor. 10:1). But because the Corinthians might say, “But
        supposing that we have acted well, would you be able to deal severely
        against us?” Therefore he answers, saying: No, because I neither plan
        nor am able to act except in my use of the authority which the Lord has
        given me. But God gave me this power, namely, of binding and loosing,
        for building up and not for tearing down, i.e., that you might be built
        up and not that you be destroyed. And if I were to correct you severely,
        I would not be building up but destroying: “Our authority, which the
        Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you” (2 Cor. 10:8).
        But the Lord gave this power to Paul: “Set apart for me Barnabas and
        Saul for the work to which I have called them” (Ac. 13:2).

        11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Mend your ways, heed my appeal, agree
        with one another, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be
        with you. 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 13 All the saints greet
        you. 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the
        fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        536. – Having rebuked those deceived by false apostles, the Apostle now
        comforts those who have persisted in his faith and doctrine. First, he
        gives an admonition; secondly, he adds a greeting (v. 12). In regard to
        the first he does two things. First, he gives the salutation; secondly,
        the reward of a fulfilled admonition (v. 11d). But he admonishes them on
        three points: first, what they should have been in themselves; secondly,
        in regard to their neighbor (v. 11b); thirdly, how all should act
        towards one another (v. 11c).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        537. – They should have two qualities in themselves. The first is joy in
        the good they had; hence he says: finally brethren, who have been
        constant, farewell [rejoice] in the things you have done for God’s
        service. This is necessary, if you are to be just and virtuous, because
        no one is just or virtuous who does not take joy in just and virtuous
        activities. Therefore it says in Ps. 100 (2, Vulgate): “Sing joyfully to
        God, all the earth: serve the Lord with gladness”; “Rejoice in the Lord
        always; again I will say, Rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). Indeed, a person should
        always rejoice because joy keeps a man in good condition, whereas one
        cannot continue long that which causes sorrow. Secondly, the good should
        have in themselves a zeal for perfection; in regard to this he says,
        mend your ways [be perfect], i.e., always tend to what is perfect:
        “Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to
        maturity [perfectionem]” (Heb. 6:1). What is said here is not a precept
        to be perfect, but always tend toward perfection. And this is necessary
        because a person who does not aim at progressing is in danger of falling
        back. For we notice that unless the rowers strive to go forward, the
        ship always goes backward. This is what the Lord said: “You, therefore,
        must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        538. – To our neighbor we must give exhortations to good; in regard to
        this he says, heed my appeal: “And he gave to every one of them
        commandment concerning his neighbour” (Sir. 17:12, Vulgate); “He who
        exhorts, in his exhortation” (Rom. 12:8); “And let him who hears say
        ‘Come’” (Rev. 22:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        539. – There are two things which should be common to all, namely, that
        they agree: therefore he says, agree with one another; and that they be
        at peace: hence he says, live in peace. These two things are so related
        that one is external and the other internal. For it is clear that bodies
        cannot be preserved and kept orderly unless the members are mutually
        coordinated. In like manner neither the Church nor the members of the
        Church, unless they are in proper order and united one with another. But
        there is a double union required for uniting the members of the Church:
        one is interior, that is, that they agree by faith in regard to the
        intellect by believing the same things, and by love in the will by
        loving the same things. Hence he says, agree with one another, i.e.,
        agree in regard to matters of faith, and love the same things with the
        affection of charity. For true wisdom is present when the activity of
        the intellect is perfected and consummated by the repose and delight
        experienced by the affections: “That together you may with one voice
        glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 15:6); “That
        all of you agree” (1 Cor. 1:10); “Complete my joy by being of the same
        mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind” (Phil.
        2:2). The other is exterior, namely, peace: therefore he says, live in
        peace among yourselves: “Strive for peace with all men” (Heb. 12:14);
        “Seek peace, and pursue it” (Ps. 34:15); “Now may the Lord of peace
        himself give you peace at all times in all ways” (2 Th. 3:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        540. – Then when he says, the God of love and peace will be with you, he
        mentions the reward given to those who fulfil these admonitions. As if
        to say: if you keep peace among you, the God of love and peace will be
        with you. In regard to this it should be noted that among the Gentiles
        was a custom that certain gifts be used as names for the gods, because
        although there is but one God, nevertheless certain special gifts were
        used for naming the gods from those gifts. Thus, from the gift of peace
        they call a god the god of peace, and from the gift of salvation, the
        god of salvation. Alluding to this practice, the Apostle says: the God
        of love and peace will be with you, not that peace is one god, as they
        said, but Christ is called the God of peace because he is the giver of
        peace and is one who loves: “My peace I give to you” (Jn. 14:27); “For
        God is not a God of confusion but of peace” (1 Cor. 14:53); “God’s love
        has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been
        given to us” (Rom. 5:5). He is also the author of peace: “In me you may
        have peace. In the world you have tribulation” (Jn. 16:33); “His abode
        has been established in peace” (Ps. 71:3, Vulgate). Furthermore, he is
        not only the God of peace, but also of love; hence, he says: the God of
        love and peace will be with you. This is so, because a person who exists
        in true peace of heart and body exists in charity, and “He who abides in
        love abides in God, and God abides in him” (1 Jn. 4:16); and because a
        person merits only through peace and love” “If a man loves me, he will
        keep my word, and my Father will love him” (Jn. 14:23).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        541. – Then when he says, Greet one another with a holy kiss, he gives
        the salutation. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
        enjoins on them a mutual greeting; secondly, he greets them on the part
        of others (v. 12b); thirdly, he greets them on his own part (v. 13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        542. – He requests that the mutual greeting be made with a kiss; hence
        he says: Greet one another with a holy kiss. Here it should be noted
        that a kiss is a sign of peace. For a man breathes through the mouth
        with which a kiss is given. Therefore, when men give one another kisses,
        it is a sign that they are uniting their spirit of peace. But there is a
        false peace, and this is done by those who “speak peace with their
        neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts” (Ps. 28:3), which is
        accomplished with the deceit of a kiss: “Better are the wounds of a
        friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy” (Prov. 27:6, Vulgate).
        There is also an evil and degrading peace, namely, when men come
        together to commit evil: “Afterward it was not enough for them to err
        about the knowledge of God, but they live in great strife due to
        ignorance, and they call such great evils peace” (Wis. 14:22). And this
        is sealed with a lustful kiss. In Prov. (7:13, Vulgate) it is said of an
        evil woman that “Catching the young man, she kisses him, and with an
        impudent face, flatters him.” There is also a holy peace which God
        produces: “And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will
        keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:7), and this
        is obtained by a holy kiss, because it unites the spirit with holiness.
        It is of this kiss that he says here: with a holy kiss. From this there
        arose the practice whereby believers and holy men kiss one another as a
        sign of charity and union

        543. – He greets them on the part of the others when he says, all the
        saints greet you, because all the saints and faithful hope and desire
        and procure our salvation with their prayers. Hence, all of Christ’s
        faithful hope and desire salvation for one another: “Make me a partaker,
        O God” (Ps. 119, Aquinas Latin).

        544. – He greets them on his own part, when he says: The grace of the
        Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy
        Spirit be with you all. Here it should be noted that there are two modes
        of appropriating something to the divine persons: one is essentially
        [essentialiter] and the other causally [causaliter]. Essentially power
        [potentia] is appropriated to the Father because he is power
        essentially; inasmuch as he is the principle. To the Son, wisdom,
        inasmuch as he is the Word. To the Holy Spirit, love, inasmuch as he is
        goodness. But here the Apostle does not appropriate those things in this
        way, namely, by essence [per essentiam], because then all things would
        be appropriated to the Holy Spirit; rather, he appropriates by cause
        [per causam]. Therefore, since grace is a gift by which sins are
        forgiven: “Justified by his grace as a gift” (Rom. 3:24), and the
        remission of sin is accomplished in us by the Son who took our flesh and
        satisfied for our sins: “Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (Jn.
        1:17): for this reason the Apostle attributes grace to Christ, when he
        says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. But charity is necessary for
        us because we must become united to God: “He who abides in love abides
        in God, and God abides in him” (1 Jn. 4:16). And because this is from
        God the Father, inasmuch as he so loved the world as to send his only
        begotten Son (Jn. 3:16): “God shows his love for us” (Rom. 5:8), he
        attributes charity to him as to its source, when he says, and the love
        of God, namely, the Father. Finally, the communication of divine gifts
        is accomplished by the Holy Spirit: “All these are inspired by one and
        the same Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:11). Therefore he attributes communication
        to the Holy Spirit, when he says, and the fellowship [participation] of
        the Holy Spirit. Or, he attributes this to him because he is common to
        the other two persons.

        545. – Thus therefore the Apostle in his greeting wishes them all things
        that are necessary when he says: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and
        the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
        The grace of Christ, by which we are made just and are saved; the
        charity of God the Father, by which we are united to him; and the
        fellowship of the Holy Spirit distributing divine gifts to us. Amen.
