<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#8220;Men shall speak of you as ministers of our God&#8221; (Is. 61:6). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. &#8211; The subject matter of this second epistle to the Corinthians is fittingly touched upon by these
words. For in the first epistle the Apostle discussed the sacraments; in this one he discusses the
ministers, both good and bad, of these sacraments.  The reason he wrote this epistle was that he
had preached to the Corinthians, but they had welcomed certain false apostles, whom they
preferred to the Apostle. Therefore he writes them this epistle, in which he commends the
apostles and the dignity of the true apostles, and discloses and reproves the falseness of the false
apostles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. &#8211; He commends the dignity of the true apostles, because they are God&#8217;s ministers. Men shall
speak of you, i.e., the apostles, as the ministers of God. They are called ministers under three
aspects.  First, inasmuch as they dispense the sacraments: &#8220;This is how one should regard us, as
servants of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1). For Christ instituted the sacraments, but the apostles and their
successors dispense them; therefore the text just cited continues: and stewards of the mysteries
of God.  Secondly, inasmuch as they govern the people of God: &#8220;Because, as servants of his
kingdom, you did not rule rightly, nor keep the law&#8221; (Wis. 6:4). For God governs all things by
his wisdom, so that whoever governs any one is called God&#8217;s minister.  Thirdly, because they
labor for the salvation of men, namely, inasmuch as many are converted by their ministry and
preaching. But God alone is the author of man&#8217;s salvation, because it was he who came to save
that which had been lost; the apostles, however, are his ministers: &#8220;What then is Apollos? What
is Paul? The ministers of him whom you have believed&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:5).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="11"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 1:1-2</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother. To
the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of
Achaia: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. &#8211; In this epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle treats of these ministers and points out their
dignity: first, he gives his greeting; secondly, he begins his message (v. 3). In the greeting he does
three things: first, he mentions the persons who send the greeting; secondly, those who are
greeted; thirdly, the good things he wishes them. In regard to the first he does two things: first,
he mentions the principal person who sends the greeting, namely Paul; secondly, his companion,
Timothy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. &#8211; The person who sends the greeting is described by his humility, because it is Paul, which in
Latin means &#8216;humble&#8217;. He is that humble person of whom it is said in Is. (60:22): &#8220;The least one
shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation.&#8221;  Or by his doctrine, because Paul is
called the mouth of the trumpet. This is the trumpet mentioned in Zechariah (9:14): &#8220;The Lord
God will sound the trumpet, and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.&#8221; He fits what is said
in Isaiah (58:1): &#8220;Lift up your voice like a trumpet.&#8221;  By the authority of his dignity, because he
says, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Here he mentions three things: first, that he is a representative;
hence, he is called an apostle, i.e., principally sent, for only twelve apostles were sent by Christ:
&#8220;He chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles&#8221; (Lk. 6:13). But the other disciples were
not sent principally, but secondarily. That is why the apostles are succeeded by bishops, who
have a special care of the Lord&#8217;s flock; but other priests succeed the seventy-two disciples and
perform duties committed to them by the bishops. His dignity, therefore, is that he is an apostle:
&#8220;If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:2); &#8220;He who worked through
Peter for the ministry to the circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles&#8221; (Gal. 2:8).
But why does he call himself an apostle, whereas in the epistle to the Romans he calls himself
a servant. The reason for this is that he rebuked the Romans for quarreling and for pride, which
is the mother of quarrels, because there are always disputes among the proud. Hence to cure them
of quarreling he leads them to humility by calling himself a servant. But the Corinthians were
obstinate and rebellious; so in order to curb their boldness, he uses a dignified name here, calling
himself an apostle.  Secondly, he mentions the one he represents, Jesus Christ: &#8220;We are
ambassadors for Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:20).  Thirdly, he mentions how he obtained his
ambassadorship, because he is not coming as a false apostle: &#8220;I did not send them and they ran&#8221;
(Jer. 23:21), nor was he given to the people in God&#8217;s anger in the sense of Job (34:30): &#8220;Who
makes a hypocrite to reign&#8221;; &#8220;I have given you kings, but in my anger&#8221; (Hos. 13:11). But he
obtained apostleship by God&#8217;s will and pleasure: &#8220;He is a chosen instrument of mine&#8221; (Ac. 9:15).
Therefore he says, by the will of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. &#8211; The other person is Timothy; hence he says, and Timothy our brother. A brother, I say,
because of the faith: &#8220;You are all brothers&#8221; (Matt. 23:8), and because of his dignity, for he was
a bishop. This is why the Pope calls all bishops brothers. He mentions Timothy because, since
he [Timothy] had visited them, as he said in the first epistle (ch. 16), the people might believe
that he had maliciously reported to the Apostle the things he is writing to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. &#8211; Then he mentions the persons greeted: first, the principal ones; secondly, those associated
with the principal ones. He says, to the church of God, which includes all believers, both the
clergy and the laity: &#8220;That you may know how one ought to behave&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:15); which is at
Corinth, because Corinth was the chief city of Achaia. But those associated with the principal
ones are all the saints who are reborn by the grace of the one Holy Spirit: &#8220;But you were washed,
you were sanctified, in the Spirit of our God&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:11); who are in Achaia, whose chief city
is Corinth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. &#8211; The Apostle wishes good things to the persons greeted; hence, he says, grace and peace to
you. In regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions the good things; secondly, their
author (v. 2b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. &#8211; He mentions these two gifts as two extremes, between which are contained all other goods.
For the first good is grace, which is the beginning of all good things; because before grace there
is only a diminished goodness in us. The last of all goods is peace, because peace is the general
end of the mind; for no matter how peace is defined, it has the character of an end. In eternal
glory, in government and in the way one lives, the end is peace: &#8220;He makes peace in your
borders&#8221; (Ps. 147:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. &#8211; He indicates the author of these goods when he says, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. These two expressions can be distinguished in two ways, because, when he says, from
God our Father, it can be referred to the entire Trinity.  For although the person of the Father is
called the Father of Christ by nature, the entire Trinity in our Father by creation and governance:
&#8220;For thou art our Father&#8221; (Is. 63:16); &#8220;You would call me My Father&#8221; (Jer. 3:19). Therefore good
things come from God our Father, i.e., from the entire Trinity: &#8220;If you, then, who are evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give
good things to those who ask him&#8221; (Matt. 7:11).  But if God our Father is taken for the entire
Trinity, why is the person of the Son added, when he says, and the Lord Jesus Christ? Is there
another person in the Trinity? I answer that he is added, not as though he were an additional
person, but on account of another nature, namely, of the humanity assumed by the Son to the
divine person. The reason he lists him along with the Trinity is that all good things come to us
from the Trinity through the Incarnation of Christ, first of all grace: &#8220;Grace and truth came
through Jesus Christ&#8221; (Jn. 1:17), and secondly peace: &#8220;He is our peace&#8221; (Eph. 2:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">10. &#8211; Again, when he says, from God our Father, it can be taken to mean the person of the Father
alone; and although the entire Trinity is our Father, as has been said, the person of the Father is
our Father by appropriation. Then the Lord Jesus Christ can be referred to the person of the Son.
No mention is made of the Holy Spirit because, as Augustine says, since he is the nexus of the
Father and the Son, whenever the person of the Father and the person of the Son are mentioned,
the person of the Holy Spirit is also understood. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="12"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 1:3-5</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies
and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be
able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we
ourselves are comforted by God. 5 For as we share abundantly in Christ&#8217;s
sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11. &#8211; Here begins the message, in which the Apostle does two things: first, he excuses himself
for not visiting them as he had promised; secondly, he begins to follow out his intention (chap.
3). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he wins their good will; secondly, he presents
his excuse (v. 15). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he wins their good will be citing
some general facts; secondly, some special ones (v. 8). The Apostle wins their good will by
showing that whatever he does, it is all for their benefit. In regard to this he does two things: first,
he mentions the profit others have obtained from him; secondly, the reason (v. 5). In regard to
the first he does three things: first, he gives thanks; secondly, the manner of the thanks (v. 4);
thirdly, the cause (b. 4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12. &#8211; He gives thanks, therefore, to the entire Trinity, the source of every good; hence he says,
Blessed be the God, i.e., the entire Trinity; and to the person of the Father when he says, and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the Father has given us all things.  It should be
noted that we bless God and God blesses us, but in different ways. For when God speaks, he
accomplishes: &#8220;He spoke and they were made&#8221; (Ps. 148:5). Hence, for God to bless is to produce
something good, and to infuse something good, and so to be a cause: &#8220;I will indeed bless you and
multiply your descendants&#8221; (Gen. 22:17). But our speech does not cause things, but
acknowledges or expresses them; hence, our blessing is the same as recognizing good. Therefore,
when we thank God, we bless him, i.e., acknowledge that he is good and the giver of all good:
&#8220;Bless God and acknowledge him in the presence of all the living for the good things he has done
for you.&#8221; (Tob. 12:6); &#8220;Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord; praise and exalt him above all
for ever&#8221; (Dan. 3:57).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">13. &#8211; It is fitting that he thank the Father, because he is merciful; hence he says, the Father of
mercies: and because he is a comforter he says, and God of all comfort. He thanks God for the
two things men especially need: first, to have evil removed from them, and this is done by mercy
which takes away misery, for it is characteristic of a father to have compassion: &#8220;As a father
pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear him&#8221; (Ps. 103: 13). Secondly, they need to
be supported in the face of evils which occur, and that is to receive comfort. Because unless a
man had something in which his heart could rest, he would not stand firm when evils come upon
him. Therefore a person comforts another by affording him something refreshing, in which he
can rest in evil times. And although a man might be comforted by something and find rest and
be supported by it in the case of some evils, it is God alone who comforts us in all evils; hence
he says, the God of all comfort. For if you sin, God comforts you, because he is merciful; if you
are afflicted, he comforts you either by rooting out the affliction by his power or by judging
justly; if you labor, he comforts you with a reward: &#8220;I am your shield; your reward shall be very
great (Gen. 15:1). Therefore, it says in Matthew (5:4): &#8220;Blessed are those who mourn, for they
shall be comforted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">14. &#8211; He tells us why he is thankful when he adds, who comforts us in all our affliction. As if to
say: He is blessed, because he comforts us in all our affliction: &#8220;God who comforts the downcast&#8221;
(2 Cor. 7:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">15. &#8211; He gives the reason for this when he says, so that we may be able to comfort those who are
in any affliction. Here it should be noted that there is an order among God&#8217;s gifts. For God gives
special gifts to some, that they may pour them out for the benefit of others; for he does not give
light to the sun in order that the sun may shine for itself alone, but for the whole world. Hence,
God desires that some profit accrue to others from all our gifts, whether they be riches or power
of knowledge or wisdom: &#8220;As each has received a gift, employ it for one another&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:10).
This then is what the Apostle says, who comforts us in all our affliction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16. &#8211; But why? Not only for our benefit, but that it profit others too. Hence, he says, so that we
may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction. For we can comfort others by the example
of our own comfort. For one who is not comforted does not know how to comfort others: &#8220;He
who has not been tried, what manner of things does he know&#8221; (Sir. 34:9, Vulgate) about any
affliction; &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me to bring good tidings to the afflicted&#8221; (Is.
61:1); &#8220;He who comforts all who were mourning in Zion&#8221; (Sir. 48:27, Vulgate). We are able, I
say, to comfort them by exhorting them to endure sufferings by promising eternal rewards, i.e.,
because we exhort you by the Scriptures and internal inspirations, in order that we may patiently
endure and exhort others by our example and by the Scriptures themselves: &#8220;For I received from
the Lord what I also delivered to you&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:23); &#8220;What I have heard from the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you&#8221; (Is. 21:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">17. &#8211; Having mentioned the profit which comes to others from the apostles, he gives the reason
for what he has said: For as we share abundantly in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, so through Christ we
share abundantly in comfort too. And because he has said two things, namely, that God comforts
us in every affliction and that we ourselves can also comfort others, he explains here the reason
for these two things: first, he shows how God comforts us in every affliction; secondly, how our
comfort is turned to the comfort of others (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">18. &#8211; He says, therefore, I am right in saying that he comforts us in every affliction, for as we
share abundantly in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
He says, in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, i.e., begun by Christ: &#8220;Begin at my sanctuary&#8221; (Ez. 9:6). For the
sufferings for our sins began in Christ, because &#8216;he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree&#8221;
(1 Pet. 2:24); then by the apostles, who said: &#8220;We are slain all the day long&#8221; (Ps. 44:22; Rom.
8:36); then by the martyrs, who were cut in two and were tempted (Heb. 11:37). Finally, sinners
themselves will bear patiently God&#8217;s anger for their sins.  Or the sufferings of Christ, i.e., what
we endure for Christ: &#8220;Then they left the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they were
counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name&#8221; (Ac. 5:41); &#8220;For your sake we are slain all the
day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#8221; (Ps. 44:22). Just as we share abundantly in
these sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too: &#8220;When the cares of my
heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul&#8221; (Ps. 94:19).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="13"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 1:6-11</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted,
it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same
sufferings that we suffer. 7 Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as
you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort. 8 For we do not
want you to be ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we experienced in Asia; for we
were so utterly, unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself. 9 Why, we felt
that we had received the sentence of death; but that was to make us rely not on
ourselves but on God who raises the dead; 10 he delivered us from so deadly a
peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us
again. 11 You also must help us by prayer, so that many [faces] will give thanks
on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">19. &#8211; After showing that the Lord comforts his servants in their tribulations, i.e., the ministers
of the faith and preachers, the Apostle now shows that their comfort redounds to the good of
others: first, he shows that their comfort results in the advantage and salvation of others;
secondly, he shows the relation of this comfort to salvation (v. 6b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">20. &#8211; In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle says that he received three things:
afflictions, when he says, &#8220;In all our afflictions&#8221;; comfort, when he says, &#8220;who comforts us&#8221;;
exhortation, when he says, &#8220;so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction&#8221;.
By taking these three things in a passive sense, we say that the apostles are afflicted, comforted
and exhorted. Hence, the Apostle also shows that three things result in the comfort of others, and
these in a definite order. First, their affliction, when he says, If we are afflicted it is for your
comfort and salvation, because by our example God is telling you to endure suffering, from
which eternal salvation will come to you. Hence in 1 Maccabees (6:34) we read that &#8220;they
showed the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them for battle&#8221;. This is done
when the lukewarm and lazy are shown the sufferings of the saints as an example. Secondly, he
shows that their comfort turns out to the advantage of others, when he says, and if we are
comforted, it is for your comfort: as if to say, the very comfort by which we are comforted by the
hope of a reward is a comfort to you, for by our example you also rejoice in having the same
hope of a reward. Thirdly he shows that the exhortation they receive turns out to the benefit of
others, saying, if we are exhorted by an internal inspiration or by scourges, it is for your
exhortation, i.e., that you be inspired to greater things and hope for salvation. Hence it says in 2
Maccabees (15:17) that, &#8220;exhorted by the word of Judas, they determined to attack bravely.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">21. &#8211; He suggests the relationship between this comfort and salvation when he says, which you
experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. In regard to this he does
two things: first, he shows the patience to be had in adversity; secondly, the fruit which results
from patience (v. 7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">22. &#8211; He says, therefore, I say that these things work for your salvation, inasmuch as by our
example you are strong enough to endure sufferings and patiently endure the trials which we also
suffer: &#8220;By your endurance you will gain your lives&#8221; (Lk. 21:19); &#8220;As an example of suffering
and patience, brethren, take the prophets&#8221; (Jas. 5:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">23. &#8211; You obtain fruit from this patience because from it our hope for you is unshaken by the fact
that you are made heirs of eternal life: &#8220;Suffering produces endurance, and endurance true hope&#8221;
(Rom. 5:3-4): &#8220;Hope in God becomes firmer to the extent that one suffers more difficult things
for his name. For as a result of the sufferings the saints endure for Christ, the hope of eternal life
rises in them&#8221; (Gregory). And the cause of this hope is knowing that as you share in our
sufferings, you will also share in our comfort, i.e., in eternal life: &#8220;The saying is sure: If we have
died with him, we shall also live with him; if we endure, we shall also reign with him&#8221; (2 Tim.
2:11-12); &#8220;But rejoice in so far as you share Christ&#8217;s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be
glad when his glory is revealed&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">24. &#8211; Then when he says, For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we
experienced in Asia, he wins their good will by mentioning certain specific things. And he does
three things: first, he describes the persecution he suffered in Asia; secondly, the special comfort
he received (v. 10); thirdly, the cause of the comfort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">25. &#8211; He says first, therefore: it is good for you to know not only what we have said about our
afflictions in general, but we do not want you to be ignorant, because it is profitable for you to
know them, inasmuch as you are more patient because of our example: we do not want you to
be ignorant, brethren, of the affliction we experienced; &#8220;Remember my affliction and my
bitterness, the wormwood and the gall&#8221; (Lam. 3:19).  This is the persecution mentioned in Acts
(19:23ff), which was launched by a certain Asian silversmith, who incited the people against him.
The Apostle describes it from three aspects: from the place, because it was in Asia; hence he
says, in Asia, i.e., Ephesus, which is in Asia, where he should rather have been honored and
comforted; from its bitterness, because it was an extreme suffering; hence he says, for we were
so utterly crushed. Also it was beyond his strength, and so he says, unbearably.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">26. &#8211; But this seems to be contrary to what it says in 1 Corinthians (10:13): &#8220;God is faithful, and
he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength.&#8221;  I answer that to suffer beyond one&#8217;s
strength can be understood in two ways: first, above one&#8217;s natural strength, which the Apostle
means here, above which God sometimes permits his servants to be tempted; secondly, above
the strength of grace, which the Apostle means in 1 Corinthians (10:13): &#8220;God is faithful.&#8221; That
the Apostle is speaking of natural strength is indicated by what he says next, we despaired of life
itself. For it is evident that among all else, life is most desirable. Therefore when a persecution
is so great that life itself becomes wearisome, it is obviously above the strength of our nature.
And this is what he says, we despaired of life itself, as if to say, this persecution was so cruel that
life itself became a burden to us: &#8220;I loathe my life&#8221; (Jb. 10:1). But against this James (1:2) says:
&#8220;Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials.&#8221; I answer that affliction can be
considered in two ways: either in itself, and then it is wearisome, or in relation to faith, and then
it is joyful, inasmuch as it is endured for God and with the hope of eternal life. We were not only
weary of life, but we were certain of death; hence, he says, we felt that we had received the
sentence of death, i.e., the certainty of death. As if to say: in my opinion I was about to die. Or
another way, the sentence of death, i.e., reason itself would say to choose death because of the
weariness of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">27. &#8211; He amplifies the reason for his affliction when he says, but that was to make us rely not on
ourselves, i.e., that human pride should be repressed: &#8220;O Lord, my strength and my stronghold&#8221;
(Jer. 16:19), and that we trust God in all things: &#8220;Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,
whose trust is the Lord&#8221; (Jer. 17:7). And therefore he says, but on God who raises the dead: &#8220;The
Lord kills and brings to life&#8221; (1 Sam. 2:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">28. &#8211; But because the Lord does not abandon those who trust in him, the Apostle mentions the
comfort he received from the Lord, saying, he delivered us from so deadly a peril. In regard to
this he does three things: first, he describes his present comfort against past evils; secondly, the
comfort to come; thirdly, the cause of love.  He says, therefore: We have been comforted by God,
who delivered us in the past from so deadly a peril, and is delivering us in the present, because
he does not stop delivering: &#8220;When you pass through the waters I will be with you&#8221; (Is. 43:2);
on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again, adding in the future: &#8220;You who fear
the Lord, hope for good things&#8221; (Sir. 2:9).  Your prayers give us cause for this hope; hence he
says, you also must help us by prayer, which you make for us: &#8220;A brother helped is like a strong
city&#8221; (Prov. 18:19); &#8220;I appeal to you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the
Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf&#8221; (Rom. 15:30).  These
prayers are necessary, because God gives many gifts to one person due to the prayers of many.
The reason is that God wishes to be thanked for the gifts he gives, and as a result many are bound
to give thanks. This happens when, as a result of giving to one person because of the prayers of
many, he puts all those at whose prayers he gave some good under an obligation to him.
Consequently, not only the one who received the benefit, but those who prayed should give
thanks to God. And this is what he says, so that many will give thanks. And he says, from many
faces, either as to age or condition or the diversity of nations or customs. On our behalf for the
blessing, i.e., for the gift of faith which we have, granted us in answer to many prayers: &#8220;Always
and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father&#8221; (Eph.
5:20).  Or another way: &#8220;from the faces of many persons&#8221;, i.e., the condition of persons. I say,
&#8220;For the blessing granted to us&#8221;, i.e., because they have the same gift, namely of faith or of
charity; i.e., by means of the many persons who are in the faith of Christ, &#8220;thanks may be given
on our behalf.&#8221; Therefore, according to this explanation, by the many faces are understood the
various virtues, so that the predominant virtue in a person is called his face; thus, patience is the
face of Job, humility the face of David, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="14"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">1-4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2 Cor. 1:12-14</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12 For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience that we have behaved in
the world, and still more toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity, not by
earthly wisdom but by the grace of God. 13 For we write you nothing but what
you can read and understand; I hope you will understand fully, 14 as you have
understood in part, that you can be proud of us as we can be of you, on the day of
the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">29. &#8211; After speaking of the comfort he had received from God following his persecution, the
Apostle assigns the cause of this comfort, which is hope in God&#8217;s help. In regard to this he does
two things: first, he states the cause of hope; secondly, he supports this with the testimony of
those to whom he is writing (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">30. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that we still hope to be rescued by God to be comforted, For our
boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, as if to say: the cause of this hope is our good
conscience, for hope is an expectation of things to come and arises from grace and merits. Hence,
in regard to this he also does three things: first, he shows the boast which he has in the testimony
of a pure conscience; secondly, he suggests the cause of this boasting (v. 12b); thirdly, he
discloses the source of this cause (v. 12c).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">31. &#8211; He says, therefore: The reason I hope and trust in God is because our boast is this, the
testimony of our conscience, i.e., I glory in the testimony and purity of our conscience: &#8220;If our
hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:21): &#8220;The Spirit himself
bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:16).  It should be noted that
the testimony of conscience is true, because it does not deceive; for many appear good outwardly
who are not good in their conscience; and conscience always endures. He does not say, &#8220;the
conscience of others,&#8221; but our conscience, because a man should put more trust in the testimony
of his own conscience about himself than in the testimony of others; they do not do this who
consider themselves good because others are evil rather than because they themselves are truly
good. Nor is it done by those who boast in the goodness of a good person, who is joined to them
by some bond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">32. &#8211; He suggests the cause of this boast when he says, in simplicity of heart, which consists of
two things. For purity of conscience consists of two things, namely, that the things a person does
are good and that his intention is right. These two things the Apostle says of himself. First, that
he has a right intention towards God in his action; hence he says, in simplicity of heart, i.e., with
a right intention: &#8220;Seek him with sincerity of heart&#8221; (Wis. 1:1); &#8220;The integrity of the upright
guides them&#8221; (Prov. 11:3). Secondly, that the things he does are good; hence, he says, and godly
sincerity in his actions: &#8220;That you may be pure and blameless&#8221; (Phil. 1:10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">33. &#8211; He discloses the source of the cause of this glory when he says, not by earthly wisdom. This
can be taken in two ways. First, as referring to what he had just said, namely, godly sincerity, and
then he is suggesting the source of his sincerity and simplicity; as if to say: many of the ancients
were wise in earthly wisdom, as the philosophers, and many Jews lived honorably, trusting in the
justice of the Law, but we have behaved in the world, not by earthly wisdom, which is according
to the nature of things, nor by the desires of the flesh, but by the grace of God: &#8220;To set the mind
on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace&#8221; (Rom. 8:6); &#8220;not in
plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:4); &#8220;By
the grace of God I am what I am&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10).  Or even according to this manner, not by
earthly wisdom, i.e., as though relying on human wisdom, but by the grace of God: &#8220;Do not rely
on your own insight&#8221; (Prov. 3:5)  Or it might be explained in another way, so that in saying, in
simplicity of heart and godly sincerity, he is referring to his purity of life; but in saying, not by
earthly wisdom, but by the grace of God, he is referring to the truth of his teaching; as if to say:
Just as our life is in the simplicity and sincerity of God, so our teaching is not in earthly wisdom,
but in the grace of God. But the first two interpretations are more valid.  And although we have
behaved thus in the world, yet still more toward you, because he had received collections from
the other churches, but not from them: &#8220;I robbed other churches&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:8). The reason for
this might be that they were greedy; hence, in order not to sadden them, he refused to take any
revenue from them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">34. &#8211; Then he calls on them to witness to this holy manner of life, saying, For we write you
nothing but what you can read and understand. As if to say: these things I write to you are not
unknown to you, because you have already read them in the first letter, and you know them by
experience: &#8220;I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment&#8221; (1 Jn. 2:7).
And although you do not know fully, because you have received false apostles, I hope you will
to the end, namely, of your life, understand, namely, perfectly, as you have understood in part.
The reason for this is that when we see someone starting well, we should hope that he will always
progress well. And why? Because &#8220;he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion
at the day of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:6) And you will understand, that you can be proud of us, i.e.,
that through us you should obtain eternal glory, which a person reaches through the faith of
Christ, which we preach to you: &#8220;The glory of sons is their fathers&#8221; (Prov. 17:6).  I say that you
can be proud of us as we can be of you, because we hope for the reward of eternal glory through
you who have been instructed by us: &#8220;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Is it not
you?&#8221; (1 Th. 2:19).  And this boast will be ours from you on the day of the Lord Jesus, i.e., on
the day of judgment, which is called Christ&#8217;s day, because he will then accomplish his will with
sinners by punishing those who in this world did their own will by sinning against the will of
Christ the Lord: &#8220;At the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity&#8221; (Ps. 75:2); &#8220;And books
were opened . . . and the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had
done&#8221; (Rev. 20:12).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">15 Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might
have a double pleasure; 16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to
come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.
17 Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans like a worldly
man, ready to say Yes and No at once? 18As surely as God is faithful, our word
to you has not been Yes and No. 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we
preached among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No; but in
him it is always Yes. 20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That
is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of God. 21 But it is God who
establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us; 22 he has put his seal upon
us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee. 23 But I call God to
witness against me&#8212;it was to spare you that I refrained from coming to Corinth.
24 Not that we lord it over your faith; we work with you for your joy, for you
stand firm in your faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">35. &#8211; After winning the good will of the Corinthians, the Apostle adds his excuse. In regard to
this he does three things: first, he mentions what he intends; secondly, in the form of a question
he answers an accusation they made against him (v. 17); thirdly, he excuses himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">36. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that in a previous epistle (which we do not have),
which the Apostle has sent to the Corinthians by a messenger, he had promised them that he
would visit them before going to Macedonia, and that he would return again to Achaia, where
Corinth is, and from Achaia to Judea. Then in a second epistle, which we call the first, he wrote
them that he would first go to Macedonia and later to Corinth. Therefore, because this seemed
contrary to the first promise, the Apostle now excuses himself for this by first mentioning the
promise he originally made; hence, he says, Because I was sure of this. As if to say: you know
my honesty and sincerity and you are my witnesses and my glory; therefore, because I was sure
of this, i.e., relying on this, because we hope to be glorified by you, I wanted to come to you first,
so that you might have a double pleasure, because a second visit and strengthening of the faith
is called a second grace in relation to the time they were first converted by his ministry and his
teaching. I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from
Macedonia, and have you send me on my way to Judea. This is the sequence of the first promise,
but in the preceding epistle this is a contrary sequence, as has been said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">37. &#8211; Then he puts the accusation for this change, for which the Corinthians accused him, in the
form of a question, saying, Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? For on account of this
they charged him with two things: light-mindedness, because he changed his mind: &#8220;The fool
changes like the moon&#8221; (Sir. 27:11); and carnal love, because it seemed to them that he had done
this from some carnal and human affection. Hence, he touches on two points: first,
light-mindedness, and he says, Was I vacillating, if I failed to do what I once wanted to do? God
forbid! &#8220;Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it comes from the levity
of our mind&#8221; (Est. 16:9, Vulgate); &#8220;In the mighty throng I will praise you&#8221; (Ps. 35:18).  Secondly
he touches on carnal affection, when he says, Do I make my plans like a worldly man, i.e.,
according to carnal affection, ready to say Yes and No at once, i.e., to affirm and deny: &#8220;Some
suspect us of acting in worldly fashion&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:2); &#8220;A double-minded man is unstable in all
his ways&#8221; (Jas. 1:7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">38. &#8211; Having enlarged upon their accusation, he excuses himself, saying, As surely as God is
faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
declares that he did not lie; secondly, he shows how he did not lie (v. 21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">39. &#8211; He shows in two ways that he had not lied, namely, from his character and from the cause
[for his not lying]. From his character, because we should not suppose that a person would easily
lie, if he has never been found to be a liar. According to this explanation, As surely as God is
faithful, is spoken with the force of an oath. As if to say: God is my witness that my word,
namely, my preaching, to you has not been Yes and No, i.e., there is no falsity in it: &#8220;A faithful
God, without deceit, just and upright is he&#8221; (Deut. 32:4).  But if God is faithful is taken for the
truth of the divine promise, then the sense is: God is faithful, i.e., he keeps his promises, but he
had promised to send you preachers of the truth: &#8220;I will give you shepherds after my own heart&#8221;
(Jer. 3:15). Therefore, since I was sent by him, our word to you has not been Yes and No.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">40. &#8211; In regard to the cause, he excuses himself for two reasons, namely, from the motive and the
efficient cause. His motive for not lying is that a person who assumes an office is naturally
moved to what suits that office and not to what is contrary; but it is obvious that the Apostle&#8217;s
office is to preach the truth. Therefore, he is not moved to the contrary of the truth, which is to
lie. In regard to this he does three things: first, he proves the truth of his word by the word of
Christ; secondly, he proves the truth of Christ by the word of God; thirdly, he concludes to what
he intended (v. 20b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">41. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that our words should be regarded as true, and true they are,
because we have preached Christ, in whom there is no falsehood. And this is what he says, For
the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we preached among you, Silvanus, by me, i.e. to say
principally, and Silvanus, secondarily (he is the Silas of Ac. 18:5), and Timothy mentioned
above. For those two were with the Apostle when he first converted them. He, namely, the Son
of God, was not Yes and No, i.e., there was not falsity, for he did nothing unbecoming, but in
him it is always Yes, i.e., the truth, for truth and being are convertible: &#8220;I am the way and the
truth and the life&#8221; (Jn. 14:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">42. &#8211; But because there might be some doubt about his statement that there was no falsity in
Christ, he at once proves this, saying, For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. He
proves this in the following way: it is obvious that there can be no falsity in that which is the
manifestation of the divine truth; but the Son of God came to manifest the divine truth in the
promises made by God to be fulfilled through him. Therefore there is no falsity in him. And that
is what he says: there is not in the Son of God Yes and No, because all the promises of God,
namely made to men, find their Yes in him, i.e., in Christ, i.e., they are verified and fulfilled in
Christ: &#8220;I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God&#8217;s truthfulness,
in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs&#8221; (Rom. 15:8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">43. &#8211; From this, therefore, the Apostle concludes that his words are true, because he preaches the
Son of God, in whom is the truth. That is why through him, namely, Christ, we utter the Amen,
i.e., that which is true: &#8220;The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness&#8221; (Rev. 3:14); &#8220;He
who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, amen&#8221; (Is. 65:16). This
truth we say to God, i.e., to the honor of God, namely, manifesting his truth to the glory of God
and our glory, because our glory is to show and preach the word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">44. &#8211; Then when he says, but it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed
us, the Apostle proves that he has not lied by the efficient cause. For although a man by his free
will can employ his tongue for speaking truth or falsity, God can establish a man so well in the
truth, that he would speak nothing but the truth. Therefore, if God established someone in the
truth, it is obvious that he could not say anything false; but God establishes us in the truth. And
therefore he says, it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, i.e., in the true preaching of
Christ. As if to say: if Christ were outside us, we could lie, but because he is with us and we in
Christ, we do not lie: &#8220;It is I who keep steady its pillars&#8221; (Ps. 75:3).  Therefore we are in Christ
in two ways, namely, by grace and by glory: by grace, inasmuch as we have been anointed with
the grace of the Holy Spirit and made members of Christ and joined to him; by which grace
Christ as man was also anointed: &#8220;God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
above your fellows&#8221; (Ps. 45:7). And from the fullness of that anointing it has overflowed to all
of us as &#8220;the precious oil on the head&#8221;, namely of Christ, &#8220;has flowed down on the beard, the
beard of Aaron&#8221; (Ps. 133:2). Therefore, he says that God has anointed us. He anointed us, I say,
as kings and priests: &#8220;You made them a kingdom and priests to our God&#8221; (Rev. 5:10); &#8220;You are
a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">45. &#8211; But the union which is according to glory we do not yet have in reality, but in sure hope,
inasmuch as we have a firm hope of attaining to this union. And we have a twofold certainty of
hope resulting from the hope of this union. One is by a sign, the other by a pledge.  [The first is]
by an evident sign, which is of faith. Hence he says, he has put his seal upon us with the sign of
Christian faith: &#8220;Put a mark on their foreheads&#8221; (Ez. 9:4), i.e., the sign of the cross: &#8220;Till we have
sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads&#8221; (Rev. 7:3). And this is done through the
Holy Spirit: &#8220;Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him&#8221; (Rom. 8:9).
Therefore the special and certain sign of obtaining eternal life is configuration to Christ: &#8220;Set me
as a seal upon your heart&#8221; (Sg. 8:6). Or he sealed us with the sign of life.  [The second is] by the
greatest pledge, i.e., of the Holy Spirit; and so he says and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a
guarantee, and we are certain that no one can take him from us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">46. &#8211; But note that there are two things to be considered in a pledge, namely, that it produces a
hope of obtaining the reality, and that it is as valid as the reality or more so. And these two things
are in the Holy Spirit, because if we consider the substance of the Holy Spirit, he is as valid as
eternal life, which is God, because he is as valid as the three persons. But if we consider the
manner in which [he] is possessed, then it produces the hope but not the possession of eternal
life, because we do not yet have him perfectly in this life. Therefore we are not perfectly happy
until we have him perfectly in heaven: &#8220;You were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit&#8221; (Eph.
1:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">47. &#8211; The when he says, but I call God to witness, he gives his excuse for not coming; and this
is by oath which is greater. In regard to this he does three things: first, he states the excuse;
secondly, he answer a tacit question (v. 24a); thirdly, he explains what he says (v. 24b).  He
excuses himself with a double oath: one of attestation, when he says, I call God to witness; the
other of execration, when he says, against me, i.e., against my soul: &#8220;For God is my witness&#8221;
(Rom. 1:9). As witness, I say, I call upon God, because I refrained from coming, i.e., after the
first time or after I departed from you; and this I did to spare you, namely, because he knew that
they were incorrigible. Hence, if he had gone then, he would either have punished them, and they
perhaps would have left the faith altogether, or he would not have punished them, and then he
would have been giving them occasion to sin more.  But because someone could say, Why do
you say spare us? Are you our lord? He removes this, saying, not that we lord it over your faith;
we work with you for your joy. As if to say: I do not say this as a lord, but as a helper: &#8220;Not as
those domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:3). A
helper, I say, for your joy, or for your improvement. Why he says, of your faith, he explains,
saying, for you stand firm in your faith, i.e., you stand in that grace of Christ by faith.</p>

I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who
should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be
the joy of you all. 4 For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart
and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love
that I have for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">48. &#8211; After giving a general excuse for his delay in visiting the Corinthians, the Apostle now
gives the cause of his delay and how he spared them. In regard to this he does two things: first,
he mentions that one cause of his delay was that he might not pain them by coming; secondly,
he shows that another cause was that the fruit he hoped for from others and which was beginning
to ripen, might not be hindered (v. 12).  In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows
that the cause of his delay in general was to avoid paining them; secondly, he speaks in particular
about a certain person who had grieved him (v. 5). In regard to the first he does three things: first,
he tells why he postponed his visit; secondly, he gives the reason for his statement (v. 2); thirdly,
he explains what he said (v. 4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">49. &#8211; He says, therefore: I have said that it was in order not to grieve you that I did not come to
you. Therefore, I made up my mind, i.e., about what I mentioned when I sent the other letter:
&#8220;Reason is the beginning of every work, and counsel precedes every undertaking&#8221; (Sir. 37:16);
not to make you another painful visit, i.e., not to cause you pain.  The reason he did not wish to
grieve them is the same one whereby the Lord did not wish his disciples to fast, namely, in order
that they be drawn to Christ and be joined to him not by fear but by love. For the Lord wished
to strengthen and nourish them in the faith in all sweetness and heartfelt desire, so that, being
thus established in love, they would not easily turn away from him because of tribulations, for
&#8220;many waters cannot extinguish love&#8221; (Sg. 8:7). For the same reason the Apostle does not want
to pain them on this account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">50. &#8211; He assigns the reason for what he says, namely, that he does not want to pain them, when
he says, for if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
In regard to this he does two things: first, he deals with the reason why he did not wish to pain
them; secondly, he shows why he tells them this (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">51. &#8211; He says, therefore: the reason why I did not wish you to fall into sadness was that your
sadness pains me, and I rejoice in your consolation; and you only console me when I am with
you. Hence, if I had come and pained you, I would be sad at your sadness; then there would be
no one among you to gladden me, because you would be sad on my account. For one who is sad
does not easily console another person: &#8220;A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a
sorrow to his mother&#8221; (Prov. 10:1); &#8220;He who loves wisdom makes his father glad&#8221; (Prov. 29:3).
Or in another way, there are two kinds of sadness. One is according to the world, and the other
according to God who produces repentance leading to salvation. The Apostle is not speaking of
the first, but of the second. He says: I will be consoled if I cause you pain, i.e., if by scolding you
I bring you to repentance; but if I had come and seen you unrepentant of your sins, I would have
had no consolation, because no one is sad and repentant because of me, i.e., because of my
correction and rebuke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">52. &#8211; But the reason I write this to you is that you so adjust yourselves, that when I come, I will
not be sad at seeing you uncorrected, in addition to the sadness I experienced when I heard that
you had sinned. In regard to this he does two things: first, he gives his admonition; secondly, he
shows that he is confident it will be obeyed (v. 3b).  The admonition is this: I wrote as I did,
namely, that I am pained at the sin you committed: &#8220;he was vexed in his righteous soul day after
day with their lawless deeds&#8221; (2 Pet. 2:8), in order that you might prepare and arrange yourselves
by correction, so that when I came I might not suffer pain at your sins from those who should
have made me rejoice, i.e., I ought to rejoice and be glad in your presence: &#8220;There is joy before
the angels of God over one sinner who repents&#8221; (Lk. 15:10).  The confidence he had that they
would follow his admonition is indicated when he says, for I felt sure of all of you. As if to say:
I have this confidence in you, that you will be so disposed, that when I come, all of you will give
me reason for joy; and you should do this cheerfully, that my joy would be the joy of you all, i.e.,
it would contribute to your joy, or it is for the sake of your joy, which you have from the recovery
of grace: &#8220;Rejoice with those who rejoice&#8221; (Rom. 12:15)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">53. &#8211; But because someone might be in doubt at his saying, so that when I came I might not
suffer pain, and ask what sort of pain he had for them, he explains this saying, for I wrote you out
of much affliction and anguish of heart. In regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions
the pain he has already suffered; secondly, he answers a tacit question (v. 4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">54. &#8211; First, therefore, he says: I would be pained if I found you uncorrected&#8212;a greater pain than
I had when you sinned and I was obliged to sadden you with a sharp rebuke: for I wrote you in
the first epistle out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, which I shed for
you when you were already dead in sin: &#8220;O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of
tears&#8221; (Jer. 9:1); &#8220;It is a disgrace to be the father of an undisciplined son&#8221; (Sir. 22:3); &#8220;The
righteous man perishes and no one lays it to heart&#8221; (Is. 57:1).  But it should be noted that he
mentions two things that amplify his pain, namely, affliction and anguish, because one added to
the other increases sadness. For sometimes a person is sad but without anguish, namely, when
he is pricked by some adversity as though by a very sharp thorn; and yet various ways of escape
seem open to him, because if no way is open, anguish is joined to affliction. He says, therefore,
for I wrote you out of much affliction, with which he was pricked by your deeds and your evil,
and anguish of heart, because he could not see where a remedy could easily be found: &#8220;Trouble
and anguish have come upon me&#8221; (Ps. 119:143).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">55. &#8211; But because they could say, O Apostle, you even write these things to pain us, he
anticipates this, saying, not to cause you pain do I write these things to you, but to let you know
the abundant love that I have for you. For there are two signs of love, namely, to rejoice in the
good of another and to be pained at his evil; and I have these toward you: &#8220;For the love of Christ
controls us&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:14). More abundantly than you think, or more abundantly than toward
others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5 But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some
measure&#8212;not to put it too severely&#8212;to you all. 6 For such a one this punishment
by the majority is enough; 7 so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him,
or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 8 So I beg you to reaffirm your
love for him. 9 For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether
you are obedient in everything. 10 Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive.
What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the
presence of Christ, 11 to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us; for we
are not ignorant of his designs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">56. &#8211; After giving the reason for his delay, namely, to avoid paining them, and after telling them
of his sadness, the Apostle then treats here of the one causing his sadness. In regard to this he
does three things: first, he speaks more fully of the guilt of the one who causes this sadness;
secondly, of his punishment for the injury he inflicted (v. 6); thirdly, he urges them to have mercy
on this person (v. 7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">57. &#8211; He says, therefore: I have written to you with many tears, which I shed because of the
sadness I fell and because of the punishment to be inflicted on the sinner, but if any one has
caused me pain, he, namely, the heinous fornicator of whom he writes in 1 Corinthians (5:1): &#8220;It
is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that is not found even
among pagans&#8221;: that one, I say, even if he has caused sorrow, he has caused it not to me, but in
some measure, i.e., he has caused it not to me alone, but you and us. Not all, but in some
measure.  And I say this, not to put it too severely to you all, i.e., that I may not lay this burden
on all of you by speaking derisively. As if to say: you are not so good or love me so much that
all of you would weep over my sadness and over the sin of a brother. Or, not to put it too severely
to you all, not only those who did not grieve over the sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">58. &#8211; Or it could be said and better: he has caused it not to me, but in some measure. For it should
be noted that sometimes a person is completely saddened and sometimes not. He is completely
saddened when he is engrossed by pain with his grief. This is the sadness that works death, as
he says below (7:10), but that, according to the Philosopher, does not happen to a wise man. He
is not completely sad when, although he is sad about some evil he is suffering or seems to be on
its way, he nevertheless rejoices for other good reasons. This sadness is according to God and
does happen to a wise man. Therefore, because the Apostle says that he was very sad, he adds
that he was sad in some measure, as though not entirely, lest they suppose that he was altogether
engrossed by sadness, which does not befit a wise man. According to this, the meaning is: He,
i.e. the fornicator, has pained me on account of his sin, but he has not pained me entirely. For
although I grieved for him because of his sin, yet I take joy in you because of the many good
things you do, and in him because of his repentance. I say, in some measure, that I may not
burden you all, i.e., that I may not lay this burden on you, namely, that you should grieve me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">59. &#8211; But lest they should wish to punish him more on account of the Apostle&#8217;s sadness, he
shows them that the punishment was sufficient, saying, for such a one, namely, he who pained
me so much by sinning, this punishment by the majority is enough, i.e., such a harsh public
correction that he was excommunicated from the Church and delivered to Satan (1 Cor. 5:5).
Therefore this punishment is enough for the above reasons.  Or it can be called sufficient, not as
to God&#8217;s judgment, but as was expedient for the time and the person. For it is better to observe
such a spirit of leniency in correcting, that the fruit of correction follows on the penance, than to
correct so harshly that the sinner despairs and falls into worse sins. Therefore is says in Sirach
(21:4): &#8220;Terror and violence will lay waste riches.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">60. &#8211; Therefore, because that punishment was sufficient and he did penance, he urges them to
show mercy, saying, so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him. Here he does three
things: first, he commands them to spare the sinner; secondly, he gives the reason (v. 7); thirdly,
he urges them to observe this admonition (v. 8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">61. &#8211; He says first, therefore: I say that the punishment is sufficient for him, so much that you
should rather turn to forgive him: &#8220;Forgive, and you will be forgiven&#8221; (Lk. 6:37); &#8220;Forgiving one
another, as God in Christ forgave you&#8221; (Eph. 4:32). You should not only forgive, but what is
more, you should comfort him, and this by recalling to themselves the example of sinners who
were restored to the state of grace, such as David, Peter, Paul and Magdalene, and through the
Word of God: &#8220;For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord GOD; so turn, and
live&#8221; (Ez. 18:32); &#8220;Admonish the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient
with them all&#8221; (1 Th. 5:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">62. &#8211; He gives the reason for this admonition, saying, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive
sorrow. For some are sometimes so steeped in sorrow because of sin and punishment of sin, that
they are overcome, when they have no one to comfort them; and this is bad, because it does not
result in the hope for the fruit of repentance, namely reformation, but in despair he delivers
himself over to all sins, as Cain, when he said: &#8220;My punishment is greater than I can bear&#8221; (Gen.
4:13); &#8220;Who, despairing, have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to practice every
kind of uncleanness&#8221; (Eph. 4:19). For this reason, despair is called a dangerous thing in 2 Samuel
(2:26), so that David said in Psalm 69 (v. 15): &#8220;Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep
swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.&#8221;  Therefore, in order to prevent this, he says,
comfort him, so that he will cease sinning: &#8220;This will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin&#8221;
(Is. 27:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">63. &#8211; Then the Apostle urges them not only by reason, but from other causes to do this, when he
says, so I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. And he urges them in three ways: first, by his
appeal, saying, so, i.e., that he not be overwhelmed, I, who can command, beg you: &#8220;Though I
am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love&#8217;s sake I prefer to
appeal to you&#8221; (Phlm. 1:8-9). Evil prelates do the opposite: &#8220;With force and harshness you have
ruled them&#8221; (Ez. 34:4). To reaffirm your love for him, which happens if you show your charity
for him and not hate him for his sins, or despise him, but for your consolation make him hate his
sin and love justice: &#8220;Strengthen your brethren&#8221; (Lk. 22:32).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">64. &#8211; Secondly, he urges them with a command, saying, for this is why I wrote, namely, that I
might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. He says, in everything, namely,
whether they are pleasing or displeasing to you. For he had first commanded them to
excommunicate him, and they obeyed the Apostle&#8217;s command. But now he commands them to
be sparing; hence he says, whether you are obedient in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">65. &#8211; Thirdly, he urges them by reminding them of a gift, when he says, any one whom you
forgive, I also forgive. As if to say: you should do this because I also have done it. For if you
have forgiven someone and asked me to forgive, I have forgiven. And this is what he says: any
one whom you forgive, I also forgive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">66. &#8211; And this is obvious, for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your
sake in the [person] of Christ. In this he touches four things required for such pardon or
forgiveness. The first is discernment, so that pardon is not granted indiscriminately and rashly;
hence he says, if I have forgiven anything, namely, in the proper way: &#8220;Let your eyes look
directly forward&#8221; (Prov. 4:25). The second is the end, because it should be done not for love or
hatred, but for some benefit to the Church or others; hence he says, it has been for your sake. The
third is authority, because it should not be done on one&#8217;s own authority, but Christ&#8217;s, who
forgives sin by authority, but the others to whom it has been entrusted, forgive as ministers and
members of Christ; hence he says, in the [person] of Christ, namely, not by my own authority.
Yet whatever is forgiven, Christ forgives: &#8220;If you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven&#8221; (Jn.
20:23).  The fourth is need; hence he says, to keep Satan from gaining the advantage over us. For
the devil had deceived many: some by leading them to commit sins, and others by excessive rigor
against sinners; so that if Satan cannot get them for having committed sin, he at least destroys
those he already has by the severity of prelates who drive them to despair by not correcting them
in a compassionate way. Hence, he destroys these, and the others he puts in the snare of the devil:
&#8220;Be not righteous overmuch&#8221; (Ecc. 7:16); &#8220;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring
lion, seeking someone to devour&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:8). And this will happen to us if we do not forgive
sinners. Therefore that we might not be deceived by Satan, to keep Satan from gaining the
advantage over us, I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for we are not ignorant of his
designs, namely, those of Satan. This is true in general, but in particular no one can know his
thoughts but God alone: &#8220;Who can strip off his outer garment? Who can penetrate into the midst
of his mouth?&#8221; (Jb. 41:13, Vulgate).</p>

to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the
fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. 15 For we are the aroma of Christ

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">67. &#8211; Having stated the first reason for his delay, namely, that he might avoid coming to them in
sadness, he now states the second reason, which is the fruit he was producing elsewhere. In
regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions his travels; secondly, their result (v. 14). In
regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the obstacle he met at Troas; secondly,
his journey into Macedonia (v. 13b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">68. &#8211; He says, therefore: When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, i.e., to preach
Christ: &#8220;But I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit&#8221; (Jn. 15:16), a door
was opened for me, i.e., men&#8217;s minds were prepared and disposed to receive the words of
preaching and Christ: &#8220;for a wide door for effective work has opened to me&#8221; (1 Cor. 16:9);
&#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock&#8221; (Rev. 3:20). But not in anyone, but in the Lord, because
this preparation of the human mind is accomplished by God&#8217;s power. For although the ease with
which minds are prepared is the cause of conversion, God is the cause of that ease and of the
preparation: &#8220;Convert us to yourself, O Lord, that we may be converted&#8221; (Lam. 5:21, Vulgate).
When, I say, a door was thus opened for me in the Lord my mind [spirit] could not rest, i.e., I was
unable to do what my spirit wished, i.e., dictated. For the spirit is said to have rest, when it
achieves what it wishes, just as the flesh is said to rest when it has what it desires: &#8220;Soul, you
have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease&#8221; (Lk. 12:19). The Apostle does not say,
I had no rest in my flesh or my body, but in my mind, i.e., in my spiritual will, which is to
establish Christ in the hearts of men. And I was hindered because I saw hearts prepared and
disposed, and was unable to preach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">69. &#8211; Then he tells why he had no rest in his spirit, when he adds, because I did not find my
brother Titus there, i.e., because of Titus&#8217; absence. And this for two reasons. One reason was that
although the Apostle knew all their languages, so that he could say: &#8220;I thank God that I speak in
tongues more than you all&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:18), he was more skilled in Hebrew than in Greek, but
Titus more in Greek. Therefore, he wanted to have him present to preach in Troas. And because
he was absent, for the Corinthians had detained him, he says, my spirit could not rest.  But
because God&#8217;s gifts are not imperfect, and the gift of tongues was specifically given to the
apostles for preaching throughout the whole world: &#8220;Their voice goes out through all the earth,
and their words to the end of the world&#8221; (Ps. 19:4), the other reason is better, namely, that many
things remained for the Apostle to do in Troas. For on the one hand, he had to preach to those
who were prepared to receive Christ by faith; and on the other, he had to resists the adversaries
who opposed him; therefore, because he could not do these things alone, he was grieved by the
absence of Titus, who could concentrate on preaching and converting the good, while the Apostle
withstood the adversaries.  And he is at pains to write this to them in order to suggest that not
only the first, but also the second reason for his delay was due to them. For on account of their
hardness and quarreling, they delayed Titus for a long time. Hence he says, because I did not find
my brother Titus there, either in Christ or in my co-worker: &#8220;A brother helped is like a strong
city&#8221; (Prov. 18:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">70. &#8211; Because I did not find Titus in Troas, I did not stay there; I took leave of them who were
converted and in whom a door had been opened, and I went on to Macedonia, where I expected
to find him. But his reason for going into Macedonia is given in Acts (16:9), where it says: &#8220;A
man of Macedonia was standing beseeching him and saying, &#8216;Come over to Macedonia and help
us.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">71. &#8211; Then when he says, But thanks be to God, he describes the progress of his journey, and
does two things: first, he describes the order of his progress; secondly, he excludes the false
apostles from that progress (v. 16b). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he hints at the
progress he made; secondly, he explains something he had said (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">72. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle did not attribute to himself the
progress and fruit he had produced, or to his own power, but to God: &#8220;On the contrary, I worked
harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me&#8221; (1 Cor.
15:20): &#8220;Give thanks in all circumstances&#8221; (1 Th. 5:18); &#8220;Always and for everything giving
thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father&#8221; (Eph. 5:20). Who in Christ
always leads us in triumph, i.e., makes us triumph in preaching Christ against our adversaries.
Here it should be notes that preachers of truth should do two things: namely, to exhort in sacred
doctrine and to refute those who contradict it. This they do in two ways: by debating with heretics
and by practicing patience toward persecutors. The Apostle touches on these in order; hence he
says, who leads us in triumph, as to those who contradict: &#8220;We are more than conquerors&#8221; (Rom.
8:37); &#8220;It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from
Heaven&#8221; (1 Macc. 3:19); and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him
everywhere, as to exhorting in sacred doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">73. &#8211; A Gloss explains the fragrance of the knowledge of him, i.e., of his Son; but it is better to
suppose that this is said to distinguish between knowledge of God obtained by other sciences and
that obtained by faith. For the knowledge of God obtained by other sciences enlightens the
intellect only by showing that God is the first cause, that he is one and wise and so on. But the
knowledge of God obtained by faith both enlightens the intellect and delights the affections,
because it not only says that God is the first cause, but that he is our Savior, that he is our
Redeemer, that he loves us and that he became incarnate for us: all of which inflame the
affections. Therefore is should be said that the fragrance of the knowledge of him, i.e., the
knowledge of his sweetness, he spreads to those who believe by everywhere, because that
fragrance is diffused far and wide: &#8220;Like a vine I cause loveliness to bud&#8221; (Sir. 24:17); &#8220;See, the
smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed&#8221; (Gen. 27:27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">74. &#8211; But because some might say, What is the fragrance of God in every place? For there are
many places in which our preaching is not accepted. The Apostle explains this, saying: I do not
care, because whether they accept our preaching or not, the knowledge of God is manifest
everywhere through us, because we are the aroma of Christ to God, namely, to the honor of God.
He says this in a likeness to the Law, where it is said that a sacrifice becomes the sweetest
fragrance of sweetness to God. As if to say: we are a holocaust offered to God as a fragrance of
sweetness among those who are being saved, namely, that they not perish, which is theirs from
God; and among those who are perishing, which is theirs from themselves. Hence, it is written
in Hosea (13:9, Vulgate): &#8220;Destruction is your own, O Israel, your help is only in me&#8221;.  But is
that fragrance related to the good and the wicked in the same way? No, but to one a fragrance
from death to death, i.e., of envy and malice, which are the occasion of bringing them to eternal
death, i.e., those who envy the good reputation of the Apostle and strive against the preaching
of Christ and the conversion of the faithful: &#8220;This child is set for the fall and rising of many in
Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against&#8221; (Lk. 2:34). To the other a fragrance from life to life,
of love and good opinion leads them to eternal life, namely, to those who rejoice and are
converted by the preaching of the Apostle: &#8220;For the word of the cross is folly to those who are
perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:18). Thus, from the
fragrance of the Apostle the good live and the wicked die, as it is read that serpents die from the
smell of flourishing vines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">75. &#8211; Then when he says, Who is sufficient for these things? He excludes the false apostles from
the progress, saying, Who of those false apostles is sufficient for these things? which we true
apostles accomplish. As if to say: None: &#8220;But to me your friends, O God, are exceedingly
honorable&#8221; (Ps. 138:17, Vulgate).  But on the other hand, it says in Proverbs (27:2): &#8220;Let another
praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.&#8221; Gregory, in his
commentary on Ezekiel, answers this by saying that the saints praise themselves for two reasons,
and not for their own glory and vanity. The first reason is that they not despair in tribulations, as
Job, when his friends tried to bring him to despair, recalled to his mind the good things he had
done, in order to comfort himself and not despair. Hence, he said: &#8220;I have made a covenant with
my eyes; how then could I look upon a virgin?&#8221; (31:1). We read of a holy father, that when he
was tempted to despair, he recalled to mind the good things he had done, in order to comfort
himself; when he was tempted to pride, he recalled the evil he had done, in order to be humbled.
The second reason is for profit, namely, that he obtain a greater reputation and that his teaching
be believed more readily. This is the reason why the Apostle praises himself here. For the
Corinthians had preferred false apostles to him and disdained him. As a result they were not
ready to obey him. Therefore, to assure that they would not disdain but obey him, he prefers
himself to them and praises himself, saying, Who is sufficient for these things? as we are. Not
the false apostles, because even though they preach, they adulterate God&#8217;s word&#8212;which we do
not do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">76. &#8211; Hence, he says, for we are not, like so many, namely, the false apostles, peddlers of God&#8217;s
word, mingling contrary doctrines, as the heretics, who although they confess Christ, do not
admit that he is true God. This is what the false apostles do, who say that along with the Gospel
the legal observances must be kept.  Hence he says, for we are not, like so many, peddlers
[adulterers] of God&#8217;s word, i.e., preaching for gain or for praise. For thus are women called
adulteresses, when they receive seed from another man for the propagation of children. In
preaching, the seed is nothing less than your end or intention. Therefore, if your end is gain, if
your intention is your own glory, you adulterate God&#8217;s word. This the false apostles were doing
who were preaching for gain: &#8220;We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God&#8217;s word, but
by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience in
the sight of God&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:2). But the apostles preached neither for monetary gain nor their own
glory, but for the praise of God and the salvation of their neighbor. Hence, he adds, but as men
of sincerity, i.e., with a sincere intention; not for gain and without corrupted admixtures: &#8220;We
have behaved in the world, and still more toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity&#8221; (2 Cor.
1:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">77. &#8211; He points out three aspects of this sincerity: the first is taken from the dignity of the one
who sent them. For it is expected of a messenger of the truth to speak the truth; hence he says,
as commissioned by God, i.e., with that sincerity which befits a messenger of God: &#8220;Whoever
speaks as one who utters oracles of God&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:11).  The second is taken from the authority
of the one presiding, before whom he stands. Hence he says, in the sight of God, in whose
presence we should speak with sincerity: &#8220;As the Lord the God of Israel lives, before whom I
stand&#8221; (1 Kg. 17:1).  The third is taken from the dignity of the subject of which he speaks. For
the preaching of the apostles is about Christ; therefore, it should be sincere, as also Christ and
God are. Hence, he says, we speak in Christ alone, and not in the ceremonies of the Law, as false
apostles do: &#8220;For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified&#8221;
(1 Cor. 2:2).</p>

letters of recommendation to you, or from you? 2 You yourselves are our letter
of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and read by all men; 3
and you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with
ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of
human hearts. 4 Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
5 Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us;
our competence is from God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">78. &#8211; After presenting his excuse, by which he won the good will of his hearers, the Apostle
continues toward his main intention, namely, to treat about the ministers of the New Testament.
In regard to this he does two things: first, he commends the dignity of the good ministers;
secondly, he expands on the guilt of the evil ministers (chap. 10ff.). In regard to the first he does
two things: first, he commends the ministry of the New Testament; secondly, he commends the
exercise of this ministry in others by exhorting them to this (chap. 6). In regard to the first he
commends the ministry of the New Testament from three aspects: first, in this chapter, from its
dignity; secondly, from its exercise (chap. 4); thirdly, from its reward (chap. 5). In regard to the
first he does two things: first, he removes an objection; secondly, he commends the ministers of
the New Testament (v. 6).  In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle intended to
commend the ministers of the New Testament, of which he is one. Therefore, lest the Corinthians
object that in doing this he wishes to commend himself, he at once removes this, saying, Are we
beginning to commend ourselves again? Here he does two things: he first raises the question and
then he answers it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">79. &#8211;The question is this: I say that we do not adulterate the Word of God as the false apostles
do, but we speak with sincerity as from God. But in saying this, are we beginning to commend
ourselves again?, i.e., are we saying this because we want to procure our glory and not that of
God?  And he says, again, because in the first epistle he had commended himself enough, when
he said (3:10): &#8220;Like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation.&#8221; Therefore, we are not saying
this to seek our own glory, but God&#8217;s: &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a
stranger, and not your own lips&#8221; (Prov. 27:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">80. &#8211; He answers this when he says, Or do we need? Here he shows that he is not happy to
commend himself. In regard to this he does two things: first, he shows that he does not need
man&#8217;s commendation; secondly, that he does not require it of them (v. 4). In regard to the first
he does two things: first, he shows that he does not need their commendation; secondly, he
assigns the cause of this (v. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">81. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that we do not begin to commend ourselves, because we do not
need commendation. And this is what he says: Do we, the true ministers, need as some do,
namely the false apostles, letters of recommendation, i.e., praise, to you by others, or from you
to others?  But on the other hand, he says in Colossians (4:10): &#8220;Mark, the cousin of Barnabas,
greets you.&#8221; Even papal legates always carry letters of recommendation. Therefore it is not an
evil.  I answer that to accept such letters from famous persons, who are commended and honored
by reason of them alone, until they become known by their good works, is not evil: that is what
papal legates do. But the Apostle was already so well known and recommended among them by
his works, that he did not need letters of recommendation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">82. &#8211; Therefore he at once gives the reason for this, saying, you yourselves are our letter of
recommendation; as if to say: I have a good letter; I do not need others. In regard to this, he does
two things: first, he shows what that letter is which he has; secondly, he explains this (v. 3). In
regard to the first he does two things: first he shows what that letter is; secondly, he shows that
it is sufficient for commending him (v. 3b).  He says, therefore, you are our letter, i.e., the letter
through which our dignity is made manifest, by which we are commended, so that we do not need
other letters: &#8220;You are our glory&#8221; (1 Th. 2:20); &#8220;My little children, with whom I am again in
travail, until Christ be formed in you&#8221; (Gal. 4:19).  But is this letter sufficient? Yes, because it
is written on your hearts. Here he touches on two things causing the sufficiency of such letters.
One is that it should be understood and known by the one for whom it is sent; the other that he
still seeks, and not that he knows himself to have it. As to this he says, written on our hearts,
because we always have you in mind, having a special care for you: &#8220;I hold you in my heart&#8221;
(Phil. 1:7). The other is that he to whom it is sent may read and know it; hence, he says, to be
known and read by all men. To be known, I say, because you have been instructed and converted
by us; but it is read, because by our example even others imitate you: &#8220;Write the vision; make
it plain upon tablets, so he may run who reads it&#8221; (Hab. 2:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">83. &#8211; Then he explains how this letter is known, saying, you show that you are a letter from
Christ, and in regard to this he does three things. First, he explains whose letter it is; secondly,
how it was written; thirdly, on what. He shows whose it is when he says, from Christ. Hence, he
says, you show that you are a letter from Christ, i.e., informed and led by Christ, principally and
authoritatively: &#8220;For you have one teacher&#8221; (Matt. 23:8), but by us secondarily and
instrumentally. Hence he adds, delivered by us: &#8220;This is how one should regard us, as servants
of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1); &#8220;What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you
believed&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:5)  He shows how it was written, not with ink, i.e., not mixed with errors, as
the letters of the false apostle; not changeable and imperfect as the Old Law, which led no one
to perfection (cf. Heb. 7:19); for black ink is that by which error is understood, and delible by
which changeableness is understood. It is written not with ink, I say, but with the Spirit of the
living God, i.e., by the Holy Spirit, by whom you live and by whose teaching you have been
instructed: &#8220;In whom you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit&#8221; (Eph. 1:13).  He suggests
where it is written, when he says, not on tablets of stone, as the Old Law, to exclude hardness;
as if to say: not in the stony hearts of the hard-hearted, as the Jews: &#8220;You stiff-necked people,
uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Ac. 7:51); but on tablets of
human hearts, i.e., hearts opened by charity, and human, i.e., made receptive as a result of filling
and understanding: &#8220;I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh&#8221;
(Ez. 36:26).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">84. &#8211; Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Above, the Apostle
excused himself, that he was not seeking his own glory, because he did not need it; here he
proves that he is not seeking his own glory. Indeed, everything good he does he attributes not to
himself but to God. In regard to this he does two things: first, he attributes all the good he has and
does to God; secondly, he gives the reason for this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">85. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that we do not need letters of recommendation and that you are our
letter ministered by us. Nor do we seek our glory, but Christ&#8217;s. Such is the confidence, i.e. to say
such things, that we have through Christ toward God, i.e., we refer it to God. Or I have such
confidence in God, by whose power I say these things, because he works in me, and the
confidence we have through Christ, through whom we have access to the Father, as it says in
Romans (5:2), who unites us to God: &#8220;Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is
the Lord&#8221; (Jer. 17:7). And I have this confidence because I am united to God through Christ: &#8220;I
will act confidently in him&#8221; (Ps. 11:6, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">86. &#8211; But the cause of this confidence is that whatever I do, I attribute to the very beginning of
the work to God. Therefore, he says, not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything
as coming from us, much less say and accomplish. For in the pursuit of any work there is first
an assent, which is done by thinking, then discussion by word, and finally accomplishment by
work. Hence if a person does not have the thinking from himself but from God, there is no doubt
that not only the completion of a good work is from God, but even the very beginning: &#8220;He who
began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:6). This
is contrary to the Pelagians, who say that the beginning of a good work is from us, but its
completion is from God: &#8220;O Lord, you have wrought for us all our works&#8221; (Is. 26:12).  But lest
this seem to take away free will, he says, of ourselves, i.e., on our part, and commends divine
grace when he says, as coming from us, i.e., as though it came from us, rather than God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">87. &#8211; The Philosopher also teaches that a man can never do any good through his free will
without God&#8217;s help. The reason is that in the things we do it is necessary to seek that for which
we do it. But there can be no infinite process, for we must come to something which is first, e.g.,
to counsel. Thus, therefore, I do good, because there is in me the counsel to do so, and this is
from God. Hence, he says that the counsel of something good is from something above man,
moving him to act well; and this is God, who moves men and all things that act to their actions;
but men are moved in one way, and other things in another. For since motion of this kind is
something received into the thing moved, it is necessary that this be done according to the mode
of its nature, i.e., of the thing moved. And therefore he moves all things according to their
natures. Therefore, those things whose nature is to have free will and have dominion over their
actions, he moves in such a way that they act freely, as rational and intellectual creatures. But
others not freely, but according to the mode of their nature.  But although we are not sufficient
to think anything of ourselves as coming from ourselves, yet we have a certain sufficiency,
namely that by which we are able to will the good, and to begin to believe, and this is from God:
&#8220;What have you that you did not receive?&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:7).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6 He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a written
code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 Now
if the dispensation of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such splendor
that the Israelites could not look at Moses&#8217; face because of its brightness, fading
as this was, 8 will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater
splendor? 9 For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the
dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. 10 Indeed, in this
case, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor at all, because of the
splendor that surpasses it. 11 For if what faded away came with splendor, what
is permanent must have much more splendor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">88. &#8211; Having commended the ministry of the New Testament, the Apostle then commends its
ministers. First, he stipulates two things, which correspond to the above words. For he had
mentioned a gift received from God when he said, our competence is from God, and the
confidence born of this gift when he said, such is the confidence that we have through Christ
toward God.  First, therefore, he determines the things pertaining to the gift received; secondly,
those pertaining to the confidence born of it (v. 12). In regard to the first he does three things:
first, he discloses the gift received from God, namely, the ministry of the New Testament;
secondly, he describes the New Testament (v. 6b); thirdly, from the dignity of the New Testament
he shows the dignity of its ministers (v. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">89. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that our sufficiency is from God who has made us competent to
be ministers of a new covenant: &#8220;Men shall speak of you as the ministers of our God&#8221; (Is. 61:6).
And in this we hold the place of angels: &#8220;Who make angels your messengers, fire and flame your
ministers&#8221; (Ps. 104:4). But he not only made us ministers, but fit ones. For God gives to each
being the things through which it can attain to the perfection of its nature. Hence, because God
constituted ministers of the New Testament, he made them fit to exercise this office, unless he
was impeded on the part of the receivers: &#8220;Who is sufficient for these things&#8221; (2 Cor. 2:16),
namely, as are the Apostles instituted by God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">90. &#8211; He describes what this New Testament is when he continues, not in a written code but in
the Spirit. He describes it in regard to two things, namely, as to that in which it consists and as
to its cause for which it has been given: for the written code kills.  In regard to the first it should
be noted that the Apostle speaks profoundly, for it is stated in Jeremiah (31:31): &#8220;I will make a
new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which
I made with their fathers&#8221;; and later on (v. 33): &#8220;I will put my law within them, and I will write
it on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be my people.&#8221; The Old Testament,
therefore, is written in a book, later to be sprinkled with blood, as it says in Hebrews (9:19): &#8220;He
took the blood of calves and goats and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying:
&#8216;This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you.&#8217;&#8221;  So it is clear that the Old Law
is a covenant of words, but the New Covenant is a covenant of the Holy Spirit, by whom the love
of God is poured out in our hearts [Et sic patet, quod vetus lex est testamentum litterae. Sed
Novum Testamentum est testamentum Spiritus Sancti, quo charitas Dei diffunditur in cordis
nostris], as it says in Rom. 5:5. Consequently, when the Holy Spirit produces charity in us, which
is the fulness of the Law, it is a New Covenant, not in a written code, i.e., not written down, but
in the Spirit, i.e., through the Spirit who gives life: &#8220;The law of the Spirit of life&#8221; (Rom. 8:2), i.e.,
life-giving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">91. &#8211; The reason why the New Testament was given by the Spirit is indicated when he says, for
the written code kills, not as a cause but as an occasion. For the written Law only gives
knowledge of sin: &#8220;For through the Law comes knowledge of sin&#8221; (Rom. 3:20). But as a result
of merely knowing sin, two things follow. For the Law, although sin is known by it, does not
repress concupiscence, but is the occasion of increasing it, inasmuch as concupiscence is
enkindled the more by something forbidden. Hence such knowledge kills, when the cause of
concupiscence has not yet been destroyed. As a result it adds to the sin. For it is more grievous
to sin against the written and natural law than against the natural law only: &#8220;But sin, finding
opportunity in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of concupiscence&#8221; (Rom. 7:8).  But
although it is the occasion of killing inasmuch as it increases concupiscence and increases the
sin, the Law is not evil, because at least it forbids evil; nevertheless, it is imperfect, inasmuch as
it does not remove the cause. Therefore, the Law without the Spirit inwardly impressing the Law
on the heart is the occasion of death; hence, it was necessary to give the Law of the Spirit, who
gives life by producing charity in the heart: &#8220;It is the Spirit that gives life&#8221; (Jn. 6:63).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">92. &#8211; From these, therefore, he shows the dignity of his ministry. He does two things in this
regard. First, he shows that the ministry of the New Testament is preferred to the Old; secondly,
that it is not only preferred, but that in comparison to the Old Testament, the latter has, as it were,
nothing of glory (v. 10). In regard to the first, he does two things. First, he shows that the ministry
of the New Testament is preferred to the Old; secondly, he assigns the reason for this (v. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">93. &#8211; In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle argues from a statement in Exodus
(34:24), where our text says that Moses had his face horned, so that the people of Israel could not
come near. Another version says that his face shone, and this is better. For it should not be
supposed that he literally had horns, as some depict him, but he is described as horned because
of the rays which seemed to be like horns. He argues from this in the following way: first, by a
similarity and by arguing from the lesser. For it is obvious that if something less has glory, then
much more something which is greater. But the Old Testament is less than the New: therefore,
since the former was in glory, so that the Israelites could not look at Moses&#8217; face, it seems that
the New is much more in glory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">94. &#8211; That the Old Testament is less than the New he proves in three ways. First, from its effect,
because the former is a covenant of death, but the latter of life, as has been said. In regard to this
he says, If the dispensation of death, i.e., the Old, which is the occasion of death; and this
corresponds to what he said, namely, that the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life.
Secondly, as to the way it was delivered, for the Old was delivered written on stone tablets, but
the New was impressed by the Spirit on human hearts. He suggests this when he says, carved in
letters, i.e., perfectly formed, on stone, i.e., on tablets of stone. This corresponds to his statement,
not in a written code but in the Spirit. Thirdly, as to perfection: for the glory of the Old Testament
is without assurance, because the Law brought no one to perfection. But in the New there is glory
with the hope of a better glory, i.e., eternal: &#8220;My salvation will be forever&#8221; (Is. 51:6). This is
suggested when he says, fading as this was: &#8220;If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no
advantage to you&#8221; (Gal. 5:2). He states the conclusion when he says, will not the dispensation
of the Spirit be attended with greater glory? which is plain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">95. &#8211; Then he assigns the reason for all these when he says, For if there was glory in the
dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of justice must far exceed it in glory. This is his
reasoning: Glory is owed more to justice than to condemnation, but the ministry of the New
Testament is a ministry of justice, because it justifies by giving life within. The ministry of the
Old Testament is a ministry of condemnation, as being its occasion: the written code kills, but
the Spirit gives life. Therefore, since the dispensation of condemnation, i.e., the ministry of the
Old Testament, is the occasional cause of condemnation, as has been said, is in glory, which
appeared on the face of Moses, it is obvious that much more abundant in glory, i.e., gives an
abundance of glory to its ministers, is the dispensation of justice, i.e., of the New Testament, by
which the Spirit is given through whom is given justice and the fulfillment of the virtues: &#8220;The
wise shall possess glory&#8221; (Prov. 3:35).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">96. &#8211; It is customary here to compare Moses and Paul; but if the Apostle&#8217;s words are considered
carefully, this is not necessary, because ministries not persons are being compared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">97. &#8211; But because the false apostles could say that even though the ministry of the New Covenant
is greater than that of the Old, it is not much greater. Therefore, it is good for us to continue in
that ministry, which they did, because they observed the ceremonies of the Law along with the
Gospel. Therefore the Apostle rejects this when he says, indeed, in this case, what once had glory
has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.  In regard to this he does
two things. First, he shows that the ministry of the New Testament exceeds that of the Old
beyond all comparison. Secondly, he assigns the reason for this (v. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">98. &#8211; He says, therefore, I have said that the ministry of justice abounds in glory to such a degree
that the glory of the Old Testament should not be called glorious, for what once had glory has
come to have no glory at all by reason of the glory that surpasses it. This is explained in two
ways.  First, that that glory is nothing in comparison to that of the New Testament, because such
glory was not conferred on all the ministers, but on Moses alone, and it did not shine on Moses
entirely, but in part, i.e., on his face alone. Therefore, it has come to have no glory at all, i.e.,
should not be glorified because of the glory that surpasses it, i.e., in comparison to the excelling
glory of the New Testament, which abounds in grace, so that men purified by it might not see the
glory of a man but of God.  It is explained in a second way by punctuating it thus: that which was
glorious in this part has come to have no glory: as if to say, for in this part, i.e., in respect to this
particular nature, that we are servants, has come to have no glory, i.e., that was not glorious
which shone in the Old Testament: and this by reason of the glory that surpasses it, which is in
the New, because it is the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">99. &#8211; Then he assigns the cause of this when he says, For if what faded away came with glory,
what is permanent must have much more glory. His reasoning is thus: that which was given to
pass away is nothing in relation to that which is given to remain always. If, therefore, the Old
Testament, which is rendered void, is done away with: &#8220;But when the perfect comes, the
imperfect will pass away&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:10). For with glory the ministry of Moses came, at least
with a particular glory.  And it is obvious that the New Testament remains, because it is begun
here and completed in heaven: &#8220;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away&#8221; (Lk. 21:33). It will be much more in eternal glory, in which it will be perfected; it will be,
I say, for us who are its ministers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12 Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, 13 not like Moses, who put a
veil over his face so that the Israelites might not see the end of the fading
splendor. 14 But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the
old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it
taken away. 15 Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their
minds; 16 but when a man turns to the Lord the veil is removed. 17 Now the Lord
is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 18 And we all,
with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into his
likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who
is the Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">100. &#8211; Having laid down what pertains to commending the gift received from God, he now lays
down what pertains to commending the confidence born of that gift. In regard to this he does two
things: first, he mentions the confidence born of the gift; secondly, he compares the confidence
in the Old and in the New Testament (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">101. &#8211; He says, therefore, Since we have such a hope, because of what has been said to us,
namely, of seeing the glory of God: &#8220;In this hope we were saved&#8221; (Rom. 8:24), we are very bold
[multa fiducia utimur], i.e., we confidently do the things which pertain to the use of this ministry,
from which our hope grows: &#8220;The righteous are bold as a lion&#8221; (Prov. 28:1); &#8220;Blessed is the man
who trusts in the Lord&#8221; (Jer. 17:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">102. &#8211; Then as he preferred the one gift to the other, so he prefers the confidence [fiducia] of the
New Testament to that of the Old (v. 13). In regard to this he does two things: first, he mentions
a fact about the Old Testament; secondly, he explains it (v. 13b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">103. &#8211; The fact he proposes is mentioned in Exodus (34:33), where it says that when he spoke
to the people, Moses veiled his face, because the children of Israel could not look upon him
because of the splendor of his face. Hence he says, not like Moses, who put a veil over his face.
As if to say: I say that we are very bold, and such as did not happen to us as Moses did to them,
namely, not revealing his face to the people, because the time to reveal the splendor of truth had
not yet come. Therefore, we have confidence [fiduciam] without the veil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">104. &#8211; Then he explains what he had said about the veil, saying, which is made void, for that veil
was the dimness of the figures, which was made void by Christ. In regard to this he does three
things. First, he mentions the voiding of this veil; secondly, how this voiding still prevails among
the Jews (v. 14); thirdly, how this has no place among the ministers of the New Testament (v.
18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">105. &#8211; He says, therefore, that Moses put a veil, namely, of the figure, over his face; this veil is
made void, i.e., is taken away by Christ, namely, by fulfilling in truth what Moses delivered in
figure, because all things happened to them in a figure. For thus Christ by his death removed the
veil of the killing of the paschal lamb. Therefore, as soon as he gave up his spirit, the veil of the
Temple was rent. Likewise by sending the Holy Spirit into the hearts of believers so that they
might understand spiritually what the Jews understood carnally. He removed the veil, when he
opened their mind to understand the Scriptures (Lk. 24:45).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">106. &#8211; What effect this voiding had on the Jews is shown (v. 14). In regard to this he does two
things. First, he shows that it was not removed from them in the state of unbelief; secondly, he
shows that it will be removed when they are converted (v. 16). In regard to the he does two
things: first, he shows why this voiding has no place among the Jews; secondly, from this he
shows that they still have the veil (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">107. &#8211; He says, therefore, that it is removed for those who believe, but not for the unbelieving
Jews. The reason for this is that their minds were hardened, i.e., their reasoning power is dull and
their senses weak and clouded, so that they cannot see the brightness of the divine light, i.e., of
divine truth, without the veil of figures. The reason for this is that they close their eyes so as not
to see, because the veil of the Temple was rent. Therefore, this is due to their sin of unbelief, and
not to a weakness in the truth; because with the removal of the veil the truth is manifested very
clearly to all who open the eyes of their mind through faith: &#8220;A hardening has come upon part
of Israel&#8221; (Rom. 11:25); &#8220;For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see,
and that those who see may become blind&#8221; (Jn. 9:39). For this was foretold by Isaiah (6:10):
&#8220;Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.&#8221;
And indeed their minds are so dulled to the truth that to this day they do not understand the truth
manifested to us. But the same veil remains which was in the Old Testament before the veil of
the Temple was rent, when they read the Old Testament, because they understand it no differently
than before. For they still rely on figures, so as not to reveal the truth, i.e., not understand. Thus
they still believe that the veil of God is not a figure, but the truth, which namely is lifted as to
believers through Christ, i.e., in the faith of Christ. But it remains in them, because they do not
believe that Christ has come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">108. &#8211; Then when he says, Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their minds,
he shows how even among the Jews the veil remains, as to unbelievers, although it has been
removed by Christ. In regard to this it should be noted that a veil is said to be put on something
in two ways: either because it is put on the thing seen, so that it cannot be seen; or because it is
put on the one seeing, so that he may not see. But the veil was put on the Jews of the Old Law
in both ways. For their eyes have been blinded not to see the truth because of their hardness; and
the Old Testament had not yet been fulfilled, because the truth had not yet come. As a sign of this
the veil was on Moses&#8217; face and not theirs. But with the coming of Christ the veil was removed
from the face of Moses, i.e., from the Old Testament, because it was not fulfilled: but it has not
been removed from their hearts. Hence, he says, to this day the veil remains. As if to say: the veil
has been removed from the believers of the Old Testament, but still when Moses is read, i.e.,
when the Old Testament is explained to them: &#8220;For from early generations, Moses has had in
every city those who preach him, for he is read every sabbath in the synagogues&#8221; (Ac. 15:21), the
veil, i.e. blindness, lies over their hearts: &#8220;A hardening has come upon part of Israel&#8221; (Rom.
11:25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">109. &#8211; But when and how that veil shall be removed from them is shown when he says, but when
a man turns to the Lord the veil is removed. First he describes how to remove this veil; secondly,
the reason for this (v. 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">110. &#8211; He says, therefore, that this veil is still upon them; not that the Old Testament is veiled,
but because their hearts are veiled. Therefore if it is to be removed, nothing remains but that they
be converted. Hence, he says, but when a man turns, namely, some of them, to God through faith
in Christ, the veil is removed by their conversion: &#8220;A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob,
to the mighty God&#8221; (Is. 10:21); and this is also stated in Romans (9:27).  And note that when he
treated of blindness, he spoke in the plural, saying over their hearts; but when he speaks of
conversion, he speaks in the singular, saying, but when a man turns, to show how easy evil is and
how difficult the good, as though few will be converted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">111. &#8211; But the reason why they are converted and the veil removed in this manner is because God
wills it. For they could claim that God put the veil on them and therefore it cannot be removed.
But the Apostle shows that it cannot only be removed, but even that it is removed by him who
is the Lord. Hence, he says, now the Lord is the Spirit. This can be understood in two ways. In
one way, so that Spirit is taken as the subject, as though saying: the Spirit, i.e., the Holy Spirit,
namely who is the author of the Law, is the Lord, i.e., works by his own free will: &#8220;The Spirit
blows where it wills&#8221; (Jn. 3:8); &#8220;The Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills&#8221;
(1 Cor. 12:11). And where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom; as if to say: because the
Spirit is the Lord, he can give freedom to enable us freely to use the writings of the Old
Testament without a veil. Therefore, those who do not have the Holy Spirit cannot use it freely:
&#8220;You were called to freedom&#8221; (Gal. 5:13); &#8220;Live as free men, yet without using your freedom as
a pretext for evil&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:16).  It can be understood another way so that by the Lord is meant
Christ, as though saying: the Lord, i.e., Christ, is Spirit, i.e., has spiritual power. Therefore, where
the Spirit of the Lord is, i.e., the law of Christ spiritually understood, not in a written code, but
impressed on the heart by faith, there is freedom from every obscurity of the veil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">112. &#8211; It should be noted that by occasion of these words, namely, where the Spirit of the Lord
is there is freedom, and of those found in 1 Timothy (1:9): &#8220;The law is not laid down for the
just&#8221;, some have erroneously said that spiritual men are not bound by the precepts of the divine
law. But this is false, for God&#8217;s precepts are the rule of the human will. But there is no man or
angel whose will does not need to be ruled and directed by divine law. Hence, it is impossible
for any man not to be subject to God&#8217;s precepts. But the statement that &#8220;the law is not laid down
for the just&#8221; means that the law was not laid down &#8220;for the just&#8221; who are led by an internal habit
to do what the law of God commands, but because of the unjust. Nevertheless, this does not mean
that the just are not bound to it. Similarly, where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, is
explained thus: the free man is one who exists for himself, but the servant exists for the sake of
the master. Therefore, whoever acts of himself acts freely, but one who is moved by another does
not act freely. Therefore, one who avoids evils, not because they are evil, but because of God&#8217;s
commandment, is not free. But one who avoids evils because they are evils is free. But this is
done by the Holy Spirit who perfects man inwardly with a good habit, so that from love he avoids
evil, as if the divine law had commanded. Consequently, he is called free, not as though he is not
subject to the divine law, but because he is inclined by a good habit to do what the divine law
ordains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">113. &#8211; Then when he says, and we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are
being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another, he shows how the faithful
of Christ are altogether free of this veil. He says, therefore: I say that this veil will be removed
from them, when a person may be converted as we are; not a particular one, but we all who are
Christ&#8217;s faithful: &#8220;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for
others they are in parables&#8221; (Lk. 8:10). With unveiled face, not having a veil upon the heart, as
they. By face is meant the heart or the mind, because just as a person sees bodily with the face,
so spiritually with the mind: &#8220;Open my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of your law&#8221;
(Ps. 119:18).  The glory of the Lord, not of Moses: for glory signifies brightness, as Augustine
says. But the Jews saw some glory on the face of Moses as a result of his speaking with God. But
this glory is imperfect, because it is not the glory with which God is glorious: and this is to know
God himself. Or the glory of the Lord, i.e., the Son of God: &#8220;The glory of a father is a wise son&#8221;
(Prov. 10:1, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">114. &#8211; Beholding, i.e., speculating, which is not taken from the word which means &#8220;watch tower&#8221;
(specula), but from &#8220;mirror&#8221; (speculum), i.e., knowing the glorious God himself by the mirror
of reason, in which there is an image of God. We behold him when we rise from a consideration
of ourselves to some knowledge of God, and we are transformed.  For since all knowledge
involves the knower&#8217;s being assimilated to the thing known, it is necessary that those who see
be in some way transformed into God. If they see perfectly, they are perfectly transformed, as the
blessed in heaven by the union of enjoyment: &#8220;When he appears we shall be like him&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:2);
but if we see imperfectly, then we are transformed imperfectly, as here by faith: &#8220;Now we see in
a mirror dimly&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">115. &#8211; Therefore he says, into his likeness, that is, as we see, we are transformed, I say, from one
degree of glory to another. In this he distinguishes a triple degree of knowledge in Christ&#8217;s
disciples. The first is from the clarity of natural knowledge to the clarity of the knowledge of
faith. The second is from the clarity of the knowledge of the Old Testament to the clarity of the
knowledge of the grace of the New Testament. The third is from the clarity of natural knowledge
and of the Old and New Testaments to the clarity of eternal vision: &#8220;Though our outer nature is
wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:16).  But how does this
come about? Not by the letter of the law, but from the Lord who is the Spirit: &#8220;For all who are
led by the Spirit of God are sons of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:14); &#8220;Let your good Spirit lead me on a level
path&#8221; (Ps. 143:10).</p>

commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience in the sight of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">116. &#8211; Having shown the dignity of the New Testament ministry, the Apostle now discusses the
exercise of this ministry. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows that the exercise
of this ministry should consist in doing good; secondly it should consist also in enduring evils
patiently (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he lays down the use of this
ministry; secondly, he excludes an objection (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">117. &#8211; He says, therefore: because this ministry is of such great dignity in itself and in its
ministers, therefore having this ministry, i.e., this dignity of administering spiritual things: &#8220;This
is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God&#8221; (1 Cor.
4:1); &#8220;Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry&#8221; (Rom. 11:13);
having it, I say, not from ourselves or from our merits, but by the mercy of God which we have
obtained from God for this: &#8220;I received mercy&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">118. &#8211; Then when he says, we do not lose heart, he describes the exercise of this ministry, which
should be engaged in doing good; and this in regard to two things: first, as to avoiding evil;
secondly, as to doing good (v. 2b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">119. &#8211; He teaches us to avoid evil both in conduct and in doctrine, when we exercise this
ministry. As to conduct in two ways, namely in our actions and in our intentions. But if a person
avoids doing evil and has a good intention, he avoids evil completely. But evil is avoided in our
activity by enduring evils patiently in adversity. Hence, he says, we do not lose heart by
impatience: &#8220;Let us not grow weary in well-doing&#8221; (Gal. 6:9); &#8220;For when I am weak, then I am
strong&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:10). It is also avoided in prosperity by making moderate use of the things that
are going well for us. Hence he says, we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways, i.e., we
remove from ourselves whatever makes a man base and dishonorable, namely, things unclean
and foul and not only open but even hidden: &#8220;Therefore put away all filthiness&#8221; (Jas. 1:21); &#8220;For
it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret&#8221; (Eph. 5:12).  Evil conduct is
avoided in our intention, if it is a right intention. In regard to this he says, we refuse to practice
cunning, i.e., fraud and pretense and hypocrisy. That is what the false apostles do, who pretend
one thing outwardly, but do something else inwardly in the heart: &#8220;Dissemblers and crafty men
provoke the wrath of God&#8221; (Job 36:13, Vulgate).  Evil is avoided in doctrine when the Lord&#8217;s
word is proposed in the proper way. In regard to this he says, or to tamper with God&#8217;s word. This
is explained in two ways. First, not mixing false doctrine with the doctrine of Christ, as the false
apostles do when they teach that the ceremonies of the Law must be observed along with the
Gospel. Secondly, not preaching for gain and for one&#8217;s own glory. The first of these is a wolf and
the second a hireling, but one who preaches the truth and for the glory of God is a shepherd.
Hence Augustine says: &#8220;The shepherd should be loved and the wolf avoided, but the hireling
must be tolerated for the present.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">120. &#8211; But because perfect justice requires more than avoiding evil, but doing good, he says
something about doing good in the exercise of this ministry. The first good is against evil
teachings; the second against evil conduct; the third against an evil intention.  Against evil
teaching, which must be avoided, they perform the good of manifesting the truth. In regard to this
he says, by the open statement of the truth: as if to say, we do not lose heart but, avoiding evil,
we walk and act in the manifestation of the truth, i.e., we manifest the pure truth: &#8220;For this I have
come into the world, to bear witness to the truth&#8221; (Jn. 18:37); &#8220;Those who show me forth shall
have everlasting life&#8221; (Sir. 24:31, Vulgate).  Against evil conduct they perform good works. In
regard to this he says, we would commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience. We do not do
this by saying good things about ourselves, because it is not easy to believe a person who
recommends himself, but by doing good, because we do such works, so that by the works
themselves we make ourselves commendable to every man&#8217;s conscience: &#8220;Maintain good
conduct among the Gentiles&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:12).  Against an evil intention we do good by making
ourselves commendable not only to every man&#8217;s conscience, but even in the sight of God, who
sees the heart.: &#8220;For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom
the Lord commends&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:18); &#8220;Providing good things not only before God but before all
men&#8221; (Rom. 12:17, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">121. &#8211; According to Augustine in a Gloss, the Apostle fulfills God&#8217;s commandment in this: &#8220;Let
your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father
who is in heaven&#8221; (Matt. 5:16); &#8220;Beware of practicing your piety before men&#8221; (Matt. 6:1): the
first by saying, we would commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience; but the second by
saying, in the sight of God: &#8220;For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly&#8221; (Rom. 2:28).  Or this
whole passage can be read in the following manner without interrupting the text: Therefore,
having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart, namely in doing good. But we
have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. Furthermore by the open statement of the truth,
keeping the same method of explanation as already given.</p>

In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to
keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the
likeness of God. 5 For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord,
with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#8217; sake. 6 For it is the God who said, &#8220;Let
light shine out of darkness,&#8221; who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">122. &#8211; Here the Apostle answers a tacit objection. For someone could say to him: you say that
you do not grow faint in manifesting the truth of Christ. But this does not seem true, because
many people contradict you. To this question, therefore, he responds. And in regard to it he does
two things: first, he responds to this question; secondly, he removes a doubt which seems to
follow from his answer (v. 5). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows from
whom Christ&#8217;s truth is hidden; secondly, the reason for this hiding (v. 4); thirdly, he shows that
it is not due to a deficiency in the truth of the Gospel that it is hidden (v. 4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">123. &#8211; He says therefore: I have said that we do not faint in manifesting the truth; but even if our
gospel, which we preach, is veiled, it is not veiled from all, but it is veiled only to those who are
perishing, namely, who offer an obstacle to its manifestation to them: &#8220;For the word of the cross
is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God&#8221; (1 Cor.
1:18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">124. &#8211; The cause of this concealment is not on the part of the Gospel, but on account of their own
guilt and malice; and this is what he adds: in their case the god of this world has blinded the
minds of the unbelievers. This can be explained in three ways: in one way so that the god of this
world, i.e. God, who is the Lord of this world and of all things by creation and nature: &#8220;The earth
is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein&#8221; (Ps. 24:1), has
blinded the minds of the unbelievers, not by producing malice, but by the merit, or rather demerit
of preceding sins, by withdrawing his grace: &#8220;Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their hearts, and turn and be healed&#8221; (Is. 6:10). Therefore he hints at their preceding sins
when he says, of unbelievers, as though their unbelief is the cause of this blindness.  In a second
way, so that the god of this world, i.e., the devil, who is called the god of this world, i.e., of those
who live in a worldly manner, not by reason of creation but by imitation, because worldly persons
imitate him: &#8220;They follow him that are on his side&#8221; (Wis. 2:25, Vulgate). Here he blinds them
by suggesting, by attracting and by inclining to sins. And so, when they are already in sin, they
work in the darkness of sin, lest they see: &#8220;Darkened in their understanding, alienated from the
life of God&#8221; (Eph. 4:18).  In the third way thus: God has the nature of the ultimate end and
fulfillment of the desires of every creature. Hence, whatever a person assigns to himself as an
ultimate end in which his desire rests, can be called his god. Hence, when you have pleasure as
end, pleasure is called your god, and the same for pleasures of the flesh and for honors. Then it
is explained so that the god of this world, i.e., that which men living in a worldly way set up as
their end, say pleasure or riches and the like. And God blinds their minds, inasmuch as he
prevents them from seeing the light of grace here, and the light of glory in the future: &#8220;Fire&#8221;,
namely of concupiscence, &#8220;has fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun&#8221; (Ps. 57:9, Vulgate).
Thus, therefore, the blindness of unbelievers is not on the part of the Gospel, but from the sin of
unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">125. &#8211; Therefore, he adds, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.
Here it should be noted that God the Father is the source of all light: &#8220;God is light and in him is
no darkness at all&#8221; (1 Jn. 1:5). From this fountain of light is derived the image of this light,
namely the Son, the Word of God: &#8220;He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his
nature&#8221; (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, this brightness of glory and image of the fountain of light took our
flesh and accomplished many glorious and divine works in this world. The disclosing of this light
is the Gospel. Hence, the Gospel is also called the knowledge of the glory of Christ, which
knowledge has the power to enlighten: &#8220;Wisdom is radiant and unfading&#8221; (Wis. 6:12). As far as
it is concerned, it shines upon all and enlightens all. But those who place an obstacle are not
enlightened. And this is what he says: the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelievers, to keep them from seeing, namely, with their unbelieving minds, the light of the
gospel, which enlightens because it is the glory of Christ, i.e. his brightness: &#8220;We have beheld
his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father&#8221; (Jn. 1:14). This glory is Christ&#8217;s, inasmuch
as he is the likeness [image] of God: &#8220;He is the image of the invisible God&#8221; (Col. 1:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">126. &#8211; Note, according to a Gloss, that Christ is the most perfect image of God. For in order that
something be perfectly an image of something, three things are necessary, and these three are
perfectly in Christ. First, a likeness; second, origin; third, perfect equality. For if there is
unlikeness between the image and that of which it is the image, and one does not arise from the
other, or even if there is not perfect equality according to the same nature, then the notion of
perfect image would not be there. For the likeness of a king on a coin is not called a perfect
image of the king, because equality according to the same nature is lacking; but the likeness of
a king in his son is called a perfect image of the king, because it possesses the three marks
mentioned  Therefore, since those three are present in Christ, the Son of God, because namely
he is similar to the Father, arises from the Father and is equal to the Father, he is in the highest
degree and perfectly called the image of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">127. &#8211; Then when he says, For what we preach is not ourselves, the Apostle settles a doubt. For
some could say to the Apostle, contrary to what was said here: above you said that your Gospel
was hidden; now you say that the Gospel of Christ enlightens. Therefore, if it is granted that the
Gospel of Christ enlightens, it cannot follow that your Gospel is hidden. To settle this he does
two things. First he shows that his own Gospel and Christ&#8217;s are the same; secondly, he shows
how it is that his own Gospel enlightens (v. 6)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">128. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that the manifestation of the brightness of Christ is the Gospel
of Christ and our Gospel. It is ours as preached by us; it is Christ&#8217;s truly as the one preached in
the Gospel. Hence it is that what we preach is not ourselves, i.e., we do not commend ourselves
nor for ourselves, i.e., we do not use our preaching for our praise or gain, but we refer it all to
Christ and his praise: &#8220;We preach Christ crucified&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:23); &#8220;That I may tell of all your
works,&#8221; not mine, &#8220;in the gates of the daughter of Zion&#8221; (Ps. 73:28).  But Jesus Christ as Lord,
with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#8217; sake. As if to say: we preach Jesus as Lord, but
ourselves as servants, the reason being that we principally seek the praise of Christ and not our
own. For a servant is one who exists for the profit of the master. That is why a minister of the
Church, who does not seek the honor of God and the welfare of his subjects, is not a true ruler,
but a tyrant. For whoever rules well should be as a servant seeking the honor and profit of his
subjects: &#8220;The elder shall serve the younger&#8221; (Gen. 25:23); &#8220;For though I am free from all men,
I have made myself a slave to all&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">129. &#8211; Then when he says, For it is the God who said, he shows the source of his Gospel&#8217;s power
to enlighten. Here we should note the order of the Apostle&#8217;s procedure. It is this: at one time,
namely, before being converted to Christ, we were darkness, just as you and the others, upon
whom the brightness of Christ&#8217;s glory did not shine. But now, after Christ has called us to
himself by his grace, that darkness has been taken away from us, and now the power of the glory
of Christ&#8217;s brightness shines in us, and it shines on us in such a way that not only are we
enlightened so that we can see, but we enlighten others. Therefore, from the spiritual grace and
abundant splendor of the brightness of the glory of Christ in us, our Gospel has the power to
enlighten.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">130. &#8211; And this is what he says: I say that our Gospel enlightens, for it is the God who said, i.e.,
who made by a single command, let light shine out of darkness, by separating the elements, when
he enlightened the dark chaos by the light he made: &#8220;He said, &#8216;let there be light&#8217;&#8221; (Gen. 1:3): &#8220;I
made an unfailing light to rise in the heavens&#8221; (Sir 24:6). He, I say, has shone in our hearts, i.e.,
in our minds, previously darkened by the absence of the light of grace and by the obscurity of sin:
&#8220;To enlighten those that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death&#8221; (Lk. 1:79).  He has shone,
I say, not only to enlighten us, but to give the light, i.e., that we might enlighten others: &#8220;To me,
though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given&#8221; (Eph. 3:8); &#8220;You are the light
of the world&#8221; (Matt. 5:4). To give the light, I say, of the knowledge, i.e., that we make others
know of the glory of God, i.e., of the clear vision of God, in the face of Christ. A Gloss: i.e.,
&#8220;through Jesus Christ&#8221;, who is the face of the Father, because without him the Father is not
known. But it is said better thus: to illumine the holy brightness of God, which indeed shines in
the face of Jesus Christ, i.e., so that by that glory and brightness Jesus Christ may be known. As
if to say: in summary, God has shone upon us to enlighten us, so that Jesus Christ may be known
and preached among the Gentiles.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent

crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken;
struck down, but not destroyed; 10 always carrying in the body the death of Jesus,
so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">131. &#8211; Above, he discussed the use of the ministry of the New Testament in regard to doing good;
here he discusses its use in regard to enduring evil. In regard to this he does two things: first, he
points to the endurance of the evils they suffered; secondly, he explains this (v. 11). In regard to
the first he does three things: first, he shows the reason why they are exposed to tribulations by
God; secondly, he shows that they should act patiently under these tribulations (v. 8); thirdly, he
gives the reason for this patience (v. 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">132. &#8211; He says, therefore: God has shone on our minds to give light to others, and this light is our
greatest treasure: &#8220;It is an unfailing treasure for men&#8221; (Wis. 7:14); &#8220;Abundance of salvation,
wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (Is. 33:6). But we do not have that greatest treasure in a precious place,
but in a lowly fragile thing, in order that its power may be attributed to God. Hence, he says, We
have this treasure, i.e., that light by which we enlighten others, in earthen vessels, i.e., in our frail
and lowly body: &#8220;For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust&#8221; (Ps. 103:14); &#8220;Like
the clay in the potter&#8217;s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel&#8221; (Jer. 18:6); &#8220;Yet, O Lord,
you are our Father, we are the clay&#8221; (Is. 64:8).  Therefore we have it in earthen vessels to show
that the transcendent power of that light belongs to God, i.e., attributed to God, and not believed
to belong to us. For if we were rich or powerful or noble according to the flesh, any great good
we did would be attributed not to God but to ourselves. But now, because we are poor and
contemptible, such excellence is attributed to God and not to ourselves. Therefore, God wants
us to be held in contempt and to be exposed to tribulations: &#8220;Lest they should say, &#8216;Our hand is
triumphant, the Lord has not wrought all this&#8217;&#8221; (Deut. 32:27); &#8220;That no human being might boast
in the presence of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:29); &#8220;You sent them as your forerunners not to speak&#8221; (Wis.
12:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">133. &#8211; Then when he says, we are afflicted in every way, he shows their patience in the things
they suffer. In regard to this he does two things: first, he points out the evils they suffer in
general; secondly, he mentions them in particular (v. 8b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">134. &#8211; He says, therefore: truly we have this treasure in earthen vessels, because we are afflicted
in every way. As if to say: no type of tribulation has missed us: &#8220;Through many tribulations we
must enter the kingdom of God&#8221; (Ac. 14:22). Nor is this strange, for it says in Luke (24:26):
&#8220;Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221; And
although we suffer in this way, we are not crushed. He speaks as a traveler who becomes
distressed, when he cannot find a way out of a narrow place. As if to say: men who trust only in
the world are distressed, if they are troubled on all sides by the world, because no way of relief
is open to them, since they trust only in the world. But we, although we are troubled in the world,
yet because we trust in God and hope in Christ, escape by the help of God. That is why we are
not distressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">135. &#8211; Then when he says, perplexed, but not driven to despair, he lists the tribulations in
particular. Now there are four things by which men are wont to be troubled; and the apostles were
also troubled by them, namely, by external things, by the disquiet of their state, by injury to their
reputation, and by affliction of their body.  Therefore, in regard to the first he says, we are
perplexed, i.e., impoverished. As if to say: we are so poor that we lack necessities: &#8220;To the
present hour we hunger and thirst&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:11). But we are not driven to despair, i.e.,
abandoned by God, who is our treasure. For riches are no sought for their own sake, but for a
sufficiency of life. Hence, men who live without God&#8217;s help and without hope, are destitute, if
they lack riches. But those who trust and hope in God alone, no matter how perplexed they be,
are not destitute: &#8220;As having nothing and possessing everything&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:10).  But this is not
all, for along with this we are disquieted: persecuted, namely, from place to place: &#8220;When they
persecute you in one town, flee to the next&#8221; (Matt. 10:23), but not forsaken by God, because he
offers help: &#8220;I will never fail you nor forsake you&#8221; (Heb. 13:5): &#8220;You, O Lord, have not forsaken
those who seek you&#8221; (Ps. 9:10).  Along with this we are injured in our reputation, because we are
humiliated, i.e., scorned and regarded as nothing: &#8220;The hour is coming when whoever kills you
will think he is offering service to God&#8221; (Jn. 16:2); &#8220;Blessed are you when men hate you&#8221; (Lk.
6:22). But because when a man is scorned and there is reason for it, the scorned one is usually
ashamed. But when there is not cause, he is not ashamed. And there was no reason for their being
scorned, hence he continues, but not ashamed. As if to say: since there is no reason, we do not
care: &#8220;In you, O Lord, have I hoped; let me never be put to shame&#8221; (Ps. 31:2).  But as though
these were trifles, he adds to the amount of tribulation, saying: struck down into the dangers of
death, but not destroyed, i.e., we do not cease doing good; or we are not destroyed because God
sustains us: &#8220;We have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all
things&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:13); &#8220;When you shall think yourself consumed, you shall rise as the daystar&#8221;
(Job 11:17, Vulgate); &#8220;We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#8221; (Ps. 44:22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">136. &#8211; Then when he says, always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, he gives the reason for
this patience. Here it should be noted that in Christ the process was this: having from the
beginning of his conception a flesh that could suffer, he both suffered and died, yet within he was
leading a spiritual life. But after the resurrection that spiritual and glorious life flowed into the
body, so that his body became glorious and immortal, because &#8220;Christ being raised from the dead
will never die again&#8221; (Rom. 6:9). Hence we can think of two states in the body of Christ, namely,
of death and of glory. Hence, he says that we endure the perils of death and suffering patiently,
in order to attain to the glorious life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">137. &#8211; And this is what he says: always carrying, i.e., in all things and everywhere, the death of
Jesus, i.e., for Jesus, or in the likeness of Jesus&#8217; death: &#8220;I bear on my body the marks of Jesus&#8221;
(Gal. 6:19), because we have suffered for the truth, as Jesus did. In our body, not only in our
mind: &#8220;For your sake we are slain all the day long&#8221; (Ps. 44:23). That the life of Jesus, i.e., the life
of grace which Jesus gives, or the life of glory which Jesus reached by his sufferings: &#8220;Was it not
necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?&#8221; (Lk. 24:26), may
also be manifested, i.e., be evident even to enemies.  He says therefore, in the future, namely, in
the resurrection, or even now the life of grace, in our bodies, and not only in our souls: &#8220;When
they had broken the wine jars, the lamps appeared&#8221; (cf. Jdg. 7:20). Therefore Ambrose says:
&#8220;They did not fear to die on account of the promised resurrection.&#8221; Bearing about, i.e., carrying
it about and enduring, because wherever we go, we suffer and do not give up. And this so that
the life of Jesus, which is now hidden in our hearts, may be manifested in our bodies, namely,
when &#8220;He will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body&#8221; (Phil. 3:21); &#8220;You have died
and your life is hid with Christ in God&#8221; (Col. 3:3); &#8220;If we die with him, we shall also live with
him&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:11).</p>

that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with
you into his presence. 15 For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to
more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">138. &#8211; Having mentioned the patience of the apostles in the midst of evils, and revealed the cause
of their patience, the Apostle now explains them. First, he explains what he said about the hope
of glory; secondly, what he said about his own patience (v. 16). In regard to the first he does two
things. First, he shows the hope of glory that he has; secondly, he shows the source of this hope
(v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">139. &#8211; In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows how he bears the mortification
of Jesus in his body; secondly, how he bears the life of Jesus (v. 11b); thirdly, what he and others
have obtained from this (v. 12).  He says therefore: I say that we bear the death of Jesus in our
bodies; not that we might die, but because while we live with bodily life or powers, we are
always being given up to death or dangers of death; and this for Jesus&#8217; sake: &#8220;We are accounted
as sheep for the slaughter&#8221; (Ps. 44:22). But how we carry the life of Jesus in our body is
explained when he says, so that the immortal and incorruptible life of Jesus may be manifested
in our now mortal flesh, so that our mortal flesh may put on immortality at the resurrection: &#8220;This
mortal nature must put on immortality&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:53).  What results from this is mentioned
when he continues, so death is at work, i.e., exercises its sway, in us, but life, namely, the present
one, works in you, because you live in prosperity: &#8220;We are fools for Christ&#8217;s sake, but you are
wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:10). And death works in us a great
good, namely, the attainment of spiritual life: &#8220;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of
his saints&#8221; (Ps. 116:15). But the earthly life that you love works in you a great evil, namely,
eternal death: &#8220;The wage of the righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin&#8221; (Prov.
10:16): &#8220;He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for
eternal life&#8221; (Jn. 12:25).  Or another way: there were two things in Christ, namely, bodily death
and spiritual life. He says therefore, so death is at work in us. As if to say: not only does spiritual
life work in us, inasmuch as we imitate him spiritually, but death is at work, i.e., because of the
hope of the resurrection and for the love of Christ, the marks of Christ&#8217;s death appear in us,
inasmuch as we are exposed to the sufferings of death: &#8220;For your sake we are slain all the day
long&#8221; (Ps. 44:22). But in you, only the life of Christ works, through which faith and the spiritual
life are planted in you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">140. &#8211; Then (v. 13) the Apostle shows how he acquired this hope of certainty. In regard to this
he does two things. First, he states the cause of the certainty; secondly, he concludes to the
certainty itself (v. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">141. &#8211; Now the cause of this certainty is the Spirit instilling faith into their hearts. First, therefore,
he mentions this cause; secondly, he explains it with an example (v. 13b).  He says therefore: the
reason we hope and do not faint is that we have the same spirit of faith which the ancients had,
because although the times have changed, the Spirit and the faith have not changed, except that
they believed that the Christ would come and suffer, whereas we believe that he has already come
and suffered. And this Spirit is the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of faith: &#8220;All these are inspired
by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:11).
Having, therefore, this Spirit that the ancients had, we do the same things as they did and we
believe. But what they did is described in Ps. 116:20, &#8220;I have believed&#8221;, namely, God perfectly.
And this is what the ancients did: &#8220;And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not
receive what was promised&#8221; (Heb. 11:39). And so, namely, for believing, I spoke, i.e., I
confessed the faith: &#8220;For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with
his lips and so is saved&#8221; (Rom. 10:10). But we do this because, since we believe, we speak and
confess the faith and preach: &#8220;We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard&#8221; (Ac. 4:20).
Therefore the Holy Spirit is the cause of this certitude.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">142. &#8211; Finally, therefore, he reaches the intended conclusion, namely, the certitude itself. First,
in regard to his own salvation; secondly, in regard to the salvation of others (v. 14b).  He says
therefore, knowing, i.e., having certain knowledge, that he who raised Jesus, i.e., God the Father
or the entire Trinity, will raise us also with Jesus, namely, to put on the same glory as Jesus,
because since we are his members, we should be with the head: &#8220;Where I am, there shall my
servant be also&#8221; (Jn. 12:26); &#8220;He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your
mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you&#8221; (Rom. 8:11).  And I am certain not
only of our salvation but of yours also, because he will bring us with you, i.e., we will be
together. For just as we are members of Christ, so you are also through us: &#8220;And so we shall
always be with the Lord&#8221; (1 Th. 4:17); &#8220;Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered
together&#8221; (Matt. 24:28).  Therefore he says, with you, to urge them to good, inasmuch as he
shows that they are not inferiors but equals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">143. &#8211; And well can I say this with certainty, because all things are for your benefit. For all
things, the sufferings we endure, the graces we receive from God, are for your sake, namely, that
you be instructed by our example. And this, therefore, so that as grace extends from us, in you
to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God, i.e., that many may
thank God for so great a favor: &#8220;Always and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ to God the Father&#8221; (Eph. 5:20).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="45"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">4-5</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner
nature is being renewed every day. 17 For this slight momentary affliction is
preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, 18 because we
look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things
that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">144. &#8211; Having mentioned the patience which the Apostle showed in tribulations and manifested
the reward they expected, he then treats of the cause of patience and the mode or reason for
patience. In regard to this he does three things. First, he hints at the patience of the saints;
secondly, the cause of patience (v. 16b); thirdly, the reward of patience (v. 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">145. &#8211; In regard to the first he intends to show that the patience of the saints is unconquerable.
Hence, he says, so, i.e., because we know that he who raised Jesus from the dead will raise us and
place us with you; therefore we do not lose heart, namely, in our tribulations, i.e., we are reduced
to the state in which we cannot bear and endure more for Christ. For to lose heart is the same as
not being able to bear: &#8220;I was wearied, not being able to bear it&#8221; (Jer. 20:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">146. &#8211; But the reason why we do not fail is that although we fail as to the outward man, we are
always renewed as to the inward man. Hence, he says, though our outer nature is wasting away,
our inner nature is being renewed every day.  Here it should be noted that by occasion of these
words a certain heretic, Tertullian by name, said that the rational soul, which is in the body of a
man, has a bodily shape and bodily members, just as the body has; and this is called the inward
man. This, of course, is false. Hence, to understand the passage, it must be known that even
according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 9.9, and according to the way we speak, each thing is said
to be that which is most important in it. For example, the most important thing in the city is the
power and the council, so that whatever the power and council do, the city is said to do. Now
something can be judged the most important thing in man either in truth or according to
appearance. In truth the most important thing in man is the mind. Hence, according to the
judgment of spiritual men, the mind is called the inward man. But according to appearance, the
most important thing is the outward body with its senses. Hence, according to the judgment of
those who consider only bodily and sense-perceptible things and savor earthly things, and whose
god is the belly, the body with the sense is called the outward man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">147. &#8211; Therefore, it is according to this manner that the Apostle is speaking here when he says,
though our outer nature, i.e., the body with its sentient nature, is wasting away, in tribulations,
fasts, abstinences and watchings: &#8220;Our old self was crucified with him&#8221; (Rom. 6:6); &#8220;Rottenness
enters into my bones&#8221; (Hab. 3:16), yes this man, who is inner, namely, the mind or reason
strengthened with the shield of faith, is being renewed. This should be understood in the
following way: oldness is the road to corruption: &#8220;And what is becoming obsolete and growing
old is ready to vanish away&#8221; (Heb. 8:13). But human nature was established in wholeness, and
if it had continued in that wholeness, it would have always been new. But through sin it began
to be corrupted. As a result, whatever followed, such as ignorance, difficulty in doing good,
inclination to evil, punishment, and so on, all pertain to oldness. Therefore, when such a human
nature gets rid of the results of sin, it is said to be renewed. Such riddance begins in the saints
here, but is perfectly completed in heaven. For here the oldness of sin is put off; for the spirit
removes the oldness of sin and is subjected to the newness of justice. Here the intellect removes
errors and assumes the newness of truth. It is according to this that the inner man, namely, the
soul, is renewed: &#8220;Be renewed in the spirit of your minds&#8221; (Eph. 4:23). But in heaven, even the
oldness of punishment is removed. Hence, there will be a complete renewal there: &#8220;Your youth
is renewed like the eagle&#8217;s&#8221; (Ps. 103:5). But because the saints advance daily in purity of
conscience and knowledge of divine things, he says, every day: &#8220;Ascending in his heart&#8221; (Ps.
84:7, Vulgate). Consequently, patience is unconquerable, because it is renewed from day to day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">148. &#8211; The third point, namely, the cause of this patience, is recognition of a reward. This
recognition is most efficacious, because, according to Gregory, it lessens the force of a scourge.
And this is what he says: For this [present], slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an
eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison. As if to say: the tribulations we suffer here are
nothing, if we look to the glory we obtain from them. Hence, he compares the condition of the
saints in this life to the condition of those in heaven and mentions five things in each state that
correspond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">149. &#8211; First, the condition of the present life in the saints is of itself slight and, as it were,
imperceptible. Hence, he says, this, i.e., the least: &#8220;For a brief moment I forsook you&#8221; (Is. 54:7).
Likewise it is transitory; hence he says, present, i.e., in this life, which is one of affliction and
toil: &#8220;The life of man is warfare&#8221; (Job 7:1, Vulgate). Likewise it lasts a short time; hence he says,
momentary: &#8220;For a moment I hid my face from you&#8221; (Is. 54:8). For the whole time of this present
life compared to eternity is only momentary. Likewise it is light; hence he says, slight. For
although he said above (1:8): &#8220;We were crushed,&#8221; because the body is heavy, yet it is very light
to a spirit on fire with charity. Hence Augustine says: &#8220;All that is heavy and huge love makes
easy and almost nothing.&#8221; Likewise it is penal; hence he says, [of our] affliction: &#8220;I will bear the
indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him&#8221; (Mic. 7:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">150. &#8211; But as to the state of happiness, he lays down five things, because in contrast to what is
this, he places beyond all measure: &#8220;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not
worth comparing to the glory that is to be revealed to us&#8221; (Rom. 8:18).  But on the other hand:
&#8220;He will give to each one according to his works&#8221; (Matt. 16:27). Therefore it will not be beyond
all measure. I answer that the word &#8220;according&#8221; does not denote an equality of amount, as though
a person will be rewarded so much for so much merit, but an equality of proportion, so that one
who merits more will receive more reward.  Likewise, against that which is in the present he
places exceedingly, i.e., in an excellent state without disturbance: &#8220;I will make you ride upon the
heights of the earth&#8221; (Is. 58:14). Against that which is momentary, he places eternal: &#8220;Everlasting
joy shall be upon their heads&#8221; (Is. 35:10). Against that which is light he places a weight. He says,
weight for two reasons: first, because a weight inclines and draws to its motion all things under
it. In the same way eternal glory will be so great that it will make the whole man glorious in soul
and in body. There will be nothing in man that does not follow the impulse of glory. Or it is
called weight, because it is precious, for only precious things are weighed.  Against that which
is called tribulation he places of glory. Or of glory can be common to the other four, which are
said of the state of glory, so that of tribulation is common to the four which are said of the present
life.  It is preparing, namely, above the tribulations we suffer, for these are the cause and merit
for which God confers that glory on us. And so the patience of the saints is unconquerable, their
reward ineffable, and the recompense of their reward right and delightful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">151. &#8211; Hence he says, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are
unseen. As if to say: although the things we hope for are still to come, and in the meantime our
body is corrupted, nevertheless, we are renewed, because we do not pay attention to those
temporal things, but to eternal. And this is what he says: it works in us a weight of glory. In us,
I say, not looking, i.e., not paying attention, to the things that are seen, i.e., earthly things, but to
the things that are unseen, namely, heavenly things: &#8220;Forgetting what lies behind and straining
forward to what lies ahead&#8221; (Phil. 3:13); &#8220;Eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor the heart of man
conceived, God has prepared for those who love him&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:9).  And why do we look on
heavenly things? Because the things that are seen, i.e., earthly things, are transient and temporal,
but the things that are unseen, namely, heavenly things, are eternal: &#8220;My salvation will be
forever&#8221; (Is. 51:6).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building
from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 Here indeed we
groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling, 3 so that by putting it on we may
not be found naked. 4 For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety; not
that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what
is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">152. &#8211; After commending the ministry of the New Testament, both as to its dignity and its use,
the Apostle now commends it as to its reward. For although he had already said something about
the reward, it was partial and incomplete; so now he deals with it at greater length. In regard to
this he does three things: first, he treats of the reward; secondly, of the preparation for and
reception of the reward (v. 9); thirdly, the cause of each, namely, of the preparation and of the
reward that is expected (v. 18). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the
reward expected; secondly, he expresses a desire for the expected reward (v. 2)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">153. &#8211; Since the awaited reward is inestimable, namely, of heavenly glory, he says, For we know.
As if to say according to a Gloss [Lombard]: indeed he works in us a weight of glory, because
this glory will be not only in our souls, but in our bodies. For, i.e., because we know, i.e., are
certain, because we already have it in hope, that if our earthly tent, i.e., the body.  For as has been
said, man is called a mind, since that is the most important thing in man. Now this mind is to the
body as a man is to a house. For just as the man living in a house is not destroyed, when the
house is destroyed, but he continues to exist, so when the body is destroyed, the mind, i.e., the
rational soul, is not destroyed, but continues to exist. The body, therefore, is called the earthly
tent we live in: &#8220;Those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are
crushed before the moth&#8221; (Job 4:19). Is Destroyed, i.e., dissolved. We know, I say, we have a
building from God, i.e., prepared by God; a building, I say, a house not made with hands, i.e., not
a work of man or of nature, but an incorruptible body, which we shall assume. It is not made with
hands, because incorruptibility in our bodies is the result of a divine action alone: &#8220;He will
change our lowly body to be like his glorious body&#8221; (Phil. 3:21). Eternal in the heavens, i.e., a
house prepared for us from all eternity: &#8220;A tabernacle that shall never be destroyed in heaven&#8221;
(Is. 33:20, Vulgate); &#8220;Your reward shall be great in heaven&#8221; (Matt. 5:12). This exchange, namely,
to get a heavenly home for an earthly one, is what Job desired: &#8220;All the days of my service I
would wait, till my release should come&#8221; (Job 14:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">154. &#8211; The explanation is based on a Gloss, but it does not agree with the Apostle&#8217;s meaning, nor
with what preceded and what follows. For when he is dealing with one continuous subject, he
does not interject another. Therefore, let us see what the Apostle really means, for he wants to
show that the saints are reasonable in enduring the tribulations by which the present life is
destroyed, because this results in obtaining glory at once, and not a glorified body, as the Gloss
says. Therefore he says: the reason we endure these things is that we know, i.e., we hold it as
certain, that if the earthly tent we live in, i.e., the body, is destroyed, i.e., corrupted by death, we
have at once, not in hope but in reality, a better house, namely, a building, a house not made with
hands, i.e., heavenly glory, not a glorified body. Of this house it says in John (14:2): &#8220;In my
Father&#8217;s house are many rooms.&#8221; This house is from God, not made with hands, because eternal
glory is God himself: &#8220;Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me&#8221; (Ps. 31:2), and
eternal in the literal sense, because it is the eternal God. In the heavens, i.e., on high, because as
soon as the body is dead, the holy soul obtains this glory, not in hope but in reality. For thus even
before the body is dissolved, we have this home in hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">155. &#8211; Thus, the reward of the saints is wonderful and desirable, because it is heavenly glory.
Hence, he links the desire of the saints with this reward, saying: Here indeed we groan, and long
to put on our heavenly dwelling. Here he does three things. First, he expresses the desire of grace
for its reward; secondly, he shows that the desire of grace is retarded by the desire of nature (v.
4); thirdly, he shows that the desire of grace overcomes the desire of nature (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">156. &#8211; The desire of grace is fervent: Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly
dwelling. As if to say: this is the real proof that we have a house not made with hands, because
if the desire of nature is not in vain, much less is the desire of grace in vain. Therefore, since we
have a most fervent desire of grace for heavenly glory, it is impossible for it to be in vain; and
this is what he says, we groan, i.e., groaning we desire, namely with our soul&#8217;s desire that we are
delayed: &#8220;Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech&#8221; (Ps. 120:5). We groan, I say, and long to put on
our dwelling, i.e., the enjoyment of glory, which is from heaven, i.e., heavenly. It is called a
dwelling because the saints dwell in that glory as their place of consolation: &#8220;Enter into the joy
of the Lord&#8221; (Matt. 25:21). In saying, to put on, he is stating that the heavenly home of which he
spoke above is not something separated from man, but something inhering in him. For a man is
not said to put on a house, but clothes, but he inhabits a house. In this way he shows that the
desire is for something that inheres, because it is put on, and something which contains and
exceeds because it is inhabited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">157. &#8211; But because he did not merely say, &#8220;put on&#8221; (indui), but &#8220;put on over&#8221; (superindui), he
gives the reason for this, when he says, so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. As
if to say: if the soul were to put on a heavenly dwelling, in such a way that the earthly dwelling
were not taken off, i.e., in such a way that our body were not dissolved by death, the attainment
of that heavenly dwelling would be &#8220;to be put on over&#8221;. But because it is necessary to be divested
of that earthly dwelling, if the heavenly is to be put on, it cannot be a &#8220;putting on over&#8221;, but
simply a &#8220;putting on.&#8221; Hence he says, so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. As if
to say: we would indeed be putting on over, if we were found clothed and not naked. For a naked
person is not said to be clothed over, but to be clothed.  But a Gloss [Lombard] explains it as a
spiritual dress, saying: &#8220;We desire to be clothed over, and this will indeed be done, but under this
condition, that we be found clothed, namely, with the virtues, and not naked, namely, of the
virtues.&#8221; Of this clothing it says in Colossians (3:12): &#8220;Put on then, as God&#8217;s chosen ones, holy
and beloved, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.&#8221; As if to say: no one will
attain to this glory, unless he has the virtues. But this explanation does not seem to agree with
the Apostle&#8217;s intention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">158. &#8211; Thus, therefore, the desire of grace burns for a reward, but it is retarded by the desire of
nature. He shows this when he says: For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety.
Herein, therefore, he first shows the condition of the natural desire; secondly, he shows that even
this condition of the natural desire is from God (v. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">159. &#8211; The condition of the desire is natural, delaying the desire of grace, because we would
prefer to be found clothed and not naked, i.e., we would prefer that the soul attain to glory
without the body&#8217;s being dissolved by death. The reason for this is that there is a natural desire
in the soul to be united to the body; otherwise, death would not be a punishment. And this is what
he says: For while we are still in this tent, i.e., who live in this mortal body: &#8220;Since I know that
the putting off of my body (tent) will be soon&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:14), we sigh, i.e., inwardly in the heart,
and not outwardly with our voice: &#8220;We moan and moan like doves&#8221; (Is. 59:11), because it is hard
to think of death, and yet burdened as with something against our desire, in that we cannot attain
to glory without the putting off of the body. This is so much against our natural desire that, as
Augustine says, not even old age itself could remove the fear of death from Peter. And so he says,
not that we would be unclothed, namely, of our earthly tent, but that we would be further clothed
with super-heavenly glory, or, according to a Gloss, with a glorified body. But because it could
seem unbecoming that the body, on the one hand should be corruptible of its very nature, if it had
not been dissolved before, and, on the other hand, glorified, he mentions the way in which he
would like this to happen, saying, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. As if to
say: we do not desire to be clothed over in such a way that the body remains mortal, but so that
the glory take away corruption altogether from the body without its dissolution. Hence he says,
so that what is mortal, i.e., the very corruption of the body, may be swallowed up by life, i.e.,
glory: &#8220;Death is swallowed up in victory&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:54).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit
as a guarantee. 6 So we are always of good courage; we know that while we are
at home in the body we are away from the Lord, 7 for we walk by faith, not by
sight. 8 We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and
at home with the Lord. 9 So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim
to please him. 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the
body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">160. &#8211; Here he discloses the author of the supernatural desire for a heavenly dwelling. For the
cause of a natural desire that we be not despoiled is that the soul is naturally united to the body,
and vice versa. But the desire to be clothed upon with a heavenly dwelling is not from nature but
from God. Hence, he says, he who has prepared us for this very thing is God. As if to say: we
wish to put on the heavenly dwelling, but in such a way as not to lose the earthly one. And yet
it is God who effects in us the desire to be thus clothed over: &#8220;God is at work in you, both to will
and to work for his good pleasure&#8221; (Phil. 2:13). The reason for this is that upon every nature
follows a desire suited to the end of that nature, as something heavy naturally tends downward
and seeks to rest there. But if a thing&#8217;s desire is above its nature, that thing is not moved to that
end naturally, but by something else, which is above its nature. Now it is evident that to enjoy
eternal glory and to see God by his essence, although it is appropriate to a rational creature, is
above its nature. Therefore, the rational creature is not moved to desire this by nature, but by God
himself, who prepared us for this very thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">161. &#8211; How this is accomplished he adds, saying, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee
[pledge]. In regard to this it should be noted that God produces natural desires and supernatural
desires in us: the natural, when he gives us a natural spirit suited to human nature: &#8220;God breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life&#8221; (Gen. 2:7); but he gives the supernatural desires when he
infuses in us the supernatural spirit, i.e., the Holy Spirit. Therefore he says, who has given us the
Spirit as a guarantee, i.e., the Holy Spirit producing in us the certainty of this thing, with which
we desire to be filled: &#8220;You were sealed with the Holy Spirit, which is the guarantee of our
inheritance&#8221; (Eph. 1:13-14). He says, pledge, because a pledge has as much value as the thing
for which it is given; but it differs from the thing for which it is given in this way, namely, that
the thing is possessed with a fuller right, when it is already had, than the pledge is. For the thing
is possessed as one&#8217;s own, but the pledge is kept and held as though giving assurance that the
thing will be possessed. So it is with the Holy Spirit: because the Holy Spirit has as much value
as heavenly glory. But there is a difference in the way he is possessed, because now we have him
as a surety of obtaining that glory; but in heaven we shall have him as something now possessed
by us. For then we shall have him perfectly, but now imperfectly. In this way, therefore, is grace&#8217;s
desire deferred by a natural desire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">162. &#8211; But is it hindered? No, but grace&#8217;s desire conquers. Hence, he says, so we are always of
good courage, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. As if
to say: there are two desires in holy men, one by which they desire a heavenly dwelling, the other
by which they do not wish to be despoiled. If these were compatible, they would not be contrary,
and one would not be delayed by the other. But the Apostle shows that they are incompatible and
that one must prevail over the other. In regard to this he does two three things: first, he shows the
incompatibility of these desires; secondly, he enters a proof (v. 7); thirdly, he shows which of
them conquers (v. 8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">163. &#8211;He shows their incompatibility when he says, so we are always of good courage [always
daring], knowing that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. Properly
speaking, to dare is to involve oneself in dangers of death and not to yield through fear. But
although the saints naturally fear death, yet they dare to face the dangers of death and not yield
because of a fear of death: &#8220;The righteous are bold as a lion&#8221; (Prov. 28:1); &#8220;In his days he feared
not the prince&#8221; (Sir. 48:13, Vulgate). Knowing this, namely, that he strengthens our boldness not
to fear death for Christ, that while we are at home in the body we are away, i.e., far away from
God: &#8220;Woe to me because my stay has been prolonged&#8221; (Ps. 120:5, Vulgate). We are absent
inasmuch as we are outside our native land, which is God. Otherwise, we would not be described
as away from him. And this is not from our nature, but from his grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">164. &#8211; That we are absent from the Lord is proved, when he says, for we walk by faith, i.e., we
pass through this life in faith, and not by sight: because faith deals with things not seen. For the
word of faith is as a lamp with which the road is lit in this life: &#8220;Your word is a lamp to my feet,
and a light for my steps&#8221; (Ps. 119:105). But in heaven there will be no such lamp, because the
radiance of God, i.e., God himself, has enlightened it (Rev. 21:23). Therefore, we shall then see
him by sight, i.e., in his essence. But he says, we walk by faith, because faith is concerned with
things unseen: &#8220;Faith is the substance of things hoped for; the conviction of things not seen&#8221;
(Heb. 11:1). But as long as the soul is united to the body, it does not see God in his essence: &#8220;No
man shall see me and live&#8221; (Ex. 33:20). Hence, inasmuch as we assent by believing the things
we do not see, we are said to walk by faith and not by sight. Thus, therefore, the incompatibility
of the two desires is plain, because we cannot, along with this body, be clothed over by the
heavenly habitation, the proof of this being that we walk by faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">165. &#8211; He follows with the victory of the one desire, namely, of grace, when he says, we are of
good courage and would rather be away from the body. This should be read as follows: knowing
what was said above, i.e., that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord [we
dare and have a good will]. He says two things: one implies the repugnance he has in willing, a
repugnance caused by the fear of death. For where there is no fear, there is no daring. For the fear
of death springs from our nature&#8217;s desire, but the daring of grace&#8217;s desire. Therefore, he says, we
dare. The other implies an imperfection of the soul in desiring, because unless we desired
properly, the fear of death would not be overcome, since it is quite natural. Therefore, it is not
only necessary to dare, but also to have a good will, i.e., to will gladly. For although, according
to the Philosopher, in the act of courage, joy is not required for the perfection of the virtue as it
is in the other virtues, but only not to be sad. Yet because the courage of the saints is more
perfect, they are not only not sad at the dangers of death, but they rejoice: &#8220;My desire is to depart
and be with Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:23). But what do we dare? Rather to be away from the body, i.e., to
be separated from the body by its dissolution, which is contrary to the desire of nature, and at
home with the Lord, i.e., to walk by sight, which is the desire of grace. He desired this who said
in Psalm 42 (v. 5): &#8220;My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">166. &#8211; Note that he concludes to the same two things he proposed at the beginning, namely, that
if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, which is the same as what he says here, namely, to be
away from the body; and that we have a building from God, not made with human hands, in
heaven, which is the same as being at home with the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">167. &#8211; By these words is refuted the error of those who say that the souls of dead saints are not
at once after death brought to the vision of God and into his presence, but they reside in mansions
until the day of judgment. For the saints dared and desired in vain to be away from the body, if
they would not be present to God when separated from the body. Therefore, the answer is that
the saints see the essence of God immediately after death and dwell in a heavenly mansion. Thus,
therefore, it is plain that the reward which the saints await is inestimable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">168. &#8211; He follows this with an account of the preparation for the reward which is accomplished
by the struggle against temptations and by exercising good works (v. 9). But the saints are
prepared for this reward in three ways. First, by pleasing God; secondly, by helping their
neighbor (v. 11); thirdly, by removing carnal affections from themselves (v. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">169. &#8211; They please God by resisting evil. Hence he says, so, namely, because our whole desire
is to be present with God, we contend, i.e., we make great effort, i.e., we strive and fight against
the temptations of the devil, the flesh and the world: &#8220;Strive to enter by the narrow gate&#8221; (Lk.
13:24). To please him, namely, God, with whom we desire to be present, whether we are at home
or away: because unless we strive to please him in this life, while we are absent, we shall not be
able to please him or be present with him in the other life: &#8220;There was one who pleased God and
was loved by him&#8221; (Wis. 4:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">170. &#8211; Then when he says, For we must all appear, he adds the cause for why the saints strive to
please God. This cause is taken from a consideration of the future judgment, when we must all
be manifested. Here the Apostle mentions five marks of the future judgment. The first is its
universality, because no one will be exempted from that judgment; hence he says, we must all,
i.e., all men, good and bad, great and small: &#8220;So each of us shall give account of himself to God&#8221;
(Rom. 14:12); &#8220;And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened&#8221; (Rev. 20:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">171. &#8211; But there are two objections against this. First, because it does not seem that unbelievers
will come to judgment, for one who does not believe has already been judged, as it says in John
(3:18). Secondly, because some will be there as judges: &#8220;You who have followed me will also
sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel&#8221; (Matt. 19:28). Therefore, not all will
be before the tribunal to be judged.  I answer that there are two things in a judgment, namely, a
discussion of merits, and as to this not all will be judged, because those who have completely
renounced Satan and all him pomps, and have clung to Christ in all things, will not be judged,
because they are gods already. But those who did not adhere to Christ in any way, neither by faith
nor works, will also not need discussion. But those who have something with Christ, namely,
faith, and in something have withdrawn from him, namely by evil works and wicked desires, will
be discussed as to the things they committed against Christ. Hence, as to this, only sinful
Christians will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ. But sentence will also be
pronounced during the judgment; and as to this, all will be manifested.  But it seems that children
will be exempt, because he says, so that each one may receive good or evil according to what he
has done in the body. But children have done nothing in the body. This is answered by a Gloss
[Lombard]: for they will not be judged for the things they did by themselves, but for the things
they did through others, when they believed or did not believe, were baptized or not baptized
through them. Or they will be condemned for the sin of their first parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">172. &#8211; Secondly, he mentions the certainty of the judgment. For in human judgment many can
be deceived, when they are judged evil, whereas they are good; or good, whereas they are evil.
The reason for this is that hearts are not manifest. But in that judgment there will be absolutely
perfect certainty, because there will be a manifestation of hearts. Hence, he says, be manifested:
&#8220;Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring
to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart&#8221; (1 Cor.
4:5).  Thirdly, he tells why the judgment will be necessary, because no one shall be able to escape
that judgment either by another&#8217;s intercession or by contumacy: &#8220;That you may know that there
is a judgment&#8221; (Job 19:29); &#8220;For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret
thing, whether good or evil&#8221; (Ec. 12:14).  Fourthly, he discloses the authority of the judge; hence,
he says, before the judgment seat [tribunal] of Christ, who will come to judge men in the same
form in which he was judged by men, so that appearing in human form, he may be seen by the
good and by the evil; for the wicked cannot see the glory of God: &#8220;And has given him authority
to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man&#8221; (Jn. 5:27). &#8220;Tribunal&#8221; implies juridical
power, and is taken from an ancient custom of the Romans, who chose three tribunes of the
people, whose function was to pass judgment on the excesses of consuls and senators. Their
places were called tribunals.  Fifthly, he speaks of the equity of the judge, because there will be
rewards or punishments according to one&#8217;s merits. Hence, he says, so that each one may receive
good or evil, according to what he has done: &#8220;He will render to each one according to his works&#8221;
(Rom. 2:5). He says, in the body, not only for things accomplished with bodily movement, but
for those accomplished by the mind; otherwise, unbelievers would not be punished. Therefore,
when he says, in the body, it is understood to mean things performed while he lived in the body.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are
is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. 12 We are not
commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to be proud of us, so
that you may be able to answer those who pride themselves on a man&#8217;s position
and not on his heart. 13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in
our right mind, it is for you. 14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we are
convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. 15 And he died for all,
that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their
sake died and was raised.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">173. &#8211; Having shown how the saints prepare themselves for the reward of eternal glory by
pleasing God, the Apostle now shows how they prepare themselves for this by helping their
neighbor. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows his own solicitude for the salvation
of his neighbor; secondly, he assigns the cause of this solicitude (v. 14). In regard to the first he
does three things. First, he mentions the care he has for the salvation of his neighbor by
persuading them; secondly, he excludes a false opinion (v. 12); thirdly, he shows that even in the
way he teaches he intends the welfare of his neighbor (v. 13). In regard to the first he does two
things. First, he mentions his zeal to benefit his neighbor; secondly, he explains this (v. 11b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">174. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that we must be manifested before the tribunal of Christ, and this
consideration induces men to fear the judgment. Hence, he says, therefore, knowing the fear of
the Lord, i.e., how purely and chastely the Lord Jesus should be feared, we persuade men to fear
and believe: &#8220;When I consider, I am in dread of him&#8221; (Job 23:15); &#8220;Who would not fear you, O
King of the nations&#8221; (Jer. 10:7); &#8220;But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him
be your fear, and let him be your dread&#8221; (Is. 8:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">175. &#8211; But because someone could say that it is not from a good conscience, but for his own
advantage that he persuades men, he shows that this is false by appealing to two testimonies,
namely, of God, when he says, but what we are is known to God, i.e., that he is speaking from
fear of God, for God sees the intention of our heart: &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately corrupt; who can understand it? I the LORD search the mind and try the heart&#8221; (Jer.
17:9-10); &#8220;For he himself knew what was in man&#8221; (Jn. 2:25). And by the testimony of their
consciences; hence he says, I hope it is known also to your conscience. Truly I hope, because I
have shown myself to you in such a way that you might know we are approved and might firmly
hold this, even though you do not admit it by mouth: &#8220;Commending ourselves to every man&#8217;s
conscience in the sight of God&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:2)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">176. &#8211; Then because they might suppose that the Apostle said this to commend himself, he
removes this false supposition, saying, we are not commending ourselves to you again, i.e., we
are not saying this for our commendation, as though trying to commend ourselves again. For
above (in chapter three and in 1 Corinthians 3) he said certain things for his commendation: &#8220;For
it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord
commends&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:18).  But we say this for your benefit. As if to say, but giving you cause
to be proud of us, i.e., matter for glorifying. For the false apostles took glory in elation, saying
that they were taught by the apostles, who were from the Lord, namely, by Peter and James, who
were pillars of the faith, thus detracting from the Apostle, as though he had not been with the
Lord Jesus, and wishing to destroy his teaching. Therefore, in order that the Corinthians, too,
might have something in which to glory against those false apostles, namely, the grace given to
the Apostle, so as to refute them and not be seduced by them, he said this. Hence, he continues,
so that you may be able to answer those, i.e., against them, or to those reprimanding, what you
can speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">177. &#8211; To them, I say, who pride themselves on a man&#8217;s position and not on his heart [who glory
in face and not in heart]. This can be explained in three ways. First, they glory in face, i.e., in the
external observances of the Law, because that is what they taught, and not in heart, i.e., in the
virtue of Christ, which is in the heart, unlike the Apostle, who in virtue of the cross of Christ,
said: &#8220;Far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (Gal. 6:14).
Likewise they glory in face, i.e., in the presence of men, as hypocrites do, and not in heart, i.e.,
in the testimony of conscience, as the Apostle says above (2 Cor. 1:12): &#8220;For our boast is this,
the testimony of our conscience.&#8221;  Or they glory in face, because they pretend some things
outwardly, which they do not feel in the heart, namely, that they claimed to have been instructed
by the apostles and were following their doctrine, which on the contrary they were trying to
destroy. It is clear, therefore, how the Apostle procured the salvation of his neighbor by teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">178. &#8211; Now we must see how he procured their salvation even in the way he taught. Hence he
says, for if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind [if we are sober],
it is for you. This is explained in two ways: in one way so that the Apostle calls himself
transported when he speaks to them by commending himself, and sober when he is not speaking
of his own commendation. According to this he is saying: no matter how we teach, it is either for
the honor of God or the benefit of his neighbor; for if we are beside ourselves, i.e., commend
ourselves, it is for God, i.e., for the honor of God or for observing God&#8217;s judgment; if we are in
our right mind [if we are sober], i.e., not saying great things about ourselves, this is for you, i.e.,
for your profit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">179. &#8211; But there is another and more literal sense. I say that we give you opportunity for glorying
in us, because in everything we do and even in the way we do it, we intend your good. Hence it
should be noted that the apostles were midway between God and the people: &#8220;While I stood
between the Lord and you at that time&#8221; (Deut. 5:5). Therefore, they were required to draw from
God whatever they poured out upon the people. Hence it was necessary that sometimes they
raised themselves to God by contemplation to obtain heavenly things, and sometimes conformed
themselves to the people to deliver what they had received from God; and all this tended to their
profit. Hence he says, for if we are beside ourselves, i.e., raised to the state of receiving gifts of
graces, and this in order to be united to God, which is done by means of temporal things: &#8220;I said
in my vision&#8221; (Ps. 116:11, Vulgate); Dionysius: &#8220;Divine love causes ecstasy.&#8221; If we are in our
right mind, i.e., adapt ourselves to you by delivering God&#8217;s precepts, it is for you, i.e., for your
benefit. This sobriety is not opposed to inebriation in wine, which brings wars on earth, but to
that inebriation which is from the Holy Spirit and draws men to divine things and about which
Song of Songs (5:1) says: &#8220;Eat, O friends, and drink: drink deeply, O lovers!&#8221; For that sobriety
is for the benefit of our neighbor, but the inebriation is for the love of God. Such a descent was
signified by the descent of the angels on the ladder which Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12): &#8220;You will see
heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man&#8221; (Jn.
1:51).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">180. &#8211; Then when he says, For the love of Christ, the Apostle indicates the cause of his
solicitude, namely, the love of Christ. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows that
he is pressed by the charity of Christ to procure the salvation of his neighbor; secondly, he
indicates the source from which the charity of Christ is kindled (v. 14b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">181. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that whether we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or whether we
be sober, it is for you, i.e., for your benefit. The reason for this is that the love of Christ controls
[presses] us to this. He says, presses, because it is the same as stimulates. As if to say: the love
of God, as a goad, stimulates us to do what charity commands, namely, to procure the salvation
of our neighbor: &#8220;Those who are led,&#8221; i.e., stirred, &#8220;by the Spirit of God are sons of God&#8221; (Rom.
8:14); &#8220;Its flashes are flashes of fire&#8221; (Song 8:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">182. &#8211; Then he indicates the cause of his solicitude, namely, the love of Christ, adding, because
we are convinced that one has died for all. First, he assigns the reason for this; secondly, he
explains it (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">183. &#8211; He says, therefore: I say that we do all things for you, because the love of Christ controls
us, because we are convinced that one, namely Christ, has died for all, then we ourselves should
so live, i.e., for your benefit, that we are even dead to ourselves, i.e., we care nothing about
ourselves, but about Christ and the things of Christ: &#8220;God shows his love for us&#8221; (Rom. 5:8);
&#8220;Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps&#8221; (1 Pet.
2:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">184. &#8211; What follows from this, namely, therefore all have died, is explained in three ways. First,
as if to say that all have died with the death of sin in Adam. For it would not have been necessary
for Christ to suffer for all, if all were not dead with the death of Adam&#8217;s sin: &#8220;For as in Adam all
die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:22). Secondly, as if to say: all have died,
namely, to the old life. For Christ died to remove sins; therefore, all should die to the old life,
namely, of sin, and live the life of justice: &#8220;The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the
life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God
in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Rom. 6:10-11). Thirdly, and more literally, all have died, i.e., each person
should regard himself as though dead to himself: &#8220;You have died and your life is hid with Christ
in God&#8221; (Col. 3:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">185. &#8211; He explains this interpretation when he says, and he died for all: &#8220;He died that we might
live to Christ&#8221; (see 2 Cor. 5:15; 1 Th. 5:10; 1 Jn. 4:9)). Hence he continues, that those who live
might live, namely, with a natural life, no longer for themselves, i.e., solely for themselves and
their own good, but for him who for their sake died and was raised, namely, for Christ, i.e., he
should direct his whole life to the service and honor of Christ: &#8220;It is no longer I who live, but
Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20); &#8220;Forget not the kindness of your surety, for he has given his
life for you&#8221; (Sir. 29:20, Vulgate). The reason for these things is that everyone who acts takes the
rule of his work from the end. Hence, if Christ is the end of our life, we should regulate our life
not according to our will but according to Christ&#8217;s will. For this is what Christ himself said: &#8220;For
I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me&#8221; (Jn.
6:38)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">186. &#8211; But note that he says two things, namely that Christ died and that he rose for us; wherein
two things are required of us. For since he dies for us, we, too, should die to ourselves, i.e., deny
ourselves for him: &#8220;If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
daily and follow me&#8221; (Lk. 9:23). This is the same as saying: let him die to himself. But because
Christ rose for us, we should so die to sin and to the old life and to ourselves that we might rise
to the new life of Christ: &#8220;So that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
we too might walk in newness of life&#8221; (Rom. 6:4). This is why the Lord not only said, &#8220;Let him
deny himself and take up his cross,&#8221; but added, &#8220;and follow me,&#8221; namely, in newness of life, by
advancing in the virtues: &#8220;They shall go from virtue to virtue&#8221; (Ps. 84:7, Vulgate).</p>

though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus
no longer. 17 Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has
passed away, behold, the new has come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">187. &#8211; Having indicated how the saints prepare themselves for receiving heavenly glory by
pleasing God and helping their neighbor, the Apostle then shows how they prepare themselves
for the same thing by giving up carnal affection. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
mentions the putting off of carnal affection; secondly, he excludes an objection (v. 16b); thirdly,
he concludes to what he intended (v. 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">188. &#8211; He says therefore: inasmuch as I am so certain of eternal glory, From now on, therefore,
we regard no one from a human point of view [according to the flesh]. Here it should be noted
that according to the flesh is a restriction and can be explained in two ways according to the
possible connections that can be made. In one way, so according to the flesh is connected with
no one. In this case, a Gloss explains it thus: we regard, i.e., approve of no one according to the
flesh, i.e., living carnally. This is the way &#8220;flesh&#8221; is taken in Romans (8:9): &#8220;You are not in the
flesh, you are in the Spirit.&#8221; In another way, we regard, i.e., approve of, no one according to the
flesh, i.e., living according to the carnal observances of the Law. This is the way &#8220;flesh&#8221; is taken
in Philippians (3:4): &#8220;Who have confidence in the flesh,&#8221; i.e., the carnal observances of the Law.
In a third way, we regard, i.e., consider, no one according to the flesh, i.e., according to the
corruption of the flesh. For although the faithful still have corruptible flesh, yet in hope they
already have an incorruptible body. Hence, they do not consider themselves from the point of
view that they have corruptible flesh now, but that they shall have an incorruptible body. This
is the way &#8220;flesh&#8221; is taken in 1 Corinthians (15:50): &#8220;Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
kingdom of God.&#8221;  But according to the flesh can be taken in another way, namely, as connected
with the verb, we regard. Then the sense is this: I say that inasmuch as we should not live for
ourselves but for him who died for us, then from now on, we regard no one according to the
flesh, i.e., we do not follow carnal affection in anyone or regard him in this light. This is the way
Deuteronomy (33:9) should be understood: &#8220;Who said of his father and mother, &#8216;I regard them
not&#8217;; he disowned his brothers, and ignored his children.&#8221; In this way, according to the flesh is
referred to the knower, but in the first explanation to the object known.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">189. &#8211; But because someone might insist that he at least knew Christ according to the flesh, he
excludes this, saying: even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we
regard him thus no longer.  In regard to this it should be noted that Manicheus appealed to those
words to support his error. For he said that Christ did not have a true body and was not born of
the seed of David. This is the way Augustine puts it in the book, Against Faustus: If anyone
alleged against him the words of the Apostle to the Romans (1:3), &#8220;Who was descended from
David according to the flesh,&#8221; and to Timothy (1 Tim. 3:16), &#8220;Great indeed, we confess, is the
mystery of our religion, which was manifested in the flesh&#8221; (and 2 Tim 2:8), &#8220;Remember Jesus
Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, as preached in my gospel,&#8221; he answered that
the Apostle was first of the opinion that he was of the seed of David and that he had a true body,
but he changed that opinion later to correct himself; that is why he said, even though we once
regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer, i.e., we have changed
our opinion and no longer believe that. But Augustine disproves this in two ways. First, because
no one says, &#8220;we regarded,&#8221; but &#8220;we are of the opinion,&#8221; when speaking of something he falsely
held. Therefore, when the Apostle uses the words, &#8220;we regarded&#8221; it does not seem that he once
held something false. Secondly, because the Apostle says, we regard no one from a human point
of view. Therefore, if what Manicheus says were true, the Apostle would have known no one to
have a true body, which is false. Therefore what Manicheus says is false.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">190. &#8211; Consequently, it must be explained otherwise according to the truth, and this in two ways.
In one way so that flesh is taken for the corruption of the flesh: &#8220;Flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:50). Then the
sense is this: if we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, i.e., to have corruptible
flesh before the passion, we regard him thus no longer, namely, that he has corruptible flesh,
because it says in Romans (6:9): &#8220;Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death
no longer has dominion over him.&#8221;  In another way according to a Gloss [Lombard], so that the
clause, even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, is referred to Paul&#8217;s
condition before his conversion; then what follows, we regard him thus no longer, refers to his
state after conversion. Then the sense is this: both I and other Jews once, i.e., before my
conversion, knew Christ according to the flesh, i.e., according to what we thought of Christ in
the Law. But now, i.e., after I was converted, we regard him thus no longer, i.e., this opinion
ceased. Indeed I believe that he is true God and that he should not be worshipped with carnal
observance. Hence, he said to the Galatians (5:2): &#8220;If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of
no advantage to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">191. &#8211; It can also be explained another way, so that the statement, even though we once regarded
Christ from a human point of view, is made by the Apostle in the person of all the apostles of
Christ. In this way it seems to correspond to the last explanation of the statement, we regard no
one from a human point of view. Hence it should be noted that when Augustine explains John
(16:17): &#8220;It is to your advantage that I go away,&#8221; where the Lord&#8217;s reason is given as being, &#8220;For
if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you,&#8221; he says that this was because the
disciples were attracted toward him as a man in the flesh to a friend in the flesh. As a result, they
could not be raised to a spiritual love, which causes one to suffer many things even for a person
who is absent. Therefore, in order to plant in them a spiritual affection, which is from the Holy
Spirit, and root out the carnal one, the Lord said to them: &#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; (Jn. 20:21).
Therefore, the Apostle in the person of all the disciples recalled this and said, even though we
once regarded, i.e., if we have clung to Christ at one time, namely, when he was present with us
in his bodily presence, according to the flesh, i.e., with carnal love, we regard him thus no longer,
i.e., that affection ceased in us by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">192. &#8211; Then when he says, Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he concludes from the foregoing that
a certain effect follows, namely, newness in the world. Hence he says, if anyone is in Christ, i.e.,
in the faith of Christ, or through Christ, he is a new creation [creature]: &#8220;For in Christ Jesus
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love&#8221; (Gal.
5:6). Here it should be noted that renewal by grace is called a creature. For creation is a change
from nothing to existence. But there are two kinds of existence, namely, of nature and of grace.
The first creation was made when creatures were produced by God from nothing to exist in
nature; and then the creature was new, but became old by sin: &#8220;He has made my flesh and my
skin waste away&#8221; (Lam. 3:4). Therefore, a new creation was required by which we would be
produced to exist in grace. This, too, is a creation from nothing because those who lack grace are
nothing: &#8220;And if I understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to
remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:2); &#8220;In his tent,&#8221; i.e., of sin,
&#8220;dwells that which is none of his&#8221; (Job 18:15). Augustine says: &#8220;For sin is nothing, and men
become nothing, when they sin.&#8221; So it is clear that the infusion of grace is a creation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">193. &#8211; If then any creature is made new through him, the old has passed away, behold, the new
has come. This of course was taken from Leviticus (26:10), where it says: &#8220;And you shall clear
out the old to make way for the new.&#8221;  From this he argues thus: if all things have been made
new, and according to the Law when new things come, the old things shall be cast away, then if
there be any new creature, the old has passed away, i.e., they should pass away from it. But the
old things that should pass away are the legal observances: &#8220;So that we serve not under the old
written code but in the new life of the Spirit&#8221; (Rom. 7:6), and in the errors of the Gentiles: &#8220;The
old error is gone&#8221; (Is. 26:3, Vulgate); likewise the corruption of sin: &#8220;We know that our old self
was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be
enslaved to sin&#8221; (Rom. 6:6).  When such things pass from us, the virtues contrary to these vices
should be renewed: &#8220;And he who sat upon the throne said, &#8216;Behold, I make all things new&#8217;&#8221; (Rev.
21:5).</p>

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might
become the righteousness of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">194. &#8211; After discussing the saints&#8217; reward and how they prepared themselves to receive it, the
Apostle now treats of the cause of both and does three things. First, he shows that the Author of
all these things is God; secondly, he recalls the benefit conferred by Christ (v. 18b); thirdly, the
use of the benefit (v. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">195. &#8211; He says therefore: I have said that we intend the salvation of our neighbor and that the old
things have passed away; but all this is from God the Father, or from God as author: &#8220;For from
him and through him and to him are all things&#8221; (Rom. 11:36); &#8220;Every good endowment and every
perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights&#8221; (Jas. 1:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">196. &#8211; Then he mentions the benefits received from God (v. 18): first, he mentions the benefit
received; secondly, he explains it (v. 19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">197. &#8211; He recalls two benefits conferred by Christ: one is common and the other is special.
Common to the whole world was reconciliation to God. And this is what he says, all this is from
God, namely, God the Father, who reconciled us to God, i.e., made peace between us and God.
And this is by Christ, i.e., by the Incarnate Word. For men were enemies of God because of sin,
but Christ removed this enmity from their midst, satisfying for sin and producing harmony:
&#8220;Whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross&#8221; (Col. 1:20). Therefore
he says, through Christ: &#8220;We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son&#8221; (Rom. 5:10).  But
a special gift was conferred on the apostles, namely, that they are ministers of this reconciliation.
Hence he says, and gave us, the apostles and vicars of Christ, the ministry of reconciliation:
&#8220;Who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:6); &#8220;Let the
mountains,&#8221; i.e., the apostles, &#8220;bear prosperity for the people&#8221; (Ps. 72:3), namely, from the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">198. &#8211; Then when he says, that is, he explains what he has said. First, the first thing; secondly,
the second (v. 19b). He says therefore: I say that God reconciled us to himself in this way. For
there were enmities between God and man on account of sin, as has been said: &#8220;But your
iniquities have made a separation between you and your God&#8221; (Is. 59:2). Therefore, sin being
destroyed by the death of Christ, the enmities were dissolved. And this is what he says: That is,
in Christ God by oneness of essence: &#8220;I am in the Father and the Father in me&#8221; (Jn. 14:11). Or
in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself through Christ: &#8220;We were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son&#8221; (Rom. 5:10). This he did, not counting their trespasses against them, i.e.,
not retaining in his memory their sins, actual or original, to punish them, for which Christ fully
satisfies., According to this he is said to have reconciled us to himself, inasmuch as he does not
impute our sins to us: &#8220;Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity (Ps. 32:2).
Then when he says, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation, he explains the second
thing, namely, the benefit conferred on the apostles. As if to say: he has given us the mystery of
reconciliation in this way, namely, that he has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation, i.e.,
he has given the power and has inspired in our hearts to announce to the world that this
reconciliation was made by Christ. By doing this we induce men to conform themselves to Christ
by baptism: &#8220;Behold, I have put my words in your mouth&#8221; (Jer. 1:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">199. &#8211; Then when he says, So we are ambassadors for Christ, he indicates the use of the benefit.
First, as to the second benefit conferred on the apostles; secondly, as to the first benefit conferred
on all (v. 20b). He says therefore: since God has established the word of reconciliation, we ought
to use it. This is why we are ambassadors for Christ: &#8220;For which I am an ambassador in chains;
that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak&#8221; (Eph. 6:20). Our fitness for this ambassadorship
is from God&#8217;s power, which is in me. Hence he says, God making his appeal through us, because
God, who speaks in us, makes us fit for this ambassadorship: &#8220;For it is not you who speak, but
the Spirit of your Father speaking through you&#8221; (Matt. 10:20); &#8220;Since you desire proof that Christ
is speaking in me&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">200. &#8211; The when he says, we beseech you, he describes the use of the first benefit. First, he
exhorts to its use; secondly, he shows the source of his power to reconcile to God (v. 21).  He
says therefore: inasmuch as God has produced a reconciliation and we are ambassadors of God
in this, we beseech you on behalf of Christ. He speaks gently, even though he could have
commanded: &#8220;Convince, rebuke, and exhort, be unfailing in patience and in teaching&#8221; (2 Tim.
4:2); &#8220;Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
yet for love&#8217;s sake I prefer to appeal to you&#8221; (Phm. 1:8-9). We beseech you, I say, on behalf of
Christ, i.e., for the love of Christ, to be reconciled to God.  But this seems contrary to his
statement that God has reconciled us to himself. Therefore, if he reconciled us, what need is there
to be reconciled? For we are already reconciled. I answer that God reconciled us to himself as
efficient cause, namely, on his part, but in order that it be meritorious for us, it is necessary that
reconciliation be made on our part, namely, in baptism and in penance. And then we cease from
sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">201. &#8211; Where we get the faculty to reconcile to God is indicated by the fact that he gave us the
power to live justly and abstain from sins. By doing this we are reconciled to God. Hence he says,
for our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin. As if to say: you can be reconciled to God,
because he, namely, Christ, who knew no sin: &#8220;He committed no sin; no guile was found on his
lips&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:22); &#8220;Which of you convicts me of sin?&#8221; (Jn. 8:46). For our sake, he made him to
be sin. This can be explained in three ways. In one way because it was the custom of the Old Law
to call a sacrifice for sin &#8220;sin&#8221;: &#8220;They feed on the sin of my people&#8221; (Hos. 4:8), i.e., the offerings
for sin. Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., the victim of sacrifice for sin. In another
way, because sin is sometimes taken for the likeness of sin, or the punishment of sin: &#8220;God
sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh&#8221;
(Rom. 8:3). Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., made him assume mortal and suffering
flesh. In a third way, because one thing is said to be this or that, not because it is so, but because
man considers it such. Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., made him regarded a sinner:
&#8220;He was numbered with the transgressors&#8221; (Is. 53:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">202. &#8211; He did this, so that in him we might become the righteousness [justice] of God, i.e.,
justified by God. Or justice, because he not only justified us, but also willed that others be
justified by us. The justice, I say, of God, not ours. And in Christ, i.e., through Christ.  Or another
way, that Christ himself be called justice. Then the sense is this: that we might become the
righteousness [justice], i.e., cling to Christ by love and faith, because Christ is justice itself. But
he says, of God, to exclude man&#8217;s justice, by which a man trusts in his own merits: &#8220;For, being
ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did
not submit to God&#8217;s righteousness&#8221; (Rom. 10:3). In him, namely, in Christ, i.e., by Christ,
because he was made justice for us (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">203. &#8211; Having commended the ministry of the apostleship, the Apostle now carries out the
ministry entrusted to him for the benefit of his subjects. In regard to this he does two things. First,
he exhorts them in general to do all the things that are commonly necessary for a good life;
secondly, he urges them in particular to help the saints in Jerusalem (chap. 8). In regard to the
first he does two things. First, he urges them to goods that are present; secondly, he commends
them for the good they have done in the past (chap. 7). In regard to the first he does three things.
First, he admonishes them in general that the grace of God should not be used in vain; secondly,
he shows that the grace of God has been conferred on them (v. 2); thirdly, he teaches them in
particular how to use the grace mentioned (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">204. &#8211; He says therefore: from the fact that we have the faculty to do good, and this by the grace
of God, and we are ambassadors of Christ for this purpose, therefore, working together [helping]
by preaching, by examples and by exhortations: &#8220;A brother helped is like a strong city&#8221; (Prov.
18:19); or helping, namely, God: &#8220;We are God&#8217;s helpers&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:9). But this seems contrary
to Isaiah (40:9): &#8220;Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord?&#8221; (Is. 40:13). Therefore it is not correct
to say, helping God.  I answer that to help God can be taken to mean that a person gives God the
power to do something. In this sense, no one helps God or can help him; or to mean that a person
carries out his commandment. Then holy men are said to help God by carrying out his
commands.  We, I say, so helping do entreat [exhort] you: &#8220;He that exhorts, in his exhortation&#8221;
(Rom. 12:8), not to accept the grace of God in vain. As if to say: let not the reception of grace
be useless and vain for you, which it is when a person does not perceive the fruit of the grace he
received. This fruit is twofold: the remission of sins: &#8220;And this will be the full fruit of the
removal of his sin&#8221; (Is. 27:9); and that a man by living righteously attain to heavenly glory: &#8220;The
return [fruit] you get is sanctification&#8221; (Rom. 6:22). Therefore, whoever does not use the grace
he has received for avoiding sin and obtaining eternal life, receives the grace of God in vain: &#8220;I
did not run in vain or labor in vain&#8221; (Phil. 2:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">205. &#8211; But lest anyone doubt that he has received this grace from God, the Apostle proves that
they have already received or are prepared to receive it, saying: For he says, &#8220;At the acceptable
time I have listened to you. In regard to this he does two things. First, he quotes the Prophet;
secondly, he adapts the quotation to his thesis (v. 2b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">206. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that you should be prepared to receive this grace fruitfully, which
has been conferred on you or prepared for you, for the Lord says as much in Is. (44:8): &#8220;In a time
of favor I have answered you.&#8221;  In regard to this it should be noted that the Lord is said to make
grace for us either by hearing us in our petitions or by helping us in our actions. But he hears that
we might receive what we ask: &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives to all
men generously and without reproaching, and it will be given him&#8221; (Jas. 1:5); &#8220;If the LORD had
not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence&#8221; (Ps. 94:17). This grace
is of two kinds: prevenient and cooperating, i.e., subsequent, which it is necessary for us to
obtain.  First of all, prevenient grace, which we ought to desire in order to be accepted by God:
&#8220;Therefore let every one who is godly offer prayer to you&#8221; (Ps. 32:6). As to this he says, At an
acceptable time, i.e., for accepting and being put in the state of grace, for in that acceptable time
that is done which is done gratuitously: &#8220;So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to
whom God reckons righteousness apart from works&#8221; (Rom. 4:6). I have listened to you, i.e.,
accepted you. Or at an acceptable time, i.e., in the time of grace; and in this way prevenient grace
is the name given to the grace by which we are freed from sin, and subsequent grace that by
which we the virtues and perseverance in good are conferred on us.  Secondly, we need
cooperating grace, such as David requested in Ps. 23 (v. 6): &#8220;Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.&#8221; As to this he says, and helped you on the day of salvation, for
the time before Christ was not day but night: &#8220;The night is far gone, the day is at hand&#8221; (Rom
13:12). But the time of Christ is called the day, and not only the day, but the day of salvation. For
before there was not salvation, because no one reached the end of salvation, namely, the vision
of God. But now, when salvation has been born in the world, men attain to salvation: &#8220;And you
shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins&#8221; (Matt. 1:21); &#8220;Work out
your salvation&#8221; (Phil. 2:12). And this is done by the help of cooperating grace, by which we
arrive at eternal life through our works: &#8220;For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for
his good pleasure&#8221; (Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">207. &#8211; Then he adapts this text to his purpose, saying, Behold, now is the acceptable time. As if
to say: the things which the Lord says by the prophet about the time of grace are now being
fulfilled, because behold, now is the acceptable time, i.e., for being adorned with grace, through
which we are heard by God, because the fulness of time has already come, namely, of the
Incarnation of Christ (Gal. 4:4); and this as to the first part of the quotation: &#8220;At an acceptable
time, O God&#8221; (Ps. 69:13). Behold, now is the day of salvation, in which, helped by cooperating
grace, we can work for the attainment of eternal salvation: &#8220;We must work the works of him who
sent me&#8221; (Jn. 9:4); &#8220;As we have the opportunity, let us do good to all men&#8221; (Gal. 6:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">208. &#8211; Then when he says, we put no obstacle, he teaches them the way to use grace conferred
on them; first, in general, namely, that they not receive it in vain; secondly, in particular (v. 4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">209. &#8211; He says therefore: use grace in such a way as putting no obstacle in any one&#8217;s way. For
grace is given for two things: to avoid evil and to do good. Therefore, he teaches these two
things, namely, that we avoid evil, in regard to which he says, putting no obstacle in any one&#8217;s
way. This can be explained in two ways: in one way as referring to the apostles. As if to say: we,
helping you, do exhort you. We, I say, giving no offense to any one, because if we were to offend
others by a wicked life, our ministry would be blamed and our preaching ridiculed: &#8220;The name
of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you&#8221; (Rom. 2:24); &#8220;If one&#8217;s life is despised,
it follows that his preaching is scorned&#8221; (Gregory). Hence, a public and notorious sinner should
beware of preaching; otherwise, he would commit sin: &#8220;But to the wicked God says: &#8216;What right
have you to recite my statutes, or take my covenant on your lips?&#8217;&#8221; (Ps. 50:17).  In another way
as referring to his subjects. As if to say: we exhort you, that you not receive the grace of God in
vain; you, I say, putting no obstacle in any one&#8217;s way, i.e., not doing anything that would
scandalize others: &#8220;Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:32);
&#8220;Decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother&#8221; (Rom. 14:13). The
reason for this is so that no fault may be found with our ministry, i.e., our apostleship. For when
subjects behave badly, the blame is put on the prelates: &#8220;Maintain good conduct among the
Gentiles&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:12). Or that the common ministry in regard to you and us, who are ministers
of God, not be blamed. We, I say, are ministers of God to fulfil his will in you and in others, but
you to fulfil it well in yourselves only: &#8220;You shall be called the priests of the LORD, men shall
speak of you as the ministers of our God&#8221; (Is. 61:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">210. &#8211; Then when he says, but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way, he
teaches them how to use the grace they received for doing good. He says therefore: let us give
no offense to anyone, but we commend ourselves, both you and we, in work and word and in all
things which pertain to the virtues, such ministers of God as we ought to be, i.e., let us conform
ourselves to God by doing his will: &#8220;Like the magistrate of the people, so are his officials&#8221; (Sir.
10:2); &#8220;This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of
God&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">211. &#8211; Then when he says, through great endurance, he shows in particular how we should
exhibit ourselves as ministers of God in using the grace conferred on us. And this as to three
things: first, as to outward actions, secondly, as to greater devotion (v. 11); thirdly, as to avoiding
unbelievers (v. 14). In regard to the first he does three things in keeping with the three things in
which external activity consists: first, it consists in enduring evil, and concerning this he says,
through great endurance; secondly, in doing good (v. 6); thirdly, in mutual cooperation of good
with bad (v. 7b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">212. &#8211; To endure evils the virtue of patience is necessary; hence, he says, through great endurance
[in much patience]. In regard to this he does three things. First, he exhorts them to patience,
because it says in Ps. 91 (v. 15): &#8220;They will be well off that they may proclaim&#8221; (Ps. 92:14-15,
Vulgate); &#8220;By your endurance [patience] you will gain your lives&#8221; (Lk. 21:19). He says, in much,
on account of the many tribulations they meet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">213. &#8211; Secondly, he shows the matter patience deals with in general, and this in two ways,
namely in evils that come upon them, in regard to which he says, in afflictions [tribulations]:
&#8220;Patient in tribulation&#8221; (Rom. 12:12); &#8220;By many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God&#8221;
(Ac. 11:21); and in the lack of necessities; hence, he says, in hardships [necessities], namely, of
things necessary for life: &#8220;Bring me out of my distresses&#8221; (Ps. 25:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">214. &#8211; Thirdly, he shows in particular the material with which patience is concerned. First, with
things that pertain to tribulations which are voluntary, and this as to the soul. Hence, he says, in
calamities [distresses], namely of the heart, when we are so beset with tribulations that there is
no way of escape: &#8220;Destitute, afflicted, ill-treated&#8221; (Heb. 11:37), and then as to the body; hence,
he says, in beatings, namely, inflicted by others, and in prisons: &#8220;And when they had inflicted
many blows upon them, they threw them into prison&#8221; (Ac. 16:23); &#8220;Far more imprisonments,
with countless beatings&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:23). In tumults, namely, of an entire people in an uproar: &#8220;For
we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause that we can give to
justify this commotion&#8221; (Ac. 19:40).  Secondly, in things that pertain to necessities. But necessity
is sometimes voluntary, and so he says, in labours, by working with his own hands among the
Corinthians, so as not to burden them with his support, because they were avaricious; and among
the Thessalonians, to give them an example of work because they were idle: &#8220;You yourselves
know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me&#8221; (Ac. 20:34).
In watchings, for the sake of preaching: &#8220;Through many a sleepless night&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:27). In
hunger [fasting], sometimes voluntary and sometimes involuntary because of need: &#8220;I pommel
my body and subdue it&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:27)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">215. &#8211; But this seems to be contrary to what is said in Matt. (11:30): &#8220;My yoke is easy and my
burden is light,&#8221; whereas he says here, in much tribulation. Therefore, it is not sweet but very
distasteful. I answer that these are hard in themselves, but they are made sweet by love and an
inward fervor of spirit. Hence, Augustine says: &#8220;All huge and difficult tasks love makes easy and
almost nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="62"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">6-2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 6:6-10</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6 By purity, knowledge, forbearance, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love, 7
truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the
right hand and for the left; 8 in honor and dishonor, in ill repute and good repute.
We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; 9 as unknown, and yet well known;
as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed; 10 as sorrowful, yet
always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
possessing everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">216. &#8211; Having set down the things which pertain to enduring evils, he now mentions those which
pertain to the observance of good. Now the goodness of a work consists in three things, namely,
in the perfection of virtues, and this pertains to the heart; in speaking the truth, and this pertains
to the mouth; and in the virtuous activity which pertains to a work. First, therefore, the Apostle
shows how they conduct themselves in matters pertaining to the perfection of the virtues, which
consists in the heart; secondly, in those which pertain to the virtue of the mouth (v. 7); thirdly,
in those which pertain to the perfection of a work (v. 7b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">217. &#8211; In regard to the first he sets down four virtues: first of all the virtue of chastity, which
holds a prominent place in the virtue of temperance: in regard to this he says, in purity [chastity],
namely, of mind and body. Here it should be noted that immediately after many labours, watches
and fasts he mentions chastity, because a person who wills to have the virtue of chastity must be
given to labours, continue in watchings, and be worn out with fasts: &#8220;But I pommel my body and
subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:27); &#8220;Strive for
peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord&#8221; (Heb. 12:14).
But if anyone should ask why he makes no mention of the other virtues, but only of temperance,
the answer is that he does mention them implicitly, because when he says, &#8220;in much patience, in
tribulations&#8221; (v. 4), they pertain to the virtue of courage; when he says, &#8220;by the armor of justice&#8221;
(v. 7), there is reference to the virtue of justice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">218. &#8211; Secondly, he mentions the virtue of knowledge; therefore he says, in knowledge. If this
is taken as referring to the knowledge by which a person knows how to behave well in the midst
of a wicked and perverse nation, it pertains to the virtue of prudence. But if knowledge is taken
as referring to the certitude with which the faithful are certain about the things which pertain to
their knowledge of God, it pertains to the virtue of faith. Both are necessary for Christians, for
without prudence and faith, men easily slip into sins: &#8220;Therefore my people go into exile for want
of knowledge&#8221; (Is. 5:13); &#8220;And I will give you shepherds after my own heart&#8221; (Jer. 3:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">219. &#8211; Thirdly, he mentions the virtue of hope when he says, longsuffering, which pertains to the
perfection of hope. For a longsuffering person is nothing less than a person who is always
hopeful of obtaining a good that is difficult and waits patiently if it delay; and this is by the Holy
Spirit: &#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control&#8221; (Gal. 5:22-23); &#8220;For all endurance and patience with joy&#8221; (Col. 1:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">220. &#8211; Fourthly, he mentions charity, which has two effects, namely, one inward and one
outward. In the inward effect it has sweetness toward one&#8217;s neighbor: for it is unseemly for a
person not to be sweet toward those he loves; therefore he says, in kindness [sweetness], in our
behavior toward others, and gentle: &#8220;A pleasant voice multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue
multiplies courtesies&#8221; (Sir. 6:5). Not in the sweetness of the world, but in that which is caused
by the love of God, i.e., by the Holy Spirit; hence he says, in the Holy Spirit, i.e., which the Holy
Spirit causes in us: &#8220;O how good and sweet is your Spirit, Lord, in all things&#8221; (Wis. 12:1,
Vulgate). In the outward effect it has truth without pretense, i.e., that a person not pretend
outwardly the contrary of what he has within; hence he says, in genuine love: &#8220;Let us not love
in word or speech but in deed and in truth&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:18); &#8220;And above all these put on love&#8221; (Col.
3:14). The reason for this is because, as it says in Wis. (1:5): &#8220;For the Holy Spirit of discipline
will flee from deceit.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">221. &#8211; Then he shows how they should act in things which pertain to the truth of the mouth,
namely, that they be truthful. Hence, he says, truthful speech, namely, speaking and preaching
what is true.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">222. &#8211; But how they should act in regard to the perfection of a work, he tells them when he says,
in the power of God, i.e., in let us not put confidence in our own works, but only in the power
of God: &#8220;For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">223. &#8211; Then when he says, with the weapons of righteousness, he shows how they should act in
doing good in prosperity and adversity; and this pertains to the virtue of justice. First, he shows
this in general; secondly, he explains it in particular.  He says therefore, that we should show
ourselves as God&#8217;s ministers in much patience and what is more with the weapons of
righteousness [by the armor of justice]. Here it should be noted that justice ordains and makes
a man keep his place for the right hand, i.e., in prosperity, namely, that he not be lifted up; and
for the left hand, i.e., in adversity, namely, that he not be cast down: &#8220;In any and all
circumstances I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and want&#8221; (Phil.
4:12). Then he explains this by the two sides, prosperity and adversity, saying, in honor and
dishonor. Here it should be noted that in temporal affairs prosperity and adversity consist in three
things, namely, the pride of life, in the concupiscence of the flesh, and in the concupiscence of
the eyes: &#8220;For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride
of life, is not of the Father but is of the world&#8221; (1 Jn. 2:16). He treats these in order. First, he
shows how they should act in prosperity and adversity as pertaining to the pride of life; secondly,
in things which pertain to the concupiscence of the flesh (v. 9); thirdly, pertaining to the
concupiscence of the eyes (v. 10b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">224. &#8211; Now there are two things which pertain to pride, namely, excellence of state and of works.
Hence he says, in honor, i.e., by a condition of excellence. As if to say: let us show ourselves as
God&#8217;s ministers, namely, by the glory of God, that is, in prosperity: &#8220;The LORD of hosts has
purposed it, to defile the pride of all glory&#8221; (Is. 23:9). That the apostles seemed glorious is shown
in Acts (chap. 14), when Paul and Barnabas were taken as gods. And dishonor, which is on the
left. As if to say: let us neither be lifted up by glory nor, if we are contemptible, be cast down:
&#8220;God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing
things that are&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:28).  As to reports about works, he says, in ill repute and good repute.
Here it should be noted that, as Gregory says, a man should not be the cause of his own bad
reputation among those who are outside; rather he should try to acquire a good reputation, as Sir.
(41:15) says: &#8220;Better is the man who hides his folly than the man who hides his wisdom,&#8221; and
this for the sake of others, because we need to have a good reputation among those who are
outside (1 Tim. 3:7). But if anyone happens to fall into bad repute unjustly, he should not be
fainthearted or abandon holiness on that account. But if he has a good reputation among
unbelievers, he should not be proud but take a middle path between the two.  Then he explains
the two things he mentioned. First, the evil reputation they had and to what a degree. Hence he
says, as imposters and yet true. As if to say: some regard us as deceivers and some as honest. But
this is not strange, because even in the case of Christ some said that he was good, and some that
he was not, but that he was deceiving the multitude, as it says in Jn. (7:12). Secondly, he shows
how they were noble and ignoble. Hence he says, as unknown and yet well known, i.e., approved
by the good and unknown, i.e., despised by the evil: &#8220;We have become, and are now, as the
refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">225. &#8211; Then he discusses the things which pertain to the concupiscence of the flesh and mentions
three things which the flesh desires: first, it desires a long life; as to this he says, as dying, i.e.,
although we are exposed to the dangers of death: &#8220;And often near death&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:23), and
behold we live in virtue and faith. Therefore, Hab. (2:4) says: &#8220;But the righteous live by their
faith&#8221;; &#8220;I shall not die, but I shall live&#8221; (Ps. 118:17).  Secondly, it desires health and repose; as
to this he says, as punished and yet not killed. As if to say: although we are chastised with many
stripes by the Lord, yet he has not delivered us over to death: &#8220;The Lord has chastened me sorely,
but he has not given me over to death&#8221; (Ps. 118:13); &#8220;Indeed all who desire to live a godly life
in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:12).  Thirdly, it desires joy and pleasantness; as to
this he says, as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. For although in outward things and things which
pertain to the flesh, we suffer sadness and bitterness, yet inwardly we have continual joy, which
grows in us by the consolations of the Holy Spirit and by the hope of an eternal reward: &#8220;Count
it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials&#8221; (Jas. 1:2); &#8220;You will have pain, but your
pain will turn into joy&#8221; (Jn. 16:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">226. &#8211; Then he discusses the things which pertain to the concupiscence of the eyes, and in regard
to this he mentions two things. One of these is in relation to others, and according to this the right
hand in riches consists in a man abounding, so that he can minister to others from his riches. But
the left hand consists in a man&#8217;s being so poor that he must beg from others. Hence he says that
in these temporal things we are as poor, i.e., receiving from others; but as to spiritual things, yet
making many rich. He does not say, &#8220;all,&#8221; because not all are ready to be enriched: &#8220;Another
pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth&#8221; (Prov. 13:7).  The second is in relation to themselves,
and according to this, prosperity in riches is to possess many; but the left side is that he have
absolutely nothing. In regard to this he says that in external things they are as having nothing,
namely, in temporal things, because they have forsaken all things for Christ: &#8220;If you would be
perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven&#8221;
(Matt. 19:21). But inwardly and in spiritual things, possessing all things, namely, by an inner
greatness of heart. And this is so because they lived not for themselves, but for Christ.
Consequently, all that were Christ&#8217;s they regarded as their own. Hence, since all things are
subject to Christ, they possessed all things, and all things tended to their glory: &#8220;Every place that
the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you&#8221; (Jos. 1:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">227. &#8211; Note in regard to the foregoing that the Apostle employs a remarkable manner of
speaking. For he, as it were, always sets one thing against another, and temporal against spiritual.
But yet in temporal things he always adds a condition, namely, as or as though, but in the
opposite spiritual things he adds nothing. The reason for this is that temporal things, whether they
be good or evil, are changeable and apparent, and they have only a likeness to good and evil.
Hence he says, as imposters and as unknown, because they were not so in reality, but only in
men&#8217;s opinion. Consequently, they were transitory good or evils. But spiritual goods are existent
and true; therefore, he adds no condition to them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">228. &#8211; After teaching them the use of grace as to good outward actions, the Apostle now instructs
them about this use in regard to internal devotion, which consists in joy of heart, which causes
the heart to enlarge. In regard to this he does three things. First, he offers himself as an example
of this enlargement; secondly, he shows that they have no contrary example, nor could they have
(v. 12); thirdly, he exhorts them to enlarge their hearts (v. 13). In regard to the first he does two
things: first, he gives a sign of an expanded heart; secondly, he mentions the expansion of heart
he had (v. 11b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">229. &#8211; Now the sign of an expanded heart is an open mouth, because it adheres immediately to
the heart. Hence, the things we express by the mouth are express signs of the thoughts of the
heart: &#8220;For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&#8221; (Matt. 12:34). And this is what
he says: our mouth is open to you. For the mouth is closed sometimes when the things in the
heart are not outwardly apparent, but it is opened when the things in the heart are manifested:
&#8220;After this Job opened his mouth&#8221; (Job 3:1); &#8220;And he opened his mouth and taught them&#8221; (Matt.
5:2).  But that it might not seem to pertain to the vice of vanity that he manifest himself, he gives
a reason, saying, to you, i.e., for your benefit we manifest to you the secrets of our heart: &#8220;Not
seeking my own advantage, but that of many&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:33).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">230. &#8211; The cause of this enlargement comes from enlarging and widening the heart. Hence he
says, our heart is wide [enlarged]: &#8220;The raising of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart&#8221; (Prov.
21:4, Vulgate).  But sometimes the heart is narrow, namely, when it is pressed together and
confined in a small place, as when a person cares for nothing but earthly things and scorns the
heavenly, not being able to grasp them with his mind. But sometimes is it wide, namely, when
a person seeks and desires great things. Such was the case with the Apostle, who did not regard
the things which are seen, but desired heavenly things. Hence he says, our heart is enlarged, i.e.,
expanded for desiring great things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">231. &#8211; Then he shows that they have no contrary example from the Apostle, saying, You are not
restricted by us [straightened]. As if to say: from the fact that we show you the largeness of our
heart, you do not have an example or a reason why you should be straightened. But if you do this,
then indeed you are straightened, but not by us, but in your own affections, i.e., by yourselves.
Here it should be noted that to be straightened is the same as to be enclosed in something, from
which no exit appears. But they have been deceived by a false apostle to such a degree that they
did not believe salvation was possible without observing legal ceremonies. As a result, they
became slaves, whereas they had been free according to the faith of Christ. Hence, the
confinement of this slavery did not come to them from the Apostle, but from their bowels, i.e.,
from the hardness of their hearts: &#8220;Do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and your
children&#8221; (Lk. 23:28).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">232. &#8211; Then he urges them to enlarge their hearts, saying, In return [having the same
recompense], widen your hearts also. As if to say: if you had been deceived and straightened by
a false apostle, then do not continue in that state, but try to have a large heart, as we have,
because you love the same recompense as we. Therefore he says, having the same recompense
as we: &#8220;For we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our consolation&#8221;
(2 Cor. 1:7). I speak as to children, and not to enemies, as to children of God, namely, heirs of
eternal life: &#8220;And if children, then heirs&#8221; (Rom. 8:17). Having the same recompense, I say, widen
your hearts also, i.e., have a large heart and free with the freedom of the Spirit, which is in the
faith of Christ, and be not straightened in the slavery of legal observances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">233. &#8211; Then when he says, Do not be mismated with unbelievers, he teaches them the use of
grace as to avoiding unbelievers. In regard to this he does three things. First, he exhorts them;
secondly, the reason for the exhortation (v. 14b); thirdly, he confirms this reason with an
authority (v. 16b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">234. &#8211; He says therefore, Do not be mismated [bear the yoke] with unbelievers. Here it should
be noted that a yoke is anything which binds several to do something. Hence, because some come
together sometimes to do something good, which is from God, and some to do something evil,
which is from the devil, we speak of God&#8217;s yoke and the devil&#8217;s yoke. God&#8217;s yoke is charity,
which binds a man to serve God: &#8220;Take my yoke upon you&#8221; (Matt. 11:29). But the devil&#8217;s yoke
is for doing evil: &#8220;The yoke of his burden&#8221; (Is. 9:4).  Therefore he says this: Do not be mismated,
i.e., do not take part in works of unbelief, with unbelievers; and this for two reasons. First,
because there were some among them who considered themselves wiser, not refraining from
idolatry; as a result they scandalized the lowly. But there were others who took part with the Jews
in the traditions of their elders. Hence, the Apostle exhorts them and says, do not be mismated
with unbelievers, i.e., do not communicate with the Jews in the traditions of the Law or with
Gentiles in the worship of idols, for both groups were unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">235. &#8211; He gives the reason for this when he says, For what partnership have righteousness and
iniquity? This is based on two distinctions: one regards the cause and the other the state. The
distinction as to cause is twofold, namely, as to habitual and as to efficient cause. The habitual
cause is also twofold: one as to effect, and this is what he says: For what partnership have
righteousness and iniquity [justice with injustice]? As if to say: you should not bear the yoke with
unbelievers, because there is one habit in you and another in them. In you it is the habit of justice;
in them it is the habit of iniquity. But the higher justice is to render to God what is his, and this
is to worship him. Hence, since you worship God, the habit of justice is in you. But the greatest
iniquity is to take from God what is his and give it to the devil: &#8220;I cannot endure iniquity and
solemn assembly&#8221; (Is. 1:13); &#8220;What has straw in common with wheat&#8221; (Jer. 23:28).  The other
habitual cause is in regard to the intellect; and this distinction is that the faithful are enlightened
with the light of faith, but unbelievers are in the darkness of errors. As to this he says, Or what
fellowship has light with darkness? As if to say: it is not right for you to communicate with them,
because it is not a suitable fellowship, because you are light through knowledge of the faith: &#8220;For
once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord&#8221; (Eph. 5:8), but they are darkness
through ignorance: &#8220;The way of the wicked is like deep darkness&#8221; (Prov. 4:19). Hence, from the
beginning the Lord separated the light from the darkness, as it says in Gen. (1:18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">236. &#8211; As to the efficient cause he says, What accord has Christ with Belial? As if to say: you are
the servants of Christ and his members: &#8220;Now you are the body of Christ and individually
members of it&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:27), but they are members of the devil. The devil is called Belial,
without a yoke, because he refused to submit to God&#8217;s yoke: &#8220;For long ago you broke your yoke
and burst your bonds&#8221; (Jer. 2:20).  That there cannot be concord between Christ and Belial is
clear from Christ&#8217;s words: &#8220;For the ruler of this world is coming; he has no power over me&#8221; (Jn.
14:30), as well as from the devil&#8217;s words: &#8220;What have you to do with us, O Son of God?&#8221; (Matt.
8:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">237. &#8211; Another distinction regards the state of faith. In regard to this he says, Or what has a
believer in common with an unbeliever? As if to say: there is not the same part on both sides,
because the part of the believer is God, whom he has as a reward and as the end of his happiness:
&#8220;The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup&#8221; (Ps. 16:5). But the part of the unbeliever is earthly
goods: &#8220;Because this is our portion and this is our lot&#8221; (Wis. 2:9); &#8220;And he will punish him and
put him with the hypocrites&#8221; (Matt. 24:51).  As to the state of grace he says, What agreement has
the temple of God with idols? As if to say: there is no agreement. Hence, you are a temple of God
by grace: &#8220;Do you not know that you are God&#8217;s temple and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you?&#8221; (1
Cor. 3:16). Therefore, you should not communicate with unbelievers, who are temples of idols.
But it should be noted that in Ez. 25, the Lord forbids idols to be worshipped in God&#8217;s temple.
Much more then are men forbidden, whose souls are God&#8217;s temple, to violate them by partaking
of idols: &#8220;If any one destroys God&#8217;s temple, God will destroy him&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">238. &#8211; Then when he says, For you are the temple of the living God, he strengthens his reason
with an authority. In regard to this he does two things. First, he confirms what he had concluded
by reason of an admonition; secondly, he confirms the admonition itself (v. 17). In regard to the
first he does two things. First, he reviews what he intends to prove; secondly, he quotes an
authority to support his conclusion (v. 17c).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">239. &#8211; He says therefore: rightly do I say that there is no agreement between the temple of God
and idols, i.e., you should not take part in them, because you are the temple of the living God,
and not of a dead one, as idolaters are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">240. &#8211; To prove this he cites an authority, proving this very point from the use to which a temple
is put. For the use of a temple is that God dwell in it, because a temple is a place consecrated for
God to dwell in: &#8220;The Lord is in his holy temple&#8221; (Ps. 11:4). This authority is taken from Lev.
(26:11), which says: &#8220;And I will make my abode among you&#8221;. In this authority four things are
touched as pertaining to this use. The first pertains to operating grace, which consists in God&#8217;s
being is someone through grace; and this is what he says, I will live in them, namely, in the
saints, adorning them with grace. For although God is said to be in all things by his presence,
power, and essence, he is not said to dwell in them, but only in the saints through grace; the
reason being that God is in all things by his activity, inasmuch as he joins himself to them as
giving esse and conserving it, but in the saints by their very activity, by which they attain to God
and in a way comprehend him, which is to love and to know. For those who know and those who
love have within themselves the thing known and loved. The second pertains to cooperating
grace, by which the saints make progress with God&#8217;s help; as to this he says, I will move among
them, i.e., I will promote them from virtue to virtue, for this progress is impossible without grace:
&#8220;By the grace of God I am what I am&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10). For just as operating grace makes us to be
something in the being [esse] of justice, so cooperating grace makes us progress in that being
[esse]. The third pertains to God&#8217;s benefits: and this is either the benefit of his protection through
providence; hence, he touches this when he says, and I will be their God, i.e., I will protect them
by my providence: &#8220;Happy the people whose God is the Lord&#8221; (Ps. 144:15), or the benefit of
recompense. As if to say: I will be their God, i.e., I will give them myself as a reward: &#8220;Your
reward shall be very great&#8221; (Gen. 15:1); &#8220;Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God&#8221;
(Heb. 11:16). The fourth pertains to correct worship and service offered by the saints; as to this
he says, and they shall be my people, i.e., they will worship me and obey me as mine and not
another&#8217;s: &#8220;We are the people of his pasture, the sheep of his hand&#8221; (Ps. 95:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">241. &#8211; Or they could refer to bodily presence; then it is explained this way: For I will live in them
by assuming flesh: &#8220;The Word became flesh and dwelt among us&#8221; (Jn. 1:14), and I will move
among them bodily by living with them: &#8220;Afterward she appeared upon earth and lived among
men.&#8221; (Bar. 3:37), and I will be their God by glory: &#8220;For what great nation is there that has a god
so near to it as the LORD our God is to us&#8221; (Deut. 4:7). And they shall be my people, i.e., they
will worship me in faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">242. &#8211; Then when he says, Therefore come out from them, he confirms this admonition with
another authority. In regard to this he does two things. First, he confirms the admonition by an
authority; secondly, he indicates the reward promised to those who heed the admonition (v. 18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">243. &#8211; He says therefore, i.e., because you are temples of God, come out from them: &#8220;Depart,
depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst of it&#8221; (Is. 52:11). Here
he says three things: go out, be separated from them, and do not touch anything unclean, because
there are three ways we should behave toward unbelievers. First, we should go out from them by
abstaining from sins: &#8220;Ho! ho! Flee from the land of the north&#8221; (Zech. 2:6). But the Donatists say
that we must depart bodily from an evil society. But this is not true. Hence, the Apostle&#8217;s words
must be understood of a spiritual separation and are explained in this way: go out spiritually by
not following their life: &#8220;As a lily among brambles&#8221; (S of S 2:2), and this in order to avoid the
very occasions of sin given by them. Hence he says, be separate, i.e., be far from consenting to
them: &#8220;For I have come to set a man against his father&#8221; (Matt. 10:35); &#8220;Depart, I pray you, from
the tents of these wicked men&#8221; (Num. 16:26). Thirdly, to rebuke them when they do wrong;
hence he says, touch nothing unclean, i.e., do not consent to them in evil: &#8220;They not only do them
but approve those who practice them&#8221; (Rom. 1:32); &#8220;Take no part in the unfruitful works of
darkness, but instead expose them.&#8221; (Eph. 5:11). And this because &#8220;whoever touches pitch will
be defiled [by it]&#8221; (Sir. 13:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">244. &#8211; Two rewards are promised to those who heed this admonition, namely, familiarity with
God and adoption by God. Familiarity with God, because I will welcome you. As if to say: go
out confidently, because I will welcome you as mine: &#8220;For my father and my mother have
forsaken me, but the LORD will take me up&#8221; (Ps. 27:10); &#8220;Blessed is he whom thou dost choose
and bring near, to dwell in your courts!&#8221; (Ps. 65:5); &#8220;Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my
chosen, in whom my soul delights&#8221; (Is. 42:1). Divine adoption, because he adopts us as sons,
because he says, I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters: &#8220;For you did
not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship&#8221;
(Rom. 8:15). He says, sons, as to the perfect, and daughters, as to the imperfect; and this is taken
from 2 Sam. (7:14), where it says of Solomon: &#8220;I will be his father, and he shall be my son.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="71"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">7-1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 7:1-3</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every
defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the fear of God. 2
Open your hearts to us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we
have taken advantage of no one. 3 I do not say this to condemn you, for I said
before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">245. &#8211; Having informed the Corinthians how to behave in the future, the Apostle now commends
them on the good they have accomplished in the past. But in order to connect the past with the
future, he first concludes his admonition; secondly, he commends them (v. 4). In regard to the
first he does three things. First, he gives the admonition; secondly, he gives himself as an
example to have the admonition obeyed (v. 2); thirdly, he states his intention in admonishing
them (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">246. &#8211; In regard to the first he does three things. First, he gives them a motive for observing the
admonition, and this is a promise made to them. Hence, he says, Since we have these promises,
beloved, namely, that God may dwell in you, and that you may receive us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">247. &#8211; Secondly, he gives the admonition, when he says, let us cleanse ourselves from every
defilement of body and spirit, because those promises are given only to those who are clean; and
so let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, i.e., of carnal and spiritual
vices: &#8220;Purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the Lord&#8221; (Is. 52:11).  Here it should be
noted that every sin which is consummated in carnal delight is carnal, while that which is
consummated in spiritual delight is spiritual. That is why carnal sins, if they are considered in
their consummation, are two in number, namely, gluttony and lust; but the others are spiritual
sins. But if they are considered in their origin, then all sins can be considered carnal, because all
of them have their origin in a conception of the flesh. In this sense he speaks to the Galatians
(5:19): &#8220;Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry,
sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness,
carousing, and the like.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">248. &#8211; Thirdly, he mentions how they can fulfil the admonition when he says, making holiness
perfect in the fear of God. For someone could say: were we not cleansed in baptism? That is why
he added, making holiness perfect, i.e., let us perfect the original cleansing in baptism. For the
same is holy that is clean: &#8220;Be holy, for I am holy&#8221; (Lev. 11:44).  Let us perfect, I say, because
philosophers have tried to be perfect and have failed, because they were unable to avoid sins. For
no matter how many other sins they avoided or how well they exercised the acts of the virtues,
the sin of unbelief remained in them. Consequently, cleanness is made perfect only in the true
worship of God. And this is what he says: in the fear, i.e., in the worship, of God: &#8220;The fear of
God has set itself over all things&#8221; (Sir. 25:14, Vulgate).  But this seems contrary to Col. (3:14):
&#8220;And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.&#8221;
Therefore, sanctification is not perfected in the fear of God, but in the love of God. I answer that
he is speaking here of filial fear, which is the effect of charity, and not of servile fear, which is
contrary to charity. He says, in the fear, to teach us to love God with a certain reverence and
carefulness. For love causes security, which sometimes begets negligence; but one who fears is
always careful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">249. &#8211; Then when he says, open your hearts to us, he offers himself as an example. As if to say:
take us as an example: &#8220;Be imitators of me as I am of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:1). For I have guarded
myself against uncleanness by holiness, because I have injured no one. Here it should be noted
that a person might injure his neighbor in three ways, but Paul did not injure them in any of these
ways. First, in his person, as to this he says, we have wronged no one, namely in his person, as
wicked masters do: &#8220;Who tear the skin from off my people&#8221; (Mic. 3:2). Secondly, in their
reputation by inducing them to evil by example and persuasion; as to this he says, we have
corrupted no one: &#8220;Bad company ruins good morals&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:33). Thirdly, by stealing their
goods; as to this he says, we have taken advantage of no one: &#8220;That no man transgress and wrong
his brother in this matter&#8221; (1 Th. 4:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">250. &#8211; Then when he says, I do not say this to condemn you, he discloses his intention. As if to
say: I do not say this to condemn you, but to correct you. For past evils are wont to be recalled
sometimes for condemnation, when there is no further hope of correction; and sometimes for
amendment, so that they will be corrected. And this is the way he speaks here: I do not say this
to condemn you: &#8220;I say this for your own benefit&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:35).  The reason for this is because
I rejoice in your good: for I said before that you are in our hearts: &#8220;You yourselves are our letter
of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and read by all men&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:2); &#8220;It
is right for me to feel thus about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers
with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel&#8221;
(Phil. 1:7).  You are, I say, in our hearts, namely, to die together and to live together. This can
be understood of the death of guilt and of natural death. Of the death of guilt, not that we are
prepared to die with you, i.e., not that when you sin, we want to sin, but we take your death of
guilt with as much pain as our own: &#8220;Who is weak, and I am not weak?&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:29); &#8220;I die
everyday&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:31). And to live together, because I take as much joy in your good life in
grace as in my own. Of natural death: then to die together it taken to mean that I am prepared to
die for you: &#8220;I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:15); to live
together, i.e., I desire you to be companions in eternal life: &#8220;If we have died with him, we shall
also live with him&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:11).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="72"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">7-2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 7:4-9a</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4 I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with
comfort. With all our affliction, I am overjoyed. 5 For even when we came into
Macedonia, our bodies had no rest but we were afflicted at every turn&#8212;fighting
without and fear within. 6 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by
the coming of Titus, 7 and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with
which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning,
your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more. 8 For even if I made you sorry with
my letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it), for I see that that letter grieved
you, though only for a while. 9 As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved,
but because you were grieved into repenting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">251. &#8211; Having given an admonition derived from what went before, the Apostle now gives his
commendation. In regard to this he does two things: first, he commends them, secondly, he
explains it (v. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">252. &#8211; He commends them by showing his love, which springs from the good works the
Corinthians did. For in the hearts of those who love there are four feelings (affectus) that usually
arise from the good works, which the lovers accomplish. First, the feeling of confidence. Hence,
he says, I have great confidence in you, inasmuch as I am confident that, having begun well, you
will always get better. Consequently, from the good things I have heard about you I hope for
greater things to come: &#8220;And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to
completion at the day of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:6); &#8220;Though we speak thus, yet in your case,
beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation&#8221; (Heb. 6:9). And this confidence
is good and salutary: &#8220;Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward&#8221;
(Heb. 10:35).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">253. &#8211; Secondly, from this confidence he conceives a feeling of glory; for as a result of loving
a friend&#8217;s good as his own, a person glories in that good as he glories in his own. And this is
especially true here, because he is the cause of their goods, as a teacher is the cause of his
disciple&#8217;s doctrine. Hence he says, I have great pride in you: &#8220;The glory of a father is a wise son&#8221;
(Prov. 10:1, Aquinas Latin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">254. &#8211; Then as a result of these two feelings he conceives a feeling of consolation, when the one
who rejoices and glories in his own goods or in those of his friend has a remedy against sadness.
This consolation is a cure for sadness; and according to the Philosopher every delight weakens
or entirely destroys sadness. If the delight is contrary to the sadness, it totally swallows up the
sadness; but if it is not contrary, it weakens or diminishes it. This is why when a person is sad,
his sadness is lessened whenever something joyful is announced to him. Therefore, because he
heard joyful things about the Corinthians, he says, I am filled with comfort, having heard of your
amendment: &#8220;For as we share abundantly in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, so through Christ we share
abundantly in comfort too&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:5); &#8220;So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any
incentive of love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy
by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind&#8221; (Phil.
2:1-2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">255. &#8211; Fourthly, there finally arises a feeling of exuberant joy, for although sadness is lessened
by certain delights, it is not entirely displaced unless there is great joy. But although the Apostle
had endured many tribulations, yet because he found great joy in the good actions of the
Corinthians, not only was sadness entirely absorbed, but his joy superabounds. Hence he says,
With all our affliction, I am overjoyed, i.e., my joy overcomes every tribulation that was in my
soul: &#8220;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming?&#8221;
(1 Th. 2:19); &#8220;Be patient in tribulation&#8221; (Rom. 12:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">256. &#8211; Then when he says, For even when we came, he explains his commendation. But he said
that he experienced two things, namely, joy and tribulation. First, therefore, he makes manifest
his tribulation; secondly, his consolation (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">257. &#8211; He enlarges upon his tribulations for two reasons, namely, because the cure was removed,
and because the tribulations were multiplied. Because of the removal of the cure he says: For
even when we came, etc. As if to say: indeed I have tribulation, because I am consoled by no one,
for even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. Here he is referring to the
persecution he suffered in Macedonia, when he freed a certain possessed maidservant, as we read
in Acts (16:16). He says, our bodies had no rest, but not &#8220;our spirit,&#8221; because the saints always
have peace in spirit. For even in adversity the soul, which suffers in the body, rests in the hope
of a reward to come, although it suffers many things contrary to the desires of the flesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">258. &#8211; But he enlarges upon his tribulations by reason of their number when he says, we were
afflicted at every turn, i.e., every type of tribulation in the body and in the soul: &#8220;In the world you
have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world&#8221; (Jn. 16:33). That he had
suffered all tribulations he explains when he says, fighting without and fear within, i.e., outside
myself the combat of persecutions, but within, i.e., in the heart, the fear of evil, fearing
persecutions in the future: &#8220;In the open the sword shall bereave&#8221; (Deut. 32:25) But this seems
contrary to Prov. (28:1): &#8220;But the righteous are bold as a lion.&#8221; I answer that he is without dread
as to the spirit, but not as to the flesh. Or without, i.e., outside the Church, combats are started
by unbelievers; but fear within, lest those who are in the Church fall away from the faith on
account of persecutors. Or without, i.e., in public, fighting, because we are attacked by obvious
enemies; fear within, which is produced in us by those who call themselves friends but are not.
For as Boethius says in The Consolation: &#8220;No pest can inflict more harm than a friendly enemy&#8221;;
&#8220;A man&#8217;s foes will be those of his own household&#8221; (Matt. 10:36).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">259. &#8211; Then when he says, But God, who comforts, he states the reason for his consolation,
which he applauds from two aspects, namely, from the gratifying presence of Titus and from the
consolation of Titus (v. 7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">260. &#8211; He says therefore: although we were gravely afflicted here, God, who comforts the
downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, whose presence was very pleasing and a great
help to me: &#8220;Who comforts us in all our affliction&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:4). He says, who comforts the
downcast [humble], because he does not comfort the proud but resists them, as it says in James
(4:6) and 1 Pet. (5:5). But he comforts the humble by giving grace, which is the consolation of
the Holy Spirit: &#8220;To comfort all who mourn&#8221; (Is. 61:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">261. &#8211; And not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you.
Here he gives another reason for the Apostle&#8217;s consolation, namely, the consolation of Titus. The
reason for this comfort is twofold: first, the amendment of the Corinthians, which they had in
Titus&#8217; presence; secondly, the devotion they showed to Titus (v. 13b). In regard to the first he
does two things. First, he mentions his comfort in the repentance of the Corinthians; secondly,
he explains something he has said (v. 9b). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
mentions the comfort of Titus; secondly, the reason for the comfort (v. 7b); thirdly, the effect of
the comfort on the mind of the Apostle (v. 7c).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">262. &#8211; He says therefore: God not only comforted us in the coming of Titus, but also in the
comfort with which Titus was comforted by you and in you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">263. &#8211; The reason for this comfort is that Titus himself was comforted in you, as he told us of
your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me. Here he mentions three praiseworthy things to
counter the three blameworthy things that were in them. For they were lazy in regard to the good;
against this he says, he told us of your longing to make more progress. They were also prone to
evil; against this he says, your mourning, namely for sins committed: &#8220;Make mourning as for an
only son&#8221; (Jer. 6:26). Finally, they were easily deceived by the false apostles; against this he says,
your zeal against the false apostles for love of me. For previously you were zealous for them
against me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">264. &#8211; Then when he says, so that I rejoiced still more, he mentions the feeling he conceived from
Titus&#8217; consolation, namely, one of joy. Hence, in regard to this he does three things: first, he
mentions the joy he felt; secondly, he intimates his doubts; thirdly, the reason for the joy.  He
says therefore: I was so pleased with the things Titus related to me, that I rejoiced still more in
that than I grieved in my tribulations. For spiritual things must be preferred to temporal things.
Or that I rejoiced still more for having saddened you than I sorrowed before. For they had sinned
by fornication, and the Apostle has rebuked them, as is evident from the first epistle (chaps. 5-6).
But at that time he wondered what effect that sadness would have, whether good or bad;
therefore, in his wonder he felt sad. But later, seeing that good had come from it, he was glad.
Hence, he says: For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it now, because you
have been corrected. And though I did regret it before, namely, when I was uncertain whether the
sadness would bring you to correct yourselves or to despair, seeing that that letter grieved you,
though only for a while, now I am glad, because you have been converted.  Then he gives the
reason for his joy, because I am not glad that you were made sorrowful, but at the effect, namely,
your amendment, because you were grieved not unto despair, but you were grieved into
repenting; just as a physician is not glad at the bitterness of the medicine, but at the effect,
namely, health: &#8220;As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:10).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="73"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">7-3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 7:9b-11</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9b For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. 10 For godly
grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but
worldly grief produces death. 11 For see what earnestness this godly grief has
produced in you, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what
alarm, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have
proved yourselves guiltless in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">265. &#8211; Having mentioned the comfort the Apostle and Titus experienced at the grief of the
Corinthians, because it ended in repentance and not in despair, he now gives the reason for his
comfort by commending their sorrow. In regard to this he does two things. First, he commends
their sorrow; secondly, from this he concludes to his intent (v. 12). In regard to the first he does
two things: first, he commends their sorrow on the part of its cause; secondly, on the part of its
effect (v. 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">266. &#8211; The cause on account of which he commends their sorrow is that it was according to God.
Therefore he says: although for a time I was sorry for the epistle, nevertheless I rejoice now, for
you felt a godly grief. Here it should be noted that sorrow and joy and generally every emotion
arise from love; for a person is sad when he lacks what he loves. The kind of love determines the
kind of sorrow it causes. But there are two kinds of love: one by which God is loved, and from
this arises a sorrow which is according to God; the other is that by which the world is loved, and
from this arises a worldly sorrow. The love by which we love God makes us serve him gladly,
honor him carefully and set some time apart for God joyfully. But because sin hinders us from
serving God, we devote no time to him or seek his honor, the love of God causes sorrow for sin:
and this is sorrow according to God. This sorrow was not in you to produce evil and loss, but
fruit and merit. Hence, he says, that you suffered no loss through us, because you profit not only
from the good and pleasant things we bestow on you, but also from the fact that we correct and
sadden you: &#8220;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the
peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it&#8221; (Heb. 12:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">267. &#8211; The when he says, For godly grief, he commends their sorrow because of its effect, which
is the reward of eternal life. In regard to this he does two things. First, he mentions the effect in
general; secondly, what their experience teaches (v. 11). In regard to the first he does two things.
First, he mentions the effect of sorrow which is according to God; secondly, of sorrow which is
according to the world (v. 10b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">268. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that our sorrow was not a loss for you, i.e., for godly grief
produces a repentance, I say, that leads to salvation, i.e., eternal salvation, which is a steadfast
salvation belonging to the blessed: &#8220;But my salvation will be for ever, and my deliverance will
never be ended&#8221; (Is. 51:6); and this is the work of penance: &#8220;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand&#8221; (Matt. 3:2). He says, steadfast, to exclude temporal, which is transitory and common
to men and beasts: &#8220;Man and beasts you save, O Lord&#8221; (Ps. 35:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">269. &#8211; But against what he says, that sadness which is according to God works penance, it seems
that the very sorrow according to God is penance. For penance is sorrow over evil and is
according to God. Therefore it does not work penance.  I answer that penance has three parts, the
first of which is sorrow, namely grief and compunction over sins; the other two are confession
and satisfaction. Therefore, when he says that sorrow works penance, it is to be understood that
compunction or sorrow for sin works penance in us, i.e., the other parts of penance, namely,
confession and satisfaction. Or we might say that sorrow according to God is more common than
penance, because penance is about one&#8217;s own sins, but one sorrows according to God for his own
sins and those of others. Thus, therefore, the effect of sorrow according to God is eternal
salvation, but the effect of sorrow according to the world is death. For since a person who loves
the world is made an enemy of God, as it says in Jas. (4:4), the love of the world causes death.
For a person is sorrowful according to the world, not because he offended God by sin, but
because, being caught in his sin, he is punished for it and exposed; and this sadness should be
avoided in sins (Sir. 30:24, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">270. &#8211; Then (v. 11) he explains this effect from the experience learned from them. As if to say:
a truly steadfast salvation, because it is clear from experience that it works in us many things that
lead to salvation. He mentions six of these things, one of which is general, namely, carefulness.
For when a person is free of care, it is easy for him to become negligent; but when he is sad and
fearful, he is careful. Hence he says, For see, i.e., you have experienced in your own case, what
earnestness this godly grief has produced in you to avoid evil and to do good: &#8220;He has shown
you, O man, what is good&#8221; (Mic. 6:8); and then, &#8220;walk carefully with your God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">271. &#8211; The other five are special: some pertain to internal feeling and some to external action.
Of those that pertain to inward feeling, some are for the removal of sin, and some for the
attainment of good. For a true penitent should depart from evil and do good. In regard to the
removal of evil he lists three, the first of which is to desist from evil; as to this he says, what
eagerness to clear yourselves, against those who induce us to evil: &#8220;Resist him, firm in your
faith&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:9). Or according to a Gloss, to defend me against the false apostle: &#8220;Take the
whole armor of God&#8221; (Eph. 6:13). The second is that a man be indignant against himself for the
sins he has committed; as to this he says, what indignation. For indignation at oneself works
sorrow according to God: &#8220;And my wrath upheld me&#8221; (Is. 63:5). The third is that he live in
continual fear of the future, so as to be wary; as to this he says, what alarm at falling again,
namely, that the same thing might happen in the future: &#8220;The fear of God came upon all&#8221; (Sir.
25:14, Vulgate). As to the attainment of good he lists two things. The first is desire for what is
good; as to this he says, what longing [desire], by which a man is inclined to do good: &#8220;The
desire of the righteous ends only in good&#8221; (Prov. 11:23). Secondly, good rivalry, by which one
strives to imitate those who are good; as to this he says, what zeal to imitate me and other good
men: &#8220;But earnestly desire the higher gifts&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:31)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">272. &#8211; Of those which pertain to outward action he mentions two. The first is that they take
revenge on themselves for having sinned; and this is useful. For since every evil must be
punished either by man or by God, if he [God] does not punish here, it is better that a man punish
in himself the evil that he has done than that God do it, because as it says in Heb. (10:31): &#8220;It is
a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221; As to this he says, what punishment, i.e.,
because you punish sinners and even yourselves: &#8220;But I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after
preaching to others I myself should be disqualified&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:27); (Is. 26:18).  The second is that
he refrain from sin altogether; hence he says, At every point you have proved yourselves, namely,
with faith leading you, guiltless in the matter, i.e., of being a Christian: &#8220;But as servants of God
we commend ourselves in every way&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:4); &#8220;He chose us in him before the foundation
of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him&#8221; (Eph. 1:4); &#8220;He who walks in the
way that is blameless shall minister to me&#8221; (Ps. 101:6). Or in the matter about which you were
corrected, for the favor you did for the fornicator; but later by punishing and condemning him
you showed that you were undefiled in this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="74"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">7-4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 7:12-16</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">12 So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the
wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your
zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. 13 Therefore we are
comforted. And besides our own comfort we rejoiced still more at the joy of
Titus, because his mind has been set at rest by you all. 14 For if I have expressed
to him some pride in you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said
to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true. 15 And his heart
goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, and the
fear and trembling with which you received him. 16 I rejoice, because I have
perfect confidence in you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">273. &#8211; Here the Apostle assigns the reason why he rejoices over them; then he draws his
conclusion, in which he does two things. First, he discloses the intention he had in writing;
secondly, he reveals the joy he had over their amendment (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">274. &#8211; He says therefore: from the fact that you are undefiled, it is apparent that although I wrote
to you to rebuke you in my epistle, it was not only on account of the one who did the wrong by
staining his father&#8217;s chamber with incest, as it says in 1 Cor. (chap. 5), nor on account of the one
alone who suffered the wrong, namely, on account of the father, as if not on account of the zeal
for revenge only, but I did this that our solicitude might be revealed, which we have for you, i.e.,
that you might know how careful we are for you. And I say this in the sight of God, as an oath
with God as witness: &#8220;For I want you to know how greatly I strive for you&#8221; (Col. 2:1).  Or
another way: I have not written to you only for the sake of him that did the wrong, that he might
be corrected, or for him that suffered it, that he might be placated, but that our solicitude for you
might be revealed, namely, to you who were indignant for the insult and for the punishment
inflicted on the fornicator: be reconciled to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">275. &#8211; Then he concludes to the joy he had at their correction when he says, therefore we were
comforted. As if to say: because I obtained this from writing to you, namely, that you are
corrected, therefore, we were comforted, i.e., we took comfort. For a man is joyful when he
obtains what he desired and intended: &#8220;But by the grace of God&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">276. &#8211; Then when he says, and besides our own comfort, he states the second cause of his
comfort, which is taken from the devotion they showed to Titus. In regard to this he does three
things. First, he mentions the joy he felt at Titus&#8217; joy; secondly, the reason for the joy (v. 14);
thirdly, the matter over which Titus rejoiced (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">277. &#8211; He says, therefore: we did rejoice at your amendment, and besides our own comfort, we
rejoiced still more than we were disturbed by the tribulation, at the joy of Titus: and this because
his mind has been set at rest by you all. For a prelate&#8217;s spirit is refreshed when his subjects are
obedient to him and revere him: &#8220;Refresh my heart in Christ&#8221; (Phlm. 20). Set at rest, I say, by you
all, because all are either amended or there is a hope of amendment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">278. &#8211; He assigns the reason for this joy from two aspects: one is on the part of the Apostle,
namely, because he was found to be truthful. For the Apostle had commended the Corinthians
to Titus before he went to them. But now, because Titus found them to be just as the Apostle had
said, he rejoiced that his words were true. And this is what he says, for if I have expressed to him
some pride in you, by commending you, I was not put to shame, i.e., I do not blush as having said
something false. For when a person is found to be a liar, he is ashamed: &#8220;A man skilled in words
may be hated&#8221; (Sir. 37:20). But just as everything we said to you was true, i.e., as I have preached
the truth to you, so our boasting before Titus has proved true. The other reason is on the part of
the Corinthians. For friends desire that those whom they love be loved by everyone. Therefore,
because Titus loved the Corinthians for their devotion, the Apostle rejoices over this and says,
and his heart goes out all the more to you. As if to say: I not only rejoice because I was found to
be right, but also because his heart, i.e., his charity and great love, goes out all the more to you
than before, because he has seen your progress; or, more abundantly than towards others: &#8220;Put
on then, as God&#8217;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness,
and patience&#8221; (Col. 3:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">279. &#8211; He discloses that the matters over which he rejoiced were their obedience and reverence:
obedience, when he says, as he remembers the obedience of you all; for this also he praised you:
&#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (1 Sam. 15:22); &#8220;Listen to me, your father, O children&#8221; (Sir.
3:1). But their reverence when he says, and the fear, namely, filial and not servile, with fear of
soul and trembling of body with which you received him: &#8220;For I bear you witness that, if
possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me&#8221; (Gal. 4:15). And because
you acted that way toward him, I rejoiced, for I was found to be right and he loves you. Hence,
I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you, not only in good will, but also in good works,
that you will act well in the future: &#8220;In your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that
belong to salvation&#8221; (Heb. 6:9).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 We want you to know, brethren, about the grace of God which has been shown
in the churches of Macedonia, 2 for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance
of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their
part. 3 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their
means, of their own free will, 4 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part
in the relief of the saints&#8212; 5 and this, not as we expected, but first they gave
themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 6 Accordingly we have urged
Titus that as he had already made a beginning, he should also complete among
you this gracious work. 7 Now as you excel in everything&#8212;in faith, in utterance,
in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for us&#8212;see that you excel in
this gracious work also. 8 I say this not as a command, but to prove by the
earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">280. &#8211; Having exhorted them to good in general, he now exhorts them to a particular good,
namely, to contribute to the things being collected for the saints at Jerusalem. For, as it says in
Acts (chap. 5), and suggested in Gal. (2:10), the apostles had charged Paul and Barnabas to
preach the word of salvation to the Gentiles and exhort them to help the saints in Jerusalem, who
having sold all their possessions and placed them at the feet of the apostles, were in dire need.
It is to this that he induces them now, and he does two things. First, he urges them to give;
secondly, he advises them how to give, namely, quickly and generously (chap. 9)  In regard to
the first he does two things. First, he treats of what should be given; secondly, of the ministers
by whom these things will be collected (v. 16).  In regard to the first he does two things. First,
he exhorts them to give; secondly, he rejects any excuse (v. 13). He uses three things to urge
them to give. First, the example of others who gave; secondly, the example of Christ (v. 9);
thirdly, their own benefit (v. 10).  In regard to the first he does three things. First, he gives the
example; secondly, he shows how he was moved by this example (v. 6); thirdly, he suggests that
they follow this example (v. 7).  In regard to the first it should be noted that in order to induce
the Corinthians to contribute generously, he proposes to them the example of the Macedonians
and commends them for two things, namely, their patience in adversity and their generosity in
giving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">281. &#8211; In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle urges them to give alms, so that
their merit may grow. Consequently, he did this at a time when they could merit, namely, in the
time of grace, for that is when alms are meritorious. Therefore he says, We want you to know,
brethren, about the grace, i.e., the gratuitous gift, of God, namely, the bestowing of alms. He calls
this a grace, because every good we do is from God&#8217;s grace. Which grace was not given to them
but to me, namely, inasmuch as it was by my management and care and urging that the
Macedonians were moved to this: &#8220;To me, though I am the very least of all the saints&#8221; (Eph. 3:8).
It was shown, I say, to me in the churches of Macedonia, i.e., among the faithful in Macedonia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">282. &#8211; It was a grace as to two things. First, as to patience, because, i.e., for in a severe test of
affliction, they have had an abundance of joy. Here he lays down the conditions of perfect
patience: one is that a person be constant, so that he will not be cast down by fear of tribulation
or by the very experience of tribulation. Hence he says, for in a severe test of affliction, they were
constant.  The other is that they rejoice in those tribulations, as we read of St. Lawrence. As to
this he says, they had an abundance of joy, i.e., the Macedonians: &#8220;Count it all joy, my brethren,
when you meet various trials&#8221; (Jas. 1:2); &#8220;Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation&#8221;(Rom.
12:12). Or: in a severe test of affliction, not that which they suffered, but which he saw suffered
in Macedonia, they have had an abundance of joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">283. &#8211; Secondly, it is a grace as to their generosity in almsgiving; as to this he says, and their
extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their part. Here he does two things:
first, he mentions their generosity; secondly, he explains what he had said (v. 3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">284. &#8211; He says therefore: not only were they patient in tribulations, namely, the Macedonians,
but they were also liberal, considering their extreme or very noble poverty. According to a Gloss,
the raising of the spirit above temporal things and a contempt for them makes poverty profound.
And so their poverty was very profound, because they did not have riches and scorned them:
&#8220;Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the
kingdom&#8221; (Jas. 2:5). This poverty, I say, overflowed, i.e., grew into riches by giving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">285. &#8211; But the explanation found in this Gloss does not seem to accord with the Apostle&#8217;s
intention; therefore, it must be explained another way. Here it should be noted that there are two
causes which make a man sufficiently ready to give: one is from an abundance of riches, or from
a contempt for riches. Consequently, in a poor man contempt for riches produces the same effect
as abundance in a rich man. Hence he says, their extreme poverty so overflowed, i.e., produced
the effect of abundance, in a wealth of liberality on their part, because their heart was solely on
God. And from this arose their contempt for riches: &#8220;The integrity of the upright guides them&#8221;
(Prov. 11:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">286. &#8211; Then when he says, For they gave according to their means, he explains what he said by
commending their generosity as to three things, namely, as to the quantity given, the will to give,
and the order of giving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">287. &#8211; As to the quantity given, it was beyond their power. Hence, he says: truly I abounded in
riches, for they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, because
they gave so much that they were in need later. Or it might be said, and better, that there is an
internal power of the soul and an external power, namely, the amount of one&#8217;s riches. The
internal power is the soul&#8217;s readiness to give; hence he says, I can testify that of their own free
will that they were willing to give according to the internal power of their soul and beyond the
external power of their riches: &#8220;So you will be laying up a good treasure for yourself against the
day of necessity&#8221; (Tob. 4:9). But on the other hand, whoever gives beyond his power gives
immoderately; therefore, he is not worthy of praise. I answer that power in giving can be
considered in two ways, namely, absolutely and according to a proportion. Therefore, when a
person gives more than others of his proportion, he does not sin; but if he gives absolutely above
his power, then he gives immoderately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">288. &#8211; Thus does he commend their generosity as to the quantity given; but he commends it as
to their will to give, when he says, of their own free will: &#8220;Speak to the people of Israel, that they
take for me an offering; from every man whose heart makes him willing you shall receive the
offering for me&#8221; (Ex. 25:2). They were willing in the sense that they asked us, begging us
earnestly. As if to say: they not only asked, but they induced us by reasons that they might have
the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints, i.e., be allowed to give their own to the poor
saints in Jerusalem, not considering that they were doing a favor for us, but we for them: &#8220;Do not
neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God&#8221; (Heb.
13:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">289. &#8211; He also commends their generosity as to the order of giving, because they not only gave
what they owned, but they first gave themselves. For this should be the order of giving, namely,
that a man be first acceptable to God, for if a man is not pleasing to God, his gifts are not
acceptable: &#8220;And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering&#8221; (Gen. 4:4). Therefore he says,
and this, not as we expected. As if to say: they were truly willing, because not as we expected,
i.e., not with the intention we considered, that is, that they would give in reparation for sin; but
first they gave themselves to the Lord, by amending their life, and to us, by obeying in all things,
by the will of God, which is that man be subject to his vicars: &#8220;Obey your leaders and submit to
them&#8221; (Heb. 13:17).  A Gloss says that their offerings would not have been acceptable, unless
they had first given themselves to God. Therefore, it seems that alms should not be accepted from
sinners. I answer that they should not be accepted, when they are given with the intention of
being nourished in their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">290. &#8211; Having given the example of the Macedonians, he then shows how he was moved by this
example, when he says, Accordingly we have urged Titus. As if to say: we were so moved by this
display of generosity by the Macedonians, that we desired Titus to make you partakers of that
grace, namely, that as Titus had already made a beginning, to urge you to do good after he saw
you amended and to induce you to communion, he should also complete among you, and
particularly that gracious work of giving alms, that it not be lacking to you: &#8220;And I am sure that
he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil.
1:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">291. &#8211; Then when he says, Now as you excel in everything, he urges them to be influenced by
this example. Here he does two things. First, he urges them to be prompted by the example of
the Macedonians to give alms; secondly, he removes a suspicion (v. 8)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">292. &#8211; He says therefore: Now as you excel in everything&#8212;in faith, in utterance, in knowledge,
in all earnestness, and in your love for us&#8212;see that you excel in this gracious work also. As if
to say: just as you surpass the Macedonians in all other graces, so you should surpass them in
this, namely, in giving alms. And this is what he says: as you excel in all other things: first, in
things pertaining to the intellect; and as to this he says, in faith, by which they believe, and in
utterance, by which they confess: &#8220;For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he
confesses with his lips and so is saved&#8221; (Rom. 10:10); in knowledge of the Scriptures: &#8220;In every
way you were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:5).  Secondly, in
things pertaining to works; as to this he says, in all earnestness, namely, in doing good: &#8220;Never
flag in zeal&#8221; (Rom. 12:11)  Thirdly, in things pertaining to the effect; as to this he says, and in
your love spiritually dwelling in us superabundantly: &#8220;And above all these put on love, which
binds everything together in perfect harmony&#8221; (Col. 3:14). As, I say, you abound in all those
things, so I asked Titus to see that in this gracious work, namely, of alms, you may also excel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">293. &#8211; But because there might be a suspicion that he was ordering them to give alms, contrary
to what is stated in Ezek. (34:4): &#8220;With force and harshness you have ruled them,&#8221; he removes
this, saying: I say this not as a command, i.e., what I asked Titus, or the fact that I say this to you,
I did not do as though commanding: &#8220;Not as domineering over those in your charge but being
examples to the flock&#8221; (1 Pet. 5:3). But I say this to prove, i.e., desiring to prove, by the
earnestness of others, namely, the Macedonians, that your love also is genuine.  Here it should
be noted that a good disposition refers not only to an aptitude to learn easily, but also to acting
well, the reason being that in order to act well, a knowledge which directs is necessary.
Therefore, just as in learning, a person is said to have a good disposition, if he quickly grasps the
words of the teacher, so in doing good a person is said to have a good disposition, if he is quickly
moved to do good by the example of others. That is why the Apostle says, to prove that your love
also is genuine, i.e., how prompt a will you have for giving when moved by the example of the
Macedonians: &#8220;I do not write this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved
children&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:14). </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="82"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">8-2</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet
for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich. 10
And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you now to complete what a
year ago you began not only to do but to desire, 11 so that your readiness in
desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have. 12 For
if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not
according to what he has not. 13 I do not mean that others should be eased and
you burdened, 14 but that as a matter of equality your abundance at the present
time should supply their want, so that their abundance may supply your want, that
there may be equality. 15 As it is written, &#8220;He who gathered much had nothing
over, and he who gathered little had no lack.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">294. &#8211; Here he uses the example of Christ to induce the Corinthians to give alms, saying: I wish
to approve your good disposition, namely, for giving to the poor, and you should do this by
reason of Christ&#8217;s example. For, that is, because you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which he conferred on the human race: &#8220;Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (Jn. 1:17).
This is called grace, because whatever the Son of God assumed of our punishments, all must be
imputed to grace, because he was not anticipated by anyone&#8217;s goodness, or compelled by
anyone&#8217;s power, or induced by any necessity of his own. But it is grace, because he for your sake
he became poor [needy]. He says, needy, which is more than poor; for a needy person is one who
not only has very little, but is destitute; but a poor man is one who has a little. Therefore, to
signify the extent of his poverty, he says, he became poor [needy], namely, in temporal things:
&#8220;The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head&#8221; (Lk. 9:58); &#8220;Remember my affliction&#8221; (Lam.
3:19). He was made needy not from necessity but willingly, because that grace would not then
be a grace. Hence he says, though he was rich, namely, in spiritual goods: &#8220;The same Lord is
Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him&#8221; (Rom. 10:12); &#8220;Riches and honor
are with me&#8221; (Prov. 8:18). He says, being, and not &#8220;having been,&#8221; lest it seem that Christ lost his
spiritual riches when he assumed poverty. For he assumed this poverty in such a way that he did
not lose those inestimable riches: &#8220;Both rich and poor together&#8221; (Ps. 49:2). Rich is spiritual
things, poor in temporal things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">295. &#8211; The reason he willed to be made needy is added, when he says, so that by his poverty you
might become rich, i.e., that through his poverty in temporal things, you might become rich in
spiritual things. And this for two reasons: for an example and for a sacrament. For an example,
indeed, because if Christ loved poverty, we also should love it because of his example. But by
loving poverty in temporal things, we are made rich in spiritual things: &#8220;Has not God chosen
those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has
promised to those who love him?&#8221; (Jas. 2:5). This is why he says, so that by his poverty you
might become rich.  For the sacrament, however, because everything Christ did or endured was
for our sake. Hence, just as by the fact that he endured death, we were delivered from eternal
death and restored to life, so by the fact that he suffered need in temporal things, we have been
delivered from need in spiritual things and made rich in spiritual things: &#8220;That in every way you
were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">296. &#8211; Then when he says, And in this matter I give my advice, he induces them to give on their
part. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows the benefit they will obtain from this;
secondly, he shows that this is desired from itself, namely, that they would give alms (v. 10b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">297. &#8211; He says therefore: considering this benefit, I give my advice, i.e., I urge you to give alms
not only for the benefit of the saints in Jerusalem but also for your benefit: &#8220;The good counsels
of a friend are sweet to the soul&#8221; (Prov. 27:9, Vulgate). And this is because it is best for you. For
the good of piety is more beneficial to the doer than to the one to whom it is done, because the
doer obtains a spiritual benefit from it, but the recipient a temporal one. And just as the spiritual
is preferred to the temporal, in works of piety the profit to the giver is preferred to the benefit of
the recipient: &#8220;Godliness is of value in every way&#8221; (1 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">298. &#8211; But this is not only profitable to them, but they also wanted this; hence he says, now to
complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire. Here he does three things. First,
he reminds them of their good start; secondly, he urges them to the due end (v. 11); thirdly, he
explains something he had said (v. 12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">299. &#8211; He says therefore: in truth you should give alms gladly, because this is not only profitable
to you, but you began not only to do but to desire this spontaneously, namely, to give alms, a year
ago, i.e., before I came to you. As if to say: it is better to will than to do: &#8220;So a word is better than
a gift&#8221; (Sir. 18:16). Therefore, you should be eager to give.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">300. &#8211; And because you are eager to give, therefore, now complete in deed what you had in your
intention; otherwise that willingness is in vain: &#8220;Let us not love in word or speech but in deed
and in truth&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:18); &#8220;And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to
completion at the day of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:6). The reason for this is so that your readiness in
desiring it, i.e., the judgment of your will, according to a Gloss is prompt, may be matched by
your completing it. Or another way, so that mind is taken for will, and then the sense is: as you
were prompt in willing, so be prompt in accomplishing, and this out of what you have, i.e.,
according to your means.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">301. &#8211; Then he explains what he means by out of what you have, saying, For if the readiness is
there, it is acceptable according to what a man has. As if to say: I say that you should be prompt
to give, but I do not wish to burden you in this matter, namely, that you would give beyond your
means, because perhaps your will inclines you to this; but in this matter the work cannot follow
the will. Therefore he says, out of what you have. For, i.e., because, if the readiness is there, it
is acceptable according to what a man has, the reason being that the will is accepted in the
accomplishment of the work; but the work is not perfected except from what a man has; hence
he says, it is acceptable according to what a man has: &#8220;If you have much, give generously; if you
have a little, then try to impart a little gladly&#8221; (Tob. 4:9, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">302. &#8211; Then when he says, I do not mean, he removes a suspicion. For someone could say: if we
give alms to the saints in Jerusalem, they will live in idleness, while we suffer a loss and become
wretched. Therefore the Apostle first removes the suspicion; secondly he shows his intention (v.
13b); thirdly, he confirms it by authority (v. 14b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">303. &#8211; He removes this suspicion when he says, I do not mean that others should be eased and
you burdened. As if to say: I do not urge you to give alms in order that others might be refreshed,
as they live in idleness off your alms, while you are burdened, impoverished, because you would
be afflicted.  But do they commit sin who give everything to others and they are later afflicted
with poverty? It seems so from these words of the Apostle. I answer that according to a Gloss,
it would be better to give all to the poor and be afflicted with Christ. But what the Apostle says
here is out of condescension, because they were weak and might perhaps have fallen away if they
were pressed by need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">304. &#8211; He discloses his intention when he says, but that as a matter of equality your abundance
at the present time should supply their want. As if to say: I do not seek your affliction, but an
equality, namely, that your abundance supply their want. This can explained in three ways. First,
as an equality of quantity; secondly, an equality of proportion; thirdly, an equality of the will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">305. &#8211; An equality of quantity, because they, i.e., the Corinthians, abounded in temporal things
and were wanting in spiritual things; but the saints in Jerusalem abounded in spiritual things and
were lacking in temporal things. Therefore he desired that an equality of quantity be established
between them, namely, that those who abounded in temporal things give half of everything to
those in need of them, while the others should give half of their spiritual things to them, so that
they would be equally rich. Therefore, he says rather, that as a matter of equality of quantity, i.e.,
from a half-share of your goods at the present time, which is short, let your abundance of earthly
goods supply their want in spiritual goods, i.e., that you may be partakers of eternal life: &#8220;Make
friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon&#8221; (Lk. 16:9); &#8220;In dividing the lot, give
and take&#8221; (Sir. 14:15); i.e., give temporal things and accept spiritual things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">306. &#8211; As an equality of proportion it is explained in the following way, and better: you
Corinthians have an abundance of temporal goods, but the saints of Jerusalem an abundance of
spiritual goods. I wish, therefore, that as a matter of equality, not according to quantity, but
according to proportion, namely, that as they are sustained by your alms, so may you be enriched
by their prayers to God. For just as they are not as rich in your temporal goods as you are rich,
so neither are you as rich in their spiritual goods as they are. And so he says: but by an equality
in the present time your abundance of earthly things should supply their want of earthly good,
so that their abundance of spiritual things may supply your want: &#8220;If we have sown spiritual good
among you, is it too much if we reap your material benefits?&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">307. &#8211; It is explained as an equality of will in this way: but by an equality your abundance at the
present time should supply their want, i.e., I desire an equality of will to be in you, that just as
they are willing to communicate to you the things in which they abound, so you would have the
will to communicate to them the things in which you abound.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">308. &#8211; Then he confirms this with an authority; hence he says, As it is written, namely in Ex.
(16:18): &#8220;He who gathered much&#8221;, i.e., had collected more manna than an omer, &#8220;had nothing
over&#8221;, i.e., did not have more than his sufficiency; &#8220;and he who gathered little had no lack&#8221;, i.e.,
he did not fall short of it, because all had an equal abundance, as it says in Ex. (16:18). And so
neither he who had collected more had more, nor he who had prepared less, discovered less.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16 But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of
Titus. 17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he
is going to you of his own accord. 18 With him we are sending the brother who
is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel; 19 and not only
that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious
work which we are carrying on, for the glory of the Lord and to show our good
will. 20 We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we
are administering, 21 for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord&#8217;s sight
but also in the sight of men. 22 And with them we are sending our brother whom
we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more
earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you. 23 As for Titus, he is my
partner and fellow worker in your service; and as for our brethren, they are
messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. 24 So give proof, before the
churches, of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">309. &#8211; After dealing with the collections, to which they should contribute, the Apostle then deals
with the ministers by whom the collections should be made. In regard to this he does two things.
First, he names them; secondly, he recommends them to the Corinthians (v. 24). In regard to the
first he does three things. First, he names Titus; secondly, Barnabas (v. 18); thirdly, Apollos (v.
22). Concerning Titus he commends two things, namely, his earnest care and the sign of his
earnest care (v. 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">310. &#8211; He says therefore, in regard to Titus: I have said above that I have asked Titus to prove
that grace collecting alms, because it has a bearing on the care entrusted to me by the apostles,
in which I have also found him careful. But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for
you into the heart of Titus, as I have, for exhorting you and promoting you to works of mercy,
because he is as solicitous as I to prove this grace for you: &#8220;And we desire each one of you to
show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end&#8221; (Heb. 6:11); &#8220;The
leader, in diligence&#8221; (Rom. 12:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">311. &#8211; But the sign of this carefulness is that when I asked him, he consented to my exhortation;
hence he says, For he not only accepted our appeal, and because he carried out what I asked;
hence he says, but being himself very earnest, of his own accord more than by my exhortation,
he is going to you, although at first he refused to go on account of your sins: &#8220;Never flag in zeal&#8221;
(Rom. 12:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">312. &#8211; Then when he says, With him we are sending the brother, he treats of the second minister.
In regard to this he does two things. First, he commends him; secondly, he gives the reason why
he is sending such earnest messengers (v. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">313. &#8211; This brother, according to some, is Luke, and according to others, Barnabas. Whoever it
is, he recommends him on three points, namely, on his reputation, because of his fame, that is,
Luke&#8217;s, is in the gospel written by him among all the churches, because it was approved by the
apostles. Or whose fame, namely, Barnabas&#8217;, is in the preaching of the gospel among all the
churches, because he preached to Jews and Gentiles. Hence it is said of Barnabas in Acts (4:38),
that he was a good man, full of faith and the Holy Spirit.  He also commends him on his
companionship, because not only that, i.e., not only is he famous, but he has been appointed by
the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, i.e., of my preaching, for which we traveled
as pilgrims over the world: &#8220;We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from
the Lord&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:6). And this is true of Luke, because he was one of the seventy-two disciples
and a companion of Paul. It is also true of Barnabas, because it was said by the Holy Spirit in
Acts (13:2): &#8220;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221; And
he was made a companion for this gracious work, namely, to collect the alms, of for this gracious
work of preaching, of which it says in Eph. (3:8): &#8220;To me, though I am the very least of all the
saints.&#8221;  He also commends him from his office, because he is a minister of grace which we are
carrying on: &#8220;This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1); &#8220;Who has
made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:6). But that grace is
administered for the glory of the Lord, namely, that our Lord be glorified by the alms collected
after the conversion of many people by our preaching, because, as it says in Prov. (14:28): &#8220;In
a multitude of people is the glory of a king.&#8221; Likewise it is administered in order that our will be
fulfilled, because we want this to be done; hence, he says, and to show our good will, i.e.,
predestined by God, who from eternity predestined us to have such a will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">314. &#8211; Then when he says, We intend, he assigns the cause for why he is sending such solemn
messengers. First, he assigns the reason for this; secondly, he proves it (v. 21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">315. &#8211; He says therefore: the reason we are sending such solemn messengers is this, that you may
know that this affair is in our heart. Hence he says, We intend that no one should blame us. As
if to say: to avoid the accusation that could be lodged against us by others either for negligence,
if we did not send solemn messengers, or of fraud, if we did not send trustworthy men. But they
are energetic and prompt and trustworthy, because they were given by the churches and chosen
by the Holy Spirit: &#8220;We put no obstacle in any one&#8217;s way, so that no fault may be found with our
ministry&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:3). But he says, about this liberal gift, namely, of alms, or of converted
Gentiles: &#8220;As each has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God&#8217;s
varied grace&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">316. &#8211; Then he proves this, saying: for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord&#8217;s sight
but also in the sight of men, namely, that the good works may be seen by them. And he does this
by providing carefully and by imitating good men: &#8220;Let love be genuine; hate what is evil, hold
fast to what is good&#8221; (Rom. 12:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">317. &#8211; Then when he says, And with them we are sending our brother, he deals with the third
messenger, namely, Apollos, and he does two things. First, he commends him for his diligence,
when he says, whom, namely, Apollos, we have often tested and found earnest in many matters
for your salvation, but who is now more earnest than ever. For as is apparent above, Apollos was
the first one after the Apostle to preach to the Corinthians: &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the growth&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:6). But being disturbed at their sin, he departed and put aside the
carefulness he had previously for them. But now, hearing of their conversion, he became more
diligent than ever for their salvation: &#8220;Eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace&#8221; (Eph. 4:3); &#8220;The leader, in diligence&#8221; (Rom. 12:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">318. &#8211; Secondly, he discloses the cause of the diligence he assumed, because Apollos is confident
of you from the things Titus has said about you, commending you. Hence, he says, because of
his great confidence in you. As for Titus, he is my partner, and because he gladly went in
fellowship with Titus and Luke, or Barnabas, and because he was induced to do this by the
apostles of the Church, who are in Judea. And therefore he says: as for our brethren, they are
messengers of the churches of Judea, that is, they induced him to have a care for you; which
churches are the glory of Christ, i.e., to the glory of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">319. &#8211; Then when he says, so give proof, he recommends those messengers to the Corinthians,
saying: because I have sent such men to you, so give proof, before the churches, of your love and
of our boasting about you to these men, i.e., show by your deeds that you have charity toward
them, and that he has truthfully commended you, and that he was right in boasting about you,
before the churches, where I have been and to whom I have preached; or: before the churches,
because what you do to them will be made known to all the churches.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="91"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">9-1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 9:1-7</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints, 2
for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia,
saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up
most of them. 3 But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may
not prove vain in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be; 4
lest if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we be
humiliated&#8212;to say nothing of you&#8212;for being so confident. 5 So I thought it
necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance
for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as
a willing gift. 6 The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must do as he
has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a
cheerful giver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">320. &#8211; Having exhorted the Corinthians to give alms to the saints in Jerusalem, the Apostle now
admonishes them how to give, namely, cheerfully and abundantly. Hence, in order that they
might give properly, he has sent them important messengers. In regard to this he does two things.
First, he excludes the supposed cause for sending the messengers; secondly, he gives the true one
(v. 3). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he excludes a suspicion; secondly, he
assigns the cause for this (v. 2); thirdly, he proves the cause (v. 2b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">321. &#8211; As to the first, because someone could say to the Apostle: you urge us to receive your
messengers cordially, but why do you not rather urge us to give alms properly. Therefore,
rejecting this, he says: it is not necessary for me to urge this now, i.e., because, it is superfluous
for me to write to you about the offering for the saints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">322. &#8211; And the reason for this is because I know your readiness to help them: &#8220;My heart is
steadfast, O God&#8221;(Ps. 108:1). That your mind is ready I prove by two things. First, from our
boasting of you, for unless I knew that you were ready for this, I would not have boasted to them
about you. Therefore he says, of which, namely, the promptitude of your mind: &#8220;For our boast
is this, the testimony of our conscience&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:12); &#8220;I have great confidence in you&#8221; (2 Cor.
7:4). I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia, in which Corinth is the
metropolis, has been ready since last year to give.  Secondly, from the effect, because you have
provoked many to do this by your example. Hence he says, and your zeal, i.e., the desire to
imitate you, has stirred up most of them, for since they heard of your progress after your
amendment, many were provoked to make progress: &#8220;Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens
another&#8221; (Prov. 27:17); &#8220;For a good purpose it is always good to be made much of&#8221; (Gal. 4:18);
&#8220;But earnestly desire the higher gifts&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:31).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">323. &#8211; Then when he says, But I am sending the brethren, he establishes the true cause for why
he was sending such solemn messengers. First, he lays down the general reason; secondly, the
special reason (v. 3b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">324. &#8211; Concerning the first he does two things. First, he assigns the true cause, saying: the reason
why I have sent them is not that I believe you are not willing to help the poor, but that our
boasting about you may not prove vain, if you should fail: &#8220;For I would rather die than have any
one deprive me of my ground for boasting&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:15). That it not be made void, I say, in this
case, because it is evident to me that in the other virtues and good deeds you will not void by
glory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">325. &#8211; Secondly, when he says, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be, he urges them
to give in the proper way. First, he urges them to give readily; secondly, that they may give
abundantly (v. 5); thirdly, that they may give cheerfully (v. 7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">326. &#8211; In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions how to give; secondly, he
assigns the reason (v. 4). The way to give is promptly; hence he says, I sent the ministers so that
you may be ready, as I said you would be, namely, after the example of the Macedonians: &#8220;And
those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast&#8221; (Matt. 25:10); &#8220;Do not say to your
neighbor, &#8216;Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">it&#8217; &#8211; when you have it with you&#8221; (Prov. 3:28). The reason for this is lest if some Macedonians
come with me and find that you are not ready, we be humiliated. As if to say: it will be to your
shame if you have promised and not paid. But even if you can stand it and you do not care about
your shame, at least think of our embarrassment, who say that you are prepared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">327. &#8211; Then when he says, So I thought it necessary, he urges them to give abundantly. In regard
to this he does two things. First, he gives the admonition; secondly, he gives the reason for it (v.
6)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">328. &#8211; He says therefore: lest our boasting be voided and you be put to shame, I thought it
necessary to urge the brethren, namely, Titus and Apollos, to go on to you before me, and arrange
in advance for this gift [blessing] you have promised, namely, the alms, which is called a blessing
because it is a cause of eternal blessedness. For by the act of giving a man is blessed by the Lord:
&#8220;He will receive blessing from the Lord&#8221; (Ps. 24:4); and by men: &#8220;The lips of many shall bless
him that is liberal of his bread&#8221; (Sir. 31:28, Vulgate); &#8220;He who has a bountiful eye will be
blessed&#8221; (Prov. 22:9). And he calls this a blessing to be prepared, as a willing gift, i.e.,
abundantly, not as an exaction, i.e., not sparingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">329. &#8211; The reason why they should give abundantly is because, I say, he who sows sparingly, i.e.,
who gives little in this world, will also reap sparingly, i.e., will receive little in the other world.
And he says, sows, because our seeds are whatever good we do; and again, if little is sown, not
much is gathered: &#8220;For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption&#8221; (Gal.
6:8); but multiplied: And he who sows bountifully, i.e., abundantly, will also reap bountifully,
i.e., the generous reward of God.  But will not all reap abundantly? Yes, as to the quantity of the
reward, because all will abound and no one will reap sparingly. But he says, bountifully, in
proportion to those sowing well: &#8220;Star differs from star in glory&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:41). All will reap
abundantly as to the substantial reward, but sparingly as to the accidental reward, in which the
saints will differ: &#8220;As it is written, &#8216;He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who
gathered little had no lack&#8217;&#8221; (2 Cor. 8:15), because sometimes a person gives sparingly and with
great charity, and reaps abundantly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">330. &#8211; Then when he says, each one must do, he exhorts them to give cheerfully and joyfully. In
regard to this he does two things. First, he urges them to give joyfully; secondly, he gives the
reason (v. 7b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">331. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that you should prepare what you intend to give as a gift, i.e.,
abundantly, and as worthy of a blessing, and not as an exaction, i.e., not sparingly. He says this,
because what is done spontaneously cannot be done with covetousness. Therefore he adds, Each
one must do as he has made up his mind, as though without covetousness, because each one of
you should give his alms as he has made up, i.e., decided beforehand, in his mind [heart], namely,
conferring with himself. Not reluctantly or under compulsion: as if to say: let each one give
willingly, not as being forced. Here he mentions the two things opposed to a voluntary action,
namely, sadness and necessity. For a voluntary action is destroyed by violence, which is of two
kinds, namely, simple and mixed. It is simple, when someone is absolutely compelled to do
something against his will. To remove that violence he says, not reluctantly, which would be
present if they gave as though compelled by the command of the Apostle. As if to say: do not
permit my command to compel you to give, but let your ready will move you to do this:
&#8220;Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the Lord&#8217;s offering&#8221; (Ex. 35:5). But a mixed
violent action happens when one is not absolutely forced to do something against his will, but
in a qualified sense, namely, that he would incur great harm, unless he did it; for example, if a
ship would sink, unless the cargo were thrown overboard. Therefore in one sense it is done
willingly, and in another sense by force, inasmuch as he is compelled by fear of a greater loss.
Therefore, to remove this he says, not under compulsion, i.e., not making it a mixed violent
action. As if to say: not from fear of shame, but from the joy you have conceived because of the
love you have towards the saints: &#8220;With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to thee&#8221; (Ps. 54:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">332. &#8211; Then when he says, For God loves a cheerful giver, he gives the reason, which is this:
everyone who rewards gives a reward for things worthy of a reward; but only acts of the virtues
are such. But in the acts of the virtues there are two elements, namely, the species of the act and
the manner of acting, which is taken on the side of the one acting. Hence, unless both are found
in an act of virtue, that act is not said to be absolutely virtuous, just as a person is not said to be
perfectly just according to the virtue, when he does works of justice, unless he acts with delight
and with joy.  And although with men, who see only what is obvious, it is enough that one
perform an act of justice according to the very species of the act, say an act of justice;
nevertheless, with God, who sees the heart, it is not enough merely to perform the act of a virtue
according to the species, but he must also act according to the proper manner, namely, with
delight and joy. Therefore, it is not the giver, but the cheerful giver that God loves, i.e., approves
and rewards, and not the sad and grumbling one: &#8220;Serve the Lord with gladness&#8221; (Ps. 100:2);
&#8220;For the Lord is the one who repays&#8221; (Sir. 35:11); &#8220;He who does acts of mercy, with
cheerfulness&#8221; (Rom. 12:8).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8 And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you
may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every
good work. 9 As it is written, &#8220;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his
righteousness endures for ever.&#8221; 10 He who supplies seed to the sower and bread
for food will supply and multiply your resources and increase the harvest of your
righteousness. 11 You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which
through us will produce thanksgiving to God; 12 for the rendering of this service
not only supplies the wants of the saints but also overflows in many thanksgivings
to God. 13 Under the test of this service, you will glorify God by your obedience
in acknowledging the gospel of Christ, and by the generosity of your contribution
for them and for all others; 14 while they long for you and pray for you, because
of the surpassing grace of God in you. 15 Thanks be to God for his inexpressible
gift!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">333. &#8211; Here he gives the reason for the three ways of giving. In regard to this he does two things.
First, he assigns the reason taken on their part; secondly, the reason taken on God&#8217;s part (v. 11).
In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the reason; secondly, he confirms it (v.
9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">334. &#8211; The reason is this: whoever gives something which is multiplied for him should give
promptly, abundantly and cheerfully, just as when we see men sowing seed abundantly and
promptly and cheerfully, because they gather it up again multiplied. Since therefore alms are
multiplied for those who give them, you should give them promptly, joyfully and abundantly.
That they are multiplied is evident, because God is able to provide you with every blessing. As
if to say: do not be afraid to give, as though you will be burdened with need and regret having
given, because God is able to provide you with every blessing of the Holy Spirit in abundance,
namely, the grace by which you will always rejoice in the good work you have done. He says
therefore, so that you may always be provided in abundance for every good work, i.e., have an
abundant will to give alms, just s you have for the other works of the virtues, and also that you
have a full sufficiency of external goods; hence he says, always having enough of everything, i.e.,
considering yourself to have: &#8220;He gives to all men generously and without reproaching, and it
will be given him&#8221; (Jas. 1:5); &#8220;But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content&#8221;
(1 Tim. 6:8).  Of that sufficiency it says below (2 Cor. 12:9): &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you.&#8221;
But concerning the multiplication it says in Is. (30:25): &#8220;And he will give rain for the seed with
which you sow the ground&#8221;; &#8220;And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father
or mother or children or lands, for my name&#8217;s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal
life&#8221; (Matt. 19:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">335. &#8211; Then when he says, As it is written, he proves his reason in two ways, namely, by
authority and from experience. He proves it by an authority when he says: rightly should this
reason move you, because, As it is written, &#8220;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his
righteousness endures for ever.&#8221; But a Gloss adduces this authority in a sense different from the
Apostle&#8217;s intention; for the Gloss says: I say that you shall abound for every good work, namely,
by the giving of alms, because, As it is written, &#8220;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor.&#8221; But
the Apostle wishes to refer this to his statement that God is able to make every grace abound in
you; and this, because he who scattered abroad and given to the poor, his justice remains forever:
&#8220;Do good to a godly man, and you will be repaid&#8221; (Sir. 12:2).  In the authority cited we note to
whom should be given, namely, to the poor, i.e., to the needy: &#8220;When you give a dinner or a
banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors, lest they
also invite you in return, and you be repaid&#8221; (Lk. 14:12); how to give, namely, he scatters abroad,
i.e., not all to one person, but divided among many: &#8220;If I give away all I have&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:3); &#8220;Is
it not to share your bread with the hungry&#8221; (Is. 58:7); his righteousness [justice], i.e., the reward
for justice, endures forever: &#8220;But one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward&#8221; (Prov. 11:18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">336. &#8211; He confirms his reason by experience when he says, He who supplies seed to the sower
and bread for food. As if to say: you know from experience that what you give in alms you have
from the Lord; therefore you should give gladly for the love of God: &#8220;For all things come from
you, and of your own have we given you&#8221; (1 Ch. 29:14).  He suggests three things in regard to
this. The first is that someone could say: if we give now what we have, what is necessary for
daily food will be wanting to us. But he rejects this, saying: he not only supplies seed to the
sower, but bread for food, i.e., the necessities of life: &#8220;He who gives food to all flesh&#8221; (Ps.
136:24). The second is that they could say: if we give much, we will not have enough to give
again. The Apostle answers this, saying that they will not want, but he will multiply your sowing,
from which you can give more alms. The third is that someone could say: if we give now, the will
to give will be lost, and we will regret having given, and so we shall lose everything. But he
removes this, saying: he will increase the harvest of your righteousness [justice], i.e., he will
increase the ability to give alms and the will from which your justice proceeds, to such a degree
that you will always be prepared and ready to give alms, and the fruit will be the most in
comparison with the small seed: &#8220;Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first fruits
of all your produce&#8221; (Prov. 3:9); &#8220;I will command my blessing upon you&#8221; (Lev. 25:21);
&#8220;Godliness is of value in every way&#8221; (1 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">337. &#8211; The when he says, You will be enriched in every way, after having assigned the reason
why they should give promptly, abundantly and cheerfully on the part of the donors, he then
assigns the reason on God&#8217;s part, for whom they ought to give. First he assigns the reason they
should give; secondly, he explains it (v. 12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">338. &#8211; In the reason to be assigned, three things are to be considered, the first of which is their
enrichment, which corresponds to what has gone above. For he had said above: he will multiply
your sowing and increase the fruits of your justice; and he recalls the first, saying: You will be
enriched in every way, i.e., both in bodily and spiritual goods: &#8220;That in every way you were
enriched in him&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:5). But lest anyone suppose that his end should be placed in an
abundance of temporal riches or that he should possess spiritual goods in idleness without using
them, he refers this first to another second thing: have great generosity directed by a simple spirit,
so that the giving comes from temporal goods but the simplicity from spiritual goods: &#8220;The
integrity of the upright guides them&#8221; (Prov. 11:13). But this should itself be referred to another
end, namely, to God; therefore he adds in the third place, which, namely, simple abundance,
through us will produce thanksgiving to God: &#8220;Give thanks in all circumstances&#8221; (1 Th. 5:18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">339. &#8211; Then when he says, for the rendering of this service, he explains the reason mentioned
above, namely, how their abundance works thanksgiving to God. First he shows this; secondly,
the reason for thanks (v. 13); thirdly, he breaks out in thanksgiving (v. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">340. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that your abundance works thanksgiving to God, for the rendering
of this service of yours, by which you help the saints, has many good results: &#8220;As a matter of
equality your abundance at the present time should supply their want&#8221; (2 Cor. 8:14).  Not only
does this good follow therefrom, but also the fact that they pray for you and give thanks to God,
proving and approving your service. And this is what he says: but also overflows in many
thanksgivings to God, which are given by many, not only by the perfect, but by the poor believers
who give thanks to God in the Lord, who moves them to this, seeing and approving your
ministry: &#8220;So that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to
many prayers&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">341. &#8211; This thanksgiving is given for three reasons. First, for their faith, which they have
received; hence he says: I say that they abound in thanksgiving, the faithful glorifying God by
your obedience in acknowledging the gospel of Christ, i.e., the confession of your faith, by which
you confess and believe in Christ: &#8220;Let your light so shine before men&#8221; (Matt. 5:16); &#8220;The word
of a man who hears will endure&#8221; (Prov. 21:28).  Secondly, on account of their abundance; hence
he says, glorifying God also for the generosity of your contribution for them, namely, the holy
poor, and for all others, namely, the faithful in need, and given with a simple and pure spirit: &#8220;Let
him who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches&#8221; (Gal. 6:6); and &#8220;Let us
do good to all men&#8221; (Gal. 6:10).  Thirdly, on account of what these saints have from God that
they may give thanks to God; hence he says: glorifying God also in their praying for you, i.e.,
they glorify God for the fact that those holy men pray for you; the men, I say, who are desirous
of seeing you in eternal happiness; and this because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">342. &#8211; From this the Apostle breaks forth in thanksgiving to God, saying: Thanks be to God for
his inexpressible gift!, that is, for the charity which is especially seen in you who even help those
who thus thank God and pray for you. This gift is inexpressible, because it cannot be said how
profitable it is, for &#8220;What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what
God has prepared for those who love him&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:9).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 10:1-6</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1 I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ&#8212;I who
am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am away!&#8212; 2 I
beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such
confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of acting in
worldly fashion. 3 For though we live in the world we are not carrying on a
worldly war, 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly but have divine
power to destroy strongholds. 5 We destroy arguments and every proud obstacle
to the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, 6 being
ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">343. &#8211; After dealing with the good ministers of Christ and of the faith, the Apostle now attacks
false ministers and false apostles. First, he attacks these; secondly, those who, being deceived by
them, have adhered to them (chap. 13). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives
the reason, excusing himself from the task imposed on him; secondly, he gives the evidence for
the fact (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he refuses to make a test; secondly,
he excuses himself with a reason (v. 2b). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
entreats them; secondly, he interjects what is imposed on them by the false apostles (v. 1b);
thirdly, he refuses the test (v. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">344. &#8211; He says therefore: I, Paul, myself, who am urging you and others to give alms; I myself,
I say, entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ. Of the mildness of Christ, Matt.
(11:29) has: &#8220;Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and
you will find rest for your souls&#8221;; of his modesty, Wis. (11:21) has: &#8220;For it is always in your
power to show great strength, and who can withstand the might of your arm?&#8221; For modesty
consists in nothing less than observing the measure in acting.  But he makes special mention of
Christ&#8217;s mildness and modesty, because the false apostles and the Corinthians accused Paul of
acting humbly when he was among them, but when he was absent he wrote very harshly.
Therefore, he mentioned those two qualities of Christ to show that the Apostle also has them and
observes them after the example of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">345. &#8211; Hence, he introduces the vice ascribed to him, saying, I, Paul, myself, i.e., truly humble,
because Paul means humble and quiet: &#8220;For I am the least of the apostles&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:9); hence,
&#8220;I myself&#8221;, i.e., truly Paul: &#8220;But thou art the same&#8221; (Ps. 102:27); &#8220;There is one that humbles
himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit&#8221; (Sir. 19:23); &#8220;For where jealousy and selfish
ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice&#8221; (Jas. 3:16). I, I say, entreat you,
who when face to face with you, i.e., outwardly, as you say, am humble among you, acting
humbly while I am present with you, but when I am away, namely, when there is no fear of being
injured by any of you, am bold toward you, i.e., act boldly, writing harsh epistles to you: &#8220;But
the righteous are bold as a lion&#8221; (Prov. 28:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">346. &#8211; Then when he says, I beg of you, he refuses to make a test. For they believed that the
Apostle acted humbly among them because of fear; hence, he says: you believe so, but I beg of
you&#8212;since you would like to experience whether I, if it were necessary, would do when I am
present as I do in my absence. And so he says: I may not have to show boldness when I am
present, i.e., when I am among you, to do anything, if it is necessary, with such confidence as I
count on showing, i.e., as confidently as I am thought by you to be bold, i.e., to act boldly and
confidently against some uncorrected persons, by rebuking and correcting through letters: &#8220;He
exults in his strength&#8221; (Job 39:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">347. &#8211; Then he excuses himself with a reason, saying: who suspect us of acting in worldly
fashion. As if to say: although I am not willing to justify myself for your sake with a test,
nevertheless, there is a reason at hand to justify me. In regard to this he does three things. First,
he gives the reason why they lay this charge against him; secondly, he destroys the reason (v. 3);
thirdly, he confirms it with a reason (v. 4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">348. &#8211; The reason why this charge is laid to him, namely that he is humble when present but
harsh and severe when absent, is that they consider that the Apostle acts in a worldly manner, i.e.,
walks according to the flesh. And because every person works according to what rules the work,
and the end should be the rule, it follows that everyone directs his own work to the end he
intends. Therefore, those who place their end in carnal goods are said to walk according to the
flesh. And because these things can be taken from them, men who tend to carnal things behave
gently and humbly toward others. Therefore, because they believed that the Apostle walked
according to the flesh, they supposed that this was the reason he behaved humbly among them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">349. &#8211; But this reason is null and void; therefore, he destroys it, saying: For though we live in the
world we are not carrying on a worldly war [according to the flesh]. As if to say: we cannot deny
that we are in the flesh, because in Rom. (8:12) he says: &#8220;So then, brethren, we are debtors, not
to the flesh, to live according to the flesh,&#8221; but that we are ruled according to the flesh, by placing
our end or our intention in carnal goods, this is false, because we are not carrying on a worldly
war, i.e., we do not regulate our life, which is a warfare (Job 7:1) according to the flesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">350. &#8211; That we are not carrying on a worldly war he proves when he says, for the weapons of our
warfare are not worldly [carnal]; and first of all, from the weapons of warfare, as a fighter has
weapons suitable to his warfare. Now it is plain that the weapons of those who fight according
to the flesh, or wage war, are riches, pleasures, and worldly and temporal honors and power. But
since our weapons are not of this sort, for the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but have
divine power [are mighty to God], i.e., according to God or to the honor of God, therefore, we
do not war according to the flesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">351. &#8211; But secondly, when he says, but have divine power to destroy strongholds, he indicates
the power of spiritual armor, which is evident from its threefold effect. The first effect is that
rebellious persons are put to shame by those arms; in regard to this he says, to destroy
strongholds. As if to say: the power of God is quite capable of destroying the rebellious: &#8220;That
he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it&#8221;
(Titus 1:9); &#8220;See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to
break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant&#8221; (Jer. 1:10).  Men fortify
themselves against God in two ways: some with astute plans, such as tyrants, who plot with their
evil designs to destroy the things of God, that they may exercise their tyranny; as to this he says,
we destroy arguments [counsels], namely, of tyrants: &#8220;He takes the wise in their own craftiness&#8221;
(Job 5:13). But others through pride or profundity of their own talent; as to this he says, and
every proud obstacle [height], namely, of their pride: &#8220;Do not be haughty&#8221; (Rom. 12:16), i.e.,
proud things, or by profundity of intellect, both of lawyers and philosophers: &#8220;Neither height nor
depth&#8221; (Rom. 8:39); &#8220;Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes&#8221; (Is. 5:21). Every proud
obstacle to the knowledge of God, i.e., the faith, which is knowledge of God, because they attack
things said about God, namely, the virgin birth and other of God&#8217;s marvels: &#8220;For the earth shall
be full of the knowledge of the Lord&#8221; (Is. 11:9); &#8220;Who have not learned what some call the deep
things of Satan&#8221; (Rev. 2:24); &#8220;So do not become proud, but stand in awe&#8221; (Rom. 11:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">352. &#8211; The second effect is the conversion of unbelievers to the faith; as to this he says, and take
every thought captive to obey Christ. This happens when a man submits all he knows to the
ministry of the Christ and of the faith: &#8220;To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with
fetters of iron&#8221; (Ps. 149:8); &#8220;Put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her chains&#8221; (Sir.
6:25), i.e., into the teaching of the faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">353. &#8211; The third effect is the correction of sinners; as to this he says, being ready to punish every
disobedience, i.e., having the readiness and free will to punish all disobedience: &#8220;And two-edged
swords in their hands&#8221; (Ps. 149:6). This will occur when your obedience is complete, i.e., when
you are perfectly obedient, because if you are willing to obey, there will be no reason for
punishing the disobedience of others and your own. Or we shall take revenge on disobedience,
when your obedience is complete, i.e., when your disobedience shall be destroyed; for contraries
are cured by contraries.</p>

<A NAME="102"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">10-2</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7 Look at what is before your eyes. If any one is confident that he is Christs, let
him remind himself that as he is Christs, so are we. 8 For even if I boast a little
too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for
destroying you, I shall not be put to shame. 9 I would not seem to be frightening
you with letters. 10 For they say, &#8220;His letters are weighty and strong, but his
bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.&#8221; 11 Let such people
understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. 12 Not
that we venture to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend
themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare
themselves with one another, they are without understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">354. &#8211; Above, the Apostle excused himself by reason; here he excuses himself by the evidence
of the fact. In this regard he does two things. First, he submits his excuse to his hearers to judge;
secondly, he pursues his cause (v. 7b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">355. &#8211; He says therefore: although reason shows that the charge laid against me by the false
apostles is false, nevertheless, if some among you are not convinced by reason and refuse to
acquiesce to it, at least look at, i.e., consider, the things that are before your eyes, i.e., that are
evident, concerning me. But he submits the judgment of his cause to them in order to indicate
how secure he is in his heart: &#8220;Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done&#8221; (Job. 6:29).  But this is
contrary to Jn. (7:24): &#8220;Do not judge by appearances.&#8221; Therefore it is not proper for him to say,
what is before your eyes. I answer that the phrase, what is before your eyes [according to outward
appearance], is taken there for things that appear outwardly in a man, namely, for that which
appear to be true, according to which a man should not judge, because sometimes the contrary
is present in the heart: &#8220;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing but
inwardly are ravenous wolves&#8221; (Matt. 7:15). But here it is taken for the Gospel&#8217;s truth itself and
the evidence of the fact according to which judgment can be made.  A Gloss explains it another
way, namely, according to outward appearance, i.e., of the false apostles, see, i.e., look to. As if
to say: consider the facts about them, because it is impossible that among the many good things
they pretend they not do some things from which you can recognize their wicked intention: &#8220;Thus
you will know them by their fruits&#8221; (Matt. 7:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">356. &#8211; Then when he says, For even if I boast, he pursues his cause. But it sometimes happens
that a person is moved against someone because the former is deceived by the authority of
someone who gives himself out as being great. This is the way the Corinthians, deceived by the
false apostles who claimed greater authority than Paul, were stirred up against him, because they
had come from Judea and were among the first converts. Therefore the Apostle does two things.
First, he deflates the authority of those false apostles; secondly, he pursues his cause (v. 9)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">357. &#8211; He says therefore: see this, I say, according to outward appearance, that if any one of the
false apostles is confident that he is Christs on account of some great thing he has done or some
spiritual gift he has received from Christ, let him remind himself, i.e., carefully consider in his
heart, that as he is Christs, so are we. As if to say: whatever is found in them is also found in us;
hence we also should be considered as Christ&#8217;s: &#8220;And I think I have the Spirit of God&#8221; (1 Cor.
7:40); &#8220;Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him&#8221; (Rom. 8:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">358. &#8211; But we are not only Christ&#8217;s, as they are, but we can glory more that we are Christ&#8217;s than
they can. And this is what he says: for even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the
Lord has given us: &#8220;He is a chosen instrument of mine&#8221; (Ac. 9:15); &#8220;For he who worked through
Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles&#8221; (Gal. 2:8).  He
gave me, I say, this special power to convert the Gentiles, for building you up, i.e., the church,
and not for destroying you, as the false apostles do, who abuse the power given to them by using
it for a purpose contrary to that for which it was given. For although the power was given for
building up the Church in faith and charity, they seek their own glory and not Christ&#8217;s;
consequently, they destroy. They did this by preaching that the ceremonies of the Law must be
observed and by making a profit.  Therefore, if I glory more in that power which I have in which
I seek Christ&#8217;s glory, I shall not be put to shame, namely, for such commendation of myself,
because I do not do it for ostentation, but out of necessity, so that by showing that my authority
is great and that of the false apostles null, no man may be deceived by them again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">359. &#8211; Note here that according to Gregory there are two cases in which a person may commend
himself without sinning, namely, when he is provoked by reproaches and is treated with
contempt, and this in order that he not despair, seeing that he is treated with contempt, and be
able to refute his adversaries. This is the way Job commended himself, as it is clear from (27:6),
where he says: &#8220;My heart does not reproach me for any of my days&#8221; Likewise, when a person is
preaching the truth and an adversary of the truth contradicts him and hinders the manifestation
of the truth, in that case the preacher should commend himself and show his authority in order
to refute him and draw his hearers to the truth. The Apostle does this in many places and also
here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">360. &#8211; Then when he says, I would not seem to be frightening you, he pursues his cause with the
evidence of the facts. In regard to this he does three things. First, he shows that the charge lad
against him is false; secondly, the reason he says this (v. 12); thirdly, he explains the reason (v.
13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">361. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that, as has been said, it was charged that the
Apostle, when he was present, was humble out of fear or to win their favor; but when he was
absent, he wrote harshly to them. But the Apostle says that this is not so, and that if they would
carefully weigh the things that appear, they would find him to be in fact as he appears in his
epistles; and they can test this, if they wish.  And that is what he says: but that I would not seem
to the false apostles or by you, as it were, to be frightening you, or to make you fearful, with the
letters which we sent to you; which fear we would not cause you when we were present. For they,
namely, the false apostles, say that his letters, namely, Paul&#8217;s, are weighty, i.e., punishing harshly
and severely, and strong, i.e., without fear, but his bodily presence is not such, for it is weak, i.e.,
feeble and humble, and his speech, namely, his preaching and conversation and exhortation, is
of no account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">362. &#8211; But let such people, i.e., who say such things about me, understand this, i.e., know for
certain, that what we say by letter when absent we do when present, i.e., we will be such when
we come to you as we are by epistle when absent, if it is necessary.  Now the reason the Apostle
acted humbly toward them is given in 1 Cor. (2:3): &#8220;And I was with you in weakness and in
much fear and trembling,&#8221; which he did, because they were not firm in faith and he wanted to
strengthen them by the gentleness of his manner. Furthermore, the reason he spoke plain words
and did not preach subtle things to them is suggested in 1 Cor. (3:1): &#8220;But I, brethren, could not
address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ.&#8221; For they were not yet
ready for a more profound doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">363. &#8211; Then when he says, Not that we venture, he indicates the reason behind what he says,
saying: I say that we are not like the false apostles, nor is the charge they lay against us true,
because I do not say any more than I have to say. Hence, he says: Not that we venture, i.e., say
that we are one of them, to class or compare ourselves with, i.e., make ourselves like some, that
is, the false apostles who commend themselves to you only. And yet they are not commended by
others and by their deeds contrary to what is stated in Prov. (27:2): &#8220;Let another praise you, and
not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.&#8221; But when they measure themselves by
one another, and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding. But we
measure ourselves against ourselves, i.e., according to what is in us we measure our deeds and
our statements. As if to say: we say things about ourselves that are proportionate to ourselves,
i.e., in keeping with our deeds: &#8220;But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast
will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor&#8221; (Gal. 6:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">364. &#8211; But on the other hand, he said above (4:2): &#8220;We would commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s
conscience in the sight of God.&#8221; Therefore, it was not proper for him to say what he did. I answer
that it is one thing to commend himself to their conscience and another to their ears. For we
commend ourselves to their ears by words alone; and this is evil. The Apostle and just men
commend themselves in the first way; but in the second way the false apostles and hypocrites.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">13 But we will not boast beyond limit, but will keep to the limits God has
apportioned us, to reach even to you. 14 For we are not overextending ourselves,
as though we did not reach you; we were the first to come all the way to you with
the gospel of Christ. 15 We do not boast beyond limit, in other men&#8217;s labors; but
our hope is that as your faith increases, our field among you may be greatly
enlarged, 16 so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without
boasting of work already done in another&#8217;s field. 17 &#8220;Let him who boasts, boast
of the Lord.&#8221; 18  For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted,
but the man whom the Lord commends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">365. &#8211; Having indicated the reason behind the things he had said, the Apostle now explains that
reason. For he had said that he measures himself by himself and did not go beyond that measure.
But a person could be excessive in two ways in glorying and commending himself. First, in
regard to that about which he glories; for example, if he glories about something he does not
have. Secondly, in regard to that in which he glories; for example, if a person has something from
someone else, but glories in himself as though he has it of himself. Thus the Apostle shows that
he did not go beyond the measure in glorying or praising himself.  In regard to the first he does
three things. First, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it (v. 14); thirdly, he draws the
conclusion (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">366. &#8211; He says therefore: I say that we measure and compare ourselves to ourselves, namely, by
doing what our office demands. But in doing this we will not boast beyond limit [our measure],
i.e., when we exercise our power and commend ourselves: &#8220;You shall do no wrong in judgment,
in measures of length or weight or quantity&#8221; (Lev. 19:35); but will keep to the limits God has
apportioned us.  A Gloss [Lombard] explains this of the limit of the Apostle&#8217;s prelacy and says:
according to the measure, i.e., according to the people measured out to him by God, the people
whose prelate and rule of conduct he is. But this same thing can be taken more universally, such
that the measure of the rule is the quantity of grace. Then the sense is this: but we glory according
to the limits God has apportioned us, i.e., according to the amount of grace God has given us:
&#8220;But grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ&#8217;s gift&#8221; (Eph. 4:7). This
grace is a rule keeping us from being lifted up or separated from God. Which God has
apportioned us, because whatever good we do in preaching the Gospel and in converting you and
others, it is all from God, granted to me for you and others: &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the growth&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:6). A measure, I say, to reach even to you, because you are under the
measure of grace granted to me, by which you have been converted to Christ and obey the
Gospel.  Therefore, what he is proposing is this, namely, that he is not going beyond the measure
of glorying and praising himself that he is their prelate and that they were converted by him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">367. &#8211; That this is so, namely, that it reaches even to them, he proves when he says: For we are
not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. As if to say: of course we glory,
but we do not stretch beyond ourselves in our grace or glory or power, as if we do not reach to
you in our power and ministry: we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of
Christ, i.e., in the preaching of Christ&#8217;s Gospel: &#8220;For I became your father in Christ Jesus through
the Gospel&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:15); &#8220;Are you not my workmanship in the Lord&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:1); &#8220;For he who
worked through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also for the
Gentiles&#8221; (Gal. 2:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">368. &#8211; Therefore he draws the conclusion, saying: therefore, when I glory in you, I am not
glorying beyond measure. Hence he says: We do not boast beyond limit, in other men&#8217;s labours,
where someone else laid the foundation of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">369. &#8211; Then when he says, but our hope is that as your faith increases, our field among you may
be greatly enlarged, he shows that he is not going beyond the measure, when he glories about the
future. But it should be noted that a preacher has two reasons for glorying in his preaching: one
is that those converted by his preaching are making progress; the other is that other people are
converted by his converts, because as it says in Ex. (cf. 36:10): &#8220;Curtain is joined to curtain&#8221;;
&#8220;And let him who hears say, &#8216;Come&#8217;&#8221; (Rev. 22:17). For one is easily converted when he sees
others converted.  In regard to those two things the Apostle hopes that his glorying in the
Corinthians will be increased. First, in regard to their progress; hence he says: I say that we do
not glory beyond measure over your conversion caused by us in the past, but will hope to be
greatly enlarged in the future, i.e., for our glory to be increased in your increasing faith, and in
the progress of your good works: &#8220;Long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up
to salvation&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:2).  Secondly, we hope to be magnified in the conversion of others by you;
therefore he says, abundantly, i.e., in the abundance of preaching not only among you but even
in lands beyond you; and this according to our rule, i.e., according as Christ has enjoined us to
preach not only to you but to all the Gentiles &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the
whole creation&#8221; (Mk. 16:15).  Without boasting of work already done in another&#8217;s field, i.e., we
do not hope to glory, nor do we glory in another man&#8217;s rule. As if to say: not in things prepared
by others, i.e., whom others have brought to the faith, but I will bear fruit among those to whom
others have not preached: &#8220;Thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ
has already been named&#8221; (Rom. 15:20). But to the contrary, Peter preached at Rome before Paul
preached there. I answer that he does not say this as though refusing to preach where another has
preached; but he says that he intends to preach even where no other have preached.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">370. &#8211; Then when he says, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, he shows that he is not going
beyond the measure as to that in which he glories, saying: if I glory in him in whom one should
glory, I am not going beyond. But since one should glory in God, Let him who boasts, boast of
the Lord: &#8220;Let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me&#8221; (Jer. 9:24).  This
can be explained in three ways: in one way, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, so that in the
Lord denotes the object in which he glories. As if to say: let him glory in the fact that he
possesses the Lord by knowing and loving. In another way, Let him who boasts, boast of the
Lord, i.e., according to God; and one glories in this way when he glories in the things of God and
not in evil, as the one who is asked in Ps. (52:1, Vulgate): &#8220;Why do you glory in malice?&#8221; In the
third way, Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord, i.e., let him regard himself as having his glory
from God, referring to God everything that redounds to his own glory: &#8220;What have you that you
did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:7).
This is the way it is taken here when he says: Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord. As if to say:
I glory in the foregoing, but not as though I had this from myself and not from God. And this is
also your measure, because all your good has sprung from us.  And indeed we should glory in the
Lord, not imputing our glory to ourselves, but to God. For it is not the man who commends
himself that is accepted, i.e., approved by God or by men: &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your
own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips&#8221; (Prov. 27:2), but the man whom the Lord
commends, i.e., makes commendable by good works and miracles. For God is the cause of the
entire good done by me.</p>

his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to
Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">371. &#8211; After defending himself against the false charges placed against him by the false apostles,
the Apostle, in order to refute them, that is, the false apostles, and render his own testimony more
honorable, now commends himself to the Corinthians. In regard to this he does two things. First,
he assigns the reason for his commendation; secondly, he makes the commendation (v. 21b). In
regard to the first he does three things. First, he asks that they bear with his foolishness; secondly,
he states why he must commend himself in order not to seem foolish (v. 2); thirdly, he suggests
that, granted he is foolish, they should bear with it (v. 16). In regard to the first he does two
things. First, he mentions his desire so that his request may be easier to grant; secondly, he makes
the request (v. 1b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">372. &#8211; The Apostle&#8217;s desire is that the Corinthians bear with him as he commends himself;
therefore he begins with an optative expression: I wish you would bear with me in a little
foolishness. In regard to this it should be noted that the moral precepts deal with actions which,
since they are particular and variable, cannot be confined within the limits of one general reason
and rule with no exceptions. But sometimes it is necessary to do something beside the common
rule in some case that crops up. But when something is done beside the common rule in this way,
wise men, who consider the cause of it, are not troubled and do not think it was done foolishly.
For example, the moral precept forbids killing, but sometimes it is necessary to kill evil men.
When this is done, wise men commend it or do not think it was wicked to have done so, but the
undiscerning and less wise, not considering the cause why one acted in this manner, are disturbed
and think it was foolish to do. So when the wicked are killed, fools and heretics condemn it,
saying it was a wicked thing to do.  Therefore, because the common law is that a man should not
commend himself, as it says in Prov. (27:2): &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
a stranger, and not your own lips&#8221;, it could happen in some case beside this common rule, that
a man commends himself and is acting praiseworthily; nevertheless, the undiscerning regard it
as folly. Therefore, since the Apostle was confronted with a case in which he should commend
himself, he urges them not to lay it to his folly, saying, I wish you would bear with me in a little
foolishness. He says, little, because were he to commend himself without cause, it would be the
utmost folly. Again, if he commended himself for a reason entirely urgent, then there would be
no folly involved. But because he is commending himself for a reason not altogether urgent, since
he could refute the false apostles in some other way, and because he is commending himself very
much, there seems to be some folly there; and that is what he says, in a little foolishness: &#8220;I have
been a fool! You forced me to it&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">373. &#8211; But although I am foolish, do bear with me. And they should do this because subjects
should uphold their prelates and vice versa: &#8220;Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfil the law
of Christ&#8221; (Gal. 6:2); &#8220;Forbearing one another in love&#8221; (Eph. 4:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">374. &#8211; Then, saying I feel a divine jealousy, he shows the need for this commendation. In regard
to this he does three things. First, he shows that a commendation of this sort springs from zeal,
to exclude folly; secondly, he says that this zeal is not irregular, to avoid indiscretion (v. 3);
thirdly, he rejects their excuse (v. 4). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions
the holy zeal he has for them; secondly, the cause of this zeal, because his office obliged him (v.
2b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">375. &#8211; His zeal, therefore, is holy, because I feel a divine jealousy for you, i.e., I love you
fervently with the jealousy of God, i.e., to God&#8217;s honor, not mine. In regard to this it should be
noted that jealousy taken as being the same as zeal is nothing more than a good or evil movement
of the spirit concerning itself with the state of one&#8217;s neighbor, and implies a fervor of love.
Consequently, zeal is an intense love that does not permit any sharing of the beloved. If it does
not permit any sharing of an evil, say of a vice or some imperfection, but it alone wishes to have
the beloved exclusively, then the zeal is good and the jealousy good. Thus it says in 1 Cor.
(12:31): &#8220;But earnestly desire the higher gifts&#8221;; &#8220;For a good purpose it is always good to be made
much of&#8221; (Gal. 4:18); &#8220;I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts&#8221; (1 Kg. 19:10);
&#8220;For zeal for your house has consumed me&#8221; (Ps. 69:10). But if it does not allow a sharing in
something excellent or in some worldly prosperity, because someone wants it all for himself, then
the zeal is evil and the jealousy evil. Now a person is sometimes jealous for his wife, to keep her
for himself. This is the way the Apostle was jealous on behalf of his people, whom he saw
prepared for a fall and, although espoused to Christ, wished to be prostituted to the devil.
Consequently, he would not permit Christ, the true spouse, to suffer their being shared with the
devil; hence he says, a divine jealousy. As if to say: Not for me but for Christ, who is the spouse:
&#8220;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&#8221; (Jn. 3:29); &#8220;I have been very jealous for the Lord, the
God of hosts&#8221; (1 Kg. 19:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">376. &#8211; Then he shows from what source the responsibility to be zealous arose, when he says: for
I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband. As if to say: it is
proper for me to be jealous for you with the jealousy of God, because I am the groomsman of this
wedding between you and Christ, i.e., I effected the espousals made by faith and charity: &#8220;I will
betroth you to me in faithfulness&#8221; (Hos. 2:20). Therefore, it is my duty to protect you. So
whoever converts the people by faith and charity, espouses them to Christ. I have betrothed you,
I say, not to many, because she that adheres to many is defiled: &#8220;You have played the harlot with
many lovers&#8221; (Jer. 3:1), but to one husband, Christ, that is, to a perfect man filled with the
virtues: &#8220;The Orient is his name&#8221; (Zech. 6:12, Vulgate). Christ is called one husband because he
is unique both as to the manner of conception (as to the manner of being born), and as to the
fullness of grace: &#8220;One man among a thousand I found&#8221; (Ecc. 7:28). To that husband, I say, I
have espoused you to present you a virgin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">377. &#8211; Note that he passes from the plural, I have betrothed you, to the singular, to present you
as a pure bride, thus showing that from all the faithful is formed one body and one Church, which
ought to be a virgin in all its members. For in all, virginity is taken for bodily integrity and
chastity for mental integrity; for sometimes a person is a virgin in body, but not chaste in mind.
Thus the Church shows herself a virgin when she perseveres in the faith and the sacraments
without being corrupted by idolatry and unbelief: &#8220;At the head of every street you built your lofty
place and prostituted your beauty&#8221; (Ez. 16:25). She shows herself chaste when, persevering in
the sacraments and in the faith of Christ, she presents herself pure in body and in work: &#8220;That he
might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that
she might be holy and without blemish&#8221; (Eph. 5:27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">378. &#8211; But because the Corinthians could say: it is not necessary for you to protect us, and your
zeal is not reasonable, because we can take care of ourselves very well, he discloses the cause
of his zeal saying, but I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts
will be led astray [corrupted]. Here it should be noted that in paradise Adam and Eve were
married, but Eve was corrupted by the serpent, not with violence, but with craftiness, inasmuch
as he promised something false and urged something wicked: false, when he said, &#8220;You will be
as gods&#8221; (Gen. 3:5), and &#8216;No, you will not die&#8221; (Gen. 3:4), even though they did incur guilt as
a result; wicked, when he persuaded her to transgress the and ignore God&#8217;s command.  The
Apostle, speaking according to this likeness, says that the Church is like Eve, whom the devil has
sometimes persecuted openly by tyrants and potentates, and then &#8220;like a roaring lion, seeking
someone to devour,&#8221; as it says in 1 Pet. (5:8); and sometimes he molests the Church in secret by
heretics who promise the truth and pretend to be good, and then as the serpent deceived Eve with
his subtility by promising false things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">379. &#8211; Therefore he says, I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve, casting her out of paradise,
by his cunning with false promises: &#8220;Adam was not deceived, but the woman&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:14), so,
i.e., by like deceptions of heretics, your thoughts [senses] will be led astray. He says, your senses,
because just as in a natural marriage a spouse takes precautions against his bride&#8217;s being
corrupted carnally, so in this spiritual marriage the Apostle fears that the senses of the heart will
be spiritually corrupted: &#8220;Bad company ruins good morals&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:33). Or the spiritual senses
referred to in Wis. (1:1): &#8220;Think of the Lord with uprightness&#8221;; &#8220;Do not be children in your
thinking&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:20).  And from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ [from the simplicity
that is in Christ]. That is simple which lacks composition. Therefore, the false apostles formed
one sect with Judaism and the Gospel, commanding that the ceremonies of the Law be observed
along with the Gospel. Therefore, they fall from the simplicity of Christ, who, being seduced by
the false apostles, observe those ceremonies along with the Gospel; and this the Apostle feared
about the Corinthians: &#8220;The integrity of the upright guides them&#8221; (Prov. 11:3).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">380. &#8211; Having described the zeal he had for the Corinthians and proved it reasonable, the Apostle
now rejects their excuse. In regard to this he does two things. First, he proposes their excuse;
secondly, he removes it (v. 5)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">381. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that the Corinthians might suppose that he has zeal
for them, because he feared that they might set aside his teaching on account of the false apostles&#8217;
teaching; hence they could say: it is obvious that lesser goods should be discarded in favor of
greater goods. Therefore, if the false apostles teach better doctrines, you should not be disturbed
if we acquiesce in them. Hence, he proposes this excuse by showing that no one is better than the
Apostle in teaching and preaching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">382. &#8211; For the Apostle preached and taught three things. First, that they were Christ&#8217;s: &#8220;For what
we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:5); secondly, that they have the
Spirit of Christ: &#8220;Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him&#8221; (Rom.
8:9); thirdly, that they received the Gospel of Christ: &#8220;For I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is
the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek&#8221;
(Rom. 1:16). If, therefore, the false apostles preach and teach something better to you, you would
do right and would be excusable; but they do not do this.  And this is what he says: For if some
one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different
spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted,
you submit to it readily enough. As if to say: I fear that a false apostle might come to you unsent,
but of himself, as a thief and a robber: &#8220;All who came before me are thieves and robber&#8221; (Jn.
10:8); &#8220;I did not send the prophets, yet they ran&#8221; (Jer. 25:21); &#8220;And how can men preach unless
they are sent?&#8221; (Rom. 10:15). If, I say, such a preacher preaches to you another Christ, namely,
more excellent than the one we have preached, which cannot be, because as it says in 1 Cor.
(8:6): &#8220;And one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist&#8221;;
and this as to the first. Or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, namely,
better than the one you have received from us, i.e., by our ministry, which cannot be, because as
it says in 1 Cor. (12:11): &#8220;All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to
each one individually as he wills&#8221;; and this as to the second.  Or if you accept a different gospel,
i.e., another preaching or doctrine, from the one you accepted from us: &#8220;I am astonished that you
are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different
gospel&#8221; (Gal. 1:6). If, I say, they did other and better things for you, you submit to it readily
enough, i.e., you would be right in excusing yourselves. But because another, i.e., better Gospel
cannot be delivered to them, the Apostle excommunicates the Galatians, if they receive another
Gospel: &#8220;If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be
accursed&#8221; (Gal. 1:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">383. &#8211; Then when he says, I think that I am not in the least inferior, he removes this excuse. In
regard to this he does two things. First, he shows that he did not do less for them than the others;
secondly, that he did more (v. 7). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows that
he did nothing less in deed than the other apostles; secondly, he suggests that he was not lacking
the means to do this (v. 6); thirdly, he presents the evidence for both (v. 6b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">384. &#8211; He says therefore: you would be right in allowing yourselves to be seduced by them, if
they preached something better to you; but this is not true. For, i.e., because I think that I am not
in the least inferior to these superlative apostles, i.e., than Peter and John, whom they considered
great. He compares himself to the great apostles, both because Paul seemed to them and was
regarded by them as less than they, on the ground that they had been with Christ, and Paul not;
and because the false apostles claimed to have been sent by them. Therefore, by showing himself
equal to the great apostles, he removes their error and refutes the false apostles: &#8220;I worked harder
than any of them&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">385. &#8211; But lest perhaps they should say to him: whence did you obtain the faculty to do this, since
you are unskilled in our speech? He shows that the faculty is due to the vastness of his
knowledge, saying, even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge: &#8220;So also our
beloved brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him&#8221; (2 Pet. 3:15). But this
should be noted, namely, that the false apostles, seeking their own glory and pursuing gain, tried
to attract people by ornate and subtle and exquisite words, trying only to stroke their ears gently.
But the Apostle, because he was not seeking his own advantage but only the spread and growth
of the faith, proposed the word of faith in such a way that all could understand, adjusting himself
to the condition and capacity of his hearers. Hence, because they were not capable of lofty
doctrine in the beginning, he proposed the faith to them not in subtle terms but in a way they
could understand, namely, plainly and clearly. That is why they said he was rude in speech: &#8220;Not
with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:17). On this
account the Apostle says: although I be rude in speech, as it seems to you, this was not due to a
lack of knowledge but for your sake by way of dispensing it, because I &#8220;could not address you
as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:1)  Or according to the
letter, it must be said that the Apostle stuttered, and on this account the false apostles ridiculed
him. Therefore he says: for even if I am unskilled in speaking, i.e., have a speech impediment,
I am not in knowledge: &#8220;I am slow of speech and of tongue&#8221; Ex. 4:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">386. &#8211; But the fact that I did no less than the great apostles is evident from the things I have done
for you; hence, he says: in every way we have made this plain to you in all things, who have
experienced what I have done: &#8220;You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:2);
&#8220;The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all patience, with signs and wonders
and mighty works&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">387. &#8211; Then when he says, Did I commit a sin, he shows that he has done more than all the
others; and this because he preached without payment. In regard to this he does two things. First,
he states the fact; secondly, he assigns the reason of the fact (v. 11). In regard to the first he does
two things. First, he shows the fact as to the past; secondly, as to the future (v. 9b). He shows the
past fact in two ways: first in general, and second in particular (v. 7b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">388. &#8211; He says therefore: I am correct in saying that I have done no less than the others, unless
you think I did less and acted wrongly, because I lessened my authority in not accepting payments
from you. But if this were so, I would have done evil. Therefore he shows that it is not evil, and
this is what he says: Did I commit a sin in abasing myself and lessening my authority? As if to
say: No: &#8220;The greater you are, humble yourself in all things, and you will find grace in the sight
of God&#8221; (Sir. 3:20, Vulgate); &#8220;For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to
all, that I might win the more&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:19); &#8220;Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (Matt. 18:4).  The reason for humbling myself is not for my
own gain but for your improvement; hence he says: so that you might be exalted, i.e., be
strengthened in faith. But the Corinthians were very covetous, and if he had accepted payment
from the very beginning, they might perhaps have left the faith. Likewise, the false prophets
preached for monetary profit. Therefore, in order that the Corinthians receive the Apostle, and
the false prophets remove the occasion for profit, the Apostle preached for free and without
subsidy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">389. &#8211; Then he explains in detail what he had said in general. In regard to this he does two things.
First, he shows how he preached to them without charge during his first visit with them;
secondly, he shows that he did the same during the long stay he made with them (v. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">390. &#8211; In regard to the first he does two things. First, he mentions the humiliation, saying: in this
did I humble myself, because I preached God&#8217;s gospel without cost to you, i.e., without charge;
but not for a reward, because this is not praiseworthy. For although all could take personal
payments from those to whom they preached the word of God, yet no one should preach for the
reward or the payment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">391. &#8211; Secondly, because they could say: where did you obtain your support? He answers that
it came from the other churches, saying: I robbed other churches by accepting support from them
in order to serve you. By this he convinces them that they could not say to the Apostle that it is
unlawful for him to take from them. For if it is taken from others for serving them, it is much
more lawful for him to take from them. From this it is apparent that a papal legate visiting one
part of his jurisdiction can accept stipends, and that the Pope can take subsidies from various
parts of the world to relieve the needs of some country. The reason is that the Church is as one
body. But we see in a natural body that, when strength is failing in one member, nature
administers humors and strength by taking from other members.</p>

<A NAME="113"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">11-3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>2 Cor. 11:9-15</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9 And when I was with you and was in want, I did not burden any one, for my
needs were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I refrained
and will refrain from burdening you in any way. 10 As the truth of Christ is in
me, this boast of mine shall not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 11 And
why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! 12 And what I do I will
continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim
that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 13 For such
men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of
Christ. 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
15 So it is not strange if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of
righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">392. &#8211; Having shown that when he first preached to them during his first visit, he preached to
them without charge, he now shows that not even during his long stay among them did he accept
any payments from them. First, he shows this; secondly, he answers a tacit question (v. 9b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">393. &#8211; He says therefore: I took no payments from you not only when I first came to you, but also
when I was with you for some time and was in want, in order to show that he did not forego the
payments, because he was rich: I did not burden any one by taking anything from anyone. This
reveals the cause why he forewent it, namely, because the Corinthians in their innate avarice
considered it a burden to minister to him: &#8220;We have not made use of this right, but we endure
anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">394. &#8211; But they could ask: Where did you get what you needed? So he answers: from the other
churches. Therefore I took nothing, because my need was supplied from the wage I earned by
working at night with Aquila and Priscilla, for he practiced the tentmaker&#8217;s art, from which he
furnished his necessities: &#8220;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities,
and to those who were with me&#8221; (Ac. 20:34). Therefore, that which was lacking you did not give,
but my needs were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia, namely, the Philippians,
who were very generous; for which the Apostle commended them in the epistle to the Philippians
(4:15): &#8220;No church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only.&#8221;
But the Corinthians were avaricious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">395. &#8211; Then when he says, So I refrained, he shows how he plans to act toward them in this
matter in the future, saying that he does not want to be a burden to them. In regard to this he does
two things. First, he gives his general reason; secondly, he confirms it (v. 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">396. &#8211; He says therefore: not only have I preached the Gospel to you without charge and was a
burden to no one, so I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way; and so I will
keep myself, not rebuking you sharply or correcting you severely or accepting anything: &#8220;I
coveted no one&#8217;s silver or gold or apparel&#8221; (Ac. 20:33); &#8220;I have not taken one ass from them, and
I have not harmed one of them&#8221; (Num. 16:15); and Samuel says: &#8220;Testify against me before the
Lord and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or whom have
I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes
with it?&#8221; (1 Sam. 12:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">397. &#8211; That he will continue to do so he confirms in two ways. First, by reason of the one who
speaks in him, namely, Christ, who is the truth from which nothing false can come; hence he
says, As the truth of Christ is in me. As if to say: what I say is true, because the truth of Christ
speaks in me: &#8220;Since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me&#8221; (2 Cor. 13:3).  Or this can
be taken as an oath, as if to say: God, who is truth, and who is in me searching my heart is my
witness that I will keep myself so: &#8220;For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
gospel of his Son&#8221; (Rom. 1:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">398. &#8211; Secondly, from the fact that he does not intend to lessen his glory, but to increase it. For
the Apostle attributed to himself before Christ as his great glory that he alone of all the apostles
preached to the Corinthians without payment; hence he says: I will not burden anyone; this boast
of mine shall not be silenced, i.e., lessened, namely, that I preached to you free and that I
refrained from what is lawful for your salvation which is Christ&#8217;s glory, because he is glorified
in me by this, or because I particularly have this glory with Christ. This would have been broken
off in the regions of Achaia, where Corinth was the metropolis, if he had taken anything from
them, because they were avaricious: &#8220;For I would rather die than have any one deprive me of my
ground for boasting&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">399. &#8211; Then when he says, And why?, he presents the cause why he did not take payment from
them. First, he excludes the false cause; secondly, he gives the true one (v. 12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">400. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that the false apostles charged the Apostle with not
taking payment from the Corinthians, because he did not love them and because he did not intend
to help and serve them. He says therefore: Why do I do this? Because I do not love you?, i.e., is
it from any hatred I bear towards you, as the false apostles claim? God knows that I love you and
that I do not do this out of hatred: &#8220;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you&#8221; (Jn. 21:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">401. &#8211; Therefore, having removed the false cause, he gives the true one, And what I do I will
continue to do. First he states the true cause; secondly, the reason for it (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">402. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that the false apostles, as has been stated, were
seeking their own profit and glory; therefore, in order to be held in reverence, they tried to follow
the example of the Apostle outwardly or even excel him, if they could. Therefore the Apostle
says: if you wish to imitate me, let them imitate me in taking nothing. And because he knew that
the false apostles preached in order to take and, consequently, would not preach if their gain
ceased, he says: And what I do I will continue to do, and what I shall do is not out of hatred, but
in order to undermine the claim of those, namely, the false apostles, who desire from my example
to have an occasion for taking what is yours. For he knew, according to Ambrose, that they would
not preach very willingly, if they received nothing; whereas on the contrary it is stated: &#8220;Give
instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man and he will increase
in learning&#8221; (Prov. 9:9). And this that they may be found, that is, the false apostles, on the same
terms as we, namely, not receiving money, even as we do not receive it. Indeed they glory in the
fact that they imitate us; and I am unwilling, if they would imitate me completely, that they
would receive: &#8220;I wish that all were as I myself am&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:7), namely, not receiving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">403. &#8211; That in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. This is read in three
ways. In one way thus: that they may be found to be such as we, not receiving, even as we do not
receive; wherein, namely, in being such as we, they may glory, for they strive to be like the
apostles. In a second way thus: that in that wherein they glory, namely, in receiving, because this
is all they sought, they may be found even as we, i.e., similar to us, namely, by ceasing and
desisting from receiving, that they may be like us. In the third way thus: that in that wherein they
glory, namely, in not receiving, for they claim they receive nothing, they may be found even as
we, i.e., not better than we, namely, lest they be able to prefer themselves to us in this.  For such
men are false apostles, deceitful workmen. This can be connected with what went before in three
ways; in the first way thus: they do not glory and strive in the way we do, for such men are false
apostles, deceitful workmen. In the second way thus: and indeed they stop receiving in order to
be like us: for such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen. In the third way thus: so they glory
in not receiving in order to seem like us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">404. &#8211; Having stated the true cause, he proves it by saying: For such men are false apostles,
deceitful workmen. In regard to this he does three things. First he states the cause; secondly, he
proves it (v. 14); thirdly, he shows the difference between false and true apostles (v. 15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">405. &#8211; He says therefore: I am right in saying that I do this in order to cut off from them the
occasion, for such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, namely, false: &#8220;Look out for the
dogs, look out for the evil-workers&#8221; (Phil. 3:2). Deceitful, i.e., shrewd, foxy, deceiving others
under the guise of religion: &#8220;Your prophets have been like foxes among ruins, O Israel&#8221; (Ez.
13:4); &#8220;Catch us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards&#8221; (S. of S. 2:15); &#8220;Beware of
false prophets, who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves&#8221; (Matt.
7:15). And this is what he says: disguising themselves as apostles of Christ, i.e., bearing the
outward signs of good apostles: &#8220;Holding the form of religion but denying the power of it&#8221; (2
Tim. 3:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">406. &#8211; He proves this, because just as the true apostles are sent by God and are transformed by
him, so Satan disguises himself as an angel of light, who is their leader and inciter, showing
himself to be an angel of God or sometimes Christ. Therefore it is no strange or great thing if his
servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, i.e., pretend to be just: &#8220;Like the
magistrate of the people, so are his officials&#8221; (Sir. 10:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">407. &#8211; But it should be noted that Satan sometimes transfigures himself so that he can be seen,
as by St. Martin, in order to deceive men. But for this the discerning of spirits, which God
conferred in a special way on St. Antony, is necessary and sufficient. One is able to know that
it is Satan by the fact that a good angel urges one to good works from the very beginning and
continues to do so, but a bad angel pretends good things in the beginning, but later, in order to
fulfil his desire and accomplish what he intends, namely, to deceive, he induces and instigates
to evil: &#8220;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God&#8221;
(1 Jn. 4:1). According to Joshua (5:13), when he saw an angel in the field, he said: &#8220;Are you for
us, or for our adversaries?&#8221; Another sign is that a good angel, even though he causes one to be
fearful in the beginning, immediately comforts and consoles, as he did Zechariah: &#8220;Do not be
afraid, Zechariah&#8221; (Lk. 1:13), and the Blessed Virgin: &#8220;Do not be afraid, Mary&#8221; (Lk. 1:30). But
an evil angel stupefies and leaves one desolate, in order the more easily to deceive and persuade
him. But sometimes he transforms himself but cannot be seen; and this when he makes things,
which are in themselves evil, appear good by perverting a man&#8217;s senses and inflaming
concupiscence: &#8220;There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death&#8221;
(Prov. 14:12). This is the way he deceived a certain monk, who had resolved never to leave his
cell. But the devil suggested to him that it would be good to go to Church and receive the body
of Christ. Consenting to this suggestion, he broke his resolve by going to the Church. Later,
recognizing that it was the devil, the monk congratulated himself for not being deceived, because
he had left for a good purpose. Later on, he suggested to him that his father had died and left
many riches to be distributed among the poor, and that he should go to the city. When he went
there, he never returned and died in sin. Hence, it is very difficult for a person to be too careful,
but one should have recourse to divine help: &#8220;Who can open the doors of his face? Round about
his teeth is terror&#8221; (Job 41:14). As if to say: no one but God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">408. &#8211; Then he indicates the difference between good and bad ministers, which consists in this,
that their end, namely, of Christ&#8217;s ministers and Satan&#8217;s, will correspond to their deeds; for the
end of the good will be good, and of the evil, evil: &#8220;Their end is destruction&#8221; (Phil. 3:19).
Furthermore, the good will receive good things and the evil, evil things: &#8220;For we must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">16 I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, accept me as a fool,
so that I too may boast a little. 17 (What I am saying I say not with the Lord&#8217;s
authority but as a fool, in this boastful confidence; 18 since many boast of
worldly things, I too will boast.) 19 For you gladly bear with fools, being wise
yourselves! 20 For you bear it if a man makes slaves of you, or preys upon you,
or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face. 21 To my
shame, I must say, we were too weak for that!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">409. &#8211; Having asked the Corinthians to bear patiently with his commendation, and shown that
he did this out of the zeal he had for them because that zeal was reasonable and ordinate, the
Apostle now presents another reason through which he shows that, given he is acting foolishly,
they should nevertheless, put up with him. Hence, in this reason he proceeds on the supposition
that he is foolish. In this part he does two things. First he makes his request; secondly, he gives
the reason for what he said (v. 17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">410. &#8211; In his request he does two things. First, he asks that they not consider him foolish, which
pertains to the previous reason; hence he says, I repeat it, since my zeal is reasonable and I am
acting reasonably in commending myself, let no one think me foolish. Secondly, he asks that,
granted that he is acting foolishly, they should nevertheless put up with him, which pertains to
the present reason. Therefore he says, but even if you do, i.e., if I am not reasonable in
commending myself and on that account you want to regard me as foolish, nevertheless, accept,
i.e., bear with me as a fool. He says, as, because although they may regard him as foolish, in this
matter he is not really foolish. Accept me, I say, as a fool so that I too may boast a little. He says,
a little, because further on he will commend himself on the glory which is according to the flesh,
which is very little: &#8220;Man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm!&#8221; (Job 25:6);
&#8220;How can he who is dust and ashes be proud?&#8221; (Sir. 10:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">411. &#8211; Then when he says, What I am saying, he assigns the reason for what he had said. But he
had said three things, for which he wishes to give a reason. First, for the fact that he supposed
it was foolish to commend himself; secondly, why he wishes to glory (v. 18); thirdly, that they
should bear with him (v. 19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">412. &#8211; He says therefore: the reason why you should take me who am foolish is because what I
am saying in this boastful confidence, i.e., in this commendation according to the flesh, which
is desired by some, as if they ought to subsist by it, I say not with the Lord&#8217;s authority, but as a
fool.  He speaks hypothetically, as if to say: if I were not reasonable in commending myself, then
what I am saying for my commendation would not be with the Lord&#8217;s authority, i.e., according
to the notion of divine wisdom; and then you would be right in not taking me as speaking
according to God, but foolishly: &#8220;For it is not the man who commends himself that is accepted,
but the man whom the Lord commends&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:18); &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your
own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips&#8221; (Prov. 27:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">413. &#8211; He indicates the reason why he commends himself and glories, when he says, since many
boast of worldly things [according to the flesh], I too will boast. Here it should be noted that the
false apostles, because they were Jews, gloried according to the flesh, saying that they were sons
of Abraham. They hoped thereby to be held in reverence and authority by the Corinthians.
Therefore, the Apostle says: granted that it is foolish for me to glory according to the flesh, yet
because many, namely the false apostles, glory according to the flesh, I too will even glory
according to the flesh: &#8220;Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes&#8221;
(Prov. 26:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">414. &#8211; But on the other hand, Seneca says: &#8220;The greatest of evils is to live by the example of evil
men&#8221;; &#8220;You shall not follow a multitude to do evil&#8221;(Ex. 23:2). Therefore, the Apostle should not
glory according to the flesh on the ground that the false apostles glory. I answer that although
both are glorying about the same thing, the intention and end are not the same, because the false
apostles commended themselves for their own glory and to acquire authority and gain; but the
Apostle glories in order that the word of God preached by him might have greater authority and
weight and bear fruit for Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">415. &#8211; Then he tells why they should bear with him, saying: you gladly bear with fools, being
wise yourselves. First, he gives this reason, namely, that they should bear with him. For they
could say: Why should we bear with you, if you are foolish? And the Apostle says that the reason
is this: since you yourselves are wise in your own eyes and in your reputation, you gladly bear
with, i.e., are wont to bear with, fools, namely, the false apostles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">416. &#8211; Secondly, he shows wherein they bear with the foolish and points out five cases of
oppression imposed by the false apostles. The first is the yoke of slavery; as to this he says, for
you bear it if a man, i.e., the false apostles, makes slaves of you. As if to say: through Christ you
were freed from the bondage of the Law, which is in fear, and were raised to the freedom of the
sons of God, which is charity: &#8220;So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free
woman&#8221; (Gal. 4:31). And yet you suffer the false apostles, who take such liberty from you and
reduce you to the slavery of the Law, because they compel you to observe the ceremonies of the
Law: &#8220;Do not submit again to a yoke of slavery&#8221; (Gal. 5:1). With greater reason, then, should you
bear with me, who want to preserve you in the freedom of Christ, than with the false apostles,
who wish to reduce you to the slavery of the Law.  The second is a very heavy burden, because
the false apostles live sumptuously on your goods, but we do not: &#8220;I do not mean that others
should be eased and you burdened&#8221; (2 Cor. 8:13). Therefore he says: or preys upon [devours]
you: &#8220;Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour the houses of widows,
praying long prayers. For this you shall receive the greater judgment&#8221; (Matt. 23:14).  The third
oppression is depredation and despoilation, because they literally took everything from them with
soft words and under the pretext of piety; as to this he says, or take advantage of you, i.e.,
smoothly deceive you by taking your property: &#8220;By fair and flattering words they deceive the
hearts of the simple-minded&#8221; (Rom. 16:18).  The fourth oppression is their excessive vaunting
of themselves over them along with contempt for the Corinthians; therefore he says: or puts on
airs by conducting himself in a conceited manner: &#8220;Do not exalt yourself through your soul&#8217;s
counsel, lest your soul be torn in pieces like a bull&#8221; (Sir. 6:2).  The fifth oppression is verbal
abuse; for the false apostles not only oppressed them in these ways but added reproaches by
saying insulting things to them and especially about their low estate. For because they were Jews
and worshippers of the one true God, they called themselves noble and the Corinthians ignoble,
because they were not of the seed of Abraham or circumcised, but descended from idolaters; as
to this he says, or strikes you in the face, i.e., insults you publicly and says harmful things. For
these harmful things, I was too weak, I must say, to my shame, and yet you bear with them and
not with us, as if we were too weak for that and for the glory you have attributed to them by
preferring them to us, especially since the false apostles say that the reason we do not say or do
such things to you is that we are weak in this part, i.e., because we are lowly: &#8220;We are weak, but
you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:10).</p>

imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. 24 Five times I
have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. 25 Three times
I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been
shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been adrift at sea; 26 on frequent journeys,
in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger
from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger
from false brethren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">417. &#8211; Having given the reasons for commending himself and the causes why they should bear
with him, he now begins to commend himself. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
shows himself equal to the false apostles and others who commended themselves; secondly, he
prefers himself to them (v. 23b).  The Apostle makes himself their equal in glory. But glory is
of two kinds: one is according to the flesh and is slight and worthy of scorn; hence he says to the
Philippians (3:7): &#8220;But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ&#8221;; the other
in according to Christ, because &#8220;it is great glory to follow the Lord&#8221; (Sir. 23:38, Vulgate), and
this should be sought: &#8220;But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ&#8221; (Gal. 6:14). The Apostle therefore makes himself equal to them in regard to both glories:
first, in regard to the first; secondly, in regard to the second (v. 23).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">418. &#8211; First, he shows himself equal to them in general, saying: receive me as one who is foolish,
provided it is foolish, for I speak hypothetically; because whatever any one dares to boast of or
to take for granted about himself and to commend himself, I can dare and commend myself on
the same matters in which they commend themselves, because they have no better reason than
I to commend themselves. I am speaking as a fool, i.e., I say that I am acting foolishly; yet he was
acting wisely, because he was not doing this to boast, but to humiliate the false apostles: &#8220;I think
that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostle&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">419. &#8211; Secondly, when he says, Are they Hebrews? So am I, he shows in detail that he is equal
to them, indicating one by one the points in which he is equal to them, and in which the false
apostles found glory. But they took glory and commended themselves on three points. First, in
their nationality and tongue, because they called themselves Hebrews; secondly in their race,
because they said they were of the race of Israel; thirdly, in the promise, because they said they
were partakers of the promise to Abraham, since they were of his seed. So he shows that he is
equal to them on these three points. First, as to nationality, as if to say: I am as they are. It should
be noted that, as some say, they are called Hebrews from Abraham, because before him that name
was uncommon. But it can be said, and perhaps better, that the word is derived from a certain
Eber mentioned in Gen. (11:14-15): &#8220;Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber,&#8221;
and then Eber lived thirty-four years and begot Peleg. It was during this time that languages
became distinct, and the language of the Hebrews remained in the family.  Secondly, he shows
himself equal to them in race, saying Are they Israelites? So am I, namely, according to rite.
Thirdly, as to the third he says: Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Of these three things
it says in Phil. (3:4): &#8220;If any other man thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have
more, circumcised on the eighth day&#8221; as to the third point; &#8220;Of the people of Israel, of the tribe
of Benjamin,&#8221; as to the second point; &#8220;A Hebrew born of Hebrews,&#8221; as to the first: &#8220;I myself am
an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin&#8221; (Rom. 11:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">420. &#8211; Thus, it is clear that I am not inferior to them as to the glory, which is according to the
flesh; nor even as to the glory which is according to Christ, because they are servants of Christ,
i.e., they say so to deceive you; I am a better one: &#8220;This is how one should regard us, as servants
of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:1); &#8220;Who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant&#8221; (2 Cor.
3:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">421. &#8211; Then when he says, I am talking like a madman, he prefers himself to all the apostles and
to the false. First, in regard to evils endured; secondly, as to benefits received (chap.12). In regard
to the first he does two things. First, he prefers himself as to evils endured; secondly, as to the
manner in which he avoided evils (v. 32). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
proposes that he should be preferred to the others; secondly, he shows in what he should be
preferred (v. 23c); thirdly, he confirms some of the statements (v. 30).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">422. &#8211; He says therefore: I am talking like a madman; because I commend myself and make
myself equal to the others, how less wise will I seem to you, if I prefer myself to them. Therefore
he says: not only am I a minister of Christ, as the others, but as one less wise according to your
opinion, I say that I am a better minister of Christ than they; and as to this he says that he should
be preferred to them: &#8220;I magnify my ministry&#8221; (Rom. 11:13) by placing it ahead of the ministry
of the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">423. &#8211; Then he indicates the matters in which he should be preferred, saying, with far greater
labours. As if to say: in this I am more, because I am more obviously a minister of Christ. First,
as to the evils inflicted; secondly, as to evils voluntarily assumed (v. 26).  First, he mentions in
general the evils inflicted, saying: I am more, namely, a proven minister; with far greater labours
than they, even though they have undertaken some labours: &#8220;I worked harder than any of them&#8221;
(1 Cor. 15:10). Secondly, he lists those evils in detail. First, as to the squalor of prison, because
far more imprisonments, namely, than they: &#8220;And when they had inflicted many blows upon
them&#8221;&#8212;namely, on Paul and his companions&#8212;&#8221;they threw them into prison&#8221; (Ac. 16:23).
Secondly, as to the pains of floggings, because with countless beatings, i.e., above the measure
of human virtue, or above the measure of human custom: &#8220;In beatings, imprisonments, tumults,
labors, watching, hunger&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:5).  But this seems to be contrary to what is stated in 1 Cor.
(10:13): &#8220;God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength.&#8221; Therefore,
not above the measure of human virtue. I answer that God does not permit us to be tried without
the held of divine grace; that is why the Apostle said in 1 Cor. (15:10): &#8220;Not I, but the grace of
God which is with me.&#8221;  Then as to the terror of death; hence he says, and often near death, i.e.,
in the dangers and terrors of death. Hence he said in Rom. (8:36): &#8220;For your sake we are being
killed all the day long&#8221;; &#8220;I die daily for your glory&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:31, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">424. &#8211; Then he manifests the two extreme dangers he underwent. And first, the danger of lashes;
secondly, the danger of death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">425. &#8211; But he shows the danger of lashes by citing those he suffered from his own, that is, from
the Jews. Hence he says, Five times I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less
one. It should be noted that, as it says in Deut. (25:2): &#8220;A number of stripes in proportion to his
offense. Forty stripes may be given him, but not more; lest, if one should go on to beat him with
more stripes than these, your brother be degraded in your sight.&#8221; This shows that men should be
whipped for lesser sins, yet so that the victim never receive more than forty stripes. But the Jews,
to appear merciful, always acted short of the Law, giving less than forty, according as it appeared
to them. Therefore, because they hated Paul, whenever they flogged him, they omitted the least
possible number of strokes below the Law&#8217;s limit, namely, giving only one less, i.e., thirty-nine.
And this is what he received five times, namely, forty lashes less one.  Secondly, he indicates the
perils he endured from outsiders, namely, the Gentiles, saying: Three times I have been beaten
with rods: &#8220;The magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods&#8221;
(Ac. 16:22); &#8220;The tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to
be examined by scourging&#8221;(Ac. 22:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">426. &#8211; Then he discloses the perils of death he faced; and first of all those inflicted by men,
saying: Once I was stoned. This happened in the city of Lycaonia, where he was struck down
with stones and almost killed: &#8220;They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that
he was dead&#8221; (Ac. 14:18).  Secondly, the perils endured from the works of nature, and
particularly from the sea. He amplifies these, first from their number, because three times I have
been shipwrecked; secondly, from their duration, because a night and a day I have been adrift at
sea, which is more grievous; for the text says that although he suffered shipwreck a number of
times, he remained in the water for a day and a half under the protection of God&#8217;s power. Hence
he could say with Jonah (2:4): &#8220;For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the
flood was round about me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">427. &#8211; Having listed the evils inflicted from without, he then lists those he voluntarily assumed,
when he says, on frequent journeys: first, external evils; secondly, internal evils (v. 28). He
describes the external evils: first as to the evils that occur on journeys; secondly, as to those in
houses (v. 27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">428. &#8211; In regard to the first he mentions his frequent journeys, saying on frequent journeys,
namely, I am proved a minister of Christ by enduring many hard and difficult things patiently:
&#8220;From Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ&#8221; Rom.
15:19). Along with these he traveled along many roads, going to Rome and into Spain: &#8220;For the
sake of the words of your lips, I have kept hard ways&#8221; (Ps. 17:4, Vulgate).  Secondly, he mentions
the dangers from journeys: first, the lesser ones; secondly, the more serious danger from false
brethren. Among the lesser dangers he mentions three things, in regard to which he suffered
many dangers. First, in regard to their causes, and these either from natural causes; hence he says,
dangers from rivers, for streams naturally rise in the winter and are swift and very dangerous; or
from malicious violence; as to this he says, in danger from robbers, whom the devil roused
against him to rob him of his clothing: &#8220;His troops come on together; they have cast up
siegeworks against me, and encamp round about my tent&#8221; (Job 19:12). Secondly, he lists the
dangers that inspire fear either from his own; hence he says, in danger from my own people, i.e.,
managed by the Jews: or from outsiders; hence he says, in danger from Gentiles, who wanted to
capture him for preaching the one true God. Consequently, he had no rest from his own or from
others: &#8220;My mother, you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land!&#8221; (Jer. 15:10).
Thirdly, he lists the dangers as to their places. First, as to cities he says, danger in the city, i.e.,
in cities stirred up against me, as at Ephesus and Corinth (Ac. 18 &amp; 19); or as to a desert place;
hence he says, danger in the wilderness, either from evil beasts, as when a viper bit his hand (Ac.
28:3) as he was collecting sticks; or from want of food. Secondly, as to danger at sea, such as
perils from plunderers and pirates: &#8220;Let those who sail the sea tell of its dangers&#8221; (Sir. 43:26,
Vulgate). But he mentions a more serious danger, saying, danger from false brethren, i.e., from
false Christians and heretics and false apostles: &#8220;Let every man beware of his neighbor&#8221; (Jer.
9:4).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">27 In toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often
without food, in cold and exposure. 28 And, apart from other things, there is the
daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 29 Who is weak, and
I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant? 30 If I must boast,
I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 31 The God and Father of the
Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie. 32 At Damascus,
the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus in order to seize
me, 33 but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped
his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">429. &#8211; Here he lists the evils voluntarily assumed, namely, those endured in homes, and he lists
three evils opposed to the three goods which are necessary for domestic life. The first good is
restful sleep; the second is sustenance from food; the third is the warmth of clothing. To restful
sleep he opposes labor and watchings, in regard to which he says, in toil, i.e., manual labor: &#8220;You
yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me&#8221;
(Ac. 20:34), because he literally made his living with his own hands: &#8220;With toil and labor we
worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.&#8221; (2 Th. 3:8). As to the weakness
resulting from labor he says, and hardship [tiredness], which is a weakness and tiredness that
follows upon labor or from a natural sickness: &#8220;My strength was dried up as by the heat of
summer&#8221; (Ps. 32:4). But in regard to watchings he says, through many a sleepless night, because
he devoted himself either to preaching at night or to manual labor. In Ac. (20:7) it says that he
prolonged his sermon until midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">430. &#8211; To sustenance from food he opposes two forms of being denied food. One is due to
necessity; hence he says, in hunger and thirst, namely, because he was unable frequently to obtain
food and drink: &#8220;To the present hour we hunger and thirst&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:11); the other is voluntary;
hence he says, often without food, i.e., voluntarily undertaken both for the good example and to
tame the flesh: &#8220;I pommel my body and subdue it&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:27). But this seems to be out of
harmony with Matt. (6:33): &#8220;But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be yours as well.&#8221; Why then in hunger and thirst? I answer that when it is expedient
and for our benefit, they are added, i.e., temporal things; but sometimes it is expedient to lack
them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">431. &#8211; To the warmth of clothing he opposes two things: one on the part of nature; hence he says,
in cold; the other on the part of poverty, hence he says, and exposure. I am proved a minister of
Christ: &#8220;We are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:11); &#8220;In afflictions, hardships,
calamities&#8221; (2 Cor. 6:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">432. &#8211; Then when he says, And, apart from other things, he lists the internal evils he assumed,
namely, those caused by anxiety of heart because of the activities of the false apostles. Now a
good prelate is concerned about two things affecting his subjects, namely, their safety and the
defection. And the Apostle suffered affliction in regard to both; the first, when he says, and, apart
from other things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. As if
to say: in addition to what I suffer and have suffered from outside, the internal affliction is more
oppressive, that is, solicitude for his subjects. Hence, he says, the daily pressure for all the
churches is great and lies heavily upon him, because he was very solicitous: &#8220;Martha, Martha,
you are anxious and troubled about many things&#8221; (Lk. 10:41); &#8220;He that rules, with solicitude&#8221;
(Rom. 12:8, Vulgate).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">433. &#8211; The second affliction he suffered concerned the failings of his subjects, and this he does
in two ways, namely for spiritual failings; hence he says, Who is weak, namely, in faith and in
goodness, and I am not weak? In heart, grieving over them as though over myself? &#8220;To the weak
I became weak, that I might win the weak.&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:22); &#8220;O that my head were waters, and my
eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my
people!&#8221; (Jer. 9:1). And for bodily failings; hence he says, Who is made to fall with the evil of
punishment, i.e., who suffers afflictions, and I am not indignant [on fire] with the fire of
compassion? This is the fire which the Lord came to cast upon the earth (Lk. 12:49).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">434. &#8211; And notice that he fittingly uses the word, &#8220;on fire&#8221;, because compassion proceeds from
the love of God and neighbor, which is a consuming fire, because it moves one to alleviate the
misfortunes of one&#8217;s neighbor, and it cleanses the soul with the compassion it engenders.
Furthermore, our sins are loosed, while the charity of that compassion covers a multitude of sins.
For a person sometimes falls into sin of himself, and then he is weakened; sometimes by the
example of others, and then he is scandalized: &#8220;Woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!&#8221;
(Matt. 18:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">435. &#8211; Then when he says, if I must boast, he confirms some of the statements made above. Or
say that above he speaks about the evils he commendably suffered; but here about the evils he
prudently avoided. But because the avoidance of evils that arise against the faith seems to imply
weakness, therefore, first, he states that he wishes to glory in those that imply weakness;
secondly, he proposes an oath to confirm his statements (v. 31); thirdly, he shows how he
avoided some evils (v. 32).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">436. &#8211; First, therefore, he suggests that the things in which one should glory, if he must glory,
saying: If, i.e., because I must, I must boast [glory], I will boast of the things that show my
weakness. As if to say: others may glory in their race and other worldly things: &#8220;They glory in
their shame, with minds set on earthly things&#8221; (Phil. 3:19), and I when compelled gloried in them.
Yet if I must glory, I will glory in my weakness: &#8220;I will all the more gladly boast of my
weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">437. &#8211; Secondly, he states that he is not lying and is calling on God to witness after the manner
of an oath, so that they will believe his, saying, The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who
is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie. Here he lays down three things. One by which to
induce fear; hence he says, God: &#8220;Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations?&#8221; (Jer. 10:7);
one by which he excites love, when he says, Father: &#8220;Every good endowment and every perfect
gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights&#8221; (Jas. 1:17); &#8220;If then I am a father,
where is my love?&#8221;, or according to another version, &#8220;my honor?&#8221; (Mal. 1:5); thirdly, to inspire
reverence and praise, who is blessed forever: &#8220;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:3). He, therefore, so revered, so worthy of love, so worthy of fear, knows that
I do not lie, namely, in what I have said and will say: &#8220;Our word to you has not been Yes and No&#8221;
(2 Cor. 1:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">438. &#8211; Then when he says, At Damascus, he shows the evils he avoided, and this in a certain
particular danger. Here it should be noted that the Apostle first began to preach Christ in
Damascus, where he was thrown to the ground and converted to the faith, as he was on his way
to arrest Christians. Therefore, the Jews appealed to the governor of that city, who was
representing Aretas the king, to arrest Paul and put him to death. So the governor ordered the
city-gates to be watched day and night, as it says in Ac. (chap. 9). But the Christians who were
there, desiring to save Paul, lowered him by the wall in a basket. This form of escape the Apostle
touches on, when he says: truly I am not lying about what I am telling you now: for at Damascus,
the governor under King Aretas, i.e., the governor who ruled at Damascus under king Aretas, was
induced by the Jews to guard the city of the Damascenes to seize me, so that after I was
apprehended, I would be delivered to the Jews and prevented from preaching. But I was let down
in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands, namely, the governor&#8217;s. This
was done in keeping with the Lord&#8217;s command: &#8220;When they persecute you in one town, flee to
the next&#8221; (Matt. 10:23). In this way too did Michel let David down through a window to escape
from Saul (1 Sam. 19:12), and Rahab let the spies down with a cord out of a window (Jos. 2:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">439. &#8211; But some object against the Apostle&#8217;s conduct: first, because he seems to have lacked
confidence in the Lord and fled. I answer that as long as human help is available, a man should
not run for divine help, because this would be tempting God; but he should use human help as
much as he can. But the Apostle was not yet lacking human help.  The second objection is based
on Jn. (10:12): &#8220;He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the
wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.&#8221; Hence, it seems that Paul was not a good shepherd.
I answer that sometimes the person of the prelate alone is sought, and sometimes the prelate
along with all the people. When the prelate alone is sought, then he should entrust his duties to
another and absent himself. This is what Paul did. Hence, a Gloss says that although he fled, he
still took care of his people by commending them to the Good Shepherd seated in heaven and
saving himself for their benefit by flight. But when the entire flock is sought, then he should
prefer the benefit and safety of the flock to his own bodily safety.  But note that there is a flight
inspired by humility, when a person flees honors, as Christ fled when they sought to make him
king (Jn. 6:15). In the same way Saul, when chosen, concealed himself at home (1 Sam. 10:22).
Another is inspired by caution, namely, when a person flees dangers in order to be saved for
greater ones. This is the way Elijah fled from Jezebel (1 Kg. 19:3), and the way the Apostle fled
from the hands of the governor.</p>

know, God knows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">440. &#8211; Having commended himself for the evils he suffered, the Apostle continues to commend
himself and shows the pre-eminence of his dignity in regard to good things received from God.
For he first gloried in his weaknesses, but now in his good things. In regard to this he does two
things. First, he commends himself on the good things received from God; secondly, he begs
pardon for this commendation, alleging that he is compelled to do this (v. 11). In regard to the
first he does two things. First, he extols the greatness of the things conferred on him by God;
secondly, he discloses the remedy given to him against the danger of pride (v. 7). In regard to the
first he does two things: first, he mentions a good divinely conferred; secondly, he shows how
he behaved in regard to glorying in it (v. 5). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he
shows in general that this was divinely bestowed; secondly, in particular (v. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">441. &#8211; The good divinely bestowed on the Apostle are revelations made to him by God; it is of
these that he wishes to glory. Hence he says: If I must boast [glory], i.e., because I must glory for
your sake, although in itself there is nothing to be gained by it, because a person who glories in
a good he has received runs the risk of losing what he has: &#8220;Through this,&#8221; i.e., by vain glory,
&#8220;are the treasures of the virtues opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.&#8221; (Sir. 43:15, Aquinas
Latin). And this is signified in Hezekiah, when he showed the treasures of the Lord&#8217;s house to
the messengers of the king in Babylon (Is. 39:2).  And although, absolutely speaking, it is not
expedient to glory, nevertheless, for some special reason a man may glory, as is clear from what
has been stated above. Therefore he says: because I must boast [glory], I will leave off
commending myself on my infirmities and come by commending myself to visions and
revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">442. &#8211; Here it should be noted the difference between a vision and a revelation. For a revelation
includes a vision, but not vice versa. For sometimes things are seen, the understanding and
significance of which are hidden from the beholder; in that case it is only a vision, as in the
visions of Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, the vision of the ears of corn and of the statue was only
a vision. But in regard to Joseph and Daniel, who understood the meaning of what was seen, it
was a revelation and a prophecy. Both, however, namely vision and revelation, are sometimes
produced by God: &#8220;There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries&#8221; (Dan. 2:28); &#8220;It was I who
multiplied visions&#8221; (Hos. 12:10); &#8220;Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your
law&#8221; (Ps. 119:18); but sometimes by an evil spirit: &#8220;They prophesied by Baal and led my people
Israel astray&#8221; (Jer. 23:13). To the Apostle were made both vision and revelation, because he fully
understood the secret things he saw. They were produced by the Lord and not by an evil spirit.
Hence he says: I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. Now a revelation is a removing
of a veil. But a veil can be of two kinds: one on the part of the beholder, and this is unbelief or
sin or hardness of heart. Of this veil he said above (3:15): &#8220;Yes, to this day whenever Moses is
read a veil lies over their minds&#8221;; the other is on the part of the object seen, namely, when
spiritual things are proposed to someone under the figures of sense-perceptible objects.
Concerning this it says in Num. (chap. 4) that the priests delivered the vessels of the sanctuary
veiled to the Levites, because weaker persons cannot grasp spiritual things as they are in
themselves. This is why the Lord spoke to the multitudes in parables (Matt. 13:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">443. &#8211; Then the Apostle describes these visions and revelations in details, speaking of himself
as though of another person; hence he says, I know a man in Christ. He mentions two visions:
the first begins here; the second at v. 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">444. &#8211; When speaking of the first vision, the Apostle makes use of a distinction, for he says in
regard to this revelation that he knew certain things and other things not. But he knew three
things, namely, the condition of the beholder; hence he says: I know a man in Christ; the time of
the vision, that is, who fourteen years ago; and the high point of the vision, because he was
caught up to the third heaven. And he says that he did not know the disposition of the beholder,
whether in the body or out of the body I do not know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">445. &#8211; Therefore let us see what he knew, so that through what is known we may more easily
attain to what was not known. First of all, the condition of the beholder, which is praiseworthy,
because he was in Christ, i.e., conformed to Christ.  But on the contrary, no one is in Christ,
unless he has charity, because &#8220;He who abides in love abides in God&#8221; (1 Jn. 4:16). Therefore, he
knew that he had charity, which is contrary to what is stated in Ec. (9:1): &#8220;The righteous and the
wise and their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate man does not know.&#8221; I
answer that being in Christ can be taken in two ways: in one way by faith and the sacrament of
faith according to Gal. (3:27): &#8220;For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on
Christ,&#8221; namely, by faith and the sacrament of faith. This is the sense in which the Apostle knew
that he was in Christ. In another way a person is said to be in Christ through charity, and in this
way no one knows for certain that he is in Christ, except by certain tests and signs, inasmuch as
he feels himself disposed and joined to Christ in such a way that he would not permit himself to
be separated from him for any reason including death. This the Apostle experienced in regard to
himself, when he said: &#8220;For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all
creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; (Rom. 8:38).
Hence, he could have had such signs that he was in the charity of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">446. &#8211; Secondly, the time of the vision, which was fitting, because it was fourteen years ago; for
fourteen years had elapsed from the time he saw the vision, until he wrote this epistle, because
when he wrote this epistle he had not yet been cast into prison. Hence it seems to have been
written at the beginning of Nero&#8217;s reign, by whom he was killed much later. Hence if we go back
fourteen years from the beginning of Nero&#8217;s reign, it is clear that the Apostle had these visions
at the beginning of his conversion. For he had been converted to Christ in the same year that the
Lord suffered. But Christ suffered near the end of Tiberius Caesar&#8217;s reign, who was succeeded
at death by the emperor Caius, who lived four years, after which Nero became emperor.
Therefore, between Tiberius and Nero there were four years. Adding two years from Tiberius&#8217;
reign, because he was not yet dead, when Paul was converted, and from Nero&#8217;s reign the eight
years which had passed until he wrote this epistle, there were fourteen years between the time of
his conversion to the time he wrote this epistle. Therefore, some say quite probably that the
Apostle had these visions during those three days after he was struck down by the Lord, when
he remained neither seeing nor eating nor drinking (Ac. 9:9). But he recalls the time of his
conversion to show that if he was so pleasing to Christ from the time of his conversion that he
revealed such things to him, then how much more pleasing was he after fourteen years, when he
had grown in charity before God and in the virtues and graces?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">447. &#8211; Thirdly, let us see the high point of the vision, because he was caught up (raptus) to the
third heaven. But it should be noted that it is one thing to be the victim of thievery and another
to be rapt. Properly speaking, the former takes place when something is taken away from another
in a secret way, hence, in Gen. (40:13) Joseph said: &#8220;For I was indeed stolen out of the land of
the Hebrews.&#8221; A person is properly speaking rapt when something is taken suddenly and by
force: &#8220;As the torrent that passes swiftly (raptim)&#8221;, i.e., suddenly and rapidly, &#8220;in the valleys&#8221;
(Job 6:15). Hence it is that plunderers who despoil violently are called ravagers (raptores). But
note that a man is said to be rapt from men, as Enoch: &#8220;He was caught up (raptim) lest evil
change his understanding or guile deceive his soul&#8221; (Wis. 4:11); sometimes the soul is rapt from
the body: &#8220;Fool! This night your soul is required of you&#8221; (Lk. 12:20). Sometimes a person is said
to be rapt by himself, when for some reason he is made to be outside himself; and this is the same
as ecstasy. But a man is made to be outside himself both by his appetitive power and by his
cognitive power. For by the former a person is in himself, when he cares only for things that are
his own; but he is made to be outside himself when he does not care about things that are his
own, but about things that pertain to others; and this is the work of charity: &#8220;Love does not insist
on its own way&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:5). Concerning this ecstasy Dionysius says in the Divine Names
(chap. 4): &#8220;Ecstasy is produced by divine love not permitting one to be a lover of self but of the
beloved,&#8221; i.e., of the things loved. But a person is made to be outside himself according to the
cognitive power when he is raised up above the human mode to see something. This is the
rapture about which the Apostle is speaking here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">448. &#8211; But it should be noted that a mode natural to human knowing is that a man know
simultaneously with his mental power, which is the intellect, and with a bodily one, which is a
sense. This is why a man in knowing has a free judgment of the intellect, when the senses are
well disposed in their vigor and not hindered by a fettering, as happens during sleep.  Therefore
a man is made to be outside himself when he is removed from this natural disposition for
knowing, namely, when the intellect, being withdrawn from the use of the senses and
sense-perceptible things, is moved to see certain things. This occurs in two ways: first, by a lack
of power, no matter how it is produced. This happens in phrenitis and other mental cases, so that
this withdrawal from the senses is not a state of being elevated, but of being cast down, because
their power has been weakened.  But the other way is by divine power, and then it is, properly
speaking, an elevation, because since the agent makes the thing it works on to be like itself, a
withdrawal produced by divine power and above men is something higher than man&#8217;s nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">449. &#8211; Therefore, a rapture of this sort is defined as &#8220;an elevation from that which is according
to nature into that which is above nature, produced in virtue of a higher nature.&#8221; In this definition
are mentioned its genus, when it is called an elevation; the efficient cause, because it is by the
power of a higher nature; and the two termini of the change, namely, the terminus from which
and into which, when it is described as being from that which is according to nature into what
is above nature. Thus it is clear what rapture is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">450. &#8211; Then he mentions the terminus reached by the rapture, when he says, to the third heaven.
But it should be noted that the third heaven is taken in three ways: in one way according to the
things below the soul; in another way according to the things in the soul; and in a third way
according to things above the soul. Below the soul are all bodies, as Augustine says in the book
On The True Religion. And so we can think of a threefold heaven: the ethereal, sidereal, and
empyrean. In this way the Apostle is said to have been rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to see things
in the empyrean heaven; not to exist there, because then he would have known whether he was
in the body or out of the body. Or according to Damascene, who does not admit an empyrean
heaven, we can say that the third heaven, to which the Apostle was rapt, is above the eighth
sphere, so that he could clearly see the things which exist above all corporeal nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">451. &#8211; But if we take heaven according to the things in the soul itself, then we should call heaven
some altitude of mind which transcends natural human knowledge. Now there are three kinds of
sight, namely, bodily, by which we can see and know bodies; spiritual or imaginary, by which
we see likenesses of bodies; and intellectual, by which we know the nature of things in
themselves. For the proper object of the intellect is the &#8220;what it is&#8221; (quod quid est) of things. But
such a sight of things, if it takes place according to the natural mode (e.g. if I see something
visible, if I imagine something previously seen, or if I understand through phantasms) cannot be
called heaven.  But each of these is called heaven when they are above the natural faculty of
human knowledge. For example, if you see something with your bodily eyes above the faculty
of nature, then you are rapt into the first heaven. This is the way Belshazzar was rapt, when he
saw the handwriting on the wall, as it is stated in Dan. (5:5). But if you are raised up by the
imagination or spirit to know something supernaturally, then you are rapt to the second heaven.
This is the way Peter was rapt, when he saw the linen sheet descending from heaven (Ac. 10:11).
But if a person were to see intelligible things themselves and their nature, not through
sense-perceptible things not through phantasms, he would be rapt to the third heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">452. &#8211; But it should be noted that to be rapt to the first heaven is to be alienated from the bodily
senses. Hence, since no one can be totally withdrawn from the bodily senses, it is obvious that
no one can be rapt in the strict sense to the first heaven, but only in a qualified sense, inasmuch
as it sometimes happens that a person is so engrossed in one sense that he is withdrawn from the
act of the others. One is rapt to the second heaven when he is alienated from sense to see
imaginable things; hence, such a person is always said to be in ecstasy. And so when Peter saw
the linen sheet (Ac. 10:11), it is said that he was in ecstasy. But Paul is said to have been rapt to
the third heaven, because he was so alienated from the senses and lifted above all bodily things
that he saw intelligible things naked and pure in the way angels and separated souls see them.
What is more, he saw God in his essence, as Augustine expressly says in Gen. ad Litt.12 and in
a Gloss, and ad Paulinus in the book, De Videndo Deum. Furthermore, it is not probable that
Moses, the minister of the Old Testament to the Jews saw God, and the minister of the New
Testament to the Gentiles, the teacher of the Gentiles, was deprived of this gift. Hence he says
above (3:9): &#8220;For if there was splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of
righteousness must far exceed it in splendor.&#8221; That Moses saw God in his essence is clear, for
he begged God: &#8220;Show me your face&#8221; (Ex. 33:13, Vulgate). And although it was denied him at
that time, it is not stated that the Lord finally denied him. Hence, Augustine says that this was
granted him by reason of what is stated in Num. (12:6): &#8220;If there is a prophet among you, I the
LORD make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with my
servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.&#8221; For he saw God openly and not in a dark
manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">453. &#8211; But would it have been possible for Paul to see God without being rapt? I answer: No, for
it is impossible that God be seen in this life by a man not alienated from his senses, because no
image or phantasm is a sufficient medium for showing God&#8217;s essence; therefore, he must be
abstracted and alienated from the senses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">454. &#8211; In a third way, by taking heaven according to things above the soul; in this way the three
heavens are the three hierarchies of angels. According to this the Apostle was rapt to the third
heaven, i.e., to see God&#8217;s essence as clearly as the angels of the higher and first hierarchy see
him, because they see God in such a way as to receive illumination in God himself and to know
the divine mysteries. This is the way Paul saw.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">455. &#8211; But if he saw God as the angels of the higher and first hierarchy do, then it seems that the
Apostle was beatified and, consequently, was immortal. I answer that although he saw God in
his essence, he was not absolutely beatified, but only in a qualified sense.  Yet it should be noted
that the vision of God by essence takes place by means of a certain light, namely, the light of
glory, of which it says in Ps. 36 (9): &#8220;In your light we see light.&#8221; But light is communicated to
some things after the manner of a passing quality and to others after the manner of an inhering
form, i.e., connaturally produced; but it is found in the air as a passing form and not as a
permanent form, because it vanishes when the sun is absent.  Similarly, the light of glory is
infused in the mind in two ways: in one way, after the manner of a form connaturally made and
permanent, and then it makes a mind beatified in the strict sense. This is the way it is infused in
the beatified in heaven. Hence they are called comprehenders and, so to say, seers. In another way
the light of glory affects a human mind as a passing quality; this is the way Paul&#8217;s mind in rapture
was enlightened by the light of glory. Hence, the very name, &#8220;rapture,&#8221; suggests that this was
done in a passing manner. Consequently, he was not glorified in the strict sense or had the mark
of glory, because that brightness was not produced as a property. As a result it was not derived
from the soul in the body, nor did he remain in this state permanently. Hence, when he was in
rapture, he had only the act of the beatified, but he was not beatified.  Thus it is clear what the
Apostle saw in his rapture, namely, the condition of the beholder, the time of the vision, and the
high point of the vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">456. &#8211; Then he tells what he did not know, namely, whether he was in the body or out of the
body, although he says that God knew. Hence he says, whether in the body or out of the body I
do not know, God knows. Some interpret this as meaning that the rapture referred to his body,
saying that the Apostle did not say he did not know whether the soul was joined to the body in
that rapture, but whether he was rapt according to the soul and body simultaneously, so as to have
been transported bodily into heaven as Habakkuk was transported (Dan. 14:35-39), or whether
it was according to the soul only that he enjoyed the vision of God, as it says in Ez. (8:3): &#8220;He
brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem.&#8221;  This was the way a certain Jew understood, as
Jerome mentions in the Prol. to Dan. 3ff., where he says: &#8220;Finally, he says that even our Apostle
does not dare to say that he was rapt in the body, but he said: whether in the body or out of the
body I do not know, God knows.&#8221; But Augustine disproves this interpretation in Gen. ad Litt.12,
because it does not agree with the other words of the Apostle. For the Apostle says that he was
rapt to the third heaven; hence he knew for certain that it was the third heaven. Consequently, he
knew whether that heaven was corporeal or incorporeal, i.e., an incorporeal thing. But if it was
incorporeal, he knew that he could not have been rapt there bodily, because a body cannot exist
in an incorporeal thing. But if it had been corporeal, he knew that the soul was not there without
the body, because the soul joined to the body cannot be in a place where there is no body, unless
the incorporeal heaven is called a likeness of the bodily heaven. But if that were the case, the
Apostle would not have said that he knew he was rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to a likeness of
heaven, because by that same token it could be said that he was rapt in the body, i.e., in the
likeness of a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">457. &#8211; Therefore it must be admitted according to Augustine that no one set in this life and living
this mortal life can see the divine essence. Hence, the Lord says: &#8220;For man shall not see me and
live&#8221; (Ex. 33:20), i.e., no man will see me, unless he is entirely separated from the body, namely,
in such a way that his soul is not in the body as a form, or if it is as a form, nevertheless his mind
is totally and altogether alienated from the sense in such a vision. Therefore, it must be said that
the Apostle says he does not know whether the soul was entirely separated from the body in that
vision. Hence he says, whether out of the body, or whether his soul existed in the body as a form,
but his mind was alienated from the bodily senses; hence, he says, whether in the body. Even
others concede this.</p>

boast, I shall not be a fool, for I shall be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it,
so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">458. &#8211; Having spoken of the first rapture, the Apostle speaks of a second rapture. First, he
mentions the rapture; secondly, its excellence (v. 4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">459. &#8211; It should be noted that a Gloss says that this rapture was distinct from the first, and if one
considers the matter well, two things are written of the Apostle to which these two raptures can
be referred. For in Acts (chap. 9) it is recorded that he remained for three days without seeing and
without taking food or drink; and the first rapture can be referred to this event, namely, that he
was rapt to the third heaven at that time. But in Acts (chap. 22) it says that he was in a trance in
the temple; hence the second rapture can refer to this.  But this does not seem to be a similar case,
because when he was in the trance, the Apostle had been cast into prison; but the Apostle wrote
this epistle long before that. Therefore it must be said that this rapture differs from the first in
regard to that into which he was rapt. For in the first rapture he had been rapt to the third heaven,
but in the second to the paradise of God</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">460. &#8211; But if you take the third heaven in a corporeal sense according to the first acceptation of
the heavens, as mentioned above, or if it was an imaginary vision, it could be called a bodily
paradise, so that he was rapt to an earthly paradise.  But this is against the author&#8217;s intention,
according to whom we say that he was rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to a vision of intelligible
things according to which they are seen in themselves and in their own natures, as has been said
above. Hence, according to this we must not understand one thing by heaven and another by
paradise, but one and the same thing by both, namely, the glory of the saints, but according to one
thing in one case and according to another thing in the other case. For heaven suggests a certain
loftiness accompanied by brightness, but paradise a certain joyful pleasantness. Now these two
things are present in an excellent way in the saints and angels who see God, because there is
present in them a most excellent brightness by which they see God, and a supreme agreeableness
by which they enjoy God. Therefore, they are said to be in heaven as to the brightness and in
paradise as to the pleasantness: &#8220;You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice&#8221; (Is. 66:14).
Therefore, both of these were conferred on the Apostle, namely to be raised up to that most
excellent clearness of knowledge, which he signifies when he says, to the third heaven, and to
experience the agreeableness of the divine sweetness; hence he says, into paradise: &#8220;O how great
is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord&#8221; (Ps. 31:20); &#8220;To him who conquers I will give some
of the hidden manna&#8221; (Rev. 2:17). This sweetness is the delight experienced in enjoying God,
and is mentioned in Matt. (25:13): &#8220;Enter into the joy of your master.&#8221; Thus the terminus of the
rapture is clear, namely, into paradise, i.e., into that sweetness with which those who are in the
heavenly Jerusalem are unceasingly refreshed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">461. &#8211; Then he mentions the excellence of that rapture, because he heard things that cannot be
told, which man may not utter. This can be explained in two ways: in one way so that the word,
&#8220;man,&#8221; is construed with &#8220;may&#8221; and &#8220;utter.&#8221; Then the sense is this: he heard secret words, i.e.,
he perceived an intimate understanding of God&#8217;s secret essence, as though by words, which
words it is not lawful to be uttered by a man. In the other way, so that &#8220;man&#8221; is construed only
with &#8220;may not&#8221;. Then the sense is this: he heard words, which it is not lawful to utter to a man,
i.e., to an imperfect man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">462. &#8211; But it should be noted according to Augustine that Paul was rapt to a vision of the divine
essence, which of course, cannot be seen by any created likeness. Hence, it is clear that what Paul
saw of the divine essence cannot be described by any human tongue; otherwise, God would not
be incomprehensible.  Therefore, according to the first explanation it must be said: he heard, i.e.,
considered, secret words, i.e., the magnificence of the godhead, which no man can utter. He says
&#8220;heard&#8221; for &#8220;saw&#8221; because that consideration was according to an interior act of the soul, in
which the same is heard and seen, as it says in Num. (12:8): &#8220;For I speak to him mouth to
mouth.&#8221; That consideration is called a vision, inasmuch as God is seen in it; and an utterance
inasmuch as man in instructed about divine things in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">463. &#8211; And because such spiritual things are not to be disclosed to the simple and imperfect, but
to the perfect, as it says in 1 Cor. (2:6): &#8220;Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom,&#8221; it is
explained in the second way, so that the secrets he heard there it is not lawful to man to utter, i.e.,
to the imperfect, but to the spiritual, among whom we speak wisdom: &#8220;It is the glory of God to
conceal things&#8221; (Prov. 25:2), i.e., the fact that it is necessary to conceal the marvelous things of
God pertains to God&#8217;s glory. The Psalm is according to the translation of Jerome: &#8220;Your praise
, O God, is silent to you&#8221; (cf. Ps. 108:2, Vulgate), that is, cannot be comprehended by our words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">464. &#8211; Then when he says, On behalf of this man I will boast, he shows how he reacted to this
glory. In regard to this he does three things. First, he shows that he did not glory in such
revelations; secondly, he suggests that he has something else in which to glory (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">465. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that the statement, on behalf of this man I will
boast [glory], but on my own behalf I will not boast, can be read in two ways. In one way so that
the Apostle is showing that he is the one in whom he glories, i.e., that he is the one who saw
these visions. In another way, to show that it was someone else who saw these visions. For it
should be noted that there are two things to consider in man, namely, the gift of God and the
human condition. If a person glories in a gift of God as received from God, that glorying is good,
as has been state above (10:17). But if he glories in that gift as though he had it of himself, then
such glorying is evil: &#8220;What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do
you boast as if it were not a gift?&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:7). According to this, therefore, the Apostle says, on
behalf of this man, namely, for the visions and gifts conferred on me by God, I will boast, but on
my own behalf I will not boast, i.e., will not glory in them as though I were their source, because
I had them from God. But if I must glory, I will glory in nothing except my weaknesses, i.e., I
have nothing in which I can glory save in my own condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">466. &#8211; But if it is explained as showing that it was someone else who saw, even if it was he, then
the sense is as though he were speaking of someone, saying, on behalf of this man I will boast,
i.e., for the man who saw this and who received these gifts I will glory; but on my own behalf,
as wishing to show that I am such a one, I will not boast except of my weaknesses, i.e., in the
tribulations I suffer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">467. &#8211; But because they could say to him, &#8220;O Apostle, it is not strange that you do not glory,
because you have nothing in which to glory,&#8221; he shows that even besides these visions he has
something in which to glory. Although I might glory in such a man and not in myself, yet I can
rightfully glory in myself, for if I should wish to boast either in such tribulations or in other
things bestowed on me by God, or even for my infirmity, I shall not be a fool, i.e., I will not act
foolishly. Why? For I will be speaking the truth about the other things in which I can glory
besides those visions. He says, I shall not be a fool, because he gloried in the things he had; for
when a person glories in things he does not have, he is speaking foolishly: &#8220;For you say, I am
rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor,
blind, and naked&#8221; (Rev. 3:17); and because he gloried with sufficient reason, as is clear from the
foregoing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">468. &#8211; Then when he says, But I refrain from it, he indicates the reason he does not glory in
everything, if he can glory, the reason being that he wishes to spare them. Hence he says, I refrain
from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me. As if to say:
I could glory in many other things, but I forbear, i.e., I glory sparingly, of I forbear commending
myself, lest I become burdensome to you. For God has conferred on me such things that if you
knew them, you would regard me as much greater; and these are the many charismatic gifts
which the Apostle had and for which the men of this world are wont to commend others and
regard them as great more than for doing something pleasing. Hence he says, I do not wish to be
commended on these gifts; therefore I refrain, i.e., I do not glory. Why? So that no one may think
more of me than what he sees in me or hears from me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">469. &#8211; Or another way: man is known in two ways: by his manner of life and by his doctrine.
Although he could have done so, the Apostle did not wish to say about himself certain things
which went beyond his life and doctrine. Consequently, I refrain, so that no one may think more
of me than he sees in me, i.e., in my outward conduct, or hears from me, i.e., from the doctrine
of my preaching and exhortation and instruction, because they might perhaps think him immortal
or an angel: &#8220;A man of understanding remains silent&#8221; (Prov. 11:12): &#8220;A fool gives full vent to
his anger, but a wise man quietly holds it back&#8221; (Prov. 29:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">470. &#8211; Or he says: But I refrain, on account of his detractors, namely, the false apostles, who said
that he glories from elation without cause or for things that were not in him. Therefore, he says,
But I refrain, i.e., I glory sparingly, so that no one, i.e., the false apostles, think of me as having
an excessive spirit of elation, more than that which he sees in me or has heard from me, i.e.,
above the power of my merits: &#8220;O LORD, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too
high&#8221; (Ps. 131:1); &#8220;The greater you are, the more humble yourself in all things&#8221; (Sir. 3:10,
Vulgate).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7 And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn
was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from
being too elated. 8 Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave
me; 9 but he said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
perfect in weakness.&#8221; I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the
power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content
with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I am
weak, then I am strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">471. &#8211; Here he speaks of the remedy against pride. In regard to this he does three things. First,
he mentions the remedy applied; secondly, he discloses his prayer to have the remedy removed
(v. 8); thirdly, he tells the Lord&#8217;s answer giving the reason for the remedy applied (v. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">472. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that very often a wise physician procures and
permits a lesser disease to come over a person in order to cure or avoid a greater one. Thus, to
cure a spasm he procures a fever. This the Apostle shows was done to him by the physician of
souls, our Lord Jesus Christ. For Christ, as the supreme physician of souls, in order to cure
greater sins, permits them to fall into lesser, and even mortal sins. But among all the sins the
gravest is pride, for just as charity is the root and beginning of the virtues, so pride is the root and
beginning of all vices: &#8220;Pride is the beginning of all sin&#8221; (Sir. 10:15, Vulgate). This is made clear
in the following way. Charity is called the root of all the virtues, because it unites one to God,
who is the ultimate end. Hence, just as the end is the beginning of all actions to be performed,
so charity is the beginning of all the virtues. But pride turns away from God, for pride is an
inordinate desire for one&#8217;s own excellence. For if a person seeks some excellence under God, if
he seeks it moderately and for a good end, it can be endured. But if it is not done with due order,
he can even fall into other vices, such as ambition, avarice, vainglory and the like. Yet it is not,
properly speaking, pride, unless a person seeks excellence without ordaining it to God. Therefore
pride, properly called, separates from God and is the root of all vices and the worst of them. This
is why God resists the proud, as it says in Jas. (4:6). Therefore, because the matter of this vice,
that is, pride, is mainly found in things that are good, because its matter is something good, God
sometimes permits his elect to be prevented by something on their part, e.g. infirmity or some
other defect, and sometimes even mortal sin, from obtaining such a good, in order that they be
so humbled on this account that they will not take pride in it, and that being thus humiliated, they
may recognize that they cannot stand by their own powers. Hence it says in Rom. (8:28): &#8220;We
know that in everything God works for good with those who love him,&#8221; not by reason of their
sin, but by God&#8217;s providence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">473. &#8211; Therefore, because the Apostle had good reason for glorying in the spiritual choice by
which he was chosen by God: &#8220;He is a chosen instrument of mine&#8221; (Ac. 9:15), and in his
knowledge of God&#8217;s secrets, because he says that he was caught up into the third heaven where
he heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter, and in enduring evils because he
had &#8220;far more imprisonments, with countless floggings, and often near death&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:23), and
in his virginal integrity, because &#8220;I wish that all were as I myself am&#8221; (1 Cor. 7:7), and especially
in the outstanding knowledge with which he shone and which especially puffs one up: for these
reasons the Lord applied a remedy, lest he be lifted up with pride. And this is what he says: to
keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations: &#8220;Do not exalt yourself through
your soul&#8217;s counsel, lest your soul be torn in pieces like a bull&#8221; (Sir. 6:2); &#8220;Being exalted I have
been humbled and troubled&#8221; (Ps. 88:15, Vulgate).  Furthermore, to show that these revelations
were made to him, he says: a thorn was given me, i.e., for my benefit and my humiliation: &#8220;You
have lifted me up and set me as it were upon the wind&#8221; (Job 31:22); there was given, I say, to me
a thorn tormenting my body with bodily weakness, that the soul might be healed. For it is said
that he literally suffered a great deal from pain in the ileum [pelvis]. Or a thorn in the flesh, i.e.,
of concupiscence arising from my flesh, because he was troubled a great deal: &#8220;For I do not do
the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. . . So I find it to be a law that when I want
to do right, evil lies close at hand. . . So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but
with my flesh I serve the law of sin&#8221; (Rom. 7:19, 21, 25). Hence, Augustine says that there
existed in him movements of concupiscence which God&#8217;s grace, nevertheless, restrained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">474. &#8211; That thorn, I say, is a messenger of Satan, i.e., a wicked angel, for it was an angel sent by
God or permitted, but it was Satan&#8217;s because Satan&#8217;s intention is to subvert, but God&#8217;s is to
humble and to render approved. Let the sinner beware, if the Apostle and vessel of election was
not secure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">475. &#8211; Now the Apostle was anxious to have this thorn removed and prayed that it might; hence
he says: Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me. Here it should be
noted a sick person, ignorant of the reason why a physician supplies a stinging plaster, asks him
to remove it. But the physician, knowing its purpose, that is, for health, does not oblige him,
caring more for his improvement. Similarly the Apostle, feeling that the sting was painful to him,
sought the help of the unique physician to remove it. For he expressly and devoutly asked God
three times to remove it, the thorn, from him: &#8220;We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon
you&#8221; (2 Chr. 20:12). Perhaps he asked this many times, but he asked him expressly and earnestly
three times, or three times, namely, many times. For three is a perfect number. And of course it
was right to ask, because &#8220;For he wounds, but he binds up&#8221; (Job 5:18); &#8220;Pray that you may not
enter into temptation&#8221; (Lk. 22:46).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">476. &#8211; Then he states the Lord&#8217;s answer: but he, i.e., the Lord, said to me: My grace is sufficient
for you. Here he does two things. First, he states the Lord&#8217;s answer; secondly, the reason for the
answer (v. 9b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">477. &#8211; He says therefore, I asked, but the Lord said to me, my grace is sufficient for you. As if
to say: it is not necessary that this bodily weakness leave you, because it is not dangerous, for you
will not be led into impatience, since my grace strengthens you; or that this weakness of
concupiscence depart, because it will not lead you to sin, for my grace will protect you: &#8220;Justified
by his grace as a gift&#8221; (Rom. 3:24). And of course, God&#8217;s grace is sufficient for avoiding evil,
doing good, and attaining to eternal life: &#8220;By the grace of God I am what I am&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10);
&#8220;But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221; (Rom. 6:25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">478. &#8211; But on the other hand it says in Jn. (15:16): &#8220;Whatever you ask the Father in my name,
he may give it to you.&#8221; Therefore, Paul either asked discreetly and deserved to be heard, or
indiscreetly and hence sinned. I answer that a man can speak of one and the same thing in two
ways: in one way according to itself and the nature of things; in another way according to its
relation to something else. Hence, it happens that something evil according to itself and to be
avoided is in relation to something else able to be sought. Thus, a medicine, inasmuch as it is
bitter should be avoided, yet, when it is considered in relation to health, a person seeks it.
Therefore a thorn in the flesh according to itself is to be avoided as troublesome, but inasmuch
as it is a means to virtue and an exercise of virtue, it should be desired.  But because that secret
of divine providence, namely, that it would turn out to his advantage, had not been revealed to
him yet, the Apostle considered that in itself it was bad for him. But God who had ordained this
to the good of his humility did not oblige him, as far as his wish was concerned; indeed, once he
understood its purpose, the Apostle gloried in it, saying, I will all the more gladly boast of my
weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon [dwell in] me. And although he did not
oblige him as to his wish, yet he heard him and does hear his saints to their advantage. Hence,
Jerome says in the Letter to Paulinus: &#8220;The good Lord frequently does not grant what we wish,
in order to bestow what we should prefer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">479. &#8211; Then he gives the reason for the Lord&#8217;s response when he says, for my power is made
perfect in weakness [infirmity]. This is a remarkable expression: virtue is made perfect in
infirmity; fire grows in water. But this can be understood in two ways, namely, materially and
by way of occasion. If it is taken materially, the sense is this: infirmity is the material on which
to exercise virtue; first, humility, as stated above; secondly, patience: &#8220;The testing of your faith
produces steadfastness&#8221; (Jas. 1:3); thirdly, temperance, because hunger is weakened by infirmity
and a person is made temperate. But if it is taken as an occasion, infirmity is the occasion for
arriving at perfect virtue, because a man who knows that he is weak is more careful when
resisting, and as a result of fighting and resisting more he is better exercised and, therefore,
stronger. Hence it says in Jdg. (3:1) that the Lord was not willing to destroy all the inhabitants
of the land, but preserved some in order that the children of Israel might be exercised by fighting
against them. In the same way, Scipio also did not wish to destroy the city of Carthage, in order
that the Romans, having external enemies, would not have internal enemies, against whom it is
more painful to wage war than against outsiders, as he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">480. &#8211; Then the Apostle mentions the effect of this answer from the Lord, saying: I will all the
more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. He mentions
two effects. One is glorying; hence he says: because my virtue is made perfect in infirmity, I will
all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, i.e., given to me for my profit; and this because it
joins me closer to Christ: &#8220;But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ&#8221; (Gal. 6:14); &#8220;But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth?&#8221; (Sir. 10:34.
Vulgate).  The reason I will glory gladly is that the power of Christ may rest upon me [dwell in
me], i.e., that through infirmity the grace of Christ may dwell and be made perfect in me: &#8220;He
gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength&#8221; (Is. 40:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">481. &#8211; The other effect is joy. Hence he says: For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with
weaknesses. In regard to this he does two things. First, he mentions the effect of joy; secondly,
he assigns the reason for it (v. 10b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">482. &#8211; He mentions the effect of joy and the matter of joy. He says therefore: because the power
of Christ dwells in me in all tribulations, I am content, i.e., I am greatly pleased and take joy in
the infirmities I mentioned: &#8220;Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials&#8221; (Jas.
1:2).  The weaknesses in which he rejoices abundantly on account of Christ&#8217;s grace are then
listed. First, those which come from an internal cause, namely, his infirmities; hence he says, in
my weaknesses: &#8220;Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste&#8221; (Ps. 16:5,
Vulgate), namely, toward grace. Secondly, those that come from an external cause: first, as to the
word, when he says, in insults: &#8220;Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name&#8221; (Ac. 15:4); then as to deed, and this either
as to a lack of good things, when he says, in hardships, i.e., in the lack of things necessary and
in the poverty by which he was pressed: &#8220;Contribute to the needs of the saints&#8221; (Rom. 12:13). Or
as to experiencing evils inflicted, and this as to external things: &#8220;Blessed are those who are
persecuted for righteousness&#8217; sake&#8221; (Matt. 5:10), when he says, in bodily persecutions, which we
experience from place to place and everywhere, as well as to internal things, saying, in
calamities, i.e., in anxieties of soul: &#8220;I am straitened on every side&#8221; (Dan. 13:22, Vulgate). But
in all these things the material which makes for joy is that they are for Christ. As if to say: I am
pleased because I suffer for Christ: &#8220;But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief&#8221; (1 Pet.
4:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">483. &#8211; He assigns the reason for this joy, when he says, for when I am weak, then I am strong,
i.e., when as a result of what is in me or as a result of persecutions, I fall into any of the aforesaid,
God&#8217;s help is applied to me to strengthen me: &#8220;Your consolations cheer my soul&#8221; (Ps. 94:19);
&#8220;Let the weak say, I am strong&#8221; (Jl. 3:10, Vulgate); &#8220;Though our outer nature is wasting away,
our inner nature is being renewed every day&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:16). And in Ex. (1:12) it says that the
more the Israelites were oppressed, the more they multiplied.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="124"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">12-4</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11 I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended
by you. For I am not at all inferior to these superlative apostles, even though I am
nothing. 12 The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all patience,
with signs and wonders and mighty works. 13 For in what were you less favored
than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me
this wrong!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">484. &#8211; Having commended himself, the Apostle now asks pardon for what he has said, showing
that he was compelled to say these things which pertain to his glory. First, he lays the blame for
his glorying on the Corinthians; secondly, he explains and clarifies this (v. 11b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">485. &#8211; First, therefore, he says: I confess that in all these commendations I have been a fool, i.e.,
it seems to you that I have performed the work of a fool. But this was not done of myself or
willingly; rather, I was compelled, and it was your fault, because you forced me to it, i.e., gave
me the occasion. For subjects frequently compel their prelates to do things which seem unwise
to do, although considering the time and place, they were done wisely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">486. &#8211; Then he explains what he had said in a general way, namely, that they were the cause of
his commending himself, when he says: for I ought to have been commended by you. Here he
says that they were the cause of his commending himself: first, by neglecting the good they
should have done, in which he enlarges upon their ingratitude; secondly, by committing evil, in
which he execrates their malice (v. 20). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he reminds
them what they ought to have done by showing the cause (v. 11c); secondly, he rejects their
excuse (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">487. &#8211; He says therefore: yes, you compelled me, because you should have done what I have
done; hence he says: for I ought to have been commended by you, which you have not done when
in was necessary, that is, when the false apostles by belittling me and preferring themselves
rendered vile the doctrine and gospel of Christ delivered by me. Hence, because you did not
commend me, then in order that the faith of Christ not die among you, I undertook to commend
myself.  But this is in conflict with his earlier statement (3:1): &#8220;Do we need, as some do, letters
of recommendation to you, or from you?&#8221; So why would he wish to be commended by them? I
answer that the Apostle did not need commendations for himself, but for others, namely, that in
commending himself his doctrine would be held in greater authority and the false apostles
refuted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">488. &#8211; But because they could say: &#8220;we did not commend you, because there is nothing
commendable about you,&#8221; the Apostle proves to them that they had good cause to commend him,
when he says: For I am not at all inferior to these superlative apostles, thus showing that there
was much in him commendable. First, as to the past good things he did; secondly, as to the good
things he intends to do (v. 14). First, in general as to all the churches; secondly, in particular as
to what he did among them (v. 11d); thirdly he excludes an objection (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">489. &#8211; He says therefore: I deserved to be commended by you, because there are many things in
me worthy of commendation, for I am not at all inferior, namely, Peter and James and John, who
are superlative apostles, i.e., who seem to some to be worthier apostles than I. For the false
apostles said that they had been taught by Peter and John, who had been taught by Christ, and
that Peter and John observed the ceremonies of the Law; hence, that they too should observe
them. But because I have done nothing else among you, either as to preaching or to converting
believers or performing miracles and undertaking labours, but rather have done more, because
&#8220;I worked harder than any of them&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10), for that reason I am more to be commended.
Or they were called superlative apostles, that is, Peter, James and John, because they were the
first ones converted to Christ: &#8220;Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me&#8221; (1
Cor. 15:8). If it is taken in this sense, even then I have done nothing less than they, because in
the short time after I was converted, I labored more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">490. &#8211; But granting that I did nothing in regard to the other churches for which I might be
commended, nevertheless I have done many special things among you, and for these you could
have commended me; hence he says, even though I am nothing, i.e., granting that I did nothing
in comparison to them, nevertheless, the effect of my power is present among you. First, as to
our preaching, by which you were converted to the faith, and I am your apostle. Yet the signs of
a true apostle, i.e., of my preaching, were performed among you by God, inasmuch as believing,
you were converted: &#8220;You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:2); &#8220;For I became
your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:15).  Secondly, by the manner of life
through which faith is strengthened, because when one&#8217;s life agrees with his doctrine, the
doctrine has greater authority, and the virtue of the preacher is more apparent through patience:
&#8220;The learning of a man is known by patience&#8221; (Prov. 19:11, Vulgate); therefore he says, in all
patience. Thirdly, as to working miracles; hence he says, with signs and wonders and mighty
works: &#8220;And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and
confirmed the message by the signs that attended it&#8221; (Mk. 16:20)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">491. &#8211; These three things are distinct, because &#8220;might&#8221; [virtus] is common to all miracles, for
might is the full extent of a power. Therefore, something is called mighty [virtuosum] because
it proceeds from great power [virtute]. Therefore, because miracles come from great power,
namely the divine, they are therefore called &#8220;powers&#8221; [virtutes]. But &#8220;sign&#8221; refers to a lesser
miracle, and &#8220;wonder&#8221; to a greater one.  Or he says &#8220;signs&#8221; as to miracles performed in regard
to the present and &#8220;wonders&#8221; in regard to miracles concerning the future. Or signs and wonders
refer to miracles done contrary to nature; for example, giving sight to the blind, raising from the
dead, and so on. But mighty deeds are things according to nature, not performed in the way
nature does, as for a sick man to be healed immediately, when one&#8217;s hands are placed on him;
for nature produces the same effect step by step. Or mighty deeds mean the virtues of the mind,
such as chastity and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">492. &#8211; Then he excludes an objection, when he says, For in what were you less favored than the
rest of the churches? For the Corinthians could answer and say: it is true that you have done
many good and great things, but others have done more and greater things than you. Therefore,
we are not willing to commend you to them or in comparison with them. But he excludes this,
saying: For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches? i.e., than the other
churches of Christ have obtained through him in spiritual matters. As if to say: nothing, because
they preached the faith and the Apostle preached the faith; they showed signs and wonders, and
so did the Apostle. In fact not only do you not have less, but even more, because the other
apostles live on the revenues of those to whom they preached, but not the Apostle. For he took
nothing from the Corinthians; hence he says: except that I myself did not burden you by taking
what was yours. As if to say: you received nothing less, unless perhaps you count it as less that
I have not taken anything from you, which however is more: &#8220;You yourselves know that these
hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me&#8221; (Ac. 20:34); &#8220;With toil and
labor we worked night and day&#8221; (2 Th. 3:8); &#8220;Who shakes his hands, lest they hold a bribe&#8221; (Is.
33:15). But if you count this an injury, namely, that I refused to take anything from you (as I did
not), because I did not love you, and it seems to you that I have done wrong, spare me. Hence he
says in irony, forgive, that is, spare me this wrong! In this manner it says in Eph. (4:32):
&#8220;Forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">14 Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden,
for I seek not what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their
parents, but parents for their children. 15 I will most gladly spend and be spent
for your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less? 16 But granting
that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you
by guile. 17 Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to
you? 18 I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take
advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same
steps? 19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending
ourselves before you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in
Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">493. &#8211; Here he shows that he is worthy of commendation in regard to good things he intends to
do. He does three things. First, he states his resolution concerning the future good he intends to
do; secondly, he assigns the reason for this resolution (v. 14c); thirdly, he applies a likeness to
his reason (v. 14d).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">494. &#8211; It should be noted in regard to the first that sometimes it happens that the reason why some
do not receive at one time is that they might be keeping themselves in reserve for another time,
in which they can receive both more and more boldly. Therefore, lest they suppose something
like this of the Apostle, namely, that he refused to take anything from them the first time, in order
that he might receive more the second time, he says that he not only did this in the past, but is
prepared to do the same in the future; hence he says, Here for the third time I am ready to come
to you. And I will not be a burden. As if to say: not even then will I burden you by taking what
is yours: &#8220;So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:9); &#8220;I hold
fast my righteousness, and will not let it go&#8221; (Job. 27:6).  He says, here for the third time I am
ready to come, and not &#8220;this third time I am coming,&#8221; because he certainly was prepared to go
to them a third time, yet he went only twice. For he was prepared to go the first time; he went and
they were converted. He was ready a second time, but he was prevented on account of their sin.
It was for this that he apologized in the beginning of this letter. Now he was ready to go a third
time, and he went. Hence he went twice, but he was ready to go three times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">495. &#8211; Then he gives the reason for this good resolution, when he says: for I seek not what is
yours but you. The reasoning is this: it is clear that an artisan arranges his work according to the
end he has in view, but when preachers preach, some intend revenue and temporal goods;
consequently they arrange and direct all their preaching to this. Others intend the salvation of
souls; consequently, they arrange their preaching according as they deem it expedient for the
salvation of souls. Therefore, because the Apostle in his preaching aimed at the salvation of the
Corinthians and he saw that it was expedient to take no revenue from them, both in order to
shame the false apostles and also because they were covetous, he refused to take any revenue.
Hence he assigns this reason: I will not burden you by taking anything, because I seek not what
is yours by my preaching, but you and your salvation are what I aim to procure: &#8220;Not that I seek
the gift; but I seek the fruit&#8221; (Phil. 4:17). Therefore the Lord said to the apostles: &#8220;I will make you
fishers of men&#8221; (Matt. 4:19), not of money. This is also prefigured in Gen. (chap. 47), where we
read that Joseph brought some Egyptians for the service of the king, because the good preacher
should be intent upon converting believers to the service of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">496. &#8211; He adapts a simile to this reasoning, when he says: for children ought not to lay up for
their parents, but parents for their children. First, he presents the simile; secondly, he adapts it
(v. 15); thirdly, he criticizes their ingratitude (v. 15b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">497. &#8211; He says therefore: I do not seek what is yours. This is clear from a simile. For we observe
that parents according to the flesh should lay up for their children, because children ought not to
lay up for their parents, but parents for their children. Therefore, since I am your spiritual father
and you are my children, I do not want you to lay up for me, but I for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">498. &#8211; But there is a question here about parents according to the flesh, for it says in Ex. (20:12):
&#8220;Honor your father and your mother,&#8221; which includes that we must minister to their needs.
Therefore the children are bound to lay up for their parents. I answer that this precept binds
children to minister to and help their parents in necessity, but not to gather and lay up for them.
For laying up and gathering have an eye on the future. But in nature the children succeed the
parents and not vice versa, except in some sad cases. Therefore the love of parents naturally
induces them to lay up for the children. It is in this way that the Apostle speaks; but in Ex. (chap.
20) the Lord is speaking about helping them in case of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">499. &#8211; Another question that arises concerns the statement that the children should not lay up for
their parents, but the parents for the children. Therefore, since prelates are our spiritual parents,
it seems that princes and others do wrong when they give their riches to prelates. I answer that
they gave them to prelates not for themselves, but for the poor, and this is what the Lord teaches:
&#8220;Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where
thieves do not break in and steal&#8221; (Matt. 6:20). Hence they are given to prelates as dispensers to
the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">500. &#8211; Then he applies the simile, in which he proposed two things: one is that the children
should not lay up for the parents, and this is now clear. The other is that parents should lay up
for and give to the children; in regard to this he says: therefore, because I am your father, I am
ready to give to you, and this is what he says: I will most gladly spend good things on you, not
only spiritual goods by preaching and giving examples, but even temporal goods, which he did,
inasmuch as he preached to them and served them with the revenues of other churches. Every
prelate should minister these three things to his subjects; hence the Lord said to Peter three times:
&#8220;Feed my sheep&#8221; (Jn. 21:17), i.e., food them by word, feed them by example, feed them by
temporal subsidies.  Not only will I give those things to you, but I am ready to die for your
salvation; hence he says, and be spent for your souls: &#8220;Greater love has no man than this, that a
man lay down his life for his friends&#8221; (Jn. 15:13); &#8220;He laid down his life for us; and we ought to
lay down our lives for the brethren&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:16); &#8220;The good shepherd lays down his life for the
sheep&#8221; (Jn. 10:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">501. &#8211; Then he criticizes their ingratitude when he says, If I love you the more, am I to be loved
the less? As if to say: gladly will I be spent for you, although you are ungrateful, because
although I love you the more, I am loved the less. This comparison can be explained in two ways.
First, in this way: although I love you the more than the other apostles, yet I am loved the less,
namely, by you, than the false apostles are loved, whom you love more than me. Thus it is
evident that I love you more than they, because I seek only your salvation, but they seek only
your goods.  In another way thus: although I love you the more than the other churches,
nevertheless I am love less by you than by the other churches: &#8220;For God is my witness, how I
yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil. 1:8). That he loved the Corinthians
more than he loved the other churches is clear from the fact that he labored more for them. But
that for which we labor more, we love more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">502. &#8211; Then when he says, But granting that I myself did not burden you, he removes a suspicion.
First, he mentions the suspicion; secondly, he excludes it (v. 17); thirdly, he assigns the reason
for the exclusion (v. 19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">503. &#8211; Their suspicion might be that the reason he did not take anything for himself was that
others might take more from them. Therefore, he says: But granting, that is, granting that I
myself, in my person and in those who are with me, did not burden you by taking anything, but
as you believed, I was crafty and got the better of you by guile, i.e., I took many more of your
goods through other persons. But this is false, because I have done nothing by guile: &#8220;For our
appeal does not spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with guile&#8221; (1 Th. 2:3). For he
was an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile (Jn. 1:47).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">504. &#8211; Then he excludes this suspicion when he says, Did I take advantage of you through any
of those whom I sent to you? First, in general; secondly, in particular. In general in the following
way: if I had wanted to snatch anything from you by others, I would have sent those who might
obtain these things. But did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you, by
using them to extort your goods? As if to say: No: &#8220;We have taken advantage of no one&#8221;(2 Cor.
7:2); &#8220;That no man transgress, and wrong his brother in this matter&#8221; (1 Th. 4:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">505. &#8211; He excludes their suspicion in particular when he says: I urged Titus to go, and sent the
brother with him. As if to say: none of those whom I sent to you overreached you. For I sent Titus
to you with entreaties. And this is what he says: I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with
him, namely, Barnabas or Luke: &#8220;With him,&#8221; namely Titus, &#8220;we are sending the brother,&#8221; namely
one of those mentioned, &#8220;who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel&#8221;
(2 Cor. 8:18).  But did Titus take advantage of you? As if to say: No: &#8220;But thanks be to God who
puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus&#8221; (2 Cor. 8:16). That Titus did not
overreach them he proves by showing that Titus was of the same mind as the Apostle, and he
mentions two points of similarity: first, in the heart; hence he says: Did we not act in the same
spirit?, i.e., have the same will; or we were inspired by the same spirit to act well and correctly:
&#8220;Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, &#8216;I believed, and so I spoke,&#8217; we too
believe, and so we speak&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:13). Secondly, in work; hence he says: Did we not take the
same steps, i.e., intent on the same works? That is to say, in the steps of Christ, for I walk in the
steps of Christ: &#8220;I have kept his way,&#8221; namely, Christ&#8217;s, &#8220;and have not turned aside&#8221; (Job 23:11);
&#8220;Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps&#8221; (1 Pet.
2:21). And Titus follows my steps: &#8220;Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:1).
Therefore, if he agrees with me in will and in work, and I have not overreached you and do not
intend to overreach you, the conclusion is evident. That he did not overreach them is clear from
Matt. (7:16): &#8220;By their fruits you shall know them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">506. &#8211; The he adds the reason, which excludes their opinion. First, he states their opinion;
secondly, he excludes it (v. 19). Their opinion was that the Apostle, as one guilty and culpable,
was writing all the words of this epistle to justify himself, and that they were not true, but merely
invented to justify himself. Therefore, he sets down their opinion, saying: Have you been
thinking all along, i.e., from the beginning of this epistle, that we have been defending ourselves
before you, i.e., that the words of this epistle are not true, but are fabricated as an excuse?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">507. &#8211; But he excludes this: for a person who excuses himself in that way has two things: one is
that he does not use true words, but fabrications; the other is that he was not wont to suffer the
loss of reputation and glory. Hence, it is especially because of the loss of reputation that they
make excuses. But neither of these is verified in us. Therefore, your opinion is not true. That
neither of these is verified in us is clear, because we do not employ false words. This he proves
first by God&#8217;s testimony, because it is in the sight of God that we are speaking. As if to say: God
is my witness, that I speak the truth: &#8220;Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven&#8221; (Job 16:19)
Secondly, by the testimony of Christ, because we have been speaking in Christ, i.e., by Christ in
whom there is not falsity: &#8220;But as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God
we speak in Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 2:17). Furthermore, we do not seek our own glory or fear loss of
reputation, because all things which I have said about my revelations and tribulations, I do or say
for your upbuilding, namely, that you continue in virtue and expel the false apostles: &#8220;Let us then
pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.&#8221; (Rom. 14:19); &#8220;Let all things be done
for edification.&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:26); &#8220;This voice has come for your sake, not for mine&#8221; (Jn. 12:30).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">20 For I fear that perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, and that you
may find me not what you wish; that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy,
anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. 21 I fear that when I
come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over
many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity,
immorality, and licentiousness which they have practiced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">508. &#8211; Having cited as one of the causes for commending the failure of the Corinthians to do the
good things they should have done and for which he rebuked their ingratitude, he now states the
other cause which arose from what they did in regard to the evils they should have avoided. In
regard to this he amplifies their wickedness and does two things. First, he mentions their fault
in general; secondly, he explains it in detail (v. 20b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">509. &#8211; He says therefore: I have praised myself not only because you have failed to praise me,
but also because of your danger, which consists in clinging to the false apostles, because by
fostering sin among you they were exposing you to great danger. Therefore he says, I fear that
perhaps I may come and find you not what I wish, namely, just, but sinners and uncorrected, and
that you will be displeasing to me and I to you, because sinners as sinners are not pleasing to a
just man; and that you may find me, i.e., sad and meting out punishment, not what you wish to
have me. For evil persons hate correction and the truth: &#8220;Have I then become your enemy by
telling you the truth?&#8221; (Gal. 4:16). Thus their evil is clear in general, namely, that he feared lest
they were not yet fully repentant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">510. &#8211; Then he manifests their sinfulness in particular, when he says, that perhaps there may be
quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder. In regard to this
he does two things. First, he enumerates their present evils; secondly, he reminds them of past
evils of which they have not yet repented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">511. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that after their conversion the Corinthians fell into
sins of the flesh, as is evident from the one who had his father&#8217;s wife; and for this they were
corrected by the first epistle, although not completely, because something still remained among
them. In addition to this there remained among them many spiritual sins which are directly
opposed to charity. Now charity does two things: first, it makes men&#8217;s hearts consent to one
another; secondly, it induces men to mutual progress. Spiritual sins, on the other hand, set men
disagreeing and make them offend one another. First, therefore, he lists the spiritual sins which
pertain to dissention; secondly, those which make for offense (v. 20c). In regard to dissensions
he proceeds in reverse order. For according to the right order, men first disagree, inasmuch as one
wants one thing and another the contrary; secondly, they pass from this to inflicting injury,
inasmuch as each one wants to obtain his desire; thirdly, when he cannot obtain his desire but
fails, he burns with the zeal of jealousy [envy]; fourthly, the result of this is verbal argument.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">512. &#8211; It is from the last of these that the Apostle begins, saying, that perhaps there may be
quarreling [contentions]. As if to say: not only do I fear your evils in general, but also in
particular, lest perhaps there be among you contentions over the merits of prelates and baptizers:
&#8220;It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife&#8221; (Prov. 20:3). &#8220;Contention is an attack on the
truth, accompanied by the confidence of shouting&#8221; (Ambrose).  This contention springs from
jealousy; hence he says, and jealousy by those who are inferior and have less: &#8220;For where
jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice&#8221; (Jas. 3:16);
&#8220;Jealousy slays the simple&#8221; (Job 5:2); &#8220;But through the devil&#8217;s envy death entered the world&#8221;
(Wis. 2:24).  Envy comes from animosity; hence he says, anger, in revenge and inflicting injury:
&#8220;Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he burden you with his evils&#8221; (Sir. 8:18, Vulgate).
Animosity comes from dissensions; hence he says, selfishness, i.e., hatreds and conflicts of
spirits: &#8220;Take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties, in opposition to the doctrine
which you have been taught&#8221; (Rom. 15:17); &#8220;All of you agree and that there be no dissensions
among you&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">513. &#8211; Then he lists their present evils in regard to offending. But because such evils consist
mainly in injuries from words and not from deeds, he passes over injuries from deeds and lists
those from words. Here too he proceeds in reverse order, beginning from the last; and this is
when a person explicitly says something evil of another. If this is in public, he is a detractor;
hence he says, slander [detraction]: &#8220;Slanderers, haters of God&#8221; (Rom. 1:30). If it is in secret, he
is a whisperer; hence he says, gossip [whisperings]. For whisperers are persons who discreetly
sow discord: &#8220;The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed&#8221; (Sir. 28:5, Vulgate).  These two
proceed from evil words against others; therefore he says, conceit [swelling]. These swellings
arise from seditions, which are the preparations made by the parties to a fight, because they are
always quarrels among the proud; hence he says, disorder, i.e., uproars for fights: &#8220;An evil man
always seek quarrels&#8221; (Prov. 17:11, Vulgate). Thus their wickedness is made clear in regard to
present evils, which are many both in dissensions and in injuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">514. &#8211; Then he manifests their wickedness in regard to past evils for which they have not
repented, when he says: I fear that when I come again my God may humble me, i.e., afflict me,
before you and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned before, i.e., before the first
epistle. And rightly do I mourn, because just as the glory of the father is in the glory of his
children, so the father&#8217;s shame is the shame of the children. Thus did Samuel mourn over Saul:
&#8220;How long will you grieve over Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel?&#8221;
(1 Sam. 16:1).  And this because they have not repented or done penance for their past carnal
sins, some of which are contrary to nature; hence he says, and have not repented of the impurity,
i.e., lust contrary to nature. Some are committed with women no longer virgins, namely, widows
or married women; hence he says, immorality [fornication]; others are committed by deflowering
virgins; hence he says, and licentiousness which they have practiced continually: &#8220;Now the works
of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness&#8221; (Gal. 5:19).</p>

that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful
in you. 4 For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we
are weak in him, but in dealing with you we shall live with him by the power of

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">515. &#8211; Having said many things to the disadvantage of the false apostles, the Apostle now speaks
against those who have been misled by them. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
rebukes those who have been misled; secondly, he congratulates those who remained faithful (v.
11). In regard to the first he does three things. First, he threatens a severe sentence; secondly, he
discloses his judiciary power (v. 3); thirdly, he warns them to amend themselves (v. 5). In regard
to the first he does three things. First, he promises his presence; secondly, he indicates the form
of his judgment (v. 1b); thirdly, he threatens a severe sentence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">516. &#8211; Therefore, he first promises to come, saying, behold I am coming to you. As if to say: be
assured that I am coming to you, so take care that I do not find you unprepared. He says: This is
the third time, not that he had come a third time, but because he was prepared a third time to
come; for he actually came only once so far, although he was ready to come the second time but
was prevented: &#8220;But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">517. &#8211; I will come, I say, and judge the wicked; in an orderly fashion, however, that by the
evidence of two or three witnesses accusing or bearing witness against anyone, any charge of the
accusers must be sustained. This is based on Deut. (17:6): &#8220;A person shall not be put to death on
the evidence of one witness,&#8221; and Deut. (19:15): &#8220;A single witness shall not prevail against a
man.&#8221; Or another way: in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand. As if to
say: that which I say about my coming to you is as certain as the testimony of two or three. Thus
there will be an order in the judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">518. &#8211; But he threatens a severe sentence, saying: I warned those who sinned before and all the
others. Here he first suggests the judicial process to be followed, which requires that three
warnings have been given. In regard to this he says: I have warned you before twice, as I warned
them when present, namely, when I was among you, so I warn them now, that is, while absent.
Thus he warns them three times. I warn, I say, those who sinned before and all the others. As if
to say: I warn everyone.  Secondly, having given the warning, he threatens the sentence; hence,
he says, that if I come again I will not spare them. As if to say: those who sinned I spared the first
time; but if they sin again, or have not done penance, I will not spare them again. This would be
just, because a person who is forgiven once and sins again, if he were forgiven, would grow in
malice and become insolent. Hence the wise man says in Prov. (13:24): &#8220;He that spares the rod
hates his son.&#8221;  As a result the Church has decreed that three admonitions must be given before
it declares one excommunicated, because it happens that some, although they are in sin and
offend, are corrected by a mere word of warning and make satisfaction. But if they are not
influenced by warnings, the severity of sentence must be applied, lest they grow more insolent:
&#8220;Because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is
fully set to do evil&#8221; (Ec. 8:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">519. &#8211; Then, lest they belittle the Apostle&#8217;s power, he discloses his judicial power, saying: Do
you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me? Here he does three things. First, he shows that he
has delegation and power to judge from Christ; secondly, he shows Christ&#8217;s power (v. 3b);
thirdly, he shows that Christ&#8217;s power is distributed to others</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">520. &#8211; He says therefore: if I come, I shall not spare; rather, I shall judge most severely. And I
can do this, because I have Christ&#8217;s authority to punish and forgive: &#8220;What I have forgiven, if I
have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 2:8); &#8220;So we
are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:20). Therefore, he says:
Do you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me? As if to say: have no doubts about my power,
because whatever I utter either by passing sentence or forgiving or preaching, I say from Christ:
&#8220;Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth&#8221; (Ex. 4:12); &#8220;For I will give you a mouth and
wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict&#8221; (Lk. 21:15).
Therefore, whatever a man says under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is said
to do. Therefore, the Apostle, because he was moved by Christ to say this, attributed it to Christ
as to the principal cause, saying, that Christ is speaking in me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">521. &#8211; But lest there be any doubt about Christ&#8217;s power and might, and Apostle discusses the
might of Christ, when he says, He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you. Herein
he shows Christ&#8217;s power as to things which are manifested in them; secondly, as to things which
are in Christ: For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God.  He says
therefore: I have judiciary power from Christ, who speaks in me, who is mighty in you by giving
the gifts of grace, the distribution of the Spirit and many other things you have experienced; and
not only is he not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you, because he has mightily
delivered you from sin and turned you to good: &#8220;The LORD, strong and mighty&#8221; (Ps. 24:8);
&#8220;Your power is at hand when you will&#8221; (Wis. 12:18, Vulgate); and a little before (v. 17): &#8220;For
you show your strength when men doubt the completeness of your power.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">522. &#8211; Not only in you has Christ&#8217;s power appeared, but also in himself, inasmuch as he rose
from the death of the cross, which he endured from human weakness, which he assumed in
poverty and lives by the power of God, which is God: &#8220;The weakness of God is stronger than
men&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:25). Or by the power of God, namely, of the Father who is also the power of
Christ, because the power of the Father and of the Son are the same: &#8220;I died, and behold, I am
alive forevermore&#8221; (Rev. 1:18).  But this power of Christ is also distributed to us, for we also are
weak in him. As if to say: that power pertains to us also, because we are weak in him, i.e., as to
its aim, inasmuch as we suffer many things and mortify ourselves and humiliate ourselves for
him: &#8220;We are weak for Christ&#8217;s sake&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:10); &#8220;His bodily presence is weak&#8221; (2 Cor.
10:10); &#8220;Always carrying in the body the death of Jesus&#8221; (2 Cor. 4:10). Therefore, we shall live,
i.e., shall be alive with him by the power of God in you, who are to be judged: &#8220;Through Jesus
Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead&#8221; (Gal. 1:1).  The sense is this: we are
raised by the power by which Christ lives, and from that power we also have the power to judge
among you; hence, we shall live with a happiness similar to his, and this by the power of God,
which power is in you, i.e., in your consciences.</p>

I write this while I am away from you, in order that when I come I may not have
to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me for building
up and not for tearing down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">523. &#8211; After threatening God&#8217;s severe judgment, the Apostle warns them to be ready, so that they
will not experience a severe judgment. First, he gives the admonition; secondly, he assigns the
reason for it (v. 10). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he presents the admonition;
secondly, he excludes a false suspicion (v. 7). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he
advises them to examine themselves; secondly, he suggests what they will be able to find through
such an examination (v. 5b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">524. &#8211; In regard to the first it should be noted that one who would appear in judgment securely
should first examine himself on his deeds; in that way he can tell whether he will appear safely.
Therefore the Apostle warns them that before they come to judgment, which will take place when
he comes to them, they should examine themselves, saying: examine yourselves, i.e., examine
and reflect on your acts: &#8220;Test everything; hold fast what is good&#8221; (1 Th. 5:21). He advises them
to examine themselves on two points, namely, on faith; hence he says: to see whether you are
holding to your faith, namely, which I have preached to you and you have received from me
concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, or have fallen away and lapsed into another. This is necessary
because in 1 Cor. (11:31) it says: &#8220;But if we judged ourselves truly, we should not be judged&#8221;;
&#8220;Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done&#8221; (Jer. 2:23). Likewise all works,
when he says: test yourselves, whether you be in good works, or whether your conscience bothers
you for having done some evil. This is useful, because it says in 1 Cor. (2:28): &#8220;Let a man
examine himself&#8221;; and in Gal. (6:4): &#8220;Let each one test his own work.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">525. &#8211; Then when he says, Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? he shows what they can
find through such an examination. First, what they might find in themselves; secondly, what they
might find in the Apostle (v. 6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">526. &#8211; In themselves they will be able to discover two things by this examination, because they
will either know that they are keeping the faith, and thus they will be able to find and know that
Christ is in them; and this is what he says: Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? i.e., if
you were to examine yourselves, would you know that you have the faith and recognize that
Christ is in you? As if to say: Yes, because where faith in Christ is, there Christ is: &#8220;That Christ
may dwell in your hearts through faith&#8221; (Eph. 3:17); &#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple
of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God?&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:19).  Or they will know that
they are not keeping the faith and will find themselves reprobates; hence he says, unless indeed
you fail to meet the test! i.e., you will find that you have Christ, unless you have lost the faith and
are fallen from the state of previously having had the faith: &#8220;You have rejected me, says the
LORD, you keep going backward&#8221; (Jer. 15:6); &#8220;For the wicked are not removed. Refuse silver
they are called&#8221; (Jer. 6:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">527. &#8211; But here there is a literal question in regard to the statement: Do you not realize that Jesus
Christ is in you? For Christ only remains in those who have charity, as it says in 1 Jn. (4:16):
&#8220;God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him&#8221; If therefore we
know that Christ is in us by faith, it is required that this be by formed faith. But this is contrary
to Ec. (9:1): &#8220;Their deeds are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hate man does not know.&#8221;
I answer that &#8220;Christ dwelling in us&#8221; can be taken in two ways, namely, in regard to the intellect
or in regard to the affections [affectum]. If it is taken in regard to the intellect, then he dwells in
us by unformed faith; and in this way we know there is nothing to prevent our knowing with
certainty that Christ dwells in us, namely, when we know that we hold the faith which the
Catholic Church teaches and holds. But if it is taken in regard to the affectivity, then Christ
dwells in us by formed faith; and in this way no one can know that Christ dwells in him, or that
he has charity, unless this certainty be granted to a person by revelation and a special grace. But
there is nothing to prevent us from having a conjecture [coniecturum] that we are in charity,
namely, when a person finds himself so ready and disposed that he would not wish to do anything
against Christ in any way for something temporal: &#8220;Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us,
we have confidence before God&#8221; (1 Jn. 3:21). It is clear, therefore, that the Apostle is speaking
in regard to the first way. Or he is even speaking of knowledge which is by a conjecture, as has
been said. But his argument proceeds as to the second way and in regard to knowledge which is
certain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">528. &#8211; What they might find in the Apostle is mentioned when he says, I hope you will find out
that we have not failed. For since those Corinthians could say, &#8220;We are not reprobates, but we
do not on that account hold to your teachings, because you are not right and should be
repudiated.&#8221; Therefore he says, whatever the case may be with yourselves, I hope that from our
life and doctrine, which we have disclosed to you, you will find out that we have not failed and
have not taught evil or are excluded from the power we say we have: &#8220;A wise man, when you
meet him, is known by his countenance&#8221; (Sir. 19:26, Vulgate); &#8220;You will know them by their
fruits&#8221; (Matt. 7:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">529. &#8211; Then when he says, But we pray God, he excludes the suspicion. For he had threatened
them with a severe judgment when he mentioned his power to judge, and suggested an
examination, trusting that Christ was in them, unless they were reprobate. Nevertheless he leaves
in doubt the question whether Christ be in them. And because they might believe and suspect that
the Apostle would rejoice in their being reprobates, in order to appear greater in comparison to
them and to exercise a more severe judgment, the Apostle removes this suspicion here: first, with
a prayer he directs to God on their behalf; secondly, by the joy he conceived in their regard (v.
9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">530. &#8211; He prays, therefore, that they may be found innocent and not be examined with the
severity of a judgment; therefore he says, But we pray, namely to God, that you may not do
wrong. As if to say: do not suppose that we desire you to be reprobates, but we pray that you may
do no evil. He prays also that he may appear weak, thus excluding any desire on the part of the
Apostle for excellence in comparison to them; hence he says, not that we may appear to have met
the test, i.e., we do not pray that we may be commended as approved in comparison to you, but
rather that you may do what is right [good]: &#8220;And let us not grow weary in well-doing&#8221; (Gal.
6:9); &#8220;Be strong, and let your heart take courage&#8221; (Ps. 27:14), though we may seem to have
failed, by losing the power to punish and judge, because where there is no guilt, we are all equal
and one does not have power over another to judge. Therefore, the Apostle rather wishes that
they be good than be subject to the power of his judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">531. &#8211; That he would lack this power of judging, if they are good, is shown when he says: For
we cannot do anything against the truth. As if to say: we do not labor for anything but the truth,
and for it we stand. But it is obvious that if we were to punish the innocent, we would be standing
against the truth and against justice. Hence, since the Apostle could not do anything against the
truth, but for the truth and for justice, it is clear that he will not punish the innocent.  It should
be noted, according to Augustine in a Gloss [Lombard], that two things are necessary for
avoiding sins, namely, free will and God&#8217;s grace. For if free will were not needed, neither
precepts nor prohibitions nor exhortations would ever be given to men; further, punishments
would be given in vain. But grace, too, is necessary, because unless God ruled all by his grace,
a man could not stand; furthermore, it would be in vain to pray that he not lead us into
temptation. Consequently, the Apostle, indicating that both are necessary, prays God to obtain
grace, and advises that they withdraw from evil with their free will, and do good; hence he says,
we pray, as to the first, that you may not do wrong, as to the second.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">532. &#8211; Then when he says, For we are glad, he removes the false suspicion on account of the joy
conceived over their good. First, he mentions the joy he conceives over their innocence;
secondly, the prayer he utters for their perfection (v. 9b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">533. &#8211; He says therefore: we pray that you may appear approved, but we infirm; and this is clear
from our emotion, because we rejoice that some among you are good and innocent, thus taking
from us the power to judge and making us seem weak; and this is what he says: For we are glad
when we are weak, i.e., not exercising our power, and you are strong, i.e., acting so well and
overcoming vices that you take away our power to judge. For when a person does evil, he
subjects himself to the power of a judge; but by acting well, he casts it away from him: &#8220;Would
you have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his
approval&#8221; (Rom. 13:3); &#8220;We are weak, but you are strong&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:10). Concerning that joy,
it says in Phil. (2:17): &#8220;I am glad and rejoice with you all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">534. &#8211; And not only do we rejoice in these things, but besides this what we pray for is your
improvement. For in natural things we notice that each natural thing tends towards its own
perfection, for which is had a natural desire; hence, to each thing is given the natural power to
enable it to attain to its perfection. But God gives man grace, by which he may attain to his
ultimate and perfect consummation, i.e., happiness, towards which he has a natural desire. Hence,
when a person does not tend toward perfection, it is a sign that he does not have a sufficiency of
God&#8217;s grace. Therefore, the Apostle, in order that they might grow in grace, prays that they be
perfected: &#8220;And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and
all discernment&#8221; (Phil. 1:9); &#8220;That you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done
all, to stand&#8221; (Eph. 6:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">535. &#8211; Then, having given the admonition, he assigns the reason for it, saying, I write this while
I am away from you, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe, i.e., I write these
things to you in my absence to warn you, lest I be forced to do something against my will, which
is that I may do nothing severe against you, except to the extent that I am compelled by you.
Hence he says, that when I come among you I may not have to be more severe against you than
I would wish or than you would wish: &#8220;For you admonished them and tried them as a father&#8221;
(Wis. 11:11, Vulgate); &#8220;I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am
away!&#8212; I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such
confidence as I count on showing against some&#8221; (2 Cor. 10:1).  But because the Corinthians
might say, &#8220;But supposing that we have acted well, would you be able to deal severely against
us?&#8221; Therefore he answers, saying: No, because I neither plan nor am able to act except in my
use of the authority which the Lord has given me. But God gave me this power, namely, of
binding and loosing, for building up and not for tearing down, i.e., that you might be built up and
not that you be destroyed. And if I were to correct you severely, I would not be building up but
destroying: &#8220;Our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you&#8221;
(2 Cor. 10:8). But the Lord gave this power to Paul: &#8220;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the
work to which I have called them&#8221; (Ac. 13:2).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Mend your ways, heed my appeal, agree with one

one another with a holy kiss. 13 All the saints greet you. 14 The grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you
all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">536. &#8211; Having rebuked those deceived by false apostles, the Apostle now comforts those who
have persisted in his faith and doctrine. First, he gives an admonition; secondly, he adds a
greeting (v. 12). In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the salutation; secondly,
the reward of a fulfilled admonition (v. 11d). But he admonishes them on three points: first, what
they should have been in themselves; secondly, in regard to their neighbor (v. 11b); thirdly, how
all should act towards one another (v. 11c).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">537. &#8211; They should have two qualities in themselves. The first is joy in the good they had; hence
he says: finally brethren, who have been constant, farewell [rejoice] in the things you have done
for God&#8217;s service. This is necessary, if you are to be just and virtuous, because no one is just or
virtuous who does not take joy in just and virtuous activities. Therefore it says in Ps. 100 (2,
Vulgate): &#8220;Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve the Lord with gladness&#8221;; &#8220;Rejoice in the Lord
always; again I will say, Rejoice&#8221; (Phil. 4:4). Indeed, a person should always rejoice because joy
keeps a man in good condition, whereas one cannot continue long that which causes sorrow.
Secondly, the good should have in themselves a zeal for perfection; in regard to this he says,
mend your ways [be perfect], i.e., always tend to what is perfect: &#8220;Therefore let us leave the
elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity [perfectionem]&#8221; (Heb. 6:1). What is said here
is not a precept to be perfect, but always tend toward perfection. And this is necessary because
a person who does not aim at progressing is in danger of falling back. For we notice that unless
the rowers strive to go forward, the ship always goes backward. This is what the Lord said: &#8220;You,
therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect&#8221; (Matt. 5:48).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">538. &#8211; To our neighbor we must give exhortations to good; in regard to this he says, heed my
appeal: &#8220;And he gave to every one of them commandment concerning his neighbour&#8221; (Sir. 17:12,
Vulgate); &#8220;He who exhorts, in his exhortation&#8221; (Rom. 12:8); &#8220;And let him who hears say
&#8216;Come&#8217;&#8221; (Rev. 22:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">539. &#8211; There are two things which should be common to all, namely, that they agree: therefore
he says, agree with one another; and that they be at peace: hence he says, live in peace. These two
things are so related that one is external and the other internal. For it is clear that bodies cannot
be preserved and kept orderly unless the members are mutually coordinated. In like manner
neither the Church nor the members of the Church, unless they are in proper order and united one
with another. But there is a double union required for uniting the members of the Church: one
is interior, that is, that they agree by faith in regard to the intellect by believing the same things,
and by love in the will by loving the same things. Hence he says, agree with one another, i.e.,
agree in regard to matters of faith, and love the same things with the affection of charity. For true
wisdom is present when the activity of the intellect is perfected and consummated by the repose
and delight experienced by the affections: &#8220;That together you may with one voice glorify the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (Rom. 15:6); &#8220;That all of you agree&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:10);
&#8220;Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of
one mind&#8221; (Phil. 2:2). The other is exterior, namely, peace: therefore he says, live in peace among
yourselves: &#8220;Strive for peace with all men&#8221; (Heb. 12:14); &#8220;Seek peace, and pursue it&#8221; (Ps. 34:15);
&#8220;Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways&#8221; (2 Th. 3:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">540. &#8211; Then when he says, the God of love and peace will be with you, he mentions the reward
given to those who fulfil these admonitions. As if to say: if you keep peace among you, the God
of love and peace will be with you. In regard to this it should be noted that among the Gentiles
was a custom that certain gifts be used as names for the gods, because although there is but one
God, nevertheless certain special gifts were used for naming the gods from those gifts. Thus,
from the gift of peace they call a god the god of peace, and from the gift of salvation, the god of
salvation. Alluding to this practice, the Apostle says: the God of love and peace will be with you,
not that peace is one god, as they said, but Christ is called the God of peace because he is the
giver of peace and is one who loves: &#8220;My peace I give to you&#8221; (Jn. 14:27); &#8220;For God is not a God
of confusion but of peace&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:53); &#8220;God&#8217;s love has been poured into our hearts through
the Holy Spirit which has been given to us&#8221; (Rom. 5:5). He is also the author of peace: &#8220;In me
you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation&#8221; (Jn. 16:33); &#8220;His abode has been
established in peace&#8221; (Ps. 71:3, Vulgate).  Furthermore, he is not only the God of peace, but also
of love; hence, he says: the God of love and peace will be with you. This is so, because a person
who exists in true peace of heart and body exists in charity, and &#8220;He who abides in love abides
in God, and God abides in him&#8221; (1 Jn. 4:16); and because a person merits only through peace and
love&#8221; &#8220;If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him&#8221; (Jn. 14:23).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">541. &#8211; Then when he says, Greet one another with a holy kiss, he gives the salutation. In regard
to this he does three things. First, he enjoins on them a mutual greeting; secondly, he greets them
on the part of others (v. 12b); thirdly, he greets them on his own part (v. 13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">542. &#8211; He requests that the mutual greeting be made with a kiss; hence he says: Greet one another
with a holy kiss. Here it should be noted that a kiss is a sign of peace. For a man breathes through
the mouth with which a kiss is given. Therefore, when men give one another kisses, it is a sign
that they are uniting their spirit of peace. But there is a false peace, and this is done by those who
&#8220;speak peace with their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts&#8221; (Ps. 28:3), which is
accomplished with the deceit of a kiss: &#8220;Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful
kisses of an enemy&#8221; (Prov. 27:6, Vulgate).  There is also an evil and degrading peace, namely,
when men come together to commit evil: &#8220;Afterward it was not enough for them to err about the
knowledge of God, but they live in great strife due to ignorance, and they call such great evils
peace&#8221; (Wis. 14:22). And this is sealed with a lustful kiss. In Prov. (7:13, Vulgate) it is said of
an evil woman that &#8220;Catching the young man, she kisses him, and with an impudent face, flatters
him.&#8221; There is also a holy peace which God produces: &#8220;And the peace of God, which passes all
understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil. 4:7), and this is
obtained by a holy kiss, because it unites the spirit with holiness. It is of this kiss that he says
here: with a holy kiss. From this there arose the practice whereby believers and holy men kiss one
another as a sign of charity and union</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">543. &#8211; He greets them on the part of the others when he says, all the saints greet you, because all
the saints and faithful hope and desire and procure our salvation with their prayers. Hence, all
of Christ&#8217;s faithful hope and desire salvation for one another: &#8220;Make me a partaker, O God&#8221; (Ps.
119, Aquinas Latin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">544. &#8211; He greets them on his own part, when he says: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Here it should be noted that
there are two modes of appropriating something to the divine persons: one is essentially
[essentialiter] and the other causally [causaliter]. Essentially power [potentia] is appropriated to
the Father because he is power essentially; inasmuch as he is the principle. To the Son, wisdom,
inasmuch as he is the Word. To the Holy Spirit, love, inasmuch as he is goodness.  But here the
Apostle does not appropriate those things in this way, namely, by essence [per essentiam],
because then all things would be appropriated to the Holy Spirit; rather, he appropriates by cause
[per causam]. Therefore, since grace is a gift by which sins are forgiven: &#8220;Justified by his grace
as a gift&#8221; (Rom. 3:24), and the remission of sin is accomplished in us by the Son who took our
flesh and satisfied for our sins: &#8220;Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (Jn. 1:17): for this
reason the Apostle attributes grace to Christ, when he says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
But charity is necessary for us because we must become united to God: &#8220;He who abides in love
abides in God, and God abides in him&#8221; (1 Jn. 4:16). And because this is from God the Father,
inasmuch as he so loved the world as to send his only begotten Son (Jn. 3:16): &#8220;God shows his
love for us&#8221; (Rom. 5:8), he attributes charity to him as to its source, when he says, and the love
of God, namely, the Father.  Finally, the communication of divine gifts is accomplished by the
Holy Spirit: &#8220;All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:11). Therefore he
attributes communication to the Holy Spirit, when he says, and the fellowship [participation] of
the Holy Spirit. Or, he attributes this to him because he is common to the other two persons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">545. &#8211; Thus therefore the Apostle in his greeting wishes them all things that are necessary when
he says: The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy
Spirit be with you all. The grace of Christ, by which we are made just and are saved; the charity
of God the Father, by which we are united to him; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
distributing divine gifts to us. Amen.  </p>
