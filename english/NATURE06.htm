      <p>THE INFINITE</p>
    </center>

    <br />
    <p>
      Infinity comes up for discussion at this point because it is related to
      the continuity of motion: A continuum is infinitely divisible. It also
      affects some basic conditions of motion, such as direction, diversity of
      elements etc. On the other hand, it is not a central discussion in the
      philosophy of nature.

    </p>
    <p><strong>6.3 Distinctions concerning infinitude</strong></p>
    <p>
      Some clarification of the notion of infinitude is needed. The first is to
      distinguish between an infinite continuum and an infinite number of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, as a privitive term it can have various meanings, just as
      "invisible can be said in three ways: 1) what is of its very nature not
      apt to be seen, for example, a sound which is not in the genus of visible
      things; 2) what is difficult to see, as what is seen in the dark or form a
      distance; 3) what is apt to be seen but is not, as something in total
      darkness. Likewise "infinite" (what cannot be crossed) can mean 1) what is
      outside the genus of traversable things, such as a point and a form; 2)
      what can be passed over but its passage is impossible or very difficult
      for us; in this way we say that the depth of the sea is infinite; 3) what
      is passable, but not to its end, such as a line without end or any other
      quantity without limits. This is the proper sense of the word "infinite".
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, we can talk of an actual infinite size or number, or a potential
      infinite: what can always be further divided or added to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we can distinguish between metaphysical infinitude (such as that
      of God and his power etc.), abstract mathematical infinitude, and the
      infinitude of a sensible body. It is only the latter we are concerned with
      in this course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.4 Dialectical arguments against infinitude</strong> (Book 3,
      Lesson 8)
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> It would
      seem that no body can be infinite, because it is limited by a surface,
      which must be finite, since it is expandable.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> It would
      seem that no infinite multitude, since if it can be numbered, whatever
      that number is, is finite.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> Every
      composite sensible body is made up of elements. If one of different kinds
      of elements is infinite, that would so dominate the whole that it would
      counteract any influence of the others, and thus destroy the equilibrium
      of the composite.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> The
      component elements of a body cannot be infinite, because each one of them
      would occupy all space, unless they were to interpenetrate, which is
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> If any
      element were infinite, it would be impossible for the whole universe to be
      anything but that element, both because it would occupy all space and
      because it would overpower other elements, as Heraclitus says that at some
      future time all things will be converted into fire because of the
      excelling power of fire.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> (Lesson
      9) A body of infinite size could either never be in motion or would always
      be in motion, since it would have no orientation of up or down, centre or
      edge, or any direction whatsoever, within or without itself.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> Were
      there to be motion of dissimilar parts (such as water and earth) within
      such a body, then the infinite whole would not be one body simply, but
      only a collection of contiguous bodies.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> There can
      be no infinite body without an infinite number of parts. They could be
      only of one kind, since that would destroy all competition.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> Every
      body is in a place, and place means being in some definite reference point
      to other bodies, up or down, right or left, as determined by gravitation
      to a place of rest. Such directional reference would be impossible in an
      infinite body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.5 The infinite as existing in potency</strong> (Book 3, Lesson
      10)
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing would indicate that there is no body of infinite size. On
      the other hand, some kind of infinitude must exist; otherwise time could
      not go on indefinitely (in an eternal world), and magnitudes would be
      divisible into parts that are not magnitudes because they are indivisible;
      likewise number could not increase indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore infinitude exists as something in potency, in the sense that
      every magnitude is always divisible and every number can be added to. But
      something is found to be in potency in two ways: In one way the whole can
      be reduced to act, as it is possible for this bronze to be a statue. But
      the infinite in potency is not meant ever to be entirely in act; rather it
      will be in act not all at once, but part after part. It is just as we say
      that today is actual, because one instant of this day is presently actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinitude of magnitudes and of numbers both consists in a finite
      actualization of something that can always be further actualized, by
      division or addition. But the two differ in that a magnitude that is
      divided or added to remains permanent and is not corrupted, but the finite
      parts of an infinite time and of successive generation are corrupted,
      while time and generation go on.
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.6 Definition of infinitude</strong> (Book 3, Lesson 11)</p>
    <p>
      The <strong>infinite</strong> is
      <em>that beyond which there is always something</em>. This definition
      excludes a circle, which can be the subject of infinite motion, but the
      same parts are gone over again and again. It also excludes the definition
      of early philosophers, "that outside of which there is nothing", which is
      the definition of a perfect and whole thing. But the infinite, in as much
      as it is in potency, is like matter with respect to the perfection of
      magnitude, and like a whole in potency, not a whole in act. It is
      something imperfect, comparable to matter not having perfection. And,
      since the whole contains but matter is contained, the infinite as such
      does not contain but is contained, since whatever amount of the infinite
      is is in act is always contained by something greater, as it is possible
      to move to something beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this, two other conclusions follow. One is that the infinite, as
      such, is unknown, because it is like matter without definition or form,
      and matter is not known except through form. The other conclusion is that
      the infinite has more the notion of a part than of a whole, since matter
      is compared to the whole as a part. And it is not a surprise that the
      infinite conducts itself as a part, in as much as only a part of it is
      ever actual.
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.7 Explanations</strong> (Book 3, Lesson 12)</p>
    <p>
      Infinity in numbers is opposite to that of magnitudes. For the unit is the
      principle of number, and divisions of numbers cannot go below the unit
      [since fractions and negative numbers are still computed in terms of a
      unit], but addition to number can go on without end. Magnitude, however,
      is always of a finite size, yet its division can go on infinitely
      [quantitatively, but physically there is a limit, just as there a physical
      limit to the size of anything].
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinitude is not found according to the same respect in motion, magnitude
      and time. Rather, the infinitude of time derives from that of motion, of
      which it is a measure, and the infinitude of motion derives from that of
      magnitude, over which motion takes place, as will be explained in Chapter
      7.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinite is a principle resembling matter, but not in so far as matter
      lies under a form, but in as much as matter has privation --for the
      infinite implies the lack of perfection and term. That is why the
      Philosopher adds that the notion of the infinite consists in privation.
      The <em>per se</em> subject of the privation which constitutes the nature
      of the infinite is the sensible continuum. This is clear from the fact
      that the infinite found in numbers is caused from the infinite division of
      magnitude; and similarly, the infinite in time and motion are caused by
      magnitude. Hence the first subject of the infinite is the continuum. And
      since really existing magnitude is not separated from sensible things, it
      follows that the subject of the infinite is sensible.

      <strong
        >6.8 Answer to arguments for the existence of an actual infinite</strong
      >
      (Book 3, Lesson 13)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Aristotle answers five arguments advanced for the existence of
      something actually infinite:
    </p>
    <p>
      1) If the world has always existed (as is logically possible), then there
      must be an infinite series of generations. <b>Reply:</b> Such infinitude
      does not exist in act, but only in potency; each generation exists in act
      only successively.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Every body must be defined by its border with another body, and so on
      to infinity. <b>Reply:</b> It is one thing to be "touched" and another to
      be "terminated. All that is required is that a body be terminated by its
      own surface. It is incidental to the finite that it be touching something
      else. Thus the outermost bodies of the universe need not be in contact
      with something further.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Space can be imagined as infinite. <b>Reply:</b> We cannot transfer
      imagination to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) Time and motion are infinite. <b>Reply:</b> They are not infinite in
      act, but only the present moment is actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      5) Magnitude is infinitely divisible. <b>Reply:</b> That points to a
      potential, not an actual infinite.
