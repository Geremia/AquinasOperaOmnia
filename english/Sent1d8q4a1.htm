            he is good, wise, and such things. Therefore, God has his being by
            which he exists, and on top of this he has something else by which
            he is a determinate thing. He is not, therefore, simple.</font

            of any thing after it was not predicated does not belong to that
            thing's substance, since its own substance comes anew to no thing.
            Therefore, since something is predicated of God after it was not
            predicated - for example, that he is "Lord" and "Creator," which are
            said of him on account of time - it seems that he is not

            the way by which the entirety of something is its own being. God is,

            font=""
            >To the first, therefore, it should be said that something is called
            'being without an addition' in two ways. On the one hand, the
            concept of the thing may be such that nothing may be added to it,
            and in this way it is said about God that he is without an addition.
            This is indeed proper for being that is perfect in itself, on
            account of which it does not receive an addition. Nor can this be
            common being, because every common thing is preserved in a
            particular thing, where an addition is made to it. On the other
            hand, something is called 'being without an addition' in such a way
            that it does not belong to the concept of the thing that an addition
            may be made to it or that an addition may not be made to it. And in
            this way, common being is without an addition. For the condition -
            'without an addition' - is not included in the understanding of
            being. Otherwise, an addition could never be made to it, because
            that would be contrary to the concept of being. For this reason, it
            is common because, in its concept, one does not signify any
            addition, but an addition can be made to it so that it may be
            determined to a particular thing. For example, 'animal' is said in
            common of beings that lack reason, because it does not belong to the
            concept of animal to have reason or not to have reason. An ass,
            however, is called 'a being that lacks reason,' because the negation
            of reason is included in its concept, and by this fact, it is
            determined according to a proper difference. In the same way, the
            divine being is determined in itself and separated from all other
            things by the fact that no addition can be made to it. Hence, it is
            evident that negations said of God do not signify any composition in
            him.</font

            aliquid, tripliciter: aut per additionem alicujus differentiae, quae
            potentialiter in genere erat; aut ex eo quod natura communis
            recipitur in aliquo, et fit hoc aliquid; aut ex eo quod additur
            aliquid accidens, per quod dicitur esse vel sciens vel albus. Nullus
            istorum modorum potest esse in Deo, quia ipse non est commune
            aliquid, cum de intellectu suo sit quod non addatur sibi aliquid;
            nec etiam ejus natura est recepta in aliquo, cum sit actus purus;

            recipere. Unde per suum esse absolutum non tantum est, sed aliquid
            est. Nec differt in eo quo est et aliquid esse, nisi per modum

            autem Boetii intelligitur de participantibus esse, et non de eo qui

            non facit compositionem, sed secundum suum esse, prout in subjecto
            realiter differens est ab ipso; qualiter in Deo non est, ut dictum

            >To the second, it should be said that, in created things, a thing
            is determined in three ways so that it may be a determinate thing:
            either by the addition of some difference that existed potentially
            in the genus; or from the fact that a common nature is received in
            something and is made this determinate thing; or from the fact that
            some accident is added by which it is said to be knowing or white.
            None of these ways can exist in God. For he is not something common,
            since the concept of God is such that something is not added to him.
            Nor again is his nature received in something, since it is pure act.
            Nor does he receive something beyond his essence, because his
            essence contains every perfection. It remains, however, that he is a
            thing determined by the condition of denying from him every
            addition, and consequently, every thing that can be received as an
            addition is removed from him. Hence, by his own independent being,
            he not only exists but is a determinate thing. Nor in him does what
            he is and the determinate thing that exists differ, except by mode
            of signification or by reason, as was said above about the divine
            attributes. Boethius' statement, however, is understood with respect
            to things that participate in being, and not with respect to the one
            who is essentially his own being. For this reason, it is evident
            that attributes produce no composition in him. For wisdom does not
            produce composition according to its concept, but according to its
            being in proportion as, in a subject, it differs in reality from
            being. As was said, it is not this way in God.</font

            >Ad tertium dicendum, quod hujusmodi relationes quae dicuntur de Deo
            ex tempore, non ponunt aliquid in ipso realiter sed tantum in
            creatura. Contingit enim, ut dicit Philosophus, V <i>Metaph</i>.,
            aliquid dici relative, non quod ipsum referatur, sed quia aliquid
            refertur ad ipsum; sicut est in omnibus quorum unum dependet ab
            altero, et non e contrario; sicut scibile non est relativum, nisi
            quia scientia refertur ad ipsum; scibile enim non dependet a
            scientia, sed e converso. Sed quia intellectus noster non potest
            accipere relationem in uno relativorum, quin intelligatur in illo ad
            quod refertur, ideo ponit relationem quamdam circa ipsum scibile, et
            significat ipsum relative. Unde illa relatio quae significatur in
            scibili, non est realiter in ipso, sed secundum rationem tantum; in
            scientia autem realiter. Ita etiam relatio importata per hoc nomen
            Deus, vel Creator, cum de Deo dicatur, non ponit aliquid in Deo nisi
            secundum intellectum, sed tantum in creatura. Ex quo patet quod
            diversitas relationum ipsius Dei ad creaturas non ponit
            compositionem in ipso.</font

            >To the third, it should be said that the kinds of relations that
            are said of God on account of time do not establish something in him
            in reality but only in a creature. For, as the Philosopher says in
            Book 5 of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, it happens that something is
            called "relative," not because something else is referred to it, but
            because it refers to something else, as is the case, for example, in
            all the things of which one depends on another but not the reverse.
            For instance, a knowable thing is relative only because knowledge
            refers to it. For a knowable thing does not depend on knowledge but
            vice versa. But because our intellect cannot understand a relation
            in one of relative things without understanding in that one thing
            the something else to which it refers, it therefore establishes a
            certain relation concerning a thing as knowable and signifies it as
            relative. Hence, the relation that is signified in a knowable thing
            does not exist in it in reality, but only according to the mind; in
            knowledge, however, the relation exists in reality. In the same way,
            a relation expressed by the name "God" or "Creator" when said of God
            does not establish something in God except according to the mind,
            but it establishes something only in a creature. For this reason, it
            is evident that the diversity of relations of God himself to
            creatures does not establish composition in him.</font

            >Ad quartum dicendum, quod, sicut supra dictum est, proprietas
            personalis comparata ad essentiam, non differt re ab ipsa, et ideo
            non facit compositionem cum ea; sed comparata ad suum correlativum,
            facit distinctionem realem; sed ex illa parte non est aliqua unio,
            et ideo nec compositio. Unde relinquitur ibi tres esse res et tamen
            nullam compositionem. Ex hoc patet nomina personalia nullam in Deo
            compositionem significare.</font

            >To the fourth, it should be said, as was said above, that a
            personal property, when compared to the divine essence, does not
            differ from it in reality, and for this reason, it does not produce
            a composition with it. But when a personal property is compared to
            its own correlative property, it produces a real distinction. But in
            that respect, no union exists and, therefore, no composition. Hence,
            it remains that three things exist in the divine essence and
            nonetheless no composition. It is evident, accordingly, that the
            personal names signify no composition in God.</font
