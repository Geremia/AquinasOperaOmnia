    <span style="font-weight: bold">Does it belong to God to have a will?</span>
  </p>

    [Parallel readings: <i>I Sent.</i>, 45, a. 1; <i>C.G.</i>, I, 72 & 73; IV,
    19; <i>S.T.</i>, I, 19, 1; <i>Comp. theol.</i>, I, 32-34.]
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it does not, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. It belongs to everyone who has a will to act according to the choice of
    his will.,But God does not act according to the choice of His will; for, as
    Dionysius says, just as our visible sun enlightens all things, not by
    reasoning or choosing, but by its very being, so too does the divine
    goodness. It therefore does not belong to God to have a will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Necessary effects cannot come from a contingent cause. But the will is a
    contingent cause, since it is open to alternatives. It cannot, then, be the
    cause of necessary things. But God is the cause of all things, necessary as
    well as contingent. He therefore does not act through a will, and so the
    conclusion is the same as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Nothing which implies a reference to a cause belongs to that which has no
    cause. But since God is the first cause of all things, He has no cause. Now
    a will implies a relationship to a final cause, because the will is referred
    to an end, as the Philosopher says. It therefore seems that will does not
    pertain to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. According to the Philosopher, what is voluntary deserves praise or blame;
    what is involuntary deserves pardon and mercy. Voluntariness therefore does
    not belong to anything to which praiseworthiness does not belong. But
    praiseworthiness does not belong to God because, as is said in the
    <i>Ethics,</i> praise is not for the best, but for those things which are
    directed to the best. Honor is for the best. It therefore does not belong to
    God to have a will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Opposites have reference to the same thing. But two species of the
    involuntary are opposed to the voluntary, as is said in the
    <i>Ethics:</i> the involuntary “from violence” and the involuntary “from
    ignorance.” Now nothing involuntary from violence is attributable to God
    because force cannot be applied to Him; nor is anything involuntary from
    ignorance, because He knows everything. Then neither is anything voluntary
    attributable to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. As is said in <i>The Rules of Faith,</i> there are two kinds of will:
    <i>affective,</i> regarding internal acts, and <i>effective,</i> regarding
    external acts. Affective will works for merit, as is said there; effective
    will achieves merit. But it does not belong to God to merit. Then neither
    does it belong to Him in any way to have a will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. God is an unmoved mover because, in the words of Boethius, “while
    remaining immobile He communicates motion to all things.” But a will is a
    moved mover, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>. Hence the Philosopher likewise
    argues from the principle that God is an unmoved mover to show that He moves
    only by being desired and known. It therefore does not belong to God to have
    a will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Will is a sort of appetite, for it is included in the appetitive part of
    the soul. But appetite is an imperfection, since it is directed to what is
    not had, as Augustine points out. Since no imperfection is found in God, it
    therefore seems that it does not belong to Him to have a will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Nothing that has reference to opposites seems to belong to God, since
    things having such reference are subject to generation and corruption. But
    God is far removed from these. Now the will has reference to opposites,
    since it is numbered among the rational powers, and these are open to
    opposite determinations according to the Philosopher.” Will is therefore not
    attributable to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Augustine says that God is not disposed in one way to things when they
    are and in another when they are not. But when they are not, God does not
    want things to be; for, if He willed them to be, they would be. Therefore
    even when they are, God does not will them to be.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. It is compatible with God to perfect but not to be perfected. It belongs
    to the will, however, to be perfected by good, as to the intellect to be
    perfected by truth. Will is therefore not compatible with God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. In one of the Psalms (113:3) it is said that the Lord “hath done all
    things whatsoever he would.” From this it appears that He has a will and
    that created things exist by His will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Happiness is found most perfectly in God. But happiness demands will,
    because according to Augustine a happy person is one “who has whatever he
    wishes and wishes no evil.” Will therefore belongs to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Wherever more perfect conditions for willing are found, will exists in a
    more perfect way. But in God the conditions for willing are found most
    perfectly. In Him there is no separation of the will from its subject,
    because His essence is His will. There is no separation of the will from its
    act, because His action also is His essence. There is no separation of the
    will from the end, its object, because His will is His goodness. Therefore
    will is found most perfectly in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Will is the root of freedom. But freedom belongs especially to God. In
    the words of the Philosopher, “a free person is one who is for his own
    sake,” and this is most true of God. Will is therefore found in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Will is most properly found in God. In support of this it should be noted
    that knowledge and will in a spiritual substance are founded upon its
    different relations to things. There is one relation of a spiritual
    substance to things according as the things are in some sense within the
    spiritual substance itself, not indeed in their own existence, as the
    ancients held, saying that by earth we know earth and by water, water, etc.,
    but in their distinctive intelligible design. “For a stone is not in the
    soul, but its species is” (that is, its intelligible design), as the
    Philosopher taught. Because the intelligible design of a being cannot be
    found by itself without a subject except in an immaterial substance,
    knowledge is not attributed to all things but only to immaterial beings. And
    the degree of knowledge parallels the degree of immateriality so that the
    things which are most immaterial are most capable of knowledge. Because
    their essence is immaterial, it serves them as a medium for knowing. Through
    His essence God knows Himself and all other things. Will, however, and any
    appetite is based upon the relation by which a spiritual substance is
    oriented to things as existing in themselves.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Inasmuch as it is characteristic of any being, whether material or
    immaterial, to have some reference to something else, it accordingly follows
    that it pertains to everything whatever to have an appetite, natural or
    animal or rational (that is, intellectual); but in different beings it is
    found in different ways. Since a thing has its reference to another being
    through something which it has within itself, its different ways of being
    referred to another correspond to the different ways in which it has
    something within itself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Whatever is in material things is in them as bound up and compounded with
    matter. The reference of material beings to other things is accordingly not
    free but dependent upon the necessity of a natural disposition. Material
    beings are therefore not the cause of their own reference as if they
    directed themselves to the end to which they are in fact directed. They
    receive that direction from elsewhere, namely, the source from which they
    get their natural disposition. They are consequently able to have only a
    natural appetite.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In immaterial and knowing substances, on the other hand, there is found
    something in the pure state and not compounded or tied up with matter. This
    is proportioned to the degree of their immateriality. By this very fact,
    too, they are referred to things by a free reference of which they are the
    cause, directing themselves to that to which they are referred. It is
    accordingly their lot to do or seek something voluntarily and of their own
    accord. If the house” in the mind of the builder were a material form having
    a determinate act of being, it would incline him only in accordance with its
    own determinate mode of existence. Hence the builder would not remain free
    to make the house or not, or to make it in this way or in some other. But
    because the form of the house in the mind of the builder is the plan of the
    house taken absolutely, of itself not disposed any more to existence than to
    non-existence or to existence in one particular way rather than in another
    as far as the accidental features of the house go, the builder’s inclination
    in regard to making the house or not remains free.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In the case of a sentient spiritual substance, however, the forms, though
    received without matter, are nevertheless, as a consequence of their being
    received in a bodily organ, not received altogether immaterially and without
    the conditions of matter. Their inclination is for this reason not
    altogether free, though they have a certain imitation or semblance of
    freedom. They incline appetitively to something by themselves inasmuch as
    they desire something as a result of their apprehension; but it does not lie
    within their competence to incline or not to incline to that which they
    desire. But in an intellectual nature, in which something is received
    altogether immaterially, the essence of a free inclination is found
    perfectly verified. And this free inclination is what constitutes the
    essential character of will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Will is accordingly not attributed to material things, though natural
    appetite is. To a sensitive soul there is attributed not will but animal
    appetite. Only to an intellectual substance is will attributed; and the more
    immaterial this substance is, the more the essence of will belongs to it.
    Consequently, since God is at the extreme of immateriality, the essential
    character of will supremely and most properly belongs to Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. By the words cited Dionysius does not mean to exclude will and choice
    from God but to show His universal influence upon things, God does not
    communicate His goodness to things in such a way that He chooses certain
    ones to receive a share in His goodness and excludes others completely from
    a share in it; but He “giveth to all... abundantly,” as is said in the
    Epistle of St. James (1:5). He is, however, said to choose in this respect,
    that in the order of His wisdom he gives more to some than to others.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The will of God is not a contingent cause, inasmuch as what He wills He
    wills immutably. By reason of its very immutability necessary things can be
    caused. This is of particular importance since of itself no created thing is
    necessary but is possible in itself and necessary through something else.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. The will is directed to something in two ways: (1) principally, and(2)
    secondarily. Principally the will is directed to the end, which is the
    reason for willing everything else. Secondarily it is directed to the means,
    which we want for the sake of the end. Now the will does not stand in a
    relationship of an effect to a cause in regard to its secondary object, but
    only in regard to its principal object, the end. It should be noticed,
    however, that the will and its object are sometimes really distinct, and in
    that case the object is related to the will as its real final cause. But if
    the will and its object are only conceptually distinct, the object will then
    not be the final cause of the will except according to our way of expressing
    it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The divine will is accordingly referred to God’s goodness as to an end,
    whereas the two are really identical. They are distinguished only in our
    manner of speaking. There accordingly remains only the conclusion that
    nothing is really the cause of the divine will, but it is a cause only in
    our manner of designating it. Nor is it out of place for something to be
    designated after the manner of a cause in regard to God. It is in this way
    for instance, that deity is spoken of as if it were related to God as His
    formal cause.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The created things which God wills, however, are not related to the divine
    will as ends but as directed to an end. God wills creatures to exist in
    order that His goodness may be manifested in them, and that His goodness,
    which in its essence cannot be multiplied, may be poured out upon many at
    least by a participation through likeness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. If praise is taken strictly, as the Philosopher takes it, it is not due
    to the will in every one of its acts but only in that in which the will
    regards the means to an end. It is clear that an act of the will is found
    not only in virtuous deeds, which are praiseworthy, but also in the act of
    happiness, which is concerned with honorable things; for happiness obviously
    involves pleasure. And yet praise is attributed to God too, since we are
    invited in many places in Holy Scripture to praise God. But in this case
    praise is taken more broadly than the Philosopher takes it.—Or it can be
    said that praise, even in its proper sense, is attri6utable to God in so far
    as by His will He directs creatures to Himself as their end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. [This answer is lacking.]
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. There is in God both affective and effective will, for He wills to will
    and He wills to do what He does. But it is not necessary that, wherever
    there is either one of these types of will, merit be found, but only in an
    imperfect nature which is tending to perfection.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. When the object of the will is distinct from the will itself, the object
    really moves the will. But when it is identical with the will, then it moves
    it only in our way of speaking. And in regard to this way of speaking, in
    the opinion of the Commentator there is verified the saying of Plato that
    the first mover moves itself inasmuch as it understands and wills itself.
    Nor does it follow from the fact that God wills creatures to be that He is
    moved by creatures, because He does not will the creatures except by reason
    of His own goodness, as has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. It is by one and the same nature that a thing both moves toward a term
    which it does not yet possess and reposes in a term which it has already
    come to possess. It is accordingly the function of one and the same power to
    tend to a good when it is not yet had, and to love it and take pleasure in
    it after it is had. Both belong to the appetitive power, though it gets its
    name rather from that act by which it tends to what it does not have. That
    is why <i>appetite</i> is said to belong to what is imperfect. But will is
    equally applicable to both. Hence will in its proper meaning is attributable
    to God, but not appetite.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. It is not compatible with God to have reference to opposites as regards
    the things that are in His essence; but He can have opposite dispositions as
    regards His effects in creatures, which He can produce or not.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Even when God is not producing things, He wants things to be; but He
    does not want them to be at that time. The argument accordingly proceeds
    from a false supposition.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. God cannot really be perfected by anything; yet in our manner of
    expressing it He is sometimes referred to as being perfected by something;
    for example, when I say that God understands something. The intelligible
    object is the perfection of the intellect just as the willed object is the
    perfection of the will. In God, however, the first intelligible object and
    the intellect are identical, and also the first object willed and the will.

        It seems that it cannot, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Order presupposes distinction. But in the divine will there is no
        distinction, since in one simple act it wills everything which it wills.
        Therefore antecedent and consequent, whch imply order, are not found in
        the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that, although there is no distinction in the
        divine will on the part of the one Willing, there is no the part of the
        things willed.—On the contrary, order can be held to be in the will on
        the part of the things willed in only two ways: either in regard to
        different things willed or in regard to one and the same thing willed.
        If this order is taken in regard to different things willed, it follows
        that the will will be said to be antecedent concerning the first
        creatures and consequent concerning those which follow. But this is
        false. If, however, this order is taken in regard to one and the same
        thing willed, this can only be according to different circumstances
        considered in that thing. But this cannot put any distinction or order
        in the will, since the will is referred to the thing as existing in its
        own nature whereas the thing in its own nature is enmeshed in all its
        conditions. In no sense, therefore, should antecedent and consequent be
        affirmed of the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Knowledge and power are referred to creatures in just the same way as
        will. But we do not distinguish God’s knowledge and power into
        antecedent and consequent on the basis of the order of creatures. Then
        neither should His will be so distinguished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whatever is not subject to change or hindrance by another is not
        judged according to that other but only in itself. Now the divine will
        cannot be changed or hindered by anything. It should not, therefore, be
        judged according to anything else but only in itself. But according to
        Damascene “antecedent will” is spoken of in God “as arising from Him;
        consequent will, as arising because of us.” Consequent will should
        therefore not be distinguished in God from antecedent will.

        5. In the affective power there does not seem to be any order except
        that derived from the cognitive, because order pertains to reason. But
        we do not attribute to God ordered cognition, which is reasoning, but
        rather simple cognition, which is understanding. Then neither should we
        affirm the order of antecedent and consequent of His will.

        6. Boethius says that God “beholds all things in a single look of His
        mind.” In like fashion, then, with one simple act of His will He reaches
        out to everything which He wills; and so antecedent and consequent
        should not be affirmed of His will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. God knows things in Himself and in their own nature; and although
        they are in their own nature only after being in the Word, even so the
        distinction of antecedent and consequent is not affirmed of God’s
        knowledge. Then neither should it be affirmed of His will.

        8. The divine will, like the divine existence, is measured by eternity.
        But the duration of the divine existence, because measured by eternity,
        is all simultaneous, having no before and after. Then neither should
        antecedent and consequent be placed in the divine will.

        l. Damascene says that it should be noted that “God wills all to be
        saved by His antecedent will,” and not by His consequent will, as he
        adds just afterwards. The distinction of antecedent and consequent
        therefore applies to the divine will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. There is in God an eternal habitual will inasmuch as He is God, and
        an actual will inasmuch as He is the Creator, willing things actually to
        be. But this latter will is compared to the former as consequent to
        antecedent. Antecedent and consequent are therefore found in the divine
        will.

        The divine will is fittingly distinguished into antecedent and
        consequent. An understanding of this distinction is to be got from thee
        words of Damascene, who introduced it. He says: “Antecedent will is
        God’s acceptance of something on His own account,” whereas consequent
        will is a concession on our account.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For the clarification of this point it should be noted that in any
        action there is something to be considered on the part of the agent and
        something on the part of the recipient. The agent is prior to the
        product and more important. Thus what pertains to the maker is naturally
        prior to what pertains to the thing made. It is evident in the operation
        of nature, for instance, that the production of a perfect animal depends
        upon the formative power, which is found in the semen; but it
        occasionally happens because of the matter receiving it, which is
        sometimes indisposed, that a perfect animal is not produced. This
        happens, for example, in the births of monsters. We accordingly say that
        it is by the primary intention of nature that a perfect animal is
        produced, but that the production of an imperfect animal is by the
        secondary intention of nature, which gives to the matter what it is
        capable of receiving, since it is unable because of the indisposition of
        the matter to give it the form of the perfect state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In God’s operation in regard to creatures similar factors must be taken
        into account. Though in His operation He requires no matter, and created
        things originally without any pre-existing, matter, nevertheless He now
        works in the things which He first created, governing them in accordance
        with the nature which He previously gave them. And although He could
        remove from His creatures every obstacle by which they are made
        incapable of perfection, yet in the order of His wisdom He disposes of
        things conformably to their state, giving to each one in accordance with
        its own capacity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That to which God has destined the creature as far as He is concerned is
        said to be willed by Him in a primary intention or antecedent will. But
        when the creature is held back from this end because of its own failure,
        God nonetheless fulfills in it that amount of goodness of which it is
        capable. This pertains to His secondary intention and is called His
        consequent will. Because, then, God has made all men for happiness, He
        is said to will the salvation of all by His antecedent will. But because
        some work against their own salvation, and the order of His wisdom does
        not admit of their attaining salvation in view of their failure, He
        fulfills in them in another way the demands of His goodness, damning
        them out of justice. As a result, falling short of the first order of
        His will, they thus slip into the second. And although they do not do
        God’s will, His will is still fulfilled in them. But the failure
        constituting sin, by which a person is made deserving of punishment here
        and now or in the future, is not itself willed by God with either an
        antecedent or a consequent will; it is merely permitted by Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should not, however, be concluded from what has just been said that
        God’s intention can be frustrated, because from all eternity God has
        foreseen that the one who is not saved would not be saved. Nor did
        He’ordain that particular one for salvation in the order of
        predestination, which is the order of His absolute will. But as far as
        He was concerned, He gave that creature a nature intended for happiness.

        1. In the divine will neither the order nor the distinction is in the
        act of the will but only in the things willed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The order of the divine will is not based upon the different objects
        of the will but upon the different factors found in one and the same
        object. For example, by His antecedent will God wants a certain man to
        be saved by reason of his human nature, which He made for salvation; but
        by His consequent will He wishes him to be damned because of the sins
        which are found in him. Now although the thing to which the act of the
        will is directed exists with all its conditions, it is not necessary
        that every one of those conditions which are found in the object should
        be the reason which moves the will. Wine, for instance, does not move
        the appetite of the drinker by reason of its power of inebriating but by
        reason of its sweetness, although both factors are found together in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The divine will is the immediate principle of creatures, ordering the
        divine attributes (as we must conceive the matter) in so far as they are
        applied to operation; for no power passes into operation unless it is
        regulated by knowledge and determined by the will to do something. The
        order of things is accordingly referred to God’s will rather than to His
        power or knowledge.—Or the answer may be given that the essence of
        willing consists in a reference of the one willing to things themselves,
        as has been said. But things are said to be known or possible for a
        given agent in so far as they are within its knowledge or its power.
        Things do not have any order as they are in God but as they are in
        themselves. Thus the order of things is not attributed to His knowledge
        or to His power but only to His will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although the divine will is not hindered or changed by anything else,
        yet in the order of wisdom it is directed to a thing in accordance with
        its state. In this way something is attributed to the divine will
        because of us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That difficulty argues from the order of the will on the part of its
        act. But the order of antecedent and consequent is not found in it from
        that point of view.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The same is to be said here.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although a thing has existence in its own nature after it has it in
        God, it is not, however, known by God in its own nature after it is
        known in Him, because by the very fact of knowing His own essence God
        beholds things both as they are in Himself and as they are in their own
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Antecedent and consequent are not affirmed of God’s will for the
        purpose of implying any succession (for that is repugnant to eternity),
        but to denote a diversity in its reference to the things willed.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. What is done in creatures is a sign or indication not only of the
        divine will but also of the divine knowledge and power. But knowledge
        and power are not distinguished into power and knowledge which are God’s
        essence and those which are indications of it. Then neither should God’s
        will be thus distinguished into His embracing will (<i
          >voluntas beneplaciti</i
        >), which is the divine essence, and His indicative will (<i
          >voluntas signi</i
        >) <i>.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. By the fact that God wishes something by His embracing will it is
        shown that the act of the divine will is brought to bear upon it with
        the result that it is pleasing to God. Then that upon which His
        indicative will is brought to bear is either pleasing to God or not. If
        it is pleasing to God, then He wills it with His embracing will; and in
        that case His indicative will should not be distinguished from His
        embracing will. If, however, it is not something pleasing to God, it is
        nevertheless designated as pleasing to Him by His indicative will; and
        consequently the indication of the divine will is false. And so in the
        true doctrine such indications of the divine will should not be
        affirmed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Every will is in the one willing. But whatever is in God is the
        divine essence. Consequently, if indicative will is attributed to God,
        it will be the same as the divine essence. In this way it will not be
        distinguished from His embracing will; for that will is said to be
        embracing which is the very divine essence, as the Master says.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 Whatever God wills is good. But the indication of His will ought to
        correspond to the divine will. There should therefore not be an
        indication of His will concerning evil. Since permission concerns evil,
        and likewise prohibition, it therefore seems that indications of the
        divine will should not be affirmed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Not only are good and better found but also bad and worse. But on the
        basis of good and better two sorts of indicative will are distinguished:
        precept, which concerns good, and counsel, which concerns a better good.
        Then two signs or indications of will should be affirmed in regard to
        bad and worse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. God’s will is more inclined to good than to evil. But the indication
        of will which regards evil, permission, can never be frustrated. Then
        precept and counsel, too, which are referred to good, should not be
        subject to frustration. Yet this is evidently false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Things that stand in a sequence of dependence should not be opposed.
        But God’s embracing will and His operation stand in a sequence of
        dependence; for God does not do anything which He does not will with His
        embracing will, and He wills nothing in creatures with His embracing
        will which He does not do, according to the words of the Psalm (113: 3):
        “[The Lord] hath done all things whatsoever he would.” God’s operation
        should therefore not be listed under His indicative will, which is
        opposed to His embracing will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In matters dealing with God there are two different ways of speaking:
        (1) In proper language. This is found when we attribute to God what
        pertains to Him in His own nature, although it always pertains to Him in
        a way that goes beyond what we conceive in our minds or express in
        speech. For this reason none of our language about God can be proper in
        the full sense. (2) In figurative, transferred, or symbolic language.
        Because God, as He is in Himself, exceeds the grasp of our mind, we must
        speak of Him by means of the things that are found in our world. Thus we
        apply the names of sensible things to God, calling Him light or a lion
        or something of the sort. The truth of such expressions is founded on
        the fact that no creature “is deprived altogether of participation in
        good,” as Dionysius says. In every creature there are to be found
        certain properties representing the divine goodness in some respect.
        Thus the name is transferred to God inasmuch as the thing signified by
        the name is a sign of the divine goodness. Any sign, then, that is used
        instead of what is signified in speaking of God is a figurative
        expression.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Both of these two ways of speaking are used in regard to the divine
        will. There is found in God in a proper sense the formal character of
        will, as was said above; and so will is properly predicated of God. This
        is His <i>embracing will</i> (<i>voluntas beneplaciti</i>), which is
        distinguished into antecedent and consequent, as has been said. Because,
        however, will in us has some passion of the soul consequent upon it, the
        name of the will is predicated of God metaphorically like the names of
        the other passions. The name of anger is applied to God because there is
        found in Him an effect which is commonly that of an angry person among
        us, namely, punishment. As a consequence the punishment itself which Gdd
        inflicts is called God’s anger. In like manner whatever is commonly a
        sign or indication of will among us is called the will of God. For this
        reason we speak of His <i>indicative will</i> (<i>voluntas signi</i>)
        because the sign itself which is usually the sign or indication of the
        will is called will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now since the will can be considered both as prescribing a course of
        action and as setting the work in motion, in either sense certain signs
        are attributed to the will. From the viewpoint of its proposing a course
        of action regarding flight from evil, its sign is a
        <i>prohibition.</i> Regarding the pursuit of good there are two signs of
        the will. If the good is necessary and the will cannot attain its end
        without it, the sign of the will is a <i>command.</i> If the good is
        useful and by it the end can be acquired in an easier and more suitable
        fashion, the sign of the will is a <i>counsel.</i> From the viewpoint of
        setting the work in motion two signs are attributed to the will. One is
        express, and this is an <i>operation;</i> for the fact that a person
        does something indicates that he expressly wills it. The other is an
        interpretative sign, <i>permission;</i> for anyone, who does not forbid
        what he can prevent, when interpreted seems to consent to it. This is
        what the name permission implies.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although God is capable of doing all things and knows all things, yet
        He does not will all things. Consequently, besides the signs found in
        creatures, by which it is shown that He is knowing, powerful, and
        willing, certain signs are ascribed to His will to show what God wills
        and not only the fact that He is willing.—Or it may be said that
        knowledge and power are not accompanied by a passion, as the will is in
        our case. Thus the will comes closer to the things which are said
        metaphorically of God than do either power or knowledge. And so the
        signs of will we call will, metaphorically speaking, more than we call
        the signs of knowledge and power knowledge and power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although God does not will everything that He commands or permits,
        yet He does will something concerning it. He wills that we be obliged to
        what He commands and that there be in our power what He permits. It is
        this divine will which the command or permission signifies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or the answer can be given that His indicative will is not so called
        because it incans that God wills the matter itself, but because what is
        ordinarily the indication of a will in our case is called will. It is
        not necessary that what is usually the sign of a certain thing be false
        when its usual term of reference does not correspond to it, but only
        when it is used in that signification. Although among us to command
        something is the sign of our willing it, yet is not necessary, whenever
        either God or man commands something, for him to signify that he wishes
        it to be. It consequently does not follow that it is a false sign.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That is why there is not always a falsehood in our actions whenever an
        action which usually signifies something is performed and that
        signification is not there. But in our words, if what they signify does
        not underlie them, there is necessarily falsity, because words have been
        instituted for the very purpose of being signs. Hence, if what is
        signified does not correspond to them, there is falsity there. Actions,
        on the other hand, have not been instituted to serve as signs but to get
        something done. That they signify anything is quite accidental to them.
        There is consequently not always falsity in them if what is usually
        signified does not correspond. There can be falsity only when they are
        made use of by the agent in order to signify something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Indicative will is not in God but is from God; for it is an effect of
        God such as we usually term, when the effect of a man, that man’s will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although the will of God does not concern evil with a view to its
        being done, it nevertheless does concern evil with a view to preventing
        it by forbidding it, or with a view to putting it within our power by
        permitting it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since everything to which the will tends has a relation to the end
        which is the reason for willing, but all evils lack a relation to that
        end, all evils are on the same footing not only in regard to the end but
        also in regard to the divine will. But to goods, which are referred to
        the end, the will stands in different relations according to the
        different relation which they have to the end. For this reason there are
        different indications for the good and the better, but not for the bad
        and the worse.

        6. God’s indicative will is not opposed to His embracing will on the
        basis of fulfillment and non-fulfillment. Although His embracing will is
        always fulfilled, something which is fulfilled can also belong to His
        indicative will. Hence, even the matters which God commands or counsels
        He sometimes wills with an embracing will. But His indicative will is
        distinguished from His embracing will because the one is God Himself,
        the other is an effect of His, as has already been explained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should, be noted that God’s indicative will is related to His
        embracing will in three ways: (1) there is an indicative will which
        never coincides with an embracing will, as the permission by which God
        permits evil to be done, since He never wills evil to be done; (2) there
        is another which always coincides, as an operation; (3) there is another
        which sometimes coincides, sometimes not, as a precept, a prohibition,
        or a counsel.

        1. Everything that is eternal is necessary. But from eternity God wills
        whatever He wills. Therefore of necessity He wills whatever He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that God’s willing is necessary and eternal on
        the part of the One willing both from the viewpoint of the act of will,
        which is the divine essence, and from that of the reason for willing,
        which is the divine goodness; but not under the aspect of the relation
        of the will to the thing willed.—On the contrary, the very fact of God’s
        willing anything implies a relationship of the will to the thing willed.
        But the fact of God’s willing something is eternal. Then the
        relationship of the will to the thing willed is itself eternal and
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The answer was given that the relationship to the thing willed is
        eternal and necessary inasmuch as the thing willed exists in its
        exemplary idea, not inasmuch as it exists in itself or in its own
        nature.—On the contrary, a thing is willed by the fact of having the
        will of God referred to it. Consequently, if the will of God were not
        referred from all eternity to the thing willed as it exists in itself
        but merely as it exists in its exemplary idea, then a temporal fact,
        such as the salvation of Peter, would not be willed by God from all
        eternity as it exists in its own nature; but it would merely be the
        object of God’s will from all eternity as it exists in God’s eternal
        ideas. But this is obviously false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whatever God has willed or wills, after He wills or has willed it, He
        is unable not to will or not to have willed it. But whatever God wills
        He never has not willed, because He always and from all eternity has
        willed whatever He wills. God is therefore unable not to will whatever
        He wills. Whatever He wills He therefore wills from necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The answer was given that the above argument is based upon God’s
        willino, taken from the viewpoint of the One willing or of the act or of
        the reason for willing, not from that of its relationship to the thing
        willed.—On the contrary, to create is an act which always implies a
        relation to its effect, for it connotes a temporal effect. But the above
        reasoning would be verified concerning creation if it were supposed that
        God had always been creating, because what He has created He is unable
        not to have created. It therefore follows with necessity also from the
        viewpoint of the relation to the thing willed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. To be and to will are one and the same for God. But God must
        necessarily be everything that He is, because “in everlasting beings
        there is no difference between being and being able to be” in the words
        of the Philosopher. God must therefore also necessarily will everything
        that He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The answer was given that, although to will and to be are in this
        case really identical, they nevertheless differ in the manner in which
        they are expressed, because to will is expressed after the manner of an
        act that passes, over into something else.—On the contrary, even God’s
        act of being, though really identical with His essence, nevertheless
        differs in the manner of its expression, because to be is expressed
        after the manner of an act. There is therefore no difference in this
        respect between being and willing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Eternity does not admit of succession. But divine willing is measured
        by eternity. Hence there cannot be any succession in it. But there would
        be succession in it if God did not will what He has willed from
        eternity, or if He willed what He has not willed. It is consequently
        impossible for Him to will what He has not willed or not to will what He
        has willed. Hence whatever He wills He wills from necessity, and
        whatever He does not will He necessarily does not will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. It is impossible for anyone who has willed anything not to have
        willed it, because what has been done is unable not to have been done.
        But in God to will and to have willed are identical because the act of
        His will is not new but is eternal. God is therefore unable not to will
        what He wills; and so He necessarily wills what He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The answer was given that He necessarily wills from the point of
        view of His reason for willing, but not from that of the thing
        willed.—On the contrary, God’s reason for willing is Himself, because He
        wills for Himself whatever He wills. Then, if He necessarily wills
        Himself, He will also necessarily will all other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The reason for willing is the end. But according to the Philosopher2
        in matters of appetite and operation the end occupies the same place as
        the principle in matters of demonstration. Now in matters of
        demonstration, if the principles are necessary, a necessary conclusion
        follows. Hence also in matters of appetite, if a person wills the end,
        he necessarily wills the means to the end; and so, if the divine act of
        willing is necessary from the standpoint of the reason for willing, it
        will also be necessary with reference to the things willed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Whoever can will and not will something can begin to will it. But
        God cannot begin to will something. Hence He cannot will and not will
        something; and so He necessarily wills whatever He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. God’s power and knowledge, like His will, imply a relation to
        creatures. But it is necessary for God to be able to do anything that He
        is able to do, and it is necessary for Him to know whatever He knows. It
        is therefore necessary for Him to will whatever He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Whatever is always the same is necessary. But the relation of the
        divine will to the things willed is always the same. It is therefore
        necessary; and so the divine act of willing is also necessary from the
        standpoint of its relationship to the substance of the thing willed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. If God wills that there shall be an Antichrist, it follows with
        necessity that there will be an Antichrist even though it is not
        necessary that there should be an Antichrist. Now this would not be the
        case if there were not a necessary relation or reference of the divine
        will to the thing willed. The divine act of willing inasmuch as it
        implies a relation of the will to the thing willed is therefore itself
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. The relation of the divine will to the reason for willing is the
        cause of the relation of the divine will to the thing willed, for the
        will is directed to some object because of the reason for willing.
        Between the two relations, moreover, there does not fall any contingent
        intermediary. When a necessary cause is placed, a necessary effect
        follows unless there happens to be a contingent cause between them.
        Consequently, since the divine act of will is necessary in its relation
        to the reason for willing, it will also be necessary in its relation to
        the thing willed; and so God wills necessarily whatever He wills.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. God’s will is more fully free than our will. But our will does not
        necessarily will whatever it wills. Then neither does God’s.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Necessity is opposed to gratuitous willing. But God wills the
        salvation of men with a gratuitous will. He therefore does not will from
        necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Since nothing extrinsic to God can impose necessity upon Him, if He
        willed anything from necessity, He would will it only from the necessity
        of His own nature. The same consequence would therefore follow from
        positing that God acts by His will and from positing that He acts by the
        necessity of nature. Now since it follows for those who hold that God
        acts by the necessity of nature that all things have been made by Him
        from all eternity, the same conclusion would follow for us, who hold
        that He makes all things by His will.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is undoubtedly true that the divine act of willing has necessity from
        the point of view of the One willing and of the act; for God’s action is
        His essence, which is clearly eternal. That is accordingly not the
        question, but rather whether God’s willing has any necessity with
        respect to the thing willed. It is this respect which is understood when
        we say that God wills this or that. And this is what we ask about when
        we ask whether God wills anything from necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should theref4we be noted that the object of any will is twofold: one
        which. is principal and another which is, in a sense, secondary. The
        principal object is that to which the will is directed of its own
        nature, since the will is a nature and has a natural ordination to
        something. This is what the will naturally wills, as the human will
        naturally desires happiness. In regard to this object the will is under
        necessity, since it tends to it in the manner of a nature. A man, for
        instance, cannot will to be miserable or not to be happy. Secondary
        objects of the will are the things which are directed to this principal
        object as to an end. Now upon these two different sorts of objects the
        will has a different bearing, just as the intellect has upon the
        principles which are naturally known and the conclusions which it draws
        out of these.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine will has as its principal object that which it naturally
        wills and which is a sort of end of its willing, God’s own goodness, on
        account of which He wills whatever else He wills distinct from Himself.
        For He makes things on account of His own goodness, as Augustine
        says;3that is to say, He does it in order that His goodness, which
        cannot be multiplied in its essence, may at least by a certain
        participation through likeness be poured out upon many recipients. Hence
        the things which He wills concerning creatures are, as it were, the
        secondary objects of His will. He wills them on account of His goodness.
        Thus the divine goodness serves His will as the reason for willing all
        things, just as His essence is the reason for His knowing all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to that principal object, God’s goodness, the divine will is
        under a necessity, not of force but of natural ordination, which is not
        incompatible with freedom, according to Augustine. God cannot will
        Himself not to be good, nor, consequently, not to be intelligent or
        powerful or anything else which the nature of His goodness includes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is not, however, under any necessity in regard to any other object.
        Since the reason for willing the means is the end, the means stands to
        the will in the same relation as it stands to the end. Hence if the
        means is proportioned to the end so that it embraces the end perfectly
        and without it the end cannot be obtained, the means, like the end, is
        desired of necessity, and especially by a will which cannot depart from
        the rule of wisdom. It seems to be all of a piece, for instance, to
        desire the continuance of life and the taking of food by which life is
        sustained and without which it cannot be preserved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But just as no effect of God is equal to the power of the cause, so
        nothing which is directed to God as its end is equal to the end. No
        creature is made perfectly like God. That is the exclusive property of
        the uncreated Word. From this it comes about that, no matter how much
        more nobly any pure creature is related to God, being assimilated to Him
        in some way, it is still possible for some other creature to be related
        to God and to represent the divine goodness in a manner equally noble.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is accordingly clear that from the love which God has for His own
        goodness there is no necessity in the divine will for willing this or
        that concerning a creature. Nor is there any necessity in it as regards
        the whole of creation, since the divine goodness is perfect in itself,
        and would be so even though no creature existed, because God has no need
        of our goods, as is said in the Psalm (15:2).rl For the divine goodness
        is not an end of the kind which is produced by the means to the end, but
        rather one by which the things which are directed to it are produced and
        perfected. For this reason Avicenna says that only God’s action is
        purely liberal, because nothing accrues to Him from what He wills or
        does regarding any creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is therefore clear from what has been said that whatever God wills to
        be in His own regard He wills from necessity, but whatever He wills to
        be concerning creatures He does not will from necessity.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Something is said to be necessary in two ways: (1) absolutely, and
        (2) conditionally. Something is said to be necessary absolutely because
        of a necessary relation which the terms used in a proposition have to
        each other; e.g., “Man is an animal” or “Every whole is greater than its
        part” and the like. But something is necessary conditionally which is
        not necessary of itself but only if something else is given; e.g.,
        “Socrates has run.” In himself Socrates is no more disposed to this than
        to its opposite; but on the condition that he has run it is impossible
        for him not to have run.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I say, therefore, that God’s willing something in creatures, as that
        Peter be saved, is not necessary absolutely, since the divine will does
        not have a necessary relation to this, as is evident from what has been
        said. But on the condition that God wills or has willed it, then it is
        impossible for Him not to have willed or not to will it, since His will
        is unchangeable. Among the theologians such necessity is accordingly
        called the necessity of unchangeability. Now the fact that God’s act of
        willing is not absolutely necessary comes from the thing willed, which
        falls short of a perfect proportion to the end, as has been said. In
        this respect the answer given above7.is verified. And eternity is to be
        distinguished4n the same way as necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The relationship implied is necessary and eternal conditionally, not
        absolutely; and this is from the standpoint of its termination in the
        object, not only as it has its exemplar in the reason for willing but
        also as in its own nature it exists in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. This we concede.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. After God wills or has willed something, that He wills or has willed
        it is necessary conditionally, not absolutely; as it is that Socrates
        has run, after he has run. This is the case with creation or any act of
        the divine will which terminates in something external.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We concede this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although the divine existence is necessary in itself, yet creatures
        do not proceed from God through necessity but through a free act of
        will. Whatever implies a reference of God to the origin of creatures, as
        to will, to create, etc., is not necessary absolutely, like the
        predicates which refer to God in Himself, such as to be good, living,
        wise, etc.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. <i>To be</i> does not express the kind of act which is an operation
        passing over into something external to be produced in time, but rather
        the act that is primary. <i>To will</i>, however, expresses a secondary
        act, which is an operation. Thus it is from the different manner of
        expression that something is attributed to the divine act of being which
        is not attributed to the divine act of willing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. We do not imply succession if we say that God can will or not will
        something unless this is understood in the sense that, on the condition
        that He wills something, it is asserted that He afterward does not will
        it. But this is excluded by our affirmation that God’s willing something
        is necessary conditionally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. God’s having willed what He has willed is necessary conditionally,
        not absolutely. The same is true of God’s willing what He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Although God necessarily wills that He be, it nevertheless does not
        follow that He wills other things necessarily. Nothing is said to be
        necessary by reason of the end except when it is such that without it
        the end cannot be had, as is evident in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. But that
        is not the case in the point at issue.

        11. If the principle is necessary in syllogisms, it does not follow that
        the conclusion is necessary unless the relationship of the principle to
        the conclusion is also necessary. In the same way, no matter how
        necessary the end is, unless the means has a necessary relationship to
        the end so that without it the end cannot exist, there will be no
        necessity arising from the end in the means; just as, even though the
        principles may be true, if the conclusion is false because of the lack
        of a necessary relationship, no necessity on the part of the conclusion
        follows from the necessity of the principles.

        12. If anyone who can will and not will can will after he has been
        unwilling and can be unwilling after he has willed, he can begin to
        will. If he wills, he can cease to will and again begin to will. If he
        does not will, he can immediately begin to will. God cannot will and not
        will in this way because of the unchangeableness of the divine will. But
        He can will and not will inasmuch as His will is not bound on its part
        to will or not to will. It remains, then, that God’s willing something
        is necessary conditionally, not absolutely.

        13. Although knowledge and power imply a relation to creatures, they
        nevertheless pertain to the very perfection of the divine essence, in
        which there can be nothing except what is necessary of itself. A diing
        is said to have knowledge because the thing known is in the knower.
        Soincthing is said to have power to do something inasmuch as it is in
        complete act with respect to that which is to be done. Whatever is in
        God, however, must necessarily be in Him; and whatever God actually is,
        He must necessarily be actually. But when it is said that God wills
        something, that something is not designated as being in God, but there
        is merely implied the relationship of God Himself to the production of
        that thing in its own nature. From this point of view the condition of
        absolute necessity is accordingly lacking, as was said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. That relationship is always the same because of the immutability of
        the divine will. The argument is accordingly conclusive only in regard
        to the necessary which is conditional.

        15. The will has a twofold relation to its object: (1) inasmuch as the
        latter is the object, and (2) inasmuch as it is to be brought into act
        by the will. The second relation presupposes the first. We first
        understand that the will wills something. Then, from the fact that it
        wills it, we understand that it is bringing it forth into reality, if
        the will is efficacious. The first relation of the divine will to its
        object is not necessary in an absolute sense because of the lack of
        proportion of the object to the end, which is the reason for willing, as
        has been said. Hence it is not necessary absolutely that God will it.
        But the second relation is necessary because of the efficacy of the
        divine will; and for this reason it follows of necessity that if God
        wills anything with His embracing will, it comes about.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Although between the two relations mentioned in the difficulty there
        intervenes no contingent cause, yet because of the lack of proportion
        the necessity of the first relation does not introduce necessity into
        the second, as is clear from what has been said.

        1. When a sufficient cause is placed, it is necessary that the effect be
        placed. Avicenna proves this’ as follows. If, when the cause is placed,
        the effect is not necessarily placed, then even after the placing of the
        cause the effect remains open to the alternatives of either existence or
        non-existence. But whatever has the potentiality of alternatives is not
        determined to either one of them unless there is something to determine
        it. Consequently, after the placing of the cause it is still necessary
        to posit something which will make the effect exist. The cause was
        accordingly not sufficient. But if the cause is sufficient, when it is
        placed, the placing of the effect must be necessary. Now the divine will
        is a sufficient cause, and not a contingent but a necessary cause. The
        things willed by God are therefore necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that from a necessary cause there sometimes
        follows a contingent effect because of the contingency of an intervening
        cause; e.g., from a major premise expressing what is necessary a
        contingent conclusion follows because of a subsumption expressing what
        is contingent.—On the contrary, whenever a contingent effect follows
        from a necessary cause because of the contingency of an intermediate
        cause, this comes from the deficiency of the second cause. The
        blossoming of a tree, for example, is contingent and not necessary
        because of the possible failure of the germinative power, which is the
        intermediate cause, although the motion of the sun, the first cause, is
        a necessary cause. But the divine will can remove all deficiency from
        the second cause, and likewise every hindrance. The contingency of a
        second cause, therefore, does not keep the effect from being necessary
        because of the necessity of the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. When the effect is contingent because of the contingency of the
        second cause, given a necessary first cause, the non-existence of the
        effect is compatible with the existence of the first cause. Thus the
        non-blossoming of a tree in spring is compatible with the motion of the
        sun. But the non-existence of what is willed by God is not compatible
        with the divine will. For these two things, God’s willing something to
        be and its not being, are irreconcilable. Consequently the contingency
        of second causes does not prevent the things willed by God from being
        necessary because of the necessity of the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The answer was given that, although the non-existence of a divine
        effect is not compatible with the divine will, even so, because the
        second cause can fail, the effect itself is contingent.—On the contrary,
        the effect does not fail to occur except by the failure of the second
        cause. But it is impossible that the second cause should fail, given the
        divine will; for in that case there would simultaneously be verified the
        existence of the divine will and the non-existence of what is willed by
        God. But this is manifestly false. Hence the contingency of second
        causes does not prevent the effect of the divine will from being
        necessary.

        All goods come about because God wills them. Now if the divine will
        imposes necessity upon things, all the goods that there are in the world

        contingent causes will be eliminated.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine will does not impose necessity upon all things. The reason
        for this is ascribed by some tothe fact that, since this will is the
        first cause of all things, it produces certain effects through the
        mediation of secondary causes which are contingent and can fail. Thus
        the effcct follows the, contingency of the proximate cause, not the
        necessity of the first cause. But this seems to be in agreement with
        those who held that all things proceed from God with natural necessity,
        just as they held that from the simple One there proceeds immediately a
        single being having some multiplicity, and through its mediation the
        whole multitude of things proceeds. In like fashion they say that from a
        single wholly immobile principle there proceeds something which is
        immobile in its substance but mobile and undetermined as to position,
        and through the mediation of this being generation and corruption occur
        in the things here below. In this line of argument it could not be held
        that multiplicity and corruptible and contingent things are caused
        immediately by God. But that position is contrary to the doctrine of the
        faith, which holds that a multitude even of corruptible things was
        immediately created by God; for example, the first individuals of trees
        and brute animals.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is accordingly necessary to assign a different principal reason for
        the contingency in things, to which the previously assigned cause will
        be subordinated. For the patient must be assimilated to the agent; and,
        if the agent is most powerful, the likeness of the effect to the agent
        cause will be perfect; but if the agent is weak, the likeness will be
        imperfect. Thus because of the strength of the formative power in the
        semen a son is made like his father not only in the nature of the
        species but also in many accidents. On the other hand, because of the
        weakness of the power mentioned the aforesaid assimilation is done away
        with, as is said in <i>Animals</i>. Now the divine will is a most
        powerful agent. Hence its effect must be made like it in all respects,
        so that there not only comes about what God wants to come about (a sort
        of likening in species), but it comes about in the manner in which God
        wants it to come about—necessarily or contingently, quickly or slowly
        (and this is a sort of likening in its accidents).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine will determines this manner for things beforehand in the
        order of God’s wisdom. According as it arranges for certain things to
        come into being in this way or in that, it adapts their causes to the
        manner fixed upon. It could, however, introduce this manner into things
        even without the mediation of those causes. We accordingly say that some
        of the divine effects are contingent not merely because of the
        contingency of secondary causes but rather because of the appointment of
        the divine will, which saw to such an order for things.

        1. That argument is applicable in the case of causes acting from the
        necessity of nature and in regard to their immediate effects; but it is
        beside the point in the case of voluntary causes, because a thing
        follows from the will in the way in which the will disposes and not in
        the way in which the will has existence, as occurs among natural causes.
        In the latter we look to an assimilation as regards the condition of the
        cause and the thing caused, which is the same in both, whereas in
        voluntary causes we look to an assimilation as regards the fulfillment
        of the will of the agent in the effect, as has been said. And even in
        regard to natural causes the argument does not apply in the case of
        their mediate effects.

        2. Even though God can remove every hindrance from a secondary cause
        when He so wills, yet He does not always will to remove it. Thus there
        remains contingency in the secondary cause and, consequently, in the
        effect.

        should be lacking is given simultaneously with the divine will. God’s
        willing someone to be saved and the possibility that that person be

        3 Political justice, which is found in human affairs, has its model in
        natural justice, which consists in the fulfillment of its own nature by
        anything whatever. But each thing participates in the order of its
        nature because of the divine will; for Hilary says: “The will of God has
        conferred upon all creatures their essence.” All justice therefore

        our will can be correct or not. In God it is distinct at least
        conceptually or according to our manner of understanding it. Therefore

        Since justice is a certain “correctness,” as Anselm says or “equation,”
        as the Philosopher teaches, the essential character of justice must
        depend first of all upon that in which there is first found the
        character of a rule according to which the equality and correctness of
        justice is established in things. Now the will does not have the
        character of the first rule; it is rather a rule which has a rule, for
        it is directed by reason and the intellect. This is true not only in us
        but also in God, although in us the will is really distinct from the
        intellect. For this reason the will and its correctness are not the same
        thing. In God, however, the will is really identical with the intellect,
        and for this reason the correctness of His will is really the same as
        His will itself. Consequently the first thing upon which the essential
        character of all justice depends is the wisdom of the divine intellect,
        which constitutes things in their due proportion both to one another and
        to their cause. In this proportion the essential character of created
        justice consists. But to say that justice depends simply upon the will
        is to say that the divine will does not proceed according to the order
        of wisdom, and that is blasphemous.

        Now, since it is no way due that creatures be brought into being, but
        purely voluntary, the first operation does not have the note of justice,
        but it depends simply upon the divine will. It might, however,
        conceivably be said to have the note of justice because of the
        ordination of the thing made to the will. For it is of obligation from
        the very fact that God wills it that everything which God wills be done.
        But in the fulfillment of this ordination it is wisdom which does the
        directing as the first rule. In the second sort of operation, however,
        there is found the character of something due, not on the part of the
        agent, since God is indebted to no one, but rather on the part of the
        recipient. It is due to every natural being that it have the things
        which its nature calls for both in essentials and in accidentals. But
        what is due depends upon the divine wisdom inasmuch as the natural being
        should be such as to imitate the idea of it which is in the divine mind.
        In this way the divine wisdom is found to be the first rule of justice.
        In all the divine operations, however, by which God bestows upon the
        creature anything beyond the debt of nature, as in the gifts of grace,
        the same sort of justice is found as is assigned in the first sort of
        operation, by which God establishes natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to our manner of understanding, the divine will presupposes
        wisdom, “Which first has the character of a rule.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since. intellect and will do not really differ in God, by the fact of
        being directed and determined to something definite the will is not
        restricted by anything other than itself; but it is moved according to
        its own nature, since it is natural for that will always to act
        according to the order of wisdom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. On the part of the One willing there cannot be any cause of the
        divine will other than the will itself as its reason for willing. For in
        God will, wisdom, and goodness are really identical. But on the part of
        the thing willed the divine will has a principle, which is that of the
        thing willed, not that of the One willing, according to which the thing
        willed is ordained to something else either by desert or by fitness.
        This ordination belongs tio the divine wisdom. Hence this is the first
        root of justice.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It seems that we are not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No one is held to the impossible. But it is impossible for us to
        conform our will to the divine will, since the divine will is unknown to
        us. Therefore we are not held to the conformity mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Whoever does not do that to which he is obliged sins. If, then, we
        are obliged to conform our will to the divine will, we sin in not
        conforming it. But whoever sins mortally does not conform his will to
        the divine in the matter in which he sins. By that very fact, therefore,
        he sins. He sins, however, by some other specific sin, such as stealing
        or fornicating. Hence whoever sins commits two sins. But this seems to
        be absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The answer was given that the commandment about the conformity. of
        our will to the divine, being affirmative, does not bind to constant
        compliance though it constantly binds. Thus it is not necessary that
        whenever conformity is lacking there is sin.—On the contrary, although a
        person not observing an affirmative commandment does not sin at every
        moment in which he is not observing it, yet he does sin whenever he acts
        contrary to it. Thus a person sins whenever he dishonors his parents,
        although he does not always sin when he is not actually honoring them.
        But he who sins mortally acts contrary to the conformity in question. It
        is therefore by this fact that he sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whoever does not observe that to which he is obliged is a
        transgressor. But one who sins venially does not conform his will to the
        divine will. If he is obliged to conform to it, he will be a
        transgressor and so will sin mortally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The answer was given that he is not obliged at that moment in which
        he is sinning venially, because affirmative commandments do not oblige
        us to comply always.—On the contrary, whoever does not comply with an
        affirmative commandment at the place and time at which it binds, is
        adjudged a transgressor. But it seems that no other time for conforming
        our will to the divine will can be determined upon than that at which
        the will passes into act. Hence, whenever the will passes into act,
        unless it is conformed to the divine will, there seems to be a sin; and
        so when a person sins venially, the sin seems to be mortal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. No one is held to the impossible. But the obstinate cannot conform
        their will to the divine. They are therefore not held to this
        conformity. And so neither are others; otherwise the obstinate would
        draw an advantage from their obstinacy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Since God wills from charity whatever He wills, being charity
        Himself, if we are obliged to conform our will to God’s, we are obliged
        to have charity. But a person who does not have charity cannot obtain it
        unless he carefully prepares himself for it. One not having charity is
        therefore obliged to prepare himself continuously to have it. Thus at
        every instant at which he does not have charity he sins, since his not
        having it comes from a lack of preparation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Since the form of an act consists especially in the manner of acting,
        if we are held to conformity with the divine will, we must will a thing
        in the same manner in which God wills it. Now a person can imitate the
        manner of the divine will after a fashion both by natural love and by
        gratuitous love. The conformity of which we speak, however, cannot be
        taken with reference to natural love, because even infidels and sinners
        conform their will to God’s in this manner as long as the natural love
        of good is alive within them. Similarly it cannot be taken with
        reference to gratuitous love, that is, charity. In that case we should
        be obliged to will from charity whatever we will. But this is contrary
        to the opinion of many, who say that the manner does not fall within the
        scope of the commandment. It therefore seems that we are not obhged to
        conform our will to the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Commenting on the words of the Psalm (32:1): “Praise becometh the
        upright,” the Gloss says: “The distance between God’s will and man’s is
        just as great as that between God and man.” But God is so distant from
        man that man cannot be conformed to Him. Since man is infinitely distant
        from God, there cannot be any proportion between him and God. Then
        neither can man’s will be conformed to God’s.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Those things are said to be conformed which agree in some one form.
        Consequently, if our will can be conformed to the divine, there must be
        some one form in which the two wills agree. Then there would be
        something simpler than the divine will. But that is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Conformity is a reciprocal relation. In such relations each one of
        the extremes is referred to the other by the same relation. Thus a
        friend is said to be a friend to his friend, and a brother, a brother to
        his brother. If, then, our will can conform to the divine will, and as a
        result we are held to the conformity in question, the divine will can
        conform to ours. But that seems unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Things that we are able to do or not do fall within the scope of
        commandments, and we are held to them. But we cannot help but conform
        our will to God’s, because, as Anselm says, whoever departs from God’s
        will in some particular fulfills the divine will in another, just as the
        more distant something that is within a spherical body gets from one
        part of the circumference, the more it draws near to some other part. We
        are therefore not bound to the conformity in question as we are bound to
        the matters which fall under a commandment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Regarding the words of the Psalm (32:1): “Praise becometh the
        upright,” the Gloss says: “The upright are those who direct their hearts
        according to the will of God.” But everyone is obliged to be upright.
        Hence everyone is obliged to the above-mentioned conformity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Every being should conform to its rule. But the divine will is the
        rule of ours, since correctness of will is found first in God. Our will
        should therefore conform to the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Everyone is obliged to conform his will to God’s. The reason for this
        can be taken from the fact that in every genus there is some one thing
        which is primary and is the measure of all the other things which are in
        that genus, for in it the nature of the genus is most perfectly found.
        This is verified of the nature of color, for example, in whiteness,
        which is called the measure of all colors because the extent to which
        each color shares in the nature of the genus is known from its nearness
        to whiteness or its remoteness from it, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>. In this way God Himself is the measure of all
        beings, as can be gathered from the words of the Commentator.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Every being has the act of existing in the proportion in which it
        approaches God by likeness. But according as it is found to be unlike
        Him, it approximates non-existence. And the same must be said of all the
        attributes which are found both in God and in creatures. Hence His
        intellect is the measure of all knowledge; His goodness, of all
        goodness; and, to speak more to the point, His good will, of every good
        will. Every good will is therefore good by reason of its being conformed
        to the divine good will. Accordingly, since everyone is obliged to have
        a good will, he is likewise obliged to have a will conformed to the
        divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But it should be noted that this conformity can be taken in many senses.
        We are speaking here of will in the sense of the volitional act. Our
        conformity to God on the part of the will as a faculty is natural,
        belonging to the image. It accordingly does not fall under any
        commandment. But the act of the divine will has not only this
        characteristic, that it is an act of will, but at the same time this
        also, that it is the cause of all things that are acts. The act of our
        will can therefore conform to the divine will either as an effect to its
        cause or as a will to a will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now the conformity of an effect to its cause is found in a different way
        among natural and among voluntary causes. In the case of natural causes
        the conformity is to be found according to a likeness in nature. For
        example, man begets a man, and fire begets fire. But in the case of
        voluntary causes the effect is said to conform to the cause by reason of
        the fact that the cause is fulfilled in the effect. Thus a product of
        art is likened to its cause, not because it is of the same nature as the
        art which is in the mind of the artist, but because the form of the art
        is fulfilled in the product. It is in this way that an effect of the
        will is conformed to the will when what the will disposes comes about.
        And so an act of our will conforms to the divine will by reason of the
        fact that we will what God wants us to will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The conformity of one will to another in its act, however, can be taken
        in two ways: (1) according to the form of a species, as man is like man,
        and (2) according to an added form, as a wise man is like a wise man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One will is like another in species, I say, when the two have in common
        the same object; for from the object the act draws its species. But in
        the object of the will two aspects are to be taken into account: one
        which is, as it were, material—the thing willed; another which is, as it
        were, formal—the reason for willing, which is the end. It is like the
        case of the object of sight, in which color is in effect material, and
        light is formal, because by light the color is made actually visible.
        Thus on the part of the object two sorts of conformity can be found. One
        derives from the thing willed. A man, for instance, wills something that
        God wills. This conformity is, in a sense, based upon the material
        causc; for the object is, as it were, the matter of the act. It is
        according1v the least among the types of conformity. The other sort of
        conformity derives from the reason for willing or the end. This is had
        when someone wills something for the same reason for which God wills it.
        Conformity of this kind is based upon the final cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A form added to an act, however, is the mode which it gets from the
        habit which elicits it. It is in this way that our will is said to be
        conformed to the divine when a person wills something from charity just
        as God does. This is, in a sense, based upon the formal cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The will of God cannot be fully known to us. Hence, neither can we
        fully conform our will to His. But we can conform it in proportion to
        the knowledge which we have, and we are held to this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A man does not commit two sins in one act, since the essence of sin
        is an act. There can, however, be two deformities of sin in one act.
        This is the case when there is joined to the act of some particular sin
        a circumstance which transmits to it the deformity of another sin. When
        a man steals the goods of another in order to spend them upon harlots,
        for instance, the act of theft takes on the deformity of lust from the
        circumstance of the reason why.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When, however, there is found in the act of some sin, over and above the
        specific deformity of that sin, some element of deformity which is
        common to every sin, by that fact neither the sin nor the deformity of
        the sin is doubled. For such things as are to be found in all sins in
        common are, as it were, the essential principles of sin as such; and
        they are included in the deformity of any specific sin just as the
        principles of a genus are included in the formal character of the
        species. Not being distinct from the specific deformity of the sin, they
        do not add to it numerically. Such things are turning away from God, not
        obeying the divine law, and others, among which must be accounted the
        lack of conformity of which we are speaking. Hence it is not necessary
        that such a defect should double the sin or the dcformity of the sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although one who acts contrary to conformity sins by this very fact,
        yet by reason of what is generic he does not add anything numerically to
        what is specific.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although one who sins venially does not in this act conform his will
        to the divine, yet he does conform it habitually. Nor is he obliged
        always to go into act, but only according to the place and time. He is,
        however, obliged never to do anything contrary. But one who sins
        venially does not act contrary to the conformity in question but rather
        beyond its scope. Hence it does not follow that he sins mortally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5.The commandment about the conformity of will does not bind every time
        our will passes into act but just when we are obliged to think about the
        state of our salvation, as when we are obliged to confess or receive the
        sacraments or do something of the sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. A person is said to be obstinate in two senses: (1) This is said
        <i>absolutely,</i> when he has a will irreversibly adhering to evil. In
        this sense those who are in hell are obstinate, but not anyone in this
        life. Those who are in hell are still held to the conformity of which we
        are treating. Although they cannot attain it, nevertheless they were
        themselves the cause of their own impotence. They accordingly sin in not
        conforming their wills, although it happens that they do not incur
        demerit because they are not wayfarers. (2) A person is said to be
        obstinate <i>in a certain respect,</i> when, namely, he has a will
        adhering to evil which is not altogether irreversible but reversible
        only with great difficulty. It is in this sense that some are said to be
        obstinate in this life. These are able to conform their will to God’s.
        Hence in not conforming they not only sin but also incur demerit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Everyone is obliged, as far as depends upon him, to have charity; and
        whoever does not sins by a sin of omission. Still he does not
        necessarily sin at every moment in which he does not have it, but at the
        time at which he was bound to have it, as when it was incumbent upon him
        to do something which cannot be done without charity, such as to receive
        the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. We are said to be obliged to something in two ways: (1) We are
        obliged in such a way that, if we do not do it, we incur a penalty. And
        this is the proper sense of being obliged. According to the more common
        opinion we are not obliged in this way to do anything from charity; but
        we are so obliged to do something from natural love, and without at
        least this whatever is done is badly done. By natural love I mean not
        only that which is implanted in us by nature and is common to all, as
        all desire happiness, but also that to which a person can attain by
        natural principles. It is found in actions that are good by reason of
        their genus, and also in the political virtues. (z) We are said to be
        obliged to something because without it we are unable to attain our end,
        beatitude. In this way we are obliged to do something from charity,
        without which nothing that merits eternal life can be done. It is
        accordingly clear how the mode of charity in one way falls within the
        scope of commandment and in another does not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Man is conformed to God since he is made to God’s image and likeness.
        It is true that, because man is infinitely distant from God, there
        cannot be a proportion between him and God in the proper sense of
        proportion as found among quantities, consisting of a Certain measure of
        two quantities compared to each other. Nevertheless, in the sense in
        which the term proportion is transferred to signify any relationship of
        one thing to another (as we say that there is a likeness of proportions
        in this instance: the pilot is to his ship as the ruler to the
        commonwealth), nothing prevents our saying that there is a proportion of
        man to God, since man stands in a certain relationship to Him inasmuch
        as he is made by God and subject to Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or the answer could be given that, although there cannot be between the
        finite and the infinite a proportion properly so called, yet there can
        be a proportionality or the likeness of two proportions. We say that
        four is proportioned to two because it is the double; but we say that
        four is proportionable to six because four is to two as six is to three.
        In the same way, although the finite and the infinite cannot be
        proportioned, they can be proportionable, because the finite is equal to
        the finite just as the infinite is to the infinite. In this way there is
        a likeness of the creature to God, because the creature stands to the
        things which are its own as God does to those which belong to Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The creature is not said to be conformed to God as to one who shares
        in the same form in which it shares, but because God is substantially
        the very form in which the creature participates by a sort of imitation.
        It is as if fire were likened to a separate subsistent heat.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although likeness and conformity are reciprocal relations, these
        terms do not always designate indifferently the reference of either one
        of the related members to the other. It is only when the form on which
        the likeness or conformity is based is in each of the extremes in the
        same way, as whiteness is in two men. In that case either one can aptly
        be said to have the form of the other; and this is what is meant when
        something is said to be like another. But when the form is in one
        principally and in the other in a secondary way, reciprocity of the
        likeness is not had. Thus we say that the statue of Hercules is like
        Hercules, but not the other way about; for it cannot be said that
        Hercules has the form of the statue, but only that the statue has the
        form of Hercules. In this way creatures are said to be similar and
        conformed to God but not God to creatures. But since conformation is a
        motion toward conformity, it does not imply a reciprocal relation but
        presupposes one of the related members and denotes that something else
        is moving toward conformity with it. Succeeding things are conformed to
        preceding, but not conversely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. The statement of Anselm is to be understood as meaning, not that man
        always does the will of God as far as he can, but that the divine will
        is always fulfilled in his regard whether he wills it or not.

        1. Paul desired “to be dissolved and to be with Christ,” as is said in
        the Epistle to the Philippians (1: 23). But God did not want this, Hence
        Paul adds: “I know that I shall abide”(1: 25) for your sake. If, then,
        we are obliged to will what God wills, in desiring to be dissolved and
        to be with Christ, Paul sinned. But that is absurd.

        2.What God knows can be revealed to someone else. Now God knows that a
        certain person is reprobated. He can therefore reveal to someone his
        reprobation. On the supposition that He reveals this to someone, it
        therefore follows that this person is bound to will his own damnation if
        we are bound to will what we know God wills. To will one’s own
        damnation, however, is contrary to charity, by which each one loves
        himself even to eternal life. A person would therefore be bound to will
        something against charity. But that is not befitting.

        3 We are obliged to obey a superior as God Himself since we obey him in
        God’s stead. But a subject is not obliged to do and to will whatever he
        knows his superior wishes, even if he knows that the superior wishes him
        to do it, unless the superior expressly commands it. We are therefore
        not obliged to will whatever God wills or whatever He wishes us to will.

        4 Whatever is praiseworthy and honorable is found in Christ most
        perfectly and without the admixture of anything contrary. But with some
        will Christ willed the contrary of what He knew God wished; for with
        some kind of will he willed not to suffer, as the prayer He prayed
        shows: “My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me”
        (Matthew 26:39), even though God wished Him to suffer. To will whatever
        God wills is therefore not praiseworthy, nor are we held to it.

        5. According to Augustine’ sadness is had regarding the things which
        have happened to us against our will. But the Blessed Virgin felt sorrow
        at the death of her son, as is indicated in the words of Simeon: “Thy
        own soul a sword shall pierce” (Luke 2:35). The Blessed Virgin therefore
        did not wish Christ to suffer, but God wished it. Now if we are obliged
        to will what God wills, the Blessed Virgin sinned in this instance. But
        that cannot be granted. Thus it is seen that we are not obliged to
        conform our will to God’s as to the object.

        1. Concerning the words of the Psalm (100:4): “The perverse heart did
        not cleave to me,” the Gloss says: “He who does not will whatever God
        wills has a twisted heart.” But everyone is obliged to avoid having a
        twisted heart. Therefore everyone is obliged to will what God wills.

        2. According to Tully, friendship is willing and not willing the same
        thing. But everyone is obliged to have friendship for God. Hence

        not will.

        3. We should conform our will to God’s for the reason that the will of
        God is the rule of our will, as the Gloss says commenting on the words
        of the Psalm (32:1): “Praise becometh the upright.” But the object of
        the divine will, too, is the rule of every other object, since it is the
        first thing willed, and the first in each genus is the measure of the
        things that come after, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> We are
        therefore obliged to conform the objects of our will to the object of
        the divine will.

        4. Sin consists principally in perversity of choice. But there is
        perversity of choice when the lesser good is preferred to the greater.
        Now whoever does not will what God wills does this, since it is evident
        that what God wills is best. Hence, whoever does not will what God wills
        sins.

        5. According to the Philosopher, the virtuous man is “the rule and
        measure” for all human acts. But Christ is most virtuous. We should
        therefore most of all conform ourselves to Christ as our rule and
        measure. Now Christ conformed his will to the divine will even as
        regards its objects; and all the blessed do the same. Therefore we too
        are obliged to conform our will to the divine even as regards its
        objects.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        in regard to the object of our will we are in a sense obliged to conform
        our will to God’s and in a sense we are not. We are obliged to conform
        our will to God’s in this respect (as has been said), that the divine
        goodness is the rule and measure of every good will. But since good
        depends upon the end, a will is called good on the basis of its relation
        to the reason for willing, which is the end. The reference of the will
        to the object, however, does not in itself make the act of will good,
        since the object stands materially, as it were, to the reason for
        willing, which is an upright end. One and the same object can be desired
        either rightly or wrongly according as it is referred to different ends;
        and on the other hand different and even contrary objects can both be
        willed rightly by being referred to an upright end. Therefore, although
        the will of God cannot be anything but good, and whatever He wills He
        wills rightly, nevertheless the goodness in the very act of the divine
        will is viewed from the standpoint of the reason for willing, that is,
        the end to which God refers whatever He wills, His own goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus we are obliged to conform absolutely to the divine will in regard
        to the end, but in regard to the object only in so far as it is viewed
        under the aspect of its relation to the end. This relation must always
        please us too, though the same object of will can justly displease us
        under some other aspect, such as its being referable to some contrary
        end. Hence it is that the human will is found to conform to the divine
        will in its object inasmuch as it stands related to the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The will of the blessed, who are in continuous contemplation of the
        divine goodness and regulate by it all their affections, knowing fully
        the relationship to it of each object of their desires, is conformed to
        the divine will in every one of its objects. For everything that they
        know God wills, they will absolutely and without any motion to the
        contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Sinners, however, who are turned away from willing the divine goodness,
        are at variance in many respects from what God wills, disapproving of it
        and in no way assenting to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Righteous wayfarers, on the other hand, whose will adheres to the divine
        goodness but who yet do not so perfectly contemplate it that they
        clearly perceive every relation to it of the things to be willed,
        conform to the divine will as regards those objects for which they
        perceive the reason, though there is in them some affection for the
        contrary. It is praiseworthy in them, however, because of the other
        relation considered in their case. They do not follow this affection
        obstinately but subject it to the divine will, because it pleases them
        that the order of the divine will be fulfilled in all things. A man, for
        instance, who wishes his father to live because of his filial affection
        while God wishes him to die, if he is saintly, subjects his own will to
        God’s so as not to bear it impatiently if the will of God contrary to
        his own will is fulfilled.

        1. Paul desired to be dissolved and to be with Christ as something good
        in itself. Nonetheless the contrary was pleasing to’him with reference
        to the fruit that God willed to draw from his living. For this reason he
        said: “But to abide still in the flesh is needful for you” (Philippians
        1: 24).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although in His absolute power God could reveal to someone his
        damnation, this can nevertheless not be done in His ordered power,
        because such a revelation would drive the man to despair. And if such a
        revelation were made to anyone, it would have to be understood, not as a
        prophecy of predestination or foreknowledge, but as one of warning,
        which is based upon the supposition that merits are taken into account.
        But granted that it were to be understood in the sense of a prophecy of
        foreknowledge, the one to whom such a revelation were made would still
        not be obliged to will his own damnation absolutely but only according
        to the order of justice, in which God wills to damn those who persist in
        sin. For God does not on His own part wish to damn anyone, but only in
        accordance with what depends upon us, as is clear from what has been
        said above. To will one’s own damnation absolutely, then, would not be
        to conform one’s will to God’s but to conform it to the will of sin.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The will of the superior is not, like the divine will, the rule of
        our will; rather his command is. Thus the case is not the same.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The passion of Christ could be considered in two ways: (1) in itself,
        inasmuch as it was an affliction of an innocent person, and (2) in its
        relation to the fruit to which God ordained it. In this latter sense it
        was willed by God, not in the former. The will of Christ which could
        consider that relation, namely, His rational will, therefore willed this
        passion as God did; but the will of sensuality, which is not capable of
        comparing but is brought to bear upon something absolutely, did not will
        this passion. In this respect also it was conformed to the divine will,
        in a sense, even as regards the object, because even God Himself did not
        will the passion of Christ taken in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The will of the Blessed Virgin was averse to the passion of Christ
        considered in itself; yet it willed the fruit of salvation which was
        coming from the passion of Christ. Thus it was conformed to the divine
        will both as regards what it was willing and as regards what it was not
        willing.

        1. The words of the Gloss are to be understood of the objects of the
        divine will as they stand under the reference to the end and not
        absolutely.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Friendship consists in harmony of wills rather as regards the end
        than as regards the direct objects themselves. A fever patient whose
        craving for wine was denied by his physician because of their common
        desire for the patient’s health would find in that physician a truer
        friend than if the latter were willing to satisfy the patient’s desire
        for a drink of wine at the peril of his health.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. As was said above, the first object of God’s will and the measure and
        rule of all its other objects is the end which His will has, His own
        goodness. All other things He wills only for this end. Thus, as long as
        our will is conformed to the divine will in regard to the end, all the
        objects of our will are regulated by the first object of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Choice includes both the judgment of reason and appetitive tendency.
        If, then, anyone should in a judgment prefer what is less good to what
        is more good, there will be perversity of choice, but not if he should
        prefer it in tending appetitively; for a man is not obliged always to
        carry out in his action what is better unless it is something that he is
        bound to by a commandment. Otherwise everyone would be obliged to follow
        the counsels of perfection, which clearly are better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. There are certain respects in which we can admire Christ but not
        imitate Him. Examples would be whatever pertains to His divinity and to
        the beatitude which He had while still in this life. An instancc of this
        is the conformity of Christ’s rational will to the divine will cvcn as
        rcgards its objects.
