  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The Masters describe it in this way: “Rapture is elevation, by the power of
    a higher nature, from that which is according to nature to that which is
    contrary to nature.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that rapture is unsuitably described, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine says: “Man’s understanding knows God naturally.” But, in
    rapture, man’s understanding is raised to a knowledge of God. Therefore, it
    is not raised to that which is contrary to nature, but to that which is
    according to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. A created spirit depends more on the uncreated spirit than a lower body
    depends on a higher body. But impressions from higher bodies are natural to
    lower bodies, as the Commentator says. Therefore, elevation of the human
    spirit, even though it takes place in virtue of a higher nature, is only
    natural.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. The Gloss on Romans(11:24), “Contrary to nature [thou] wert grafted into
    the good olive tree,” reads that God, the author of nature, “does nothing
    contrary to nature,” since that which each one receives from the source of
    all rule and order of nature is the nature for it. But the elevation of
    rapture is from God, who is the creator of human nature. Therefore, it is
    not against nature but according to it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. It was said that it is against nature because it is done in a divine
    manner and not in the manner of human spirit.—On the contrary, Dionysius
    says: “We see the justice of God in this that He distributes [His goods] to
    all things according to the measure of their worth.” But God cannot do
    anything contrary to His justice. Therefore, He does not give a thing
    something which is not according to its manner of being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. If man’s manner is changed in some respect, it is not changed in such a
    way that man’s proper good would be taken away. For, as Augustine says, God
    is not the cause of man’s deterioration. But man’s proper good is to live
    according to reason and to act in a voluntary way, as is clear in Dionysius.
    Therefore, since violence is contrary to what is voluntary and does away
    with the good of reason (for necessity causes sorrow since it is contrary to
    the will, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>), it seems that God brings
    about no violent elevation in man contrary to nature. Now, this is what
    seems to take place in rapture, as the very name implies, and as the
    previously mentioned description points out in the words, “by the power of a
    higher nature.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. According to the Philosopher,” excessive intensity of sensible objects
    destroys the senses, but excessive intensity of intelligible objects does
    not destroy the understanding. Now, the senses fail of knowledge of intense
    sensible objects because they are destroyed by them. Therefore, the
    understanding can know intelligible objects naturally no matter how intense
    they are. Hence, no matter to what intelligible objects the mind of man is
    raised up, the elevation will not be contrary to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Augustine says that angels and souls have similar natures but dissimilar
    duties.” Now, it is not contrary to the nature of an angel to know the
    things to which man is raised in rapture. Therefore, for man, the elevation
    of rapture is not contrary to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. If any movement is natural, arrival at the term of the movement will also
    be natural, since no movement is infinite. But the mind of man is naturally
    moved toward God. This is clear from the fact that it rests only when it has
    reached God. Hence, Augustine says: “You made us for Thee, Lord; and our
    heart is not at rest until it rests in Thee.” Therefore, the elevation by
    which the mind reaches God, as happens in rapture, is not contrary to
    nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. It was said that it is not natural for the human mind to be drawn to God
    by reason of the mind itself, but by reason of an ordination of God. Thus,
    it is not natural simply.—On the contrary, a lower nature does not engage in
    activity or tend toward any end except by reason of a divine ordination. It
    is for this reason that every natural work is called a work of intelligence.
    Nevertheless, we say that the movements and activities of natural things are
    simply natural. Therefore, to be drawn toward God should also be judged
    simply natural if it is natural to the mind by reason of a divine
    ordination.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. The soul, in so far as it exists in itself and is thus called a spirit,
    is prior to the soul as joined to the body and, accordingly, called a soul.
    But the activity of the soul as a spirit is to know God and the other
    separated substances. But, in so far as it is joined to the body, its
    activity is to know corporeal and sensible things. Therefore, the capacity
    of the soul to know intelligible things is prior to that to know sensible
    things. Since, therefore, it is natural for the soul to know sensible
    things, it is also natural for it to know divine intelligible things. Thus,
    we conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. The ordination of a thing to its final end is more natural than the
    ordination to the means, for the ordination to the means exists because of
    the ordination to the final end. But sensible things are the means by which
    we reach the knowledge of God, as we see in Romans (1:20): “For the
    invisible things of him... are clearly seen, being understood by the things
    that are made.” But the knowledge of sensible things is natural to man.
    Therefore, knowledge of intelligible things is also natural. We conclude as
    before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Nothing that takes place by a natural power can be said to be
    unconditionally contrary to nature. But certain things, as herbs or stones,
    have natural powers to release the mind from the senses, so that wonderful
    visions are beheld. This is what seems to happen in rapture. Therefore,
    rapture is not an elevation contrary to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The Gloss on the passage in the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:2), “I
    know a man in Christ,” says: “Rapture, that is exaltation contrary to
    nature...” Therefore, rapture is an elevation contrary to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    just as everything else has a certain activity which is natural to it in so
    far as it is this thing, fire or a stone, for example; so, too, man as man
    has a certain activity which is natural to him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, in physical reality the natural activity of a thing may be modified in
    two ways. In one, the change arises from a deficiency of its proper power,
    whatever be the source of such a deficiency, whether an extrinsic or an
    intrinsic cause. Thus, an abnormal fetus is produced because of a lack of
    formative power in the seed. In the other way, the change arises from the
    activity of the divine power, whose will all nature obeys. This happens in
    miracles, as when a virgin conceives or a blind man is made to see.
    Similarly, man’s natural and proper activity can be modified in two ways.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Man’s proper activity, however, is to understand through the mediation of
    sense and imagination. For the activity by which he fixes on intellectual
    things alone, passing over all lower things, does not belong to man as man,
    but in so far as something divine exists in him, as is said in the
    <i>Ethics.</i> Moreover, the activity by means of which he grasps only
    sensible things apart from understanding and reasoning does not belong to
    him as man, but according to the nature which he has in common with the
    brute animals. Therefore, when man is transported out of his senses and sees
    things beyond sense, his natural mode of knowing is modified.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Sometimes, this change takes place because of some deficiency in man’s
    proper power, as happens with insane people and others who are mentally
    deranged. This kind of transport out of their senses is not an elevation but
    rather a debasing of man. Sometimes, however, such transport takes place
    through the divine power, and then it is properly an elevation. For, since
    the agent makes that which is passive like itself, the transport which takes
    place by the divine power, and which is above man, has an ordination to
    something higher than that which is natural to man.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thus, in the foregoing description of rapture, which defines it as a
    movement, “elevation” gives its genus, and “by the power of a higher nature”
    gives the efficient cause. “From that which is according to nature to that
    which is contrary to nature” gives the starting point and the term of the
    movement.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. One can know God in many ways: through His essence, through sensible
    things, or through intelligible effects. We have to make a similar
    distinction about that which is natural to man. For something is contrary to
    nature and according to nature for one and the same thing according to its
    different states, because the nature of the thing is not the same when it is
    in the state of becoming and when it has complete existence, as Rabbi Moses
    says. Thus, full stature and other things of the kind are natural to man
    when he has reached maturity, but it would be contrary to nature for a boy
    to have full stature at birth.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thus, it must be said that to know God in some fashion is natural for the
    human intelligence according to any state. But in the beginning, that is, in
    this life, it is natural for it to know God through sensible creatures. It
    is also natural for it to reach the knowledge of God through Himself when it
    reaches its full perfection, that is, in heaven. Thus, if in this life it is
    raised to the knowledge of God which it will have in heaven, this will be
    contrary to nature, just as it would be contrary to nature for a baby boy to
    have a beard.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Nature can be taken in two ways: in particular, as proper to each thing,
    and in general, as embracing the whole order of natural causes. For this
    reason a thing is said to be according to nature or contrary to nature in
    two ways: in one, with reference to nature in particular; in the other, with
    reference to nature in general. Thus, every deficiency, decay, and the
    weakness of old age is contrary to nature in particular, but, according to
    nature in general, it is natural for everything which is composed of
    contraries to decay.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, since the universal order of causes is so ordained that lower
    things should be moved by those which are higher, all movement which takes
    place in lower nature because of the impressions of what is higher, whether
    this be in physical or in spiritual things, is natural according to
    universal nature, but not according to particular nature unless the
    impression made on the lower nature by the higher nature is such that the
    very impression is its nature. Thus, it is clear how the effects which God
    brings about in creatures can be called according to nature or contrary to
    nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. The answer to the third difficulty is clear from this. Or else we should
    say that that elevation is called contrary to nature because it is contrary
    to the ordinary course of nature, as the Gloss explains.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Although God never acts contrary to justice, He sometimes does do
    something beyond justice. For a thing is contrary to justice when something
    one deserves is taken away from him. This is clear in human dealings when
    someone robs another. But, if out of liberality one gives what is not
    deserved, this is not contrary to justice, but beyond it. Accordingly, when
    in this life God raises a human mind above its proper level, He does not act
    contrary to justice, but beyond it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. By the very fact that a man’s work has a meritorious value it must be
    under the direction of reason and the will. But the good which is imparted
    to a work in rapture is not of this sort. Hence, it is not necessary that it
    proceed from the human will, but only from the divine power. Nevertheless,
    we cannot call it violence in every respect, unless in the sense that we say
    there is violent movement when a stone is thrown down faster than it would
    fall by its natural motion. Nevertheless, properly speaking, “that is
    violent in which that which is passive contributes nothing,” as is said in
    the <i>Ethics.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <i>6.</i> Understanding and sense have this in common, that both fail of
    perfect perception of an excessively intense object, although both perceive
    something of it. The difference lies in this, that sense is destroyed by an
    excessively intense sensible object, so that afterwards it cannot know
    lesser sensibles, but understanding is strengthened through reception of an
    excessively intense intelligible object, so that afterwards it can know
    lesser intelligible objects better. Hence, the authoritative statement of
    the Philosopher cited above is not to the point.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Angels and souls are said to be equal in nature only in relation to the
    state of final perfection in which men will be like angels in heaven, as is
    said in Matthew (22:30), or in so far as they share in intellectual nature,
    although it is more perfect in the angels.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Arrival at the term of natural movement is natural, not in the beginning
    or middle of the movement, but at the end. Hence, the argument does not
    follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Activities of physical things which come from a divine ordination are
    said to be natural when the sources of these activities are implanted in
    things in the way in which their natures are. However, God does not ordain
    the elevation of rapture for man in this way. Hence, they are not alike in
    this respect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. That which is prior in the intention of nature is sometimes subsequent
    in time, as actuality relates to potentiality in the same receiving subject,
    for to be in act is prior in nature, although in time one and the same thing
    is first in potentiality before it is in actuality. In like manner, the
    activity of the soul, in so far as it is a spirit, is prior, relative to the
    intention of nature, but subsequent in time. Hence, if one activity takes
    place at the time for another activity, this is contrary to nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. Although the ordination to the means is because of the ordination to the
    final end, it is only through the means that one arrives naturally at the
    final end. If it happens otherwise, the arrival is not natural. And it is
    thus in the case in question.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. The transport out of the senses which is brought about by the power of
    physical things is classified with that transport which takes place because
    of a deficiency of the proper power. For the nature of those things is such
    that they can effect a transport out of the senses only in so far as they
    deaden the senses. Hence, it is clear that such transport from sense is
    foreign to rapture.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It seems that he did not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Gloss on Ephesians (4:18), “Having their understanding
        darkened... “ says: “Everyone who understands is enlightened with an
        inner light.” Therefore, if the understanding is raised up to see God,
        it must be enlightened by some light proportionate to this kind of
        sight. But the only such light is the light of glory, of which Psalms
        (35:10) says: “In thy light we shall see light.” Therefore, God can be
        seen through His essence only by an intellect enjoying beatitude. And,
        since Paul was not glorified when he was enraptured, he could not see
        God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that in that state Paul did enjoy beatitude.—On the
        contrary, perpetuity is of the nature of beatitude, as Augustine says.
        But that state did not remain in Paul forever. Therefore, he did not
        enjoy beatitude in that state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. From the glory in the soul glory overflows into the body. But Paul’s
        body was not glorified. Therefore, neither was his mind enlightened by
        the light of glory. And, so, he did not see God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It was said that by seeing God through His essence in that state he
        was made blessed, not without qualification, but only in a qualified
        way.—On the contrary, all that is needed for one to be blessed in all
        respects is the act of glory and the gift of glory, which is the
        principle of that act. Thus, Peter’s body would have been glorified if,
        along with being held up on the water, he had also had within him
        agility, which is the principle of this act. But splendor, the principle
        of the vision of God, which is the act of glory, is the gift of glory.
        Therefore, if Paul’s mind saw God through His essence and was
        enlightened by the light which is the source of this vision, he was
        glorified without qualification.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. While he was enraptured, Paul had faith and hope. But these are
        incompatible with the vision of God through His essence, for faith
        concerns things that appear not, as is said in Hebrews (11:1), and:
        “What a man seeth, why doth he hope for? “ as is said in Romans (8:24).
        Therefore, he did not see God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In heaven, charity is not a principle of merit. But in his rapture
        Paul was capable of meriting, since his soul had not yet been separated
        from the corruptible body, as Augustine says. Therefore, he did not have
        the charity proper to heaven. But where there is the vision proper to
        heaven, which is perfect, there also is the charity proper to heaven,
        which is perfect, for one loves God to the extent that he knows about
        God. Therefore, Paul did not see God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The divine essence cannot be seen without joy, as Augustine says.
        Therefore, if Paul saw God through His essence, he took delight in that
        sight. Accordingly, he did not wish to be separated from it, nor, on the
        other hand, did God cut him off from it against his wishes. For, since
        God is most generous, He does not on His part withdraw His gifts.
        Therefore, Paul would never have been cut off from that state. But he
        was cut off. Therefore, he did not see God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. No one who has a good because of merit loses it without sin.
        Therefore, since to see God through His essence is a good which one has
        because of merit, no one who sees God through His essence can be cut off
        from this sight unless he should happen to sin. But this cannot be said
        of Paul, who says in Romans (8:38, 39): “For I am sure that neither
        death, nor life... shall... separate us...” We conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. When Paul is said to be enraptured, there is also question of the
        difference between his rapture and the deep sleep of Adam and the
        rapture of John the Evangelist, in which he says he “was in the spirit”
        (Apocalypse 1:10), and the “ecstasy of mind” which Peter had (Acts
        11:5).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From what Augustine says and from the Gloss” we see clearly that Paul
        saw God through His essence when he was enraptured.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Concerning this, some have said that Paul, when he was enraptured, did
        not see God through His essence, but with a vision midway between the
        vision had in this life and the vision had in heaven. We can take this
        intermediate vision to mean the kind of vision which is natural to an
        angel, such that he would see God, not, indeed, through His essence with
        natural knowledge, but through intelligible species, in so far as he
        considers his own essence, which is an intelligible likeness of the
        uncreated essence, according to the saying of <i>The Causes</i> that an
        intelligence knows what is above it in so far as it is caused by it.
        According to this, Paul, when enraptured, is conceived of as having seen
        God through the refulgence of some intelligible light in his mind.
        However, the knowledge of this life, which is through the mirror and
        obscurity of sensible creatures, is natural to man. And the knowledge of
        heaven, by which we see God through His essence, is natural only to God.
        But this opinion is contrary to what Augustine says, for he states
        expressly that, when Paul was enraptured, he saw God through His
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nor is it likely that a minister of God to the Jews of the Old Testament
        would see God through His essence, as appears from Numbers (12:8):
        “Plainly and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord,” and that
        this would not be granted to the minister of the New Testament, the
        Teacher of the Gentiles. This is especially true since the Apostle
        himself argues in this way: “For if the ministration of condemnation be
        glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory” (2 Cor
        3:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Still, he did not have beatitude without qualification, but only in some
        respects, although his mind was enlightened with supernatural light to
        enable it to see God. This will become clear from the example of
        physical light. For, in some things, we find the light from the sun as
        an abiding form, as though it had become connatural to them, as in the
        stars, rubies, and things of this sort. But, in other things, the light
        from the sun is received as a passing impression, as light in the air.
        For the light does not become a form abiding in the air, as though
        connatural to it, but passes when the sun leaves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like fashion, also, the light of glory is infused into the mind in
        two ways. In one, it follows the mode of a form which becomes connatural
        and abiding. This makes the mind blessed without qualification, and is
        the manner in which it is infused in the blessed in heaven. In the other
        way, the mind receives the light of glory as a passing impression. It
        was in this way that Paul’s mind was enlightened with the light of glory
        when he was enraptured. The very name shows that this took place quickly
        (<i>raptim</i>) and in passing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, he was not glorified without qualification, nor did he have the
        gift of glory, since that splendor did not become a property in him. For
        this reason it did not flow down from the soul to the body, nor did he
        remain in this state permanently.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1-4. The response to the first four objections is clear from what has
        been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When full vision comes, faith leaves. Hence, in so far as Paul had
        the vision of God through His essence, he did not have faith. Now, he
        had the vision of God through His essence by way of act, not according
        to the habit of glory. Consequently, he had faith not in act but
        habitually, and hope likewise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although Paul was then in a state in which he could merit, he did not
        actually merit, for, just as he had the act of vision possessed by those
        in heaven, so he had the act of charity possessed by those in heaven.
        Nevertheless, some say that, although he had the vision of those in
        heaven, he did not have the act of charity of those in heaven. For,
        although his understanding was rapt, his affections were not. But this
        is clearly contrary to what the Gloss on “He was caught up into
        paradise” (2 Cor 12:4), says: “That is, into that tranquility which
        those who are in the heavenly Jerusalem enjoy.” But enjoyment takes
        place through love.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. That the vision did not remain in Paul was due to the nature of the
        light which illumined his mind, as is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Although in the blessed the vision of God is due to merit, at that
        time it was not given to Paul as a reward of merit. Hence, the reasoning
        does not follow. However, it should be noted that these last two
        objections bring no better argument against the fact that Paul saw God
        through His essence than against the fact that he saw Him in any way
        which surpassed the common manner of sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. In the Scriptures, transport of mind, ecstasy, and rapture are all
        used in the same sense and indicate some raising up of the mind from
        sensible things outside of us toward which we naturally turn our
        attention, to things which are above man. This takes place in two ways.
        For, at times, this transport from things outside is taken to refer to
        attention only, as when someone makes use of the external senses and
        things about him, but his whole attention is engaged in contemplating
        and loving things divine. Such is the state of anyone who contemplates
        and loves things divine in transport of the mind, whether ecstasy or
        rapture. For this reason Dionysius says: “Divine love brings about
        ecstasy.” And Gregory, speaking of contemplation, says: “One who is rapt
        in order that he may understand the things within closes his eyes to
        visible things.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Ecstasy or rapture or transport of the mind take place in another way,
        and the names are more generally used in this sense, when one is also
        deprived of the use of his senses and sensible things in order to see
        certain things supernaturally. Now, a thing is seen supernaturally when
        it is seen beyond sense, understanding, and imagination, as we said in
        the question on prophecy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, Augustine distinguishes” two kinds of rapture. There is one
        in which the mind is carried out of the senses to the vision in the
        imagination. This is what happened to Peter and to John the Evangelist
        in the Apocalypse, as Augustine says. There is another in which the mind
        is at once transported out of the senses and out of the imagination to
        an intellectual vision. This happens in two ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In one, the intellect understands God through certain intelligible
        communications, and this is proper to angels. Adam’s ecstasy was of this
        sort, as the Gloss on Genesis(2:21)says: “The correct interpretation of
        this ecstasy is that it was given so that Adam’s mind might become a
        member of the heavenly court and, entering into the sanctuary of God,
        might understand the last things.” In the other way, the understanding
        sees God through His essence. It was for this that Paul was enraptured,
        as we have said.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Man’s nature is the same in this life and after the resurrection.
        For, if it were not specifically the same, numerically the same man
        would not arise. But after the resurrection the saints will see God
        mentally through His essence and no transport out of the senses will
        take place. Therefore, the same thing is possible for those in this
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that, since the body of one in this life is
        corruptible, it weighs down the understanding so that it cannot be drawn
        freely to God unless it is carried out of the senses of the body. And
        this corruption will be gone after the resurrection.—On the contrary,
        nothing is hindered, just as nothing suffers, except through the
        activity of its contrary. But bodily corruption does not seem to be
        opposed to the act of understanding, since understanding is not an act
        of the body. Therefore, corruption of the body does not prevent the
        understanding from being drawn freely to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It is certain that Christ took on our mortality and the corruption
        which is a punishment for us. But His understanding enjoyed the sight of
        God continuously, although He was not always transported out of his
        external senses. Therefore, corruption does not make it impossible for
        the understanding to be drawn to God without being transported out of
        the senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. After Paul had seen God through His essence, he remembered the things
        which he had seen in that vision. Otherwise, if he had not remembered
        them, he would not have said: “He heard secret words, which it is not
        granted to man to utter” (2 Cor. 12:4). Therefore, while he saw God
        through His essence, something was being imprinted on his memory. But
        memory belongs to the sensitive part of man, as the Philosopher plainly
        shows. Therefore, when in this life someone sees God through His
        essence, he is not entirely transported out of his bodily senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The sensitive powers are closer to each other than the intellective
        powers are to the sensitive powers. But the imagination, which is one of
        the sensitive powers, can actually grasp any of its objects whatever
        without being cut off from the external senses. Therefore, the
        understanding, too, can actually see God without being cut off from the
        sensitive powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. That which is according to nature does not require for its existence
        anything which is contrary to nature. But it is natural for the human
        understanding to see God through His essence, since it was created for
        this. Therefore, since transport out of the senses is contrary to nature
        for man, inasmuch as sensitive cognition is natural to him, it seems
        that he does not require transport from the senses as a prerequisite to
        see God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Only those things which are joined together can be cut off from each
        other. But intelligence, whose object is God, as is said in
        <i>Spirit and Soul</i>, does not seem to be joined to the bodily senses
        but rather seems extremely distant from them. Therefore, for man to see
        God through His essence by means of intelligence he does not need to be
        cut off from the senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Paul seems to have been raised up to the sight of God so that there
        would be a witness of the glory which is promised to the saints. Hence,
        Augustine says: “Why should we not believe that it was God’s wish to
        show to this great Apostle, the Teacher of the Gentiles, that life which
        is to be lived forever after this life? [God did this] while Paul was
        raised in rapture to that most lofty sight.”But, after the resurrection,
        in that vision of the saints which will be given to those who see God in
        the next life, there will be no transport out of the bodily senses.
        Therefore, it seems that this kind of transport did not take place in
        Paul either, when he saw God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. During their sufferings and torments the martyrs inwardly perceived
        something of the divine glory. Hence, Vincent says: “Behold, I am
        already raised on high, and from above the world I look down on all your
        distinguished men, O tyrant.”And in other records of the sufferings of
        the saints we read many passages which seem to have the same tenor. But
        it is obvious that there was no withdrawal from the senses in these
        people. Otherwise, they would not have felt the pain. Therefore, there
        is no transport out of the senses in order for one to share in the glory
        by which God is seen through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The practical understanding is closer than the speculative
        understanding to the activity which has sensible things as its object.
        But, as Avicenna says,, it is not necessary for the practical
        understanding always to pay attention to manis operations which are
        concerned with sensible objects. Otherwise, the best harpist Would seem
        to be the worst if it Were necessary for him to give artistic reflection
        to each stroke of the strings. For, in such a case, there would be too
        much interruption of the sounds, which would hurt the proper melody.
        Therefore, it is far less necessary for the speculative understanding to
        pay attention to man’s operations which concern sensible things. Thus,
        it remains free to be drawn to any act of understanding, even to the
        divine essence itself, while the sense powers are engaged in sensible
        activities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. While Paul saw God through His essence, he still had faith. But it
        belongs to faith to see darkly through a mirror. Therefore, while Paul
        saw God through His essence, at the same time he saw darkly through a
        mirror. But this obscure knowledge is through a mirror and through
        sensible things. Therefore, while he saw God through His essence, he
        also gave his attention to sensible things. The conclusion is the same
        as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, and is quoted in the Gloss on the second Epistle
        to the Corinthians(12:2): “No man who sees God, as He is in Himself,
        lives the mortal life which we live in the bodily senses. But unless one
        in some way dies to this life, either leaving the body completely, or so
        turning away and cutting himself off from the bodily senses that with
        good reason he does not know whether he is in the body or outside of it,
        he is not enraptured and transported to that vision.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Gloss on the second Epistle to the Corinthians (5:13), “Whether
        we be transported in mind, it is to God,” says: “He calls ecstasy that
        by which the mind is raised to an understanding of heavenly things, so
        that in some sense lower things drop from the memory. All the saints to
        whom secrets of God which surpass this world have been revealed were in
        this ecstasy.”Therefore, it is necessary for everyone who sees God
        through His essence to be withdrawn from the consideration of lower
        things, and, consequently, also from the use of the senses with which we
        see only lower things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3.The Gloss on Psalms (67:28), “There is Benjamin, a youth in ecstasy of
        mind,” says: “Benjamin, (that is, Paul), in ecstasy, that is, with his
        mind unconscious of the bodily senses, as when he was carried up into
        the third heaven.” But the third heaven means vision of God through His
        essence, as Augustine says. Therefore, the vision of God through His
        essence requires loss of consciousness of the bodily senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The activity of an understanding which is raised to see the essence
        of God is more effective than any activity of the imagination. But,
        sometimes, a man is transported out of the bodily senses because of the
        intensity of the activity of the imagination. Therefore, he should be
        transported out of them with much greater reason when he is lifted up to
        the vision of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Bernard says: “Divine consolation is sensitive and will not be given
        to those who admit any other.” So, for the same reason, the divine
        vision does not tolerate sight of anything else along with it.
        Therefore, neither does it tolerate the use of the senses along with it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The greatest cleanness of heart is needed to see God through His
        essence, according to Matthew (5:8): “Blessed are the clean of heart.”
        But the heart is sullied in two ways, namely, by the contamination of
        sin, and by phantasies of material things. This is clear from what
        Dionysius says: “Those [celestial essences] should be considered pure,
        not in the sense that they are free of unclean stains and defilements
        (in which he refers to uncleanness because of guilt, which never existed
        in the blessed angels), nor in the sense that they are receptive of
        phantasies of material things” (in which is included the uncleanness
        which comes through phantasies, as is clear from Hugh of St. Victor.)
        Therefore, the mind of one who sees God through His essence must be
        transported not only out of the external senses, but also out of the
        internal phantasms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:10) we read: “When that
        which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be put away.” But,
        here, “perfect” refers to the vision of God through His essence, and
        “imperfect” refers to vision through a mirror darkly, which is through
        sensible things. Therefore, when one is raised to the vision of God
        through His essence, he must be deprived of the vision of sensible
        things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As is clear from the authoritative statement of Augustine, a man living
        in this mortal body cannot see God through His essence, unless he is
        made unconscious of the bodily senses. We can see the reason for this
        from two things. First, from that which is common to the understanding
        and the other powers of the soul, for with all the powers of the soul we
        find that, when the act of one power becomes intense, the act of another
        is either weakened or entirely suppressed. Thus, it is clear that, when
        one is giving very close attention to the activity of sight, his hearing
        does not perceive the things which are being said, unless, perhaps,
        their force attracts the sense of the hearer to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason for this, as Augustine proves, is that attention is needed
        for the act of any cognoscitive power. Moreover, one’s attention cannot
        be given to many things at once, unless they are related to one another
        in such a way that they can be taken as one, just as the motion or
        activity of a thing cannot have two termini not related to each other.
        Hence, since there is one soul, in which all cognoscitive powers are
        rooted, the attention of one and the same soul is needed for the acts of
        all the cognoscitive powers. Therefore, when the soul gives complete
        attention to the act of one power, the man is cut off from the act of
        another power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But for the understanding to be raised up to the vision of the divine
        essence, the whole attention must be concentrated on this vision, since
        this is the most intensely intelligible object, and the understanding
        can reach it only by striving for it with a total effort. Therefore, it
        is necessary to have complete abstraction from the bodily senses when
        the mind is raised to the vision of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Second, we can find a reason for this in that which is proper to the
        understanding. For, since we know things in so far as they are in act,
        and not in so far as they are in potency, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics,</i> the understanding, which holds the highest place in
        knowledge, properly deals with immaterial things, which are most in act.
        Hence, every intelligible thing is either free from matter or separated
        from it by the activity of the understanding. Therefore, the freer the
        understanding is of contact, as it were, with material things, the more
        perfect it is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason, the human understanding, which reaches material things
        by considering phantasms; from which it abstracts intelligible species,
        has less efficacy than the angelic understanding, which always considers
        purely immaterial forms. Nevertheless, in so far as the purity of
        intellectual knowledge is not wholly obscured in human understanding, as
        happens in the senses whose knowledge cannot go beyond material things,
        it has the power to consider things which are purely immaterial by the
        very fact that it retains some purity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, if it is ever raised beyond its ordinary level to see the
        highest of immaterial things, namely, the divine essence, it must be
        wholly cut off from the sight of material things at least during that
        act. Hence, since the sensitive powers can deal only with material
        things, one cannot be raised to vision of the divine essence unless he
        is wholly deprived of the use of the bodily senses.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. After the resurrection the beatified soul will be joined to the body
        in a different way from that in which it is now united to it. For, in
        the resurrection, the body will be entirely subject to the spirit to
        such an extent that the properties of glory will overflow from the
        spirit into the body. Hence, they will be called spiritual bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, when two things are united and one of them has complete
        control over the other, there is no mixture there, since the one falls
        completely under the power of the other which rules it. Thus, if one
        drop of water is poured into a thousand jars of wine, the purity of the
        wine is not at all impaired. Therefore, in the resurrection there will
        be no defilement of the understanding and its power will not be weakened
        in any way by any union whatsoever with the body. Hence, even without
        transport out of the bodily senses, it will contemplate the divine
        essence. However, the body is not now subject to the spirit in this way,
        and, therefore, the reasoning does not have the same force.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Our body is corruptible because it is not fully subject to the soul.
        For, if it were fully subject to the soul, immortality would also
        overflow into the body from the immortality of the soul, as will happen
        after the resurrection. It is for this reason that the corruption of the
        body oppresses the understanding. Although in itself it is not directly
        opposed to the understanding, its cause impairs the purity of the
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. From the fact that Christ was God and man, He had full power over all
        the parts of His soul and over His body. Hence, as Damascene says,by the
        power of the Godhead He permitted each power of the soul to do that
        which is proper to it in so far as it fitted in with our redemption.
        Thus, it was not necessary for Him to have an overflow from one power to
        another, nor for one power to be deprived of its act because of the
        intensity of the act of another power. Consequently, the fact that His
        understanding saw God did not necessitate any transport out of the
        bodily senses. However, it is different with other men, in whom
        redundance or interference of one power with another necessarily follows
        from the intimate connection of the powers of the soul with one another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. After Paul had stopped seeing God through His essence, he remembered
        what he had known in that vision by means of certain species which
        remained in his understanding and were relics, so to speak, of the
        previous vision. For, although he saw the very Word of God through His
        essence, and from the vision of that essence knew many truths, (and thus
        neither for the Word Himself nor for the things which he saw in the Word
        did this vision take place through any species, but only through the
        essence of the Word), nevertheless, by reason of the vision of the Word,
        certain likenesses of the things which he saw were imprinted on his
        understanding. And with these likenesses he could see afterwards the
        things which he had previously seen through the essence of the Word.
        Later, by applying these intelligible species to the individual
        intentions or forms which were stored in his memory or imagination, he
        could remember the things which he had seen previously, and this even
        through the activity of memory, which is a sensitive power. Thus, it is
        not necessary to hold that in the act of seeing God something took place
        in his memory, which is part of the sensitive power, but only in his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although transport from the external senses does not arise from every
        act of imaginative power, the transport mentioned above does take place
        when the act of the imagination is very intense. Similarly, it is not
        necessary that transport out of the senses take place because of every
        act of understanding; nevertheless, it does come about through the most
        intense act, which is the vision of God through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although it is natural for the human understanding at some time to
        reach the vision of God through His essence, it is not natural for it to
        reach this in the conditions of this life, as we have said. For this
        reason the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although our intelligence, with which we grasp things divine, does
        not combine with the senses in the process of perception, it does
        combine with them in the process of judging. Hence, Augustine says:
        “Through the light of our intelligence we judge even of the lower things
        and we perceive things which are neither bodies nor bear forms like
        those of bodies.”“ Therefore, our intelligence is said at times to
        abstract from the senses when it does not make judgments concerning
        them, but focuses its attention on the vision of heavenly things alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The essence of the beatitude of the saints consists in the vision of
        the divine essence. Hence, Augustine says: “Vision is the whole reward.”
        For this reason one could be a suitable witness of that beatitude
        because he had seen the divine essence. Still, it would not be necessary
        for him to experience all the privileges which belong to the blessed.
        But, from that which he did experience, he could also know the other
        things. For he was not enraptured to become blessed, but to be a witness
        of beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. In their sufferings the martyrs perceived something of divine glory,
        not as if they drank it at its source, as do those who see God through
        His essence, but, rather, they were refreshed by a sprinkling of that
        glory. Hence, Augustine says: “There,” where God is seen through His
        essence, “the blessed life is drunk from its source. From that source
        some of it is sprinkled on this human life, so that in the temptations
        of this world that life may be lived temperately, justly, bravely, and
        prudently.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The speculative understanding is not forced to turn its attention to
        the activities in which one is occupied with sensible things, but it can
        busy itself with other intelligible things. Moreover, the intensity of
        the act of speculation can be so great that it is altogether abstracted
        from sensible activity.

        1. The powers of the vegetative soul are more material than the powers
        of the sensitive soul. But for our understanding to see God through His
        essence it must abstract from the senses, as has been said., Therefore,
        abstraction from the acts of the vegetative soul is much more urgently
        required for the purity of that vision. But this abstraction cannot take
        place where there is brute life as long as the soul is united to the
        body as its form. For, as the Philosopher says: “In animals the process
        of nutrition is always going on.” Therefore, for the vision of the
        divine essence there must be an abstraction from the union by which the
        soul is united to the body as its form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The gloss of Augustine on Exodus (33:20), “For man shall not see me
        and live,” says: “This shows that God cannot appear as He is to this
        life of corruptible flesh. But He can in the other life, which one can
        live. only by dying to this life.” The gloss of Gregory reads: “He who
        sees the wisdom which is God dies entirely to this life.” But death is
        the result of the separation of the soul from the body to which it was
        united as its form. Therefore, there has to be a complete separation of
        the soul from the body in order to see God through His essence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3 “For a living thing, its act of life is its act of existence,” as is
        said in <i>The Soul</i>. But the act of existence of a man who is alive
        arises from the union of his soul with his body as its form. But Exodus
        (33:20) says: “For man shall not see me and live.” Therefore, as long as
        the soul is united to the body as its form, he cannot see God through
        His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The union by which the soul is united to the body as its form is
        stronger than that by which it is united to the body as a mover. From
        this latter union arise the activities of the powers and the activities
        which are carried on through bodily organs. But this latter union
        hinders the vision of the divine essence, for which there must be
        abstraction from the bodily senses. Therefore, the first union will
        interfere with it much more, and thus it will be necessary to dissolve
        it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since powers flow from the essence and are rooted in it they are not
        raised to a level higher than that of their essence. Therefore, if the
        essence of the soul is united to a material body as its form, it is not
        possible for the power of understanding to be raised to things which are
        altogether immaterial. We conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Greater contamination results in the soul from its connection with
        the body than from its union with a bodily likeness. But for the mind to
        see God through His essence, it must be purified of bodily likenesses,
        which are perceived through imagination and sense, as has been said.
        Therefore, for the soul to see God through His essence, it must with
        much greater reason be separated from the body.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. In the second Epistle to the Corinthians (5:6, 7) we read: “While we
        are in the body, we are absent from the Lord. (For we walk by faith, and
        not by sight.) “ Therefore, as long as the soul is in the body, it
        cannot see God as He is in Himself.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The gloss of Gregory on the passage from Exodus (33:20), “For man
        shall not see me and live,” says: “The splendor of the eternal God can
        be seen by some who live in this flesh, but who are growing in priceless
        virtue.”“ But the splendor of God is His essence, as the same gloss
        says. Therefore, it is not necessary to have complete separation of soul
        from body to see the essence of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine says: “The soul is enraptured not only to the vision of
        imagination, but also to the vision of understanding, through which the
        truth itself is clearly seen. Meanwhile, it has been carried out of its
        senses less than in death, but more than in sleep.” Therefore, to see
        the uncreated truth of which Augustine is speaking there is no need to
        dissolve the union whereby the soul is united to the body as its form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The same thing is clear from these words of Augustine: “It is not
        beyond belief that even that lofty degree of revelation”—to see God
        through His essence—“was given to some holy men before they were dead
        and their corpses ready for burial.” Therefore, while the soul is still
        united to the body as its form, it can see God.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To see the divine essence, which is the most perfect act of
        understanding, there must be an abstraction from those things which of
        their nature interfere with the excessive intensity of the act of
        understanding and which are hindered by this same intensity. This
        happens in some things because of something intrinsic to the act itself,
        and in others merely for some extrinsic reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The activities of sense and understanding interfere with each other by
        reason of the acts themselves, inasmuch as attention is needed for both
        activities, and also because the understanding in some fashion enters
        into the sensible activities since it receives something from the
        phantasms. Thus, the purity of the understanding is contaminated to some
        extent by sense activities, as we have said. But no attention is needed
        for the union of the soul to the body as its form, since this union does
        not depend on the will of the soul, but on nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the same way, the purity of the understanding is not directly
        contaminated by such a union. For the soul is not joined to the body as
        its form through the mediation of its powers, but through its essence,
        since nothing stands as a medium between matter and form, as is proved
        in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Furthermore, the essence of the soul is not
        united to body in such a way that it follows the condition of the body
        completely, as other material forms, which are, as it were, completely
        engulfed in matter to such an extent that only material power or
        activity can proceed from them. Now, from the essence of the soul there
        proceed not only the forces and powers which are in some sense bodily,
        as the existent acts of the bodily organs, that is, the sensitive and
        vegetative powers, but also the powers of understanding, which are
        completely immaterial and not the existent acts of any body or part of a
        body, as is proved in <i>The Soul.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is clear that the powers of our understanding do not
        proceed from the essence of the soul in so far as it is united to the
        body, but, rather, in so far as it stays free of the body and is not
        entirely bound down to it. In this sense the union of the soul with the
        body does not extend to the activity of the understanding and so cannot
        interfere with its purity. Hence, if we consider what is intrinsic to
        the acts, the dissolution of the union by which the soul is united to
        the body as its form is not a necessary condition for the activity of
        the understanding, no matter how intense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like manner, there is no need for the suppression of the activities
        of the vegetative soul. For the activities of this part of the soul are
        really natural, as is clear from the fact that they are brought to full
        perfection by the power of the active and passive qualities, namely, the
        warm and the cold, the moist and the dry. For this reason they
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        obey neither reason nor will, as is clear in the <i>Ethics.</i> Thus, it
        is plain that attention is not needed for actions of this kind, and so
        it is not necessary to turn our attention from intellectual activity
        because of the acts of these qualities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like manner, the activity of the understanding has nothing to do with
        the activities of this sort, since it receives nothing from them,
        because they are not related to knowledge and because the understanding
        does not use any bodily instrument which would have to be sustained
        through the activities of the vegetative soul, as is the case with the
        organs of the sensitive powers. Thus, the purity of our understanding is
        in no wise impaired through the activities of the vegetative soul. From
        this it is clear that, if we consider merely what is intrinsic to the
        acts themselves, the activity of the vegetative and the activity of the
        intellectual soul do not hinder each other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, one of these can interfere with the other for some
        extrinsic reason; for example, in so far as the understanding receives
        something from the phantasms, which are in bodily organs, which must be
        nourished and sustained through the activity of the vegetative soul.
        Thus, because of the acts of the nutritive power variation may occur in
        the disposition of the organs, and, consequently, in the activity of the
        sensitive power from which the understanding receives
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        something. Thus, the activity of the understanding itself is hindered
        for an extrinsic reason. This is plain during sleep and after eating. On
        the other hand, also, the activity of understanding interferes with the
        activity of the vegetative soul in this way, inasmuch as the activity of
        the power of imagination is needed for the activity of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And intensity of the imagination requires the co-operation of heat and
        the [animal] spirits. Thus, the act of the nutritive power is hindered
        by the intensity of contemplation. But this plays no part in the
        contemplation by which God’s essence is seen, since such contemplation
        does not need the activity of the imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is clear that abstraction from the acts of the vegetative
        soul or any impairment of those acts is not in any way required for the
        vision of God through His essence. All that is required is abstraction
        from the acts of the sensitive powers.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although the powers of the vegetative soul are more material than the
        powers of the sensitive soul, still, along with this they are more
        remote from the understanding and so are less able to interfere with the
        intensity of the understanding or be hindered by it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. “To live” can be taken in two senses. In one, it means the very act
        of existence of that which is living, which rests on the union of the
        soul to the body as its form. In the other sense, “to live” is taken to
        mean the activity of life. Thus the Philosopher distinguishes living
        into understanding, sensing, and the other activities of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, since death is the loss of life, we must distinguish it in
        like manner. Thus, sometimes it means the loss of that union by which
        the soul is joined to the body as its form, and sometimes it means the
        loss of the vital activities. For this reason Augustine says: “One dies
        to this life to some extent whether he leaves the body entirely, or
        whether he is transported out of the senses of the body and made
        unconscious of them.”.Death is thus understood in the glosses which have
        been cited,” as is plain from the words following the quotation from the
        gloss of Gregory: “He who sees the wisdom which is God dies entirely to
        this life, so that he may not be held back by love of it.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The solution to the third difficulty is clear from what has just been
        said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Since the union by which the soul is united to the body as its form
        is stronger, it follows that it is less possible to withdraw from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The reasoning would conclude correctly if the essence of the soul
        were so united to the body that it were entirely bound down to the body.
        But we have already said that this is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although the bodily likeness which is necessary for the activity of
        the imagination and the senses is more immaterial than the body itself,
        it has a closer relation to the activity of the understanding. Thus, it
        is more able to hinder it, as we have said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7.What the Apostle says should be applied to our existence in the body
        not only by reason of the union of the soul with the body as its form,
        but also by reason of our use of the bodily senses.

        It seems that he knew whether his soul was in the body, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. He knew this better than any of those who followed, But many commonly
        agree that during the rapture Paul’s soul was united to his body as its
        form. Therefore, with much greater reason Paul knew this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the rapture Paul knew what he saw and with what vision he saw it.
        This is clear from the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:2), because
        he says: “I know a man... caught up to the third heaven.” Therefore, he
        knew what that heaven was, whether it was something corporeal or
        spiritual, and he knew whether he saw it spiritually or corporeally. But
        it follows from this that he knew whether he saw it while in the body or
        out of it. For bodily vision cannot take place except through the body,
        and the vision of understanding is always without the body. Therefore,
        he knew whether he was in the body or out of it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. As Paul himself says, he knew “a man [who was] caught up to the third
        heaven” (2 Cor. 12:2). But man means that which is made up of the union
        of the body and the soul. Therefore, he knew that the soul was united to
        the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. He himself knew that he was enraptured, as is clear from what he
        says. But dead people are not said to be enraptured. Therefore, he knew
        that he was not dead. Therefore, he knew that his soul was joined to his
        body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As Augustine says, in the rapture he saw God with that vision with
        which the saints in heaven see God. But the souls of the saints in
        heaven know whether they are in the body or out of it. Therefore, the
        Apostle also knew this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Gregory says: “What is there that they do not see who see Him who
        sees everything?” This seems to refer especially to the things which
        pertain to those who are seeing. But whether it is united to the body or
        not has very special pertinence to the soul. Therefore, the soul of Paul
        knew whether it was united to the body or not.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:2) it says: “I know a man
        in Christ above fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I know not, or
        out of the body, I know not; God knoweth.” Therefore, he did not know
        whether he was in the body or out of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are many opinions on this point. For some have understood the
        Apostle to say that what he did not know was not whether he was in the
        body or not, but whether the rapture was one of the soul and the body
        together, so that he was carried bodily to heaven, as we read in Daniel
        (14:35) that Habakkuk was transported, or whether it was a rapture of
        the soul alone, that is, in the visions of God, as is said in Ezechiel
        (40:2): “In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel.”
        And Jerome adopts this interpretation of a certain Jew when he says:
        “Finally, our Apostle, too, did not dare to assert that he was caught up
        in body, but said: “Whether in body or out of the body, I know not....”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Augustine, however, disapproves of this interpretation. For it is clear
        from the words of the Apostle that he himself knew that he was caught up
        to the third heaven. Therefore, it is clear that that heaven to which he
        was transported was truly heaven, and not some likeness of heaven.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For, if he had wanted to mean that, when he said he was caught up to
        heaven, he was transported in order to see a likeness of heaven in his
        imagination, he could have asserted in the same way that he was
        transported in the body, that is, to a likeness of this body. Thus, it
        would not have been necessary to distinguish between what he knew and
        what he did not know, since he would know both equally, that is, that he
        was in heaven and that he was transported in the body, that is, to a
        likeness of the body, as happens in dreams.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, he knew for certain that that to which he was transported was
        really heaven. Therefore, he knew whether it was a body or something
        incorporeal. For, if it was a body, he was transported to it bodily,
        but, if it was something incorporeal, he could not be transported to it
        bodily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, it remains that the Apostle did not doubt whether he was
        enraptured bodily or only spiritually, but knew that he was transported
        to that heaven only in his understanding. However, he did have doubts
        whether in that rapture his soul was in his body, or not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some others concede this, but say that, although during the rapture the
        Apostle did not know this, he did, nevertheless, know it afterwards,
        surmising it from the vision which he had had. For in the rapture his
        whole mind was given over to things divine, and he did not perceive
        whether his soul was in his body or not. But this opinion, too, is
        openly opposed to what the Apostle says. For, as he distinguishes what
        he knew and did not know, so he distinguishes the present from the past.
        And he speaks of the man enraptured, as in the past, fourteen years
        before, but he admits, as in the present, that he knows something and
        does not know something. Therefore, fourteen years after that rapture he
        still did not know whether he was in the body or not when the rapture
        took place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, others have said that he did not know either during the rapture
        or after it whether his soul was in the body to some extent and not
        completely. For they say that he knew both then and afterwards that his
        soul was united to the body as its form, but did not know whether it was
        so united to it that it could receive something from the senses. Or,
        according to others, he did not know whether the nutritive powers
        exercised their activities by means of which the soul takes care of the
        body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this, too, does not seem to fit the words of the Apostle, for he
        said with no reservations that he did not know whether he was in the
        body or out of it. Furthermore, it would not seem very much to the point
        to say that he did not know whether the soul was in the body in this way
        or that way, when these did not cut the soul off entirely from the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, we have to say that he simply did not know whether his soul
        was united to the body or not. This is the conclusion which Augustine
        reaches after a long investigation, when he says: “Perhaps, then, we
        should conclude that he was ignorant of this matter: while he was
        transported to the third heaven, was he in the body—that is, as the soul
        of one awake, or asleep, or in ecstasy and completely unconscious of the
        bodily senses, is in the body when the body is said to be alive—or did
        he leave the body completely so that the body lay dead until, the vision
        finished, the soul returned to the dead members, and he was not as one
        awaking from sleep or returning to his senses from the transport of
        ecstasy, but as one completely dead returning to life?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says: “The Apostle doubts whether he was in the body or
        out of it. Hence, if he is in doubt, which of us dares to be certain?”
        Thus, Augustine leaves the question undecided. When later writers take a
        stand on this question, they are speaking with probability rather than
        with certitude. For, since it could happen that one would be enraptured
        in the way the Apostle says he was enraptured while his soul remained
        united to the body, as is clear from what has been said, it is more
        probable that it did remain united to the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The reason given here holds against the interpretation of the words
        of the Apostle first given, in which he is considered to have doubted
        not about the state of the one enraptured, that is, whether the soul was
        united to the body, but of the manner of the rapture, namely, whether
        the rapture was bodily or only spiritual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Through synecdoche, sometimes only a part of man is called man,
        especially the soul, which is the more noble part of man. Yet this can
        also be taken to mean that the one who he says was enraptured was not a
        man during the rapture, but was a man fourteen years later, that is,
        when the Apostle said this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Granted that in that state the soul of the Apostle was separated from
        the body, that separation was not due to any natural mode of acting, but
        to the divine power which transported the soul out of the body, not to
        have it remain separated permanently, but for a time, and to this extent
        one can be said to be enraptured, although not every dead person can be
        said to be enraptured.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As Augustine says: “When the Apostle was carried out of the senses of
        the body to the third heaven and paradise, he certainly fell short of
        the full and perfect knowledge of things which the angels have, in so
        far as he did not know whether he was in the body or outside of it. And,
        so, this will not be lacking when this corruption puts on incorruption
        in the resurrection of the dead.” Thus, it is clear that his vision was
        to some extent more imperfect than the sight of the blessed, although in
        some respects it was like theirs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Paul was not transported to see God in order to have beatitude
        without qualification, but to be a witness of the beatitude of the
        saints and of the divine mysteries which were revealed to him.
        Consequently, he saw in the vision of the Word only those things the
        knowledge of which the rapture was ordained to communicate. Thus, he did
        not see everything as the blessed do, especially after the resurrection.
        For, then, as Augustine adds to the words already cited: “All things
        will be plain, and there will be no falsity nor ignorance.”
