    THE religion of Christ appears to aim chiefly it diverting the attention of
    mankind from material things, in order to concentrate their thoughts on the
    spiritual. Therefore Jesus, “the Author and finisher of our faith,” at His
    coming into this world, proposed to His faithful followers the contempt of
    earthly things. He taught this lesson both by His life and by His words.He
    taught it by His life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To quote St. Augustine (<i>De catechizandis rudibus</i>), “the Lord Jesus,
    when He became man, despised the good things of earth, in order to show that
    they are contemptible. He likewise endured all those earthly trials which He
    has commanded us to bear, so that, from the chances of this world, we may
    neither expect happiness, nor fear unhappiness. He rejected all appearance
    of noble birth; for, although at the time of his conception the virginity of
    His Mother was intact and although she remained for ever inviolate, yet was
    she espoused to a carpenter. He did not will that any should glory in the
    splendour of an earthly city; therefore was He born in Bethlehem, the least
    of the cities of Judah. He to whom all things belong, and by whom all things
    are made, became poor that so none of those who would believe in Him might
    dare to be lifted up by earthly wealth. He came to point out the way of
    humility; therefore He refused to be chosen King by men. He who gives food
    to all, Himself hungered. He by whom all manner of drink was created, was
    thirsty. He who has made Himself our road to Heaven, was weary and wayworn.
    He who set an end to our sufferings, Himself was crucified. He died, who
    raised the dead.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The same lesson He inculcated by His words. For, at the very beginning of
    His preaching, He promised to those who repented, not an earthly Kingdom,
    such as in the Old Testament they had looked for, but the Kingdom of Heaven.
    Not only did He teach His disciples that the first Beatitude consists in
    poverty of spirit, but He further pointed out that it is in this same
    poverty that all perfection consists. To the young man seeking the Kingdom
    of Heaven He said (Mt 19: 21), “If you would be perfect, go sell all that
    you have, give it to the poor, and follow Me.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    His disciples followed in this road of poverty. Owning nothing temporally,
    by spiritual virtue they possessed all things; and having only what to eat
    and what to put on, they were content. But Satan, in his jealousy of our
    salvation, has never, since the earliest ages, ceased from hindering men in
    the holy and salutary exercise of poverty. For this purpose he has made use
    of carnal men, enemies of the Cross of Christ, and savouring of the things
    of this world. St. Augustine, in his work <i>De Agone Christiano</i>, says:
    “Men and women of all ages and every rank are attracted to the beauty of
    eternal life. Some, to the neglect of their temporal interests, give
    themselves wholly to divine things. Others yield the palm to the virtue of
    those that act in this wise, and praise the deeds which they themselves lack
    courage to imitate. But some few there are who, at the sight of such deeds,
    murmur and fret in impotent rage. These can scarcely be called Catholics;
    they are rather self-seekers, trying to serve their own interests by means
    of the Church; or else they are heretics, striving to glorify themselves in
    the name of Christ.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Among this number, in former years, two men arose, in different places
    indeed, but infected by the same folly. Jovinian appeared in Rome, and
    Vigilantius in Gaul—both of which places had hitherto been free from the
    pestilence of error. Jovinian dared to set matrimony on a level with
    virginity. Vigilantius asserted that wealth was as meritorious as poverty.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    By this manifest perfidy, they stultified, as far as they were able, the
    evangelical and apostolic counsels. For, if wealth is equal to poverty, and
    matrimony to virginity, it was futile for our Lord to have given us the
    counsel to observe poverty, or for the Apostle to have recommended us to
    preserve virginity. By this argument, the great doctor St. Jerome has
    effectually refuted both the false teachers whom we have named.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But, just as one of the heads of the beast mentioned in the Apocalypse was,
    “as it were, slain to death, and his death-wound was healed,” so in Gaul
    followers of Valentian have reappeared who, by means of ingenuity and
    cunning, deter men from the observance of the counsels. Their first axiom is
    that no one ought, by entering the religious life, to undertake to practice
    the counsels, unless he is already exercised in the observance of the
    commandments. This regulation would exclude from the way of perfection all
    children, all sinners and all recent converts to the Faith.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Their next dictum is that no one should undertake the observance of the
    counsels without first seeking advice form many persons. We see at once that
    this rule would be a great obstacle in the way of those who desire to
    embrace perfection, since the advice of carnal men (who form the majority of
    mankind) tends rather to deter souls from spirituality than to draw them to
    it. Further, these followers of Vigilantius try to hinder men from laying
    themselves under an obligation to embrace religious life, though such an
    obligation strengthens the soul to embrace a life of perfection. Finally,
    they do not hesitate to take every means to diminish in men’s hearts the
    love of poverty.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    These criminal efforts are prefigured in the words of Pharaoh, who, as we
    read in Exodus (5:4), when chiding Moses and Aaron for trying to lead the
    people of God out of Egypt, said to them, “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, draw
    off the people from their work? Origen in his Gloss comments on this passage
    as follows: “Today likewise should Moses and Aaron, that is to say, a
    prophetic and priestly word, call a soul to serve God and, leaving the world
    and renouncing all possessions, to devote itself to the law of God and the
    hearing of His word, you will hear the friends of Pharaoh saying: ‘See how
    men are seduced, and young man led astray.’” Origen adds in another place:
    “These were the words of Pharaoh; and in like manner do his friends speak
    today.” Such are the maxims whereby they seek to hinder those who aim at
    perfection. But, to quote the proverb of Solomon, “There is no counsel
    against the Lord.” Trusting, therefore, in the help of spiritual arms, which
    are the power of God, we will endeavour to refute the opinions which we,
    have quoted, and to overthrow the presumption of those who exalt themselves
    against the Divine Wisdom.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    we will treat of each of the foregoing propositions in the following manner.
    First, we will state on what foundation they are based. Then we will examine
    in what particulars, and in what manner, each of the aforesaid propositions
    is repugnant to truth, which is in harmony with piety. And, thirdly, we will
    demonstrate that the arguments used in support of these propositions are
    empty and frivolous.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        THE followers of Vigilantius strive, by sundry arguments, to prove that
        none should undertake to follow the Counsels, unless they are already
        exercised in obedience to the Commandments. First, they remind us that
        Our Saviour when He gave the Counsel of poverty, told the young man that
        if he desired to enter into life, he must keep the Commandments, and
        only when the youth professed to have kept the Commandments, did Christ
        give him the Counsel concerning poverty. This shows, they say, that
        obedience to the Commandments ought to precede observance of the
        Counsels. Again they bring forward, in defence of their opinion, the
        words of Jesus Christ (Mt 28:20), “ teaching them to observe all things
        whatsoever I have commanded you.” They also quote the following
        commentary of Bede upon this Text: “The order herein commanded to be
        observed is equitable. For, first, a hearer must be taught; he must then
        be initiated into the mysteries of the Faith; and, finally, he must be
        instructed in the keeping of the Commandments.” From these words the
        conclusion is drawn that obedience to the Commandments must go before
        the praetice of the Counsels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They further allege in favour of their views the verse of Psalm 108, “By
        your commandments I have had understanding.” They cite too the words of
        the Gloss, “I do not say that I have understood your Commandments
        themselves, but that by them I have had understanding; for, by keeping
        the Comm ndments, David attained to sublime wisdom.” The verse of Ps. 30
        is also, quoted in the same sense, “As a weaned child to his mother,”
        with the following commentary upon this text, which occurs in the Gloss,
        “As in physical so also in spiritual procreation and nourishment five
        periods occur. First we are conceived in the womb; we are nourished
        therein until we see the light; we are then carried in the arms of our
        mother and suckled with her milk until, being weaned, we are seated at
        the table of our father.” The Gloss then adds: “Holy Church likewise
        observes these five periods.” For the child of the Church is, so to
        speak, conceived on the Wednesday of the fourth week [of Lent]. He is,
        by exorcism and catechism, initiated in the rudiments of the Christian
        Faith. He is nourished in the womb of the Church until, on Holy
        Saturday, he is by baptism born into spiritual light. Then, until
        Pentecost, he may be said to be carried in the arm of the Church and
        fostered at her breast; for during this season nothing laborious is
        enjoined, neither rising by night nor fasting. But after he has been
        confirmed by the Holy Spirit, the Christian is weaned, and begins to
        fast and to observe other toilsome practices. But (say the followers of
        Vigilantius) many reverse this order. Such are heretics and schismatics,
        who prematurely forsake their mother’s milk, and therefore come to
        nought. As it is more difficult to practise the Counsels than to keep
        the Commandments, it is reversing the right order of things for a man
        who is not exercised in obedience to the Commandments to undertake to
        observe the Counsels. Such an error may end in heresy or schism.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They strive, further, to strengthen this argument by the order observed
        by our Saviour in the miracles whereby He fed the multitudes. For,
        first, as we read in Mat xiv, He fed five thousand men with five loaves
        and two fishes; and then in Mat 15 we see that He fed four thousand men
        with seven loaves and seven little fish. By the five thousand men are
        meant those who, living a secular life, know how to make good use of
        material possessions; but the four thousand fed by seven loaves, signify
        those who renounce the world completely, and are nourished on
        evangelical perfection and spiritual grace. Hence we are to learn that
        men must first be sustained by obedience to the commandments, and
        afterwards led to the perfection of the Counsels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another argument, brought forward by those who follow Vigilantius, is
        contained in the words of St. Jerome on the beginning of the Gospel of
        St. Matthew. “The Holy Gospel,” he says, “is composed of four elements,
        namely, precepts, commandments, testimonies, examples. Justice appears
        in the precepts, charity in the commandments, faith in the testimonies,
        perfection in the examples.” From this passage they conclude that it is
        from the justice of the precepts that we are to attain to the perfection
        of the examples, which perfection would seem to consist in the Counsels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They further bring forward the following passage of St. Gregory (<i
          >VI Moral.</i
        >): “It was after the embrace of Lia that Jacob came to Rachel; for the
        perfect man is first engaged in the fruitfulness of active life and
        afterwards attains to the repose of contemplation:” Now the religious
        state, which professes the practice of the Counsels, belongs to the
        contemplative life. But the Commandments lead us to the active life. The
        Gloss says, concerning the passage in Matthew 12, where the Commandments
        of the Law are enumerated: “Behold the active life.” But when it
        comments on those words of our Lord in the same chapter, “If you would
        be perfect” etc., the Gloss adds: “Behold the contemplative life.”
        Therefore, it is not fitting that a man should embrace the religious
        life, unless, by keeping the Commandments, he has first been exercised
        in the active life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another argument, adduced by the disciples of Vigilantius in the defence
        of their cause, is contained in the commentary of St. Gregory on
        Ezekiel: “ No one becomes perfect at once. In true conversion a man must
        begin with the least things, in order that he may attain to great
        things.” Now the Commandments of the Decalogue would appear to be the
        lesser things, but the Counsels, which pertain to perfection, the
        greater. For St. Augustine, in his book
        <i>De sermone Domini in Monte</i>, says: “The things commanded by the
        Law are lesser; those which Christ was to command, were greater.” Let no
        man, therefore, proceed to the observance of the greater things, namely,
        the practice of the Counsels, unless he is first exercised in the
        lesser, that is to say, in keeping the Commandments. Again, St. Gregory
        says (<i>Decretis, dist. 48, cap. Sicut</i>): “While walls are still new
        and damp, we know that they cannot bear weight; and if a roof be placed
        upon them before they be dry, the whole building will fall to the
        ground.” Again, among the sayings of St. Gregory, we find the following:
        “He courts a fall who, despising steps, attempts to climb a height by a
        steep ascent.” Whence they conclude that it is dangerous for anyone to
        presume to attain to the high perfection of the counsels, unless he be
        first exercised in lesser things that is to say in the Commandments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who hold this opinion, further observe that the Commandments, even
        in the order of nature, precede the counsels, for they are more common
        and more in harmony with nature. The Commandments can be kept together
        with the Counsels, but the Counsels cannot be practised apart from the
        Commandments. Hence it cannot be well ordered to aspire to the Counsels,
        unless the observance of the Commandments has gone first. Those who are
        of this opinion further add that if it were right that the Counsels
        should take precedence over the Commandments, those who did not practise
        the Counsels could not be saved, for they would not be keeping the
        Commandments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These are the chief arguments used by those who hold that religious life
        should not be attempted by any, save those who are exercised in
        obedience to the Commandments.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        SINCE this question regards morals, our first consideration must be
        whether what has been said, is congruous with good works. We must prove,
        first of all that the doctrine of the followers of Vigilantius is
        directly opposed to such works. For there are three classes of mankind
        who have had no practice in keeping the Commandments. The first class is
        composed of children who have not had time to be exercised in keeping
        them. The second class includes recent converts to the Faith who, before
        their conversion, had no opportunity of observing the Commandments, “for
        all that is not of faith is sin” (Rom 14:23), and “without faith, it is
        impossible to please God” (Heb 11:6). The third class of men who have
        not been in the habit of keeping the Commandments are those who have led
        a sinful life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now we shall show, in the case of each of these classes, the fallacy of
        the arguments which we have undertaken to refute.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If it were necessary that the observance of the Commandments should
        precede the practice of the Counsels and the entrance into the religious
        life, it would not be right, nor would the Church suffer parents to
        place their young children in religious houses, there to be educated in
        the exercise of the Counsels before they have kept the Commandments. But
        we know that such is her custom, a usage supported by grave authority,
        and confirmed by many passages of Scripture. St. Gregory says (<i
          >XX, quaestione I, cap. Addidistis</i
        >): “Is it lawful for a father or mother who have placed an infant son
        or daughter in a monastery to be there educated in regular discipline,
        to withdraw such a child when it has attained the age of puberty, and to
        give it in marriage? This question we will not discuss.” The question as
        to how far the obligation to regular observance is perpetually binding
        is not of great importance; for, if the practice of keeping the
        Commandments were a necessary introduction to the observance of the
        Counsels, no one could be educated in the regular observance of the
        Counsels who was not exercised in obedience to the Commandments. But the
        custom of dedicating children to the religious life is proved, not
        merely by many ecclesiastical statutes, but by the examples of the
        Saints. St. Gregory relates (<i>II Dialog.</i>) that “noble and
        religious men of the City of Rome flocked to blessed Benedict, to offer
        him their children to be trained for Almighty God. Then Euticius and
        Patricius Tertullus gave him their promising sons, Maurus and Placidus,
        of whom Maurus, the younger, being distinguished by his virtues, became
        assistant to the master, while Placidus was still, in disposition, a
        child.” And, as St. Gregory narrates in the same book, Blessed Benedict
        himself, while still a child, being desirous to please none but God,
        turned his back on worldly learning and, leaving his parents’ house,
        sought the usages of holy conversation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This custom took its rise from the Apostles themselves. Dionysius, in
        the end of his book <i>Eccles. Hierarch.</i>, says, “children, brought
        up to sublime things and kept from sin and error, will acquire the habit
        of holy living. This was the opinion of our blessed masters, and it
        seemed good to them to receive children.” Dionysius, it is true, is here
        only alluding to the admission of children to Baptism, but his argument
        bears out our assertion, viz. that it is expedient to educate children
        in the principles which they are hereafter to practise, in order that
        they may acquire the habit of them. We must add, further that this rule
        is authorised by our Lord Himself. For we read in St. Matt. xix. 13,
        “Then were little children presented to Him, that He should impose hands
        upon them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said to
        them: ‘Allow the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me,
        for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.” St. Chrysostom, commenting on
        these words, says, “Who shall deserve to draw near to Christ, if
        innocent childhood is driven from Him? If these children are to be
        saints, why should they not approach their Father? If they are to be
        sinners, why should you pronounce sentence of condemnation upon them
        before their crimes are committed?” Now we know that it is by the way of
        the Counsels that man approaches most closely to Christ, for He said to
        the young man, “ Sell all that you have, give to the poor and follow me”
        (Mt 19:21). Therefore children are by no means to be hindered from
        drawing near to Him by the way of the Counsels. But, as Origen says, on
        the same passage: “Some there are who, before they have learnt the
        doctrine of justice, rebuke those who, by simple teaching, offer to
        Christ infants and children, that is to say the unlearned. Our Lord
        exhorted His disciples, who were then grown men, to condescend to the
        service of children and to be, so to speak, children with children that
        so they might gain children, for ‘of such,’ He said, ‘is the Kingdom of
        Heaven.’ And He Himself, when He was in the form of God, became a child.
        We ought to bear this in mind, lest, in our esteem for our own superior
        wisdom, we should despise the little ones of the Church, forbidding the
        children to go to Jesus.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We may remember, again, how in Luke 1:80 it is written of St. John the
        Baptist, “And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and was in
        the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.” Bede comments
        on this text in the following words: “He who was to be the preacher of
        penance passed his early years in the desert. He acted thus in order
        more easily to draw his hearers, by means of his instructions, from the
        vanities of the world. He would not, as St. Gregory of Nyssa says, allow
        himself to become accustomed to the allurements of the senses, lest he
        should be misled or perplexed in his judgment concerning the true good.
        And, because he was pure, and because, from the beginning of his life to
        the end, he offered to the divine regard desires free from every
        passion, therefore he was raised to such a height of grace that he
        received gifts surpassing those of the prophets.” Therefore, not only is
        it lawful but even most expedient in order to obtain greater grace that
        some men, leaving the world, even in their childhood, should live in the
        solitude of the religious life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We read in Lamentations 3:27, “It is good for a man, when he has borne
        the yoke from his youth.” The reason given for these words being, “he
        shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because he has taken it up upon
        himself.” By this we are given to understand that they who bear the yoke
        of religious life from their youth upwards, arise above themselves and
        are rendered more fit for religious observance, which consists in
        silence and freedom from worldly care and disturbance. In the Book of
        Proverbs 22:6 the words occur, “A young man according to his way, even
        when he is old he will not depart from it.” Hence St. Anselm in his book
        <i>De Similitudinibus</i> compares those who have been brought up in
        monasteries to angels, while those who have been converted from an
        imperfect life he likens to men. This mode of thinking is not only
        confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture, it is shared even by
        philosophers; for Aristotle in his Second Book of <i>Ethics</i> says,
        “It is by no means a matter of small moment whether from our youth we
        are accustomed to such or such a manner of life, but, on the contrary,
        it is of supreme importance that certain men should, from childhood, be
        instructed in those things which they must observe during the course of
        their life.” Again, in the Eighth book of his <i>Politics</i>, the same
        philosopher writes: “The chief concern of a legislator ought to be for
        the education of the young who should be trained in every good quality.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We see likewise how this opinion is practically borne out by society,
        for men are, from their very childhood, brought up to those professions
        and offices for which they are destined. Those who are intended for
        clerics must, from their tender years, be educated in the clerical life;
        soldiers, as Vegetius says in book <i>De re militari</i>, must, in early
        years, be subject to military discipline; and, carpenters must, from
        childhood, learn their handicraft. Why then should the only exception to
        this rule be made with regard to the religious life? Why should not the
        young be formed to it from their youth? Surely the more arduous a
        profession may be, the more necessary it is that men should be early
        trained to it. Hence we see that the argument that it is necessary to be
        practised in keeping the Commandments before we observe the Counsels,
        does not hold good with regard to children.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        VERY few words will suffice to show the absurdity of refusing the
        religious habit to recent converts on the ground that they are not
        exercised in the observance of the Commandments. The first followers of
        Christ, who formed His college, and who gave an example of perfection,
        far surpassing that of any religious order, were received by our Lord
        immediately after their conversion. St. Paul, who was the last by
        conversion, but the foremost in preaching, embraced evangelical
        perfection as soon as he was converted to the faith. This we know by his
        own words to the Galatians: “But when it pleased Him, who separated me
        from my mother’s womb, and exalted me by his grace, to reveal his Son in
        me that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not
        condescended to flesh and blood” (Gal 1:15). Christ teaches us the same
        lesson by His own example. We read in St. Matthew 4:1 that after His
        baptism, He “was led by the Spirit into the desert.” “Thus,” says the
        Gloss, “did He teach those that have been baptised to leave the world
        after their baptism to devote themselves to God in solitude.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This teaching is confirmed by the praiseworthy practice of many who,
        being once converted from unbelief, immediately assume the religious
        habit. Who would be so ill-advised as to counsel these men rather to
        stay in the world than to withdraw into the Religious life, there to
        endeavour to preserve the Baptismal Grace which they have received? What
        right-minded man would dissuade them from putting on Christ by perfect
        imitation, when by baptism they have already been clothed with Him? The
        argument that no one ought to be admitted to the religious life who has
        not kept the Commandments is thus an absurdity in the case of recent
        converts to the Faith.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        FINALLY, let us see whether penitent sinners, who are not yet exercised
        in observing the Commandments, are to be excluded from religious life.
        The example of St. Matthew is germane to our question. Our Lord called
        him from the profits of a custom collection to be His follower; and
        Matthew, although not at once admitted to the number of the Apostles,
        immediately embraced the perfection of the counsels, for, “leaving all
        things he rose up and followed him” (Luke v. 28). “He who had robbed
        others abandoned his own possessions,” says St. Ambrose. From this
        example, it is abundantly evident that penitents may, even after most
        heinous sins, enter on the observance of the Counsels. In fact, we may
        go further, and say that it is fitting that such repentant sinners
        should embrace a life of perfection; for, as St. Gregory says in his
        comment on the words of Luke iii., “Bring forth therefore fruits worthy
        of penance”: “He who has committed no unlawful act may rightfully be
        granted the enjoyment of lawful things. But he who has fallen into sin,
        ought to deprive himself of lawful goods, in proportion as he is
        conscious of having committed unlawful deeds.” Again, he says: “It is
        fitting that if a man has impoverished himself by sin, he should so much
        the more eagerly seek by penance the riches of good works.” Since then
        in the religious life men abstain even from lawful things, and seek the
        treasure of perfection, it is reasonable that they who abandon sin
        (whereby they have been exercised, not in the practice, but in the
        transgression of the Commandments) should walk in the way of the
        Counsels, by entering religion, which is the state of true penance.
        Again we find, in <i>quaest. XXXIII. cap. II. Admonere</i>, that Pope
        Stephen, addressing a certain Astulphus, who had been guilty of great
        sins, says: “May our advice be pleasing to you. Go into a monastery:
        humble yourself to the Abbot; and, helped by the prayers of many
        brethren, perform in simplicity of heart whatever may be enjoined upon
        you.” “But,” he continues: “if you prefer to remain in your house or in
        the world and there to do public penance (which will be far more onerous
        and painful for you), we will tell you how you are to act.” The Pope
        then imposes severe penances upon him, telling him at the same time that
        it would be better and more advantageous for him to go into religion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus we see that those who are practised, not in keeping the
        Commandments but in sinning against them, are advised to embrace
        religious life. Such penitent, sinners are, however, deterred from so
        doing by the admirable wisdom of certain advisers, whose counsel St.
        Paul thus refutes: “I speak a human thing because of the infirmity of
        your flesh, for, as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness
        and iniquity unto iniquity, so now yield your members to serve justice
        unto sanctification” (Rom 6:19). “I speak a human thing,” comments the
        Gloss, “because you owe more service to justice than to sin.” And Baruch
        (4:28) says, “As it was your mind to go astray from God; so, when you
        return again, you shall seek him ten times as much.” For after sinning
        and thus forsaking God and disobeying His commands, a man ought to
        strive after the highest virtue, and not be content with half measures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This teaching is borne out by the example of numerous saints. For many
        of both sexes, after leading lives of crime, have embraced the practice
        of the Counsels, and although they had formed no habit of keeping the
        Commandments, have devoted themselves to the observance of the strictest
        religious rule. Their conduct is approved even by philosophers. In the
        Second book of <i>Ethics</i> Aristotle writes: “When we withdraw from
        great sin, we shall come to the uniform line, even as they do who plane
        away the knots from wood.” For those who are knotted by sin, must be
        brought back to righteousness by practising the more perfect works of
        virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus we have made it clear that the opinion of those who maintain that
        none should practise the Counsels who have not kept the Commandments,
        cannot be approved, with regard to any class of men.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IN order to refute this error, once and for all, we must examine the
        fallacy on which it is based. Now the premises on which the followers of
        Vigilantius construct their argument are erroneous, and for this reason.
        They assume that perfection consists, chiefly, in the observance of the
        Counsels; and that the Commandments, compared to the Counsels, are as
        the imperfect compared to the perfect. Therefore, they say, we must go
        from Commandments to Counsels, as from imperfection to perfection. But
        this proposition is false. We know from the very words of our Lord (Mt
        22:37) that the first and chief commandment of the Law is the love of
        God and of our fellow-men. “The first commandment is, you shall love the
        Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with
        your whole mind. And the second is like it: you shall love your
        neighbour as yourself.” The perfection of Christian life consists
        essentially, in obeying these two precepts, Hence the Apostle says to
        the Colossians (3:14), “ But above all these things, have charity, which
        is the bond of perfection.” On this passage the Gloss observes that
        charity makes other things perfect, in so far, that is to say, as they
        are ordered in charity. For charity binds all things together. Again,
        when our Lord had been giving the precepts of brotherly love (Mt 5:48),
        He added, “Be therefore perfect as also your Heavenly Father is
        perfect.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome says, commenting on the words in St. Matthew 19:27, “Behold,
        we have left all things and have followed you”: “Whereas it does not
        suffice to have left all things, he (Peter) adds ‘and have followed
        you.’ For the Apostles followed the Lord not so much in bodily presence,
        as in affections of the heart.” Again, St. Ambrose, alluding to the
        words, “follow me” (Luke 5), says: “Christ commands him (Levi) to follow
        Him, not with his feet, but with the desires of his mind.” It is thus
        abundantly evident that the perfection of the Christian life consists in
        charity towards God. And there is a very solid reason for this
        conclusion. The perfection of anything consists, as we know, in its
        attainment of its end. Now the end of the Christian life is that
        charity, to which all things must be ordered, and which, as St. Paul
        says (1 Tim 1:5), is “the end of the commandment,” or, as the Gloss
        says, in its comment on this text, “is the perfection of the precept,
        that is to say, of all precepts, for the love of God and of our
        neighbour is the fulfilment of all.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must distinguish between an end and the means to an end. In
        considering the means to an end, we must fix some certain measure by
        which the means may be proportioned to the end. But in what regards the
        end itself, there is no question of measure, but each one prosecutes his
        end to the best of his ability. A physician tempers his remedies, lest
        they should be in excess. He has no fear of excess in the health which
        he wishes to restore by those remedies, but he desires that such health
        should be as perfect as possible. In like manner, the commandment to
        love God, which is the end of the Christian life, knows no limits. No
        one can say that this degree or that of the love of God is enjoined by
        this precept, or that where the love of God exceeds the Commandment it
        becomes a Counsel. Every man is bound to love God as much as he can.
        This truth is embodied in the very words of the precept: “Love the Lord
        your God with your whole heart.” Every one must obey this commandment
        according to his ability, some with greater and some with less
        perfection. He totally fails to observe it who does not, in his
        affections, prefer God before all things. He who loves Him as His last
        End, above all other things, fulfils the precept more or less perfectly,
        according as he is more or less impeded by his aftection for created
        things. St. Augustine says (<i>LXXXIII Quaest.</i>): “The poison of
        charity is the hope of acquiring or retaining temporal things. That is
        to say, if such things are looked on as a last end. The food of charity
        is the lessening of cupidity. Its perfection consists in the extinction
        of earthly desire.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But there is another perfect manner of observing this precept, which
        cannot be achieved in this life. For, as St. Augustine says in
        <i>De perfectione justitiae</i>, “In that fulness of charity which will
        reign it our heavenly country, the precept of charity ‘Love the Lord
        your God with your whole heart’ etc. will be perfectly obeyed.” “Why,”
        he continues, should not this perfection be anticipated by man,
        although, in this life he may not attain to it? He does not run aright,
        who does no know where he is running to. But how can he know, if he is
        not taught by any precepts Therefore, to this, as to their end, are
        directed the commandments of love of God and of our neighbour, together
        with all other counsels and commands. Hence St. Augustine says in
        <i>Ench.</i>: “God gives us certain commandments, such as: ‘Do not
        commit adultery’, while other things, such as ‘It is good for a man not
        to touch a woman,’ are not enjoined on us by precept, but set before us
        as a spiritual counsel. Such things are rightly done when they are
        referred to the love of God and to the love of our neighbour, for His
        sake.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, the manner in which the precept of Charity is to be
        fulfilled by certain precepts of the Law is different to that in which
        it is to be accomplished by the Counsels. For some things are so
        designed to a particular end that the end cannot be attained without
        them. Such is the case with food and the maintenance of life. Other
        things, again, serve to attain an end with peculiar certainty and
        completeness. Thus, though food is necessary for the continuance of
        physical life? medicine serves for the more easy and certain
        preservation of health. Now some of the commandments are given for the
        first of these two reasons, namely as a necessary means of attaining to
        charity. For instance, no one can fulfil the precept of charity who
        worships false gods, and thus withdraws from the love of God, or who
        commits murder or theft, which are contrary to the love of our
        neighbour. But the Counsels are given to us in order that we may fulfil
        the precept of charity, in the second way of which we have spoken. Hence
        the Apostle, “king of the Counsel of virginity, expressly says that its
        object is to enable us to love God. “He who is without a wife is
        solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please
        God. But he who is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the
        world, how he may please his wife” (1 Cor 7:32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, we see from St. Matthew 19 that our Lord gave the Counsel of
        poverty as a means whereby He was to be followed; and following Him, as
        we have shown, consists in charity. Now charity is lessened by cupidity,
        but cupidity and love of money is diminished, or wholly eradicated, by
        the renunciation of earthly possemons. St. Augustine, in his Epistle to
        Paulinus and Therasia, says that “our love for the goods that we have
        acquired is much stronger than our desires for those that we do not
        possess. It is one thing, indeed, to have no will to gain those things
        that are lacking to us, but quite another to divest ourselves of those
        that we already possess.” Both these Counsels are also intended to
        facilitate charity towards our neighbour. All that our Lord lays down in
        St. Matthew 5 about brotherly love ought to be the abiding disposition
        of the soul. And it is clear that His precepts on this head will be most
        easily obeyed by the man who is not hampered by self-interest. He who
        has no will to possess anything will be better prepared to part with his
        coat and his cloak, than he who desires possessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Since charity is not only the end, but also the foundation of all
        virtues and of all the precepts given us for the attainment of virtue,
        it follows that as by means of the Counsels man advances towards more
        perfect love of God and of his neighbour, so likewise the more perfect
        observance of the Counsels is furthered by obedience to those
        Commandments which are necessary to charity. He who has the intention of
        practising continence or poverty for the love of Christ is a long way
        from committing adultery or theft. The various exercises of the
        religious life, such as watching, fasting and retirement from worldly
        affairs, tend furthermore to preserve man from vice, and to facilitate
        his practice of perfect virtue. Thus the observance of the Counsels
        leads to the observance of the other Commandments. Of course, we do not
        mean that keeping the Commandments is the end proposed by those who
        practise the Counsels. No one, for instance, embraces virginity in order
        that he may abstain from adultery, or leads a life of poverty as a
        safeguard against theft; but the Counsels are practised as a means of
        advancing in the love of God and of our neighbour. For greater things
        are not made for lesser ones as their end. From all this it becomes
        clear that the Counsels pertain to perfection of life, not because
        perfection necessarily consists in their observance, but because they
        are the way or means to perfection. St. Augustine bears this out in
        <i>De moribus ecclesiae</i>, where he says of the life of religious:
        “Let all our endeavour be to restrain concupiscence, and to preserve
        brotherly love.” Again, in the same work, he writes, “Charity is there
        (in religious life) chiefly cultivated: virtue, words, manner,
        countenance, all are agreeable to charity.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, in the <i>Collatio patrum</i>, the Abbot Moses says, “For this
        (i.e. for the sake of purity of heart and charity), we do and suffer all
        things, and on this account we renounced kinsfolk, country, honours,
        riches and all manner of earthly joy. To gain these virtues we undertake
        fasting, watching, labour and nakedness, and for these we practise
        reading and all other virtues. For we desire to prepare our hearts and
        to keep them pare from defiling thoughts, and by these means to rise to
        the perfection of charity.” Hence we learn that obedience to the
        Commandments may be either perfect or imperfect, according as we
        practise a more or less perfect means of keeping them. For we may, as we
        have shown, practise by means of the Counsels perfect obedience to the
        Commandments; or we may, by living in the world without the Counsels,
        keep them imperfectly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, to teach that a man must first be exercised in keeping the
        Commandments before he passes to the Counsels, is tantamount to saying
        that he must first obey the Commandments imperfectly, rather than at
        once strive to keep them perfectly. This is, of course, an absurdity,
        whether we consider the Commandments themselves or the mode of observing
        them. For who could be so foolish as to dissuade a man from loving God
        and his neighbour perfectly by telling him first to love them
        imperfectly? Is not such a fallacy condemned by the divine precept of
        charity: “Love the Lord your God with your whole heart”? Or need we fear
        lest we should learn to love God so quickly that we shall love Him
        beyond due measure? “Bless the Lord (says Sirach xliii. 30), exalt Him
        as much so you can, for He is above all praise.” And St. Paul says, “So
        run that you may obtain” (1 Cor. ix. 24). Again, “Let us hasten,
        therefore, to enter into that rest” (Heb. iv. 11). For with whatever
        energy a man enters on the road of perfection, he will still have much
        progress to make before he arrives at final perfection in his Heavenly
        home. The argument is equally absurd if we consider the means used for
        attaining to perfection. Who would tell a man who aspired to virginity
        or continence that it would be best for him first to live chastely in
        wedlock? Or who would tell a man who wished to practise poverty first to
        live justly in the enjoyment of riches, as if wealth were a preparation
        for poverty rather than an impediment to it? The young man who did not
        accept from our Lord the Counsel of poverty (Mt 19) went away sad,
        because of his possessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We have up to now been observing the connection between the Counsels and
        the precepts of charity, but our arguments hold equally good with regard
        to the other precepts of the Law. For, if the practice of the Counsels
        and the exercises of the Religious life are a safeguard against breaking
        the Commandments, is it not clear that some men may need them in order,
        by their means, to avoid the occasions of sin? Should we advise a young
        man to live among women and bad companions, in order that by practising
        chastity in the world he might afterwards observe it in the cloister? Is
        this virtue easier in the world than in the religious life? The same
        reasoning applies to other virtues and vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who hold the opposite opinion resemble generals, who would like to
        expose their raw recruits to the heat of battle. Those who live in the
        world and keep the Commandments can make greater progress in virtue if
        they become religious. For we must remember that if, on the one hand, a
        secular life spent in obedience to the Commandments is a good
        preparation for the practice of the Counsels, yet, on the other hand, a
        life in the world presents a great obstacle to the observance of the
        Counsels. Hence St. Gregory says in the beginning of his <i>Morals</i>:
        “When my conscience was urging me to leave the world, many secular cares
        began to press upon me, as if I were to be detained in the world, not
        from love of its beauty, but by that which was more serious, viz.
        anxiety of mind. But at length, escaping eagerly from all such cares, I
        sought the monastery gate.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        THE arguments adduced in the foregoing chapters facilitate the complete
        refutation of our adversaries’ opinion. Their first contention, namely
        that our Lord gave the Counsel of poverty to one who had already
        practised the keeping of the Commandments, is pulverised by St. Jerome.
        This father, commenting on the words in St. Matthew 19, “All these
        things have I kept from my youth,” says: “This young man spoke untruly.
        For, if he had by his deeds fulfilled the command, ‘Love your neighbour
        as yourself, why should he have gone away sad when Christ said to him:
        ‘Go, sell what you have and give to the poor’?” Origen also, writing on
        the Gospel of St. Matthew, says, “ It is related in the Hebrew version
        of the Gospel that when the Lord said to him (the rich young man), ‘Go,
        sell what you have,’ the youth began to hesitate. Then Jesus said to
        him, ‘How then can you say that you have observed the Law and the
        prophets? It is written in the Law: ‘You shall love your neighbour as
        yourself’; and see how many of your brethren, the sons of Abraham, are
        clothed in dung and perish with hunger. Your house is filled with
        plenty, but none of it goes forth to your brethren.’ Then, rebuking him,
        the Lord said: ‘If you would be perfect’ etc. For it is impossible to
        fulfil the commandment to love our neighbour as ourselves if we are rich
        and abounding in possessions.” This remark refers, of course, to the
        perfect observance of the precept of charity; and there is no reason why
        the rich young man may not have kept the Commandments imperfectly, and
        thus not have spoken untruly in his answer to the Lore. This is the
        opinion of St. Chrysostom and of other writers. But the fact that Christ
        gave the Counsel of poverty to one who was, even to a certain extent,
        practised in obedience to the Commandments, is no proof that such
        obedience is a necessary preliminary, or the sole preparation, for the
        exercise of the Counsels. St. Matthew was called from habits of sin to
        the practice of the Counsels, thereby showing us that the way of
        perfection is open both to sinners and to innocent souls.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second place, our opponents say that a catechumen must be taught
        to keep the Commandments after he has received the Sacraments of the
        Church. This argument is irrelevant to the point in question; for
        instruction in the Commandments, as well as the doctrine and Sacraments
        of the Faith, is necessary for all men, whether they remain in the world
        or embrace the perfect life of religious; for these things are common to
        both classes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Their third argument, viz. that by keeping the Commandments man attains
        the fulness of wisdom, means nothing more than that obedience to the
        Commandments is rewarded by the knowledge of the things of God. Our
        opponents further quote the words given in one version of Sirach 1:26:
        “if you desire wisdom, keep the Commandments, and the Lord will give her
        to you.” This text, however, as is evident, has no bearing on the
        question.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Their fourth argument, founded on the Gloss on the verse in Psalm 130,
        “As a weaned child” etc., to which reference has already been made, we
        will carefully discuss. For, although in itself frivolous, it is
        considered by our adversaries to be very weighty. If we examine this
        passage in the Gloss, we shall see that it refers to the spiritual
        nourishment of recent converts to the Faith. It sets forth that “after
        Baptism we are instructed in good works and nourished by the milk of
        simple teaching until, being somewhat grown, we are admitted to our
        Father’s table.” This means to say that we progress from the more simple
        doctrine “The Word was made Flesh,” to the Word of the Father is in the
        beginning with God.” Now these words of the Gloss, evidently refer to
        the order to be observed in instruction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our opponents next adduce, as an argument, that the Church observes five
        seasons in the spiritual generation of her converts. They are first
        initiated, by exorcism and catechism, into the rudiments of the Faith.
        Then they are nourished in the womb of the Church until Holy Saturday
        when, by Baptism, they are born into light. After Baptism until
        Pentecost they are carried in the arms of the Church and nourished with
        her milk; for during that season neither fasting nor rising at night nor
        any other penitential practice is observed. After Pentecost, when they
        have been confirmed by the Holy Spirit, catechumens are, so to speak,
        weaned, and begin to fast and perform other laborious exercises. Now
        this example of the five seasons appears to support our adversaries’
        argument, but it is fallacious in three respects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is a difference between the case of recent converts to the Faith
        who, like babes, require to be nourished, and that of penitent sinners
        who, like sick men, need to be healed. Those newly converted to the
        Faith need not necessarily, in the beginning, have difficult tasks laid
        upon them; they may be first exercised in easier things, and then be led
        on to those that are more laborious. Such men resemble children who are
        fed first on milk, and afterwards on stronger food; and it is to those
        who the Gloss refers. But if recent converts should, of their own
        accord, stretch forth their hands to higher things, who shall dare
        withhold them? In the smile used by the Gloss, we see that just as after
        the solemn Baptism on Easter Eve, the Church, for the sake of the sick,
        grants a certain rest from laborious works, so likewise after the solemn
        Baptism which precedes Pentecost, she immediately enjoins fasting, thus
        signifying that some who have in fervour of spirit been received to
        Baptism, subject themselves at once to a stricter life. But with
        penitent sinners the case is otherwise. Severe penance is imposed on
        them at first. This, by degrees, is mitigated; for they are like sick
        persons who, in the beginning of their illness are restricted to a
        strict diet which, when convalescence has set in, is somewhat relaxed.
        Thus, the Church im poses on innocent souls, from the very beginning,
        the burden of the Commandments, which must of necessity be kept. She
        does not lay the Counsels upon them as a necessity, but she does not
        forbid them to undertake their observance, if they have the will so to
        do. Stricter obligations are, however, imposed upon penitents, according
        to the statutes of the Canons of the Early Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second fallacy into which our opponents fall, in the application of
        their argument, is that of saying that in every office or profession,
        transition is made from what is easier to what is more difficult. Now it
        is not necessary that everyone who undertakes an important post, should
        first have served in an inferior capacity. Neither is it essential that
        a man, desiring to practise a trade, should already have worked at
        another trade; but he must ascend from the less to the more difficult
        branches of the trade in which he wishes to become proficient. In like
        manner, it is not essential that they who wish to become religious
        should already have kept the Commandments in the world. What is
        necessary is that, when they enter religious life, the easier
        observances should be imposed upon them at first. Again, those who wish
        to become clerics need not first have led the life of laymen, nor need
        they who wish to live continently, have observed continence in married
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third error into which our adversaries fall, arises from the fact
        that there is a twofold difficulty in the work of practising the
        Counsels. The first difficulty arises from the greatness of the work
        itself, which, because it needs the perfection of virtue, is not imposed
        upon the imperfect. The second difficulty lies in the restraints
        imposed. And the more imperfect the persons, the more restraint they
        need. Thus children need closer watching while they are under the
        custody of their tutors, than when they have arrived at perfection, Now
        the religious life, as we have seen, is a certain course of discipline
        restraining men from sin and leading them on to perfection. Therefore,
        they who are the most imperfect, not being practised in the observance
        of the Commandments, stand in the greatest need of the safeguards of
        religious life, which render it more easy for them to abstain from sin
        than if they lived freely in the world. The words in the Gloss, “But
        many, such as heretics and schismatics, pervert this order,” are clearly
        shown, by the context, to refer to order of doctrine. For the Gloss
        continues: “This man says indeed that he has kept the Commandments, thus
        laying himself under a curse as if he were humble, not merely in other
        matters, but also in knowledge. For he says, I thought humbly, being at
        first nourished by milk, which is the ‘Word was made flesh,’ in order
        that I might grow to the Bread of Angels, that is, ‘the Word which in
        the beginning was with God.’” And thus he returns to what he said at
        first. By this passage we see that words, intended as a means, have been
        used as an example.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The next argument brought forward against us is so frivolous that it
        requires no answer. It concerns the five thousand men whom Christ fed
        with five loaves and the four thousand among whom seven loaves were
        distributed. It is not necessary that the order of things typified
        should correspond with the order of their types, for we often see that
        later things are prefigured by earlier ones, and <i>e converso</i>.
        Neither can any valid argument be drawn from symbolical things of this
        nature, as St. Augustine says in his
        <i>Epistle against the Donatists</i>. Dionysius likewise writes in his
        <i>Epistle to Titus</i> that allegorical theology is not argumentative.
        We will, notwithstanding, observe that by this order of miracles is
        typified the order of precepts and counsels, in so far as regards the
        whole human race. The Counsels were given not in the old Law but in the
        new; for, the Law brought nothing to perfection. The Gloss points this
        out by saying that the five loaves signify the legal precepts, and that
        the seven loaves are symbolical of evangelical perfection. But this is
        no reason why the same men should be exercised first in the precepts of
        the Law, and then in the Counsels in the religious life; for we do not
        read that the same individuals were first among the seven thousand, and
        that they then formed part of the four thousand who were miraculously
        fed by Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the point brought forward by our opponents, as to the four things
        of which the Gospel is composed, is not relevant to the question we are
        discussing. For the perfection proposed as an example does not refer to
        the Counsels, but to virtuous acts or the perfect way of keeping the
        Commandments as Christ kept them. Hence the Gloss goes on to quote other
        examples, e.g., “Learn of Me, for I am meek” etc., and elsewhere, “Be
        perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect.” “I have given you an
        example” etc.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must examine with greater care the seventh argument, as it is one
        that our opponents are fond of using. It concerns the order to be
        observed between the active and the contemplative life. It is perfectly
        true that the active ought to precede the contemplative life, but the
        meaning of the active life is not always understood. It is sometimes
        thought that the active life consists merely in the management of
        temporal affairs; and therefore, as religious possess nothing, either
        individually or in common, they are believed to be incapable of sharing
        in the active life. St. Gregory, in the second part of
        <i>the second homily on Ezekiel</i>, points out that this view is a
        mistaken one. “The active life,” he says, “consists in giving bread the
        hungry, instructing the ignorant, correcting those who err, recalling
        the proud to humility, caring for the sick, distributing to each one
        what is needful to him, and in seeing how each one may be maintained by
        those things that an entrusted to us.” Thus we see that the active life
        regards not merely temporal matters, but also the guidance and
        correction of others in spiritual concerns, and that for such duties
        those men are the best fitted who own no worldly possessions.
        Consequently, when our Lord appointed the Apostles to be the teachers of
        the whole earth, He stripped them of their property (Matt. 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We may further enquire whether the exercise of the moral virtues
        pertains to the active life. Aristotle (<i>X Ethic.</i>) answers this
        question in the affirmative, and adds that the intellectual virtues
        belong to the contemplative life. St. Augustine confirms this opinion in
        <i>XII De Trinit.</i>, where he ascribes the inferior reason, which is
        exercised about temporal matters concerning either ourselves or others,
        to action, and the superior reason, which is occupied with eternal
        interests, to contemplation. In accordance with this view, it is quite
        reasonable to hold that the active must precede the contemplative life.
        For, unless a man has, by the exercise of the moral virtues, freed his
        soul from passion (which it is the business of the active life to do),
        he will not be fit for the contemplation of divine truth. “Blessed are
        the clean of heart,” says Christ, “for they shall see God” (Mt 5:8).
        They shall see Him here by imperfect contemplation, and hereafter by
        what is perfect. Thus the exercise of the active life pertains not only
        to laymen, but to religious also.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Three reasons go to prove that this is the case. First, because by the
        exercise of the moral virtues the passions are restrained. Secondly,
        because religious can show mercy to others by teaching and correcting,
        or by visiting the sick and comforting the sorrowful, be they seculars
        or religious of their own monastery. Thus they can verify the words of
        St. James (1:27), “Religion clean and undefiled before God and the
        Father is this: to visit the fatherless and the widow in their
        tribulation, and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world.” The
        third reason why religious share with seculars in the active life is
        because, at their entry into religion, they distributed their worldly
        possessions to the poor. It is not, therefore, because the precepts
        belong only to the active life that the Gloss says that the Commandments
        are the duty of the active, and the Counsels of the contemplative life.
        St. Gregory writes: “To live a contemplative life is to bear in mind
        with all diligence, charity to God and to our neighbour, which are the
        great precepts of the Law. The Counsels dispose the soul more
        particularly to the contemplative life. For without them, the mere
        observance of the Precepts will not suffice for contemplation, which
        requires greater perfection.” No one need remain in the world for the
        sake of leading an active life; for in religion he can have quite as
        much exercise in the active life as is necessary to dispose him for the
        contemplative.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The eighth argument, viz. that “no one arrives at once at the highest
        point,” is not much to the purpose, although great stress is laid upon
        it. For we may consider the highest and the lowest either as referring
        to the same condition and to the same man, or to different conditions
        and different men. If we consider these degrees as referring to the same
        condition and the same man, it is quite evident that no one arrives at
        once at the highest point; for every virtuous man is, during the whole
        course of his life, making progress towards perfection. But if these
        degrees are considered with regard to different conditions, there is no
        reason why a man should not fill the highest post without having served
        in an inferior capacity. It is not necessary for a cleric to have lived
        as a layman; for some men are admitted in their boyhood into the ranks
        of the clergy. Neither is the saying that no one reaches the highest
        point at once true, if we consider it as referring to different people;
        for one man may start from a degree of holiness far higher than that to
        which another will attain throughout the whole course of his life. St.
        Gregory says (<i>Dialog. 11</i>): “in order that all his contemporaries
        and all succeeding generations might know to what a height of perfection
        the child Benedict had arrived, when he received the grace of
        conversion.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The ninth argument, viz. that “damp walls cannot bear a roof,” and the
        tenth that “he courts a fall who tries to climb a steep ascent without
        steps,” are both irrelevant to our subject. The authorities from whom
        these passages are drawn use these examples in speaking of the dignity
        of the episcopal state, which requires mature virtue and is, therefore,
        not to be conferred on those who are imperfect. But the Counsels are
        aids to perfection and safeguards from sin. Hence we may speak of them
        as serving to dry the moisture from newly erected walls, and as sure
        steps whereby the summit of perfection may be reached.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The eleventh argument used against us deals with the natural priority of
        the Commandments to the Counsels. Reference to what we have already said
        will show how much weight such an argument carries. If we speak of the
        final precepts, viz. the love of God and of our neighbour, it is clear
        that the Counsels are directed towards these precepts as to their end.
        The relation between the Counsels and these precepts is that which
        exists between things ordained for a certain end, and the end for which
        they are ordained. Now an end is the first thing, if we consider it with
        reference to the intention; but it is the last if we consider it with
        regard to the prosecution or consummation. If then the Counsels were so
        ordained with reference to the Commandments that unless the Counsels
        were practised the Commandments could not be observed, it would follow
        that man is bound to observe the Counsels before loving God or his
        neighbour. Such, of course, is not the case. But if the relations
        between the Counsels and the Precepts be in such wise that by means of
        the Counsels, the Precepts can be more easily and more perfectly kept,
        it follows that by means of the Counsels we can attain to the perfect
        love of God and of our neighbour. Hence we see that, although in
        intention this precept precedes the counsels, yet in prosecution the
        counsels precede this precept.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If we consider the relations between the Counsels and the other Precepts
        which are given as means to the love of God and our neighbour, we shall
        see that these relations are of a twofold nature. For, as the Counsels
        cannot be observed without the Precepts, and as the Precepts are kept by
        many without the Counsels, the Counsels can be compared to the Precepts
        if they be considered generally. Thus the relations between the Counsels
        and the Precepts would be that of particular to general. The particular
        will precede the general, not necessarily in order of time, but in order
        of nature. Therefore it is not essential to be exercised in obedience to
        the Precepts before passing to the observance of the Counsels. But
        another relation may be observed between the Counsels and the Precepts,
        which can be observed without the counsels. In this relation the
        counsels may be compared to the precepts as a perfect to an imperfect
        species, e.g. as a rational to an irrational animal. In this relation,
        the Counsels precede the precepts in the order of nature, for in every
        genus the perfect is naturally first. As Boethius says, “nature begins
        from the perfect.” It does not matter that in this relation the precepts
        precede the counsels in point of time, for a thing of an imperfect
        species may, in point of time, be prior to the thing of a perfect
        species to which it passes. What is essential is that an imperfect thing
        should pass to a perfect one of its own species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The last argument, viz. that there can be no salvation without the
        Counsels if the Counsels precede the Precepts, is manifestly based on a
        misunderstanding of what I have been saying. For we do not affirm that
        the Counsels are so related to the Precepts that the latter cannot be
        kept without the former. What we assert is that by means of the Counsels
        the Precepts can be more perfectly obeyed.

          >Arguments Used to Prove That Before Entering Religious Life A Man
          Ought to Deliberate for A Long Time, and Take Counsel of Many</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will proceed to consider whether it is necessary for one who desires
        to become a religious to take the advice of many counsellors. It is
        urged that advice should be sought from many persons before taking a
        difficult step affecting one’s whole life; and, as nothing can be
        conceived more difficult than to renounce oneself, leave the world, and
        spend one’s whole life in religion, it must be necessary to take much
        advice and to spend a long time in reflection. This argument is based on
        the definition of a vow. A vow is said to be the promise of a better
        good, made with grave deliberation. The stringency of the vow depends
        upon the deliberation. No vow is so binding as the religious vows, which
        nothing can annul. Therefore, the religious vows require the gravest
        deliberation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who hold this opinion seek to confirm it by these words, “Do not
        believe every spirit, but try the spirits to see whether they are of
        God” (1 John 4:1). This text applies to entrance into religion. St.
        Benedict, in his Rule, and Pope Innocent, in his Decretal, quote it in
        this sense. But the “ trying,” of which St. John speaks, requires
        careful examination, and this examination (they conclude) is best made
        in consultation with many. Therefore, he who desires to enter religion
        should take counsel of many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who think thus, further add that counsel is most needed before
        taking a step wherein there is the greatest danger of being deceived.
        There is great danger of deception on entering religious life, since
        “Satan transforms himself into an angel of light” (2 Cor. ix. 14) and,
        under an appearance of good, misleads the unwary. Therefore it is only
        after grave deliberation that a man should enter on the religious life.
        Again, it is alleged that peculiarly diligent examination is required
        before undertaking anything that may come to a bad end. Now as we see in
        the case of apostates and despairing souls, entrance into religious life
        has often ended badly. Consequently, this step requires grave
        consideration. A last argument remains, and it is considered a very
        weighty one. In the Acts of the Apostles (v. 39) the following words
        occur: “If this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought,”
        Now the counsel of entering religion has often come to nought by
        apostasy. Therefore, it was not from God. Hence much deliberation with
        many people is necessary before taking such a step.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These are the chief arguments, adduced by those who impress upon
        candidates for religious life the necessity for grave deliberation with
        many counsellors, in the hope that some obstacle may be placed in their
        way by one or other of their numerous advisers.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IN order to demonstrate the fallacy of the foregoing arguments, we will
        first consider the case of St. Peter and St. Andrew, who, as soon as our
        Lord called them, “leaving their nets, followed him” (Matt. 4). St.
        Chrysostom pronounces the following eulogium of them: “They were in the
        midst of their business; but, at His bidding, they made no delay, they
        did not return home saying: ‘let us consult our friends, but, leaving
        all things, they followed, Him, as Elisha followed Elijah. A similar
        unhesitating and instant obedience does Christ require of us.” Then, we
        have the example of St. James and St. John who, being called by God,
        immediately left their nets and their father and followed Him. St.
        Hilary, in his Commentary on St. Matthew’s Gospel, says: “ we are taught
        by their example in abandoning their trade and their father’s house, to
        follow Jesus and to be withheld neither by worldly anxieties nor by the
        ties of domestic life.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, we read of St. Matthew (Mt 9) that, at the call of the Lord he
        “arose and followed Him.” St. Chrysostom comments: “See the obedience of
        this man thus called. He neither refuses to obey, nor begs that he may
        go home to acquaint his kinsfolk of his departure.” And Remigius also
        observes of St. Matthew that he made no account of the dangers which he
        might incur from the anger of the magistrates, when he left their
        business unfinished. Thus, it becomes plain that nothing human ought to
        deter us from the service of God. We read in the Gospel of St. Matthew
        (8:21), and again in that of Luke (9:59) that “one of His disciples said
        to Him: ‘Lord, let me first go and bury my father.’ But Jesus said to
        him: ‘Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.’” St. Chrysostom,
        writing on these words, says: “Christ spoke thus, not as contemning the
        love which we owe to our parents, but to show us that nothing ought to
        seem more necessary to us than the affairs of the Kingdom of Heaven. He
        would teach us that with our whole heart, we ought to attach ourselves
        to them, letting nothing, however important or attractive, to be an
        obstacle in our way. What would seem more necessary than to bury one’s
        father? What more easy? It would not have taken much time. But the devil
        is always on the alert to find some unguarded door, and if he perceive a
        slight negligence, he will cause it to become great cowardice. Therefore
        the wise man says: Defer not, from day to day. By these words he warns
        us not to waste a moment of time and, although numberless affairs may be
        pressing upon us, to prefer spiritual interests to all other things,
        even to such as are necessary.” St. Augustine says in
        <i>De verbis Domini</i>: “Your father is to be honoured, yes, but God
        must be obeyed. Christ says, ‘I call you to preach the Gospel. You are
        necessary to me for my task. My work is greater than is that which you
        desire to perform. There are others who can bury the dead. The first
        thing must not give place to the last. Love your parents, but prefer God
        to them.’” If then our Lord refused to grant His disciple a short time
        in which to perform so necessary a duty, how great is the presumption of
        those who teach that lengthy deliberation is necessary before embracing
        the Counsels?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Luke (9:61) tells us that “ another said: I will follow you, Lord, but
        let me first take my leave of those who are at my house.” St. Cyril, the
        great Greek doctor, comments: “This man’s promise is admirable and
        worthy of imitation. But by his desire of going to take leave of those
        who were in his house, he showed that he was somewhat wavering in his
        attachment to the Lord, although in his mind he had determined to follow
        him. The fact of his wishing to take counsel of his kinsfolk, who would
        not approve of his intention, shows that he was somewhat unstable; and
        therefore Christ rebuked him saying: ‘No man putting his hand to the
        plough and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.’ He had put his
        hand to the plough by his eagerness to follow our Lord, but he looked
        back, seeking an occasion of delay by visiting his home and conversing
        with his kinsmen. Not thus did the holy Apostles act, who at once left
        their boats and their father, and followed Christ. Neither did St. Paul
        condescend to flesh and blood. Such ought to be the conduct of those who
        desire to follow our Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine, in <i>De verbis Domini</i>, has this passage: “The Orient
        calls you; will you wait for the West?” Now by the <i>Orient</i> is
        meant Christ, as we know from the words in Zach. 6:12: “Behold a man,
        the Orient is his name.” By the <i>West</i> is signified man declining
        to the grave and liable to fall into the darkness of sin and ignorance.
        He, therefore, does an injury to Christ, in whom are contained all the
        treasures and the wisdom of God” (Col 2:3), who, having heard His call,
        thinks it necessary to take counsel with mortal man. Our opponents try
        to evade this argument by an equivocation. They say that the passages
        quoted by us only refer to the audible call of the Lord, and, of course,
        in that case no delay must be made nor human counsel asked. But if a man
        is interiorly called to enter religion, he needs long deliberation and
        many advisers, in order to find out whether his vocation is from God.
        This is begging the question; for we are to take the words of Christ,
        written in Scripture, as coming from His own mouth. For He Himself says:
        “What I say to you, I say unto all, Watch” (Mark 13:37). And in the
        Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans 15:4, we find “For whatever was
        written, was written for our instruction.” As St. Chrysostom says: “If
        these things had only been said for them, they would not have been
        written, but they were said for them, and written for us.” And St. Paul
        brings forward the authority of the Old Testament in his Epistle to the
        Hebrews (xii. 5), “And you have forgotten the consolation which speaks
        to you as children: My son, do not neglect the discipline of the Lord.”
        From which it is clear that the words of Holy Scripture were spoken not
        only to those who heard them, but to future generations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We, will especially examine whether the counsel given by Christ to the
        young man (Matt. 19:21): “If you would be perfect, go, sell all that you
        have, and give to the poor” was addressed to that youth only, or to all
        men. We can best consider this passage by referring to its context,
        where Peter says: “See, we have left all things and have followed You.”
        And our Lord promises the reward to all men saying, “Everyone who has
        left house or brethren etc. for my name’s sake... shall receive a
        hundredfold and shall possess life everlasting.” Thus we see that this
        counsel is no less to be followed by all men than if it had been given
        to each individually. Hence St. Jerome, writing to the presbyter
        Paulinus, says: “You have heard our Saviour’s words: ‘If you would be
        perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and come, follow
        me.’ Put these words then into practice. Strip yourself of all, and
        thus, following the Cross of poverty, you will more speedily and more
        easily ascend Jacob’s ladder.” And, although our Lord addressed the
        counsel of poverty individually to the rich young man, He nevertheless
        gave the same advice to all mankind (Mt 16:24): “If anyone will come
        after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.”
        St. Chrysostom, commenting on this text, says, “He addresses this
        teaching to the whole world, saying, ‘If anyone’—be it man or woman,
        king, free man, or serf.” Now self-denial, according to St. Basil, means
        complete forgetfulness of past things and the abnegation of our own
        will. In it, therefore, is included the disposal of the property which
        we possess of our own will. Therefore the counsel given to the young man
        is to be understood as given to all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But another point remains to be considered. We have already said that
        the words of our Lord quoted in Holy Scripture, carry the same weight as
        if spoken by His own lips. But there is another way whereby God speaks
        interiorly to men, viz. the way alluded to in Ps. 84:9: “I will hear
        what the Lord God will speak in me.” Now this interior voice is to be
        preferred to any external speech. St. Gregory says (<i
          >Homil. Pentecostes</i
        >), “The Creator does not speak to the understanding of a man, unless He
        speak to that same man by the unction of the Holy Spirit. Before Cain
        slew his brother he heard a voice saying, “You have sinned; stop.” But
        as, on account of his sin, he was admonished by a voice alone, and not
        by the unction of the Spirit, he was indeed able to hear the word of
        God, but refused to obey it.” If then we are bound to obey immediately
        the audible voice of our Creator, how much more ought we not,
        unhesitatingly and unresistingly, to obey the interior whisper, whereby
        the Holy Spirit changes the heart of man. Hence, in Is 50:5, it is said
        by the mouth of the Prophet, or rather of Christ Himself: “The Lord God
        has opened my ear (i.e. by interior inspiration), and I do not resist. I
        have not gone back.” “Forgetting the things that are behind, and
        stretching forth myself to those that are before,” as we read in the
        Epistle to the Philippians (3:13). St. Paul, again, says (Rom 8:14),
        “Whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.” The
        Gloss of St. Augustine has the following comment: “Such men do not
        perform anything, but act under the impulse of grace.” But he who
        resists or hesitates, does not act by the impulse of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is then the distinguishing mark of the Sons of to be carried forward
        by grace to better things, without waiting for counsel. This impulse of
        grace is alluded to in the Prophet Isaiah (59:59), “When he comes as a
        violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord drives on.” St. Paul
        teaches us that this impulse of grace is to be obeyed: “Walk in the
        Spirit” (Gal 5:16), and again (5:25), “If you are led by the Spirit, you
        are not under the law.” St. Stephen thus reproached certain men, “You
        always resist the Holy Spirit (Acts 7:51). St. Paul says (1 Thes 5:19),
        “Do not extinguish the Spirit.” On which words, the Gloss comments: “If
        the Holy Spirit should at any time reveal something to a certain man, do
        not forbid him to make known what he has heard.” Now, the Holy Spirit
        gives His revelations not only by teaching man what he ought to speak,
        but by suggesting to him what he ought to do (John 14). When, therefore,
        a man is inspired by this Holy Spirit to enter religious life, it is his
        duty to follow the inspiration at once, without waiting to take counsel
        of human advisers. This is shown us by the words of the Prophet Ezekiel
        (1:20), “Wherever the spirit went, they went, and the wheels rose along
        with them.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We have further authority for our teaching, not merely in passages of
        Scripture, but in the examples of the Saints. St. Augustine, in the
        Eighth Book of his Confessions, tells us of two soldiers, one of whom,
        having read the life of St. Anthony, was so filled with Divine love,
        that he said to his, comrade: “I have determined to serve God, I begin
        at this hour and in this spot. If it is irksome for you to imitate me,
        at least do not withstand me.” But his comrade answered that he would
        stand by him in a combat which would bring so great reward.” Thus (O
        Lord) did both these servants of yours build up a tower at a befitting
        cost, by leaving all things and following you.” In the same book, St.
        Augustine reproaches himself with having delayed his conversion: “When I
        was convinced of the truth, I could not reply except in slow and drowsy
        words: ‘I am coming now; let me be a while longer.’ But my promised time
        had no limit, and my ‘little while’ was long protracted.” Again in the
        same book he says, “I was filled with shame for listening to the babble
        of worldly and carnal concerns, and hung wavering.” Thus, we see that,
        far from being praiseworthy, it is most reprehensible to hesitate or
        take counsel, as if we were in doubt, when we have heard an interior or
        exterior call, be it some word or some passage in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Interior inspiration has efficacy to enable those to whom it is given to
        accomplish great deeds. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when
        the disciples were gathered together, the Holy Spirit came upon them and
        made them speak of the wonders of God. The Gloss says on this passage:
        “The grace of the Holy Spirit of God knows no obstacles.” Again, the
        Book of Sirach (11:23) has these words: “It is easy in the eyes of God
        suddenly to make a poor man rich.” St. Augustine speaks of the efficacy
        of internal inspiration in his book
        <i>De praedestinatione Sanctorum</i>. He quotes the words recorded in
        St. John (6), “Everyone who has heard of the Father and has learned,
        comes to Me.” On these words he says, “This school where the Father is
        heard and teaches, in order that men may come to the Son, is far removed
        from the senses; for in it we hear not with ears of flesh, but with the
        hearing of the heart.” Again he says: “The grace which, by the Divine
        munificence, is secretly bestowed is not rejected by any hard heart; for
        it is given in order that hardness may be entirely taken away.” St.
        Gregory, in his <i>Homilia Pentecostes</i>, treats of the efficacy of
        interior inspiration: “Oh, how cunning a workman is this Spirit. He
        makes no delay in teaching what He wishes. As soon as He touches the
        heart, He teaches it. His touch is teaching. He changes the human mind
        as soon as He enlightens it; and the man taught by Him at once forsakes
        what he was, in order to show what he was not.” He who hesitates to obey
        the impulse of the Holy Spirit for the sake of taking counsel either
        knows not this impulse, or else resists it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Philosophers, no less than sacred writers, condemn the error of acting
        thus. Aristotle, in a chapter of the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> on good
        fortune, says, “If we seek to know what is the principle of movement in
        the soul corresponding to God in the universe, we shall see that reason
        cannot be the principle of reason; that principle must be something
        better. But what, save God, can be better than knowledge and
        understanding?” He continues, in another place: “Those who are moved by
        God do not need to be counselled; for they have a principle surpassing
        counsel and understanding.” Shame then on him who, calling himself a
        Catholic, would send men inspired by God, to take advice of human
        counsellors, of whom even a heathen philosopher tells us they have no
        need.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, let us further examine for what cause, those called by God to
        religious life can require counsel. First, it is sacrilegious to doubt
        whether the life counselled by Christ is the most perfect. Again, none
        but a soul enslaved by human love would hesitate as to whether it is
        right to abandon the intention of entering religious life for fear of
        grieving friends or incurring temporal loss. St. Jerome writes in his
        epistle to Heliodorus: “Even should your infant son hang round your
        neck, or your mother, with unkempt hair and dishevelled dress, show you
        the breasts that suckled you, or your father cast himself along your
        threshold, pass on. Shed no tear; tread your father underfoot and hasten
        to the standard of the Cross. In this case, cruelty is the only piety.”
        Elsewhere he adds, “My enemy, with drawn sword, is about to slay me, and
        shall I think of my mother’s tears? Shall I forsake the combat for love
        of my father, when I ought not to leave Christ even to bury my parents?
        In several places he writes in the same strain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But perhaps some may think it necessary to take counsel, lest they
        should not be able to fulfil what is implied in entering religious life.
        The same doubt occurred to St. Augustine, as he tells us in the Eighth
        Book of his Confessions. He feared to undertake to observe the counsel
        of continence; and, speaking of himself, he uses these words: “On the
        side to which I turned my face, and where I feared to go, I saw the
        chaste dignity of continence. She was serene and cheerful, without
        wantonness. She beckoned me to approach her fearlessly, holding out to
        embrace me and uphold me, her gentle hands full of numberless good
        examples. With her were many youths and maidens, staid widows and
        venerable virgins.” He adds later on: “And she smiled at me, mocking, as
        if to say, ‘What these have done, can you not likewise do? Have these
        acted by their own might, and not by the power of their God? The Lord
        their God has given me to them. Why then do you stand on your own,
        without a foothold? Cast yourself on Him. Fear not. He will not draw
        away to let you fall. Cast yourself on Him with confidence. He will
        receive you and heal you.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are, nevertheless, two points on which those may take counsel who
        have the intention of entering religious life. Of these, one is the mode
        of becoming a religious; and the other is the existence of any obstacle
        to religious life, such as matrimony or the state of slavery. But advice
        should not be sought from kinsfolk. The book of Proverbs (25:9) says
        indeed, “Treat your cause with your friend, and discover not the secret
        to a stranger.” But, in the matter of entering religion, relations are
        not friends, but rather enemies. “A man’s enemies are those of his own
        household,” says Micah (7:6), and our Lord quotes his words (Mt 10:36).
        Therefore, with regard to this matter, the advice of our kinsmen is to
        be particularly avoided.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome, in his epistle to Heliodorus, thus enumerates the obstacles
        which family ties may raise to entrance into religious life. “Your
        widowed sister will encircle you with her arms. The domestic slaves,
        among whom you grew up, will cry to you, ‘To whose service do you leave
        us?’ The aged nurse and the foster-father, who in fondness has been a
        second father to you, after your own, will call out: ‘Stay a little; we
        shall soon be dead; wait and bury us.’” St. Gregory likewise says (<i
          >III Moral.</i
        >): “Our crafty enemy, seeing himself banished from the hearts of good
        men, seeks out those by whom they are loved. He speaks by means of their
        caressing words, knowing that they are more loved than others. He hopes
        that as the violence of love overcomes their heart, he may easily
        destroy the fortifications of their virtue by means of the sword of
        persuasion.” For this reason it was that the Blessed Benedict, as St.
        Gregory tells us (<i>II Dialog.</i>), secretly fled from his nurse, and
        sought retirement in a desert place, but opened his mind to the monk
        Romanus, who kept his secret, and gave him assistance. Carnal men, to
        whom the wisdom of God is folly, are therefore not to be consulted. The
        following advice is given us in the Book of Sirach (37:12), “Do not
        consult a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust
        man concerning justice.” The same inspired writer adds: “Give no heed to
        these in any matter of counsel. But be continually with a holy man,”
        from whom. counsel may be sought if any should be needed.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IT is easy to answer the objections which may be raised against our
        arguments. It is true, in the first place that advice should be sought
        in difficult and serious undertakings, when the way is not clear. When,
        however, the right path has been shown us by some higher counsellor, it
        is unwise to open the question again and to seek further advice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second argument adduced, that a vow is confirmed by the deliberation
        of the mind, is irrelevant to the matter in hand. For the deliberation
        spoken of consists in that choice, whereby a man elects the greater good
        to which he intends to devote himself. Now all that is done from choice,
        is done by deliberation or counsel; for choice is the desire for a thing
        commended to us, as Aristotle says (<i>III Ethic.</i>). The same Holy
        Spirit who is the spirit of strength and piety, and who moves men to a
        determination of embracing the religious life, is likewise the spirit of
        counsel and of knowledge, and directs their interior deliberation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third objection brought against us is equally irrelevant. “Try the
        spirits whether they be of God,” (1 John 4:1) we are told. But probation
        is only necessary where certainty does not exist. The Gloss comments on
        the words of St. John, which we have quoted: “Things that are certain
        need no discussion.” Nevertheless, those whose duty it is to admit
        others into religious life may be uncertain of the motive which may lead
        a candidate to present himself. For he may be inspired by desire for
        spiritual perfection; or he may be influenced by curiosity, or by a wish
        to do some harm. Again, uncertainty may exist as to the fitness of
        postulants for religious life. Therefore, the Church ordains, and
        religious rules require, that candidates should pass through a period of
        probation. But the postulants themselves cannot be in doubt as to the
        motive which leads them to seek the religious habit. Therefore, they do
        not need deliberation, especially if they are not doubtful about their
        health, which the year of probation is intended to put to a test.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The statement that “Satan transforms himself into an angel of light” and
        inspires good desires with the intention of deceiving us, is very true.
        But, as the Gloss says, when the devil deceives the bodily senses, he
        does not withdraw the mind from a praiseworthy and holy intention; for
        whoever leads a faithful life is in no danger. Even should Satan,
        pretending to be good, do or say things befitting the holy angels, and
        should he delude a man into believing him, the error would not be
        dangerous or harmful. But, when, by means of his pretence of good, he
        begins to draw men away to his own work, they need the greatest
        watchfulness, lest they should be led astray by him. Granted, then that
        the devil instigates someone to enter religious life, this undertaking
        is a good one, worthy of the holy angels, and a man who consents to it
        will run no risk. But he must be on his guard to resist temptations to
        pride or other vices. God makes use of the malice of the devil for the
        profit of the just, for whom, if they overcome, He prepares crowns; and
        thus the evil spirits are duped by the saints. But it must be understood
        that a suggestion to enter religious life proceeding either from man or
        from Satan has no efficacy, unless it be accompanied by the interior
        attraction of God. St. Augustine in his book
        <i>De praedestinatione Sanctorum</i> says “that all the saints are
        taught by God, not because all come to Christ, but because no one comes
        to him by any other means. Thus the desire to enter religion, from
        whomever such a suggestion may proceed, comes from God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fifth argument, namely that advice is needed before going into
        religion, because the undertaking may end badly, needs some
        discrimination. The bad end of any undertaking may be the fault either
        of the enterprise itself, or of him who makes the attempt. If the
        undertaking itself is dangerous and frequently productive of ill
        effects, great deliberation would be needed before attempting it; or it
        might be better to abandon it entirely. But if danger from the
        enterprise accrue but to very few, much deliberation would not be
        required about the step itself. Great care and vigilance, however, would
        be necessary on the part of him who undertakes it, lest he should by any
        chance fall into danger. Otherwise he would make his enterprise a
        pretext for neglecting all human efforts. This is enforced by the words
        of Sirach (11:4). “He who observes the wind shall not sow; and he who
        considers the clouds shall never reap,” and those other words of
        Proverbs (26:13), “The slothful man says, ‘There is a lion in the way
        and a lioness on the roads.’” On this text the Gloss observes: “There
        are many who, when hey hear words of exhortation, say that they would
        never want to enter the way of justice, but are held back by Satan from
        making progress.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It sometimes happens, however, that an undertaking, certainly good in
        itself, may come to an unfortunate termination. This failure is due to
        instability of purpose on the part of the person engaged in the affair.
        But the fact that some men who have become religious have changed for
        the worse, and have apostatised is no reason for delaying to enter
        religious life, on the plea of requiring longer deliberation. The same
        pretext might be used as an excuse for not embracing the Faith or
        approaching the Sacraments, for as we are told by St. Peter (2 Pet 2:
        21), “It would have been better for them not to have known the way of
        justice, than after they had known it to turn back.” St. Paul also says
        (Heb. 10:29), “He deserves worse punishments who has esteemed the blood
        of the Testament unclean, and has offered an affront to the spirit of
        grace.” Neither would he return to works of justice, since we find it
        written (Sirach 26:27[19]), “He who passes over from justice to sin, God
        has prepared him for the sword.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The sixth argument used against our proposition is one that must be
        carefully examined, both on account of the frequency with which it is
        adduced, and on account of the heresy which lurks under its cover. We
        are told that “a work that is of God cannot come to nought.” Two
        heresies have sprung up in our time through misunderstanding these
        words. The first error is that since the body becomes corrupted, it
        cannot be the work of God. The second is that any grace or charity
        received from God cannot be lost. We might as well say that because
        Satan sinned, he was not created by God; or that because Judas fell away
        from the Apostolic College, his calling was not from God; or that
        because Simon Magus lapsed into heresy after Baptism, it was not the
        will of God that Philip should have baptised him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We may add one other argument, as weighty as the preceding, which is
        commonly used by our adversaries: If a man, they say, goes into religion
        and leaves his monastery, his vocation was not from God, nor did the
        advice given him by his counsellors proceed from Heaven. In refutation
        of this opinion, we may quote the words wherewith St. Augustine (<i
          >I Contra Julianum</i
        >) replies to those who held that no root of evil can exist in that
        which is the gift of God. St. Augustine argues: “ Manicheus will
        conquer, unless both he and you be resisted. Therefore, the truth of the
        Catholic Faith overcomes Manicheus, because it overcomes you.” In order,
        then that our opponents may be worsted, together with the Manicheans,
        let us say that the counsel of God is never brought to nought. To quote
        the words of Isaiah (46:10): “My counsel shall stand, and all my will
        shall be done.” Now in God’s unchangeable counsel, He sometimes, as St.
        Augustine says, in <i>De Perseverantia</i>, gives temporal justice to
        those to whom He does not give the gift of perseverance; just as He
        gives temporal existence to corruptible things, on which He does not
        bestow eternal life. And thus the Manicheans are answered. For
        corruptible things are created by the immutable counsel of God, in order
        that they may enjoy temporal existence. Our opponents are likewise
        silenced, since, in the eternal wisdom of God, He gives the resolution
        of entering the religious life to those on whom He does not bestow the
        grace of perseverance.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE must next examine the views held by those who endeavour to prevent
        men from binding themselves by vow to become religious. Some there are
        who seek to detract from the merit of any vows, contending that it is
        better to perform good works without being bound by any obligation. They
        support their opinion by the following words of Prosper (<i
          >II De vita contemplativa</i
        >): “We ought to fast and abstain, not as being bound thereto by
        necessity, lest, if we do these works unwillingly, we should be acting
        not through devotion, but from constraint.” Now he who makes a vow to
        fast, subjects himself to the necessity of fasting; and this is the case
        with all other good works. Therefore, it would not seem expedient to
        make a vow to fast, or to enter religion, or to perform any other pious
        action. Those who hold this view maintain, likewise that a good work
        loses in merit in proportion to the necessity for its performance. Now
        as a man who has vowed to enter religion, or to perform any other
        virtuous action, is bound to fulfil what he has promised to God, it is
        better and more praiseworthy if he executes such a good work without the
        obligation of a vow, rather than do it because he had taken a vow. Those
        who argue thus, endeavour likewise, in an especial manner, to prove that
        people should not be persuaded to enter religion on account of the
        obligation laid upon them by any vow or oath.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They support their opinion by the statute of the Council of Toledo,
        where (<i>Dist. XLV, cap. De Judaeis</i>) we find hese words: “Not
        unwilling, but willing souls, will be saved. For justice must be
        preserved intact. Man, of his own choice, obeyed the will of the serpent
        and perished. Therefore, each man must be saved by the response of his
        own soul in believing, when the grace of God calls him to do so.
        Therefore men are to be converted, not by force, but by their own free
        will and choice. Now these words apply far more forcibly to entrance
        into religious life, which is less necessary to salvation than is faith
        in the Christian religion. But those who enter religion on account of a
        vow or an oath do so not freely, but under constraint. Therefore such an
        obligation is not to be commended. The decree of Pope Urban (<i
          >XIX, quaest. II, cap. Duae sunt</i
        >) is considered au argument in support of this opinion. The Pope says
        that they who enter religious life are led by a private law, which is
        the law of the Holy Spirit. “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
        liberty” (2 Cor. 3:17). Now necessity, which constrains men by the
        obligation of a vow or oath, is opposed to liberty. Therefore, it is not
        seemly that men should be obliged to embrace religious life, on account
        of any oath or vow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another argument is drawn from the fall of those, who, having entered
        religion under the constraint of some obligation, have not persevered
        therein, but have returned to the world and abandoned themselves, in
        despair, to vice of every kind. In them is fulfilled what our Lord said
        to the Pharisees (Mt 23:15): “You go round about the sea and the land to
        make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him the child of hell
        twofold more than yourselves.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further maintained that some men who were under vow to go into
        religion, have not fulfilled their obligation, and have nevertheless
        become good bishops er archdeacons. Had they kept their vow, these good
        results would not have been obtained. It is also urged that men must not
        be persuaded to embrace the religious state for the sake of any temporal
        advantages, such as gifts. The decree of Pope Boniface (<i
          >I, quest. II, cap. Quam pio</i
        >) is quoted in confirmation of this proposition, for the Pope says:
        “Nowhere do we read that the disciples of the Lord or their followers
        were converted to the worship of God by gifts.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further alleged that it leads men into unfaithfulness to be bound,
        while still inexperienced, to the laborious obligations of religious
        life, such as the long morning office, trying vigils, fasts and
        disciplines. They are led like cattle to the slaughterhouse; and, as
        they do not fulfil what they have vowed to perform, these religious
        exercises are for them snares which entangle them in eternal death. Such
        obligations, it is urged, are unlawful, as being contrary to the statute
        of Innocent IV, which provides a year of probation for candidates to
        religious life, and forbids anyone to be bound before the age of
        fourteen years. This decree is in harmony with the rule of St. Benedict,
        which also, appoints a year of probation for those who enter the order.
        It is declared, furthermore, to be peculiarly unlawful for youths under
        the age of puberty to be bound to go into religion, for how can a youth
        accept obligations which may lawfully be made void by another? If any
        youths of tender years have bound themselves to become religious, they
        may be withheld from so doing by their parents or guardians. This is
        laid down in <i>XX quaest. 2</i>, where it is declared that “if a
        maiden, under the age of twelve years has taken the veil, her
        engagements may be annulled at the will of her parents or guardians.”
        Thus it is unlawful to bind, either by oath or vow, children under the
        age of puberty to the religious life.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further laid down that none, under this age, can be bound to
        religious life, even though he or she should be capable of fraud. St.
        Bernard, in the preparation of regulars and of those who embrace the
        religious state, comments on the decree <i>Postulasti</i> of Pope
        Innocent III: “If you desire to know what to expect of them when they
        are under the age of thirteen or fourteen years, you may be in doubt,
        for they are capable of craft, and may make up in cunning what they lack
        in age.” This has been proved in marriage, as we see in
        <i>Extra de Despon. impub. cap. A nobis</i>, and <i>cap. Tuae</i>, and,
        as they have been able to bind themselves to the devil, they may also be
        able to bind themselves to God. But the Pope replies that children under
        fourteen may, after they have been received, serve in the Church, but
        they may not be bound under obligations. He who is capable of fraud, the
        Pope continues in his reply to Hugh, is bound to good, and if he has
        become a monk he is under the obligations of the monastic life, since he
        was able to bind himself to the devil. Innocent III was of the same
        opinion, for in this same decretal he replies that entrance into
        religious life is a solemn engagement, “if age is supplied by malice.”
        This is also laid down in the old decretal, but it is of small import in
        our days.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These who argue against the propriety of persons being under an
        obligation to go into religion, quote the <i>Summae</i> of Raymund and
        Goffin. They also maintain (<i>XXII, Quaest. V, cap. Pueri</i> and cap.
        <i>Honestum</i>) that children under fourteen years of age oughtnot to
        be bound by oath; neither, by the same reasoning, can they be bound by
        vow to enter religious life. They say further that, as the word religion
        signifies either re-binding or re-electing, according to St. Augustine
        (<i>X</i> <i>De Civit. Dei</i>), therefore children, who are not bound
        and have made no choice, cannot be re-bound, nor can they repeat their
        choice. From an these arguments they conclude that children who embrace,
        or are constrained to embrace religious life, are much to be pitied for
        their folly.

          Meritorious Than Those Performed Without Any Such Obligation</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IN order that the truth may be made manifest with regard to each of the
        premises contained in the last chapter, we will investigate them one by
        one, beginning with those that concern common things, and proceeding to
        those who are more spiritual. We will first, examine whether it be true
        that good works, done under vow, are less meritorious than those
        performed without such obligation. And, although a great deal has been
        said on this subject in our little book on Perfection, we will
        nevertheless not hesitate to go over the ground again.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must first remember that although the praiseworthiness of an action
        depends radically on the will, the work itself becomes outwardly more
        praiseworthy in proportion to the excellence of the will. Now one
        condition of a good will is that it be firm and stable. Proverbs (13: 4)
        reproaches the slothful in these words: “The sluggard wills and wills
        not.” Therefore an exterior work becomes praiseworthy and meritorious,
        in proportion to the stability of the will in good. Hence St. Paul,
        writing to the Corinthians (1 Cor 15:58), says: “Be steadfast and
        immoveable.” And Aristotle teaches that for the perfection of virtue,
        stability and constancy in operation are necessary. Lawyers also define
        justice as firmness and steadfastness of will. On the other hand, we
        know that the heinousness of sin depends upon the obstinacy in evil
        shown by the sinner. In fact, this obstinacy is itself called a sin
        against the Holy Spirit. Now it is clear that the will to do anything is
        strengthened by an oath. “ I have sworn,” says the Psalmist, “and am
        determined to keep the judgments of your Justice” (Ps 118:106). The will
        is likewise confirmed by a vow, since a vow is a promise, and he who
        promises to do a thing strengthens his determination to do it.
        Therefore, as we see in our experience of human life, a virtuous action
        is more meritorious and more praiseworthy, if it is performed when the
        will is strengthened by a vow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        So inconstant is the human will that it has become customary not to
        believe what men say they will do for one another, unless they confirm
        their words by promise, and further ratify those promises by lawful
        safeguards. Now we owe more to ourselves, especially in the affairs of
        our spiritual wellbeing, than we owe to other people. This we are taught
        by the words of Sirach 30:24 [23], “Have pity on your own soul, pleasing
        God.” Now by reason of the inconstancy of his will, a man may neglect to
        perform something that he intended for the temporal advantage of his
        neighbour; he therefore provides against this possible omission by
        confirming his promise by some oath or pledge. How much more fittingly
        then may he not bind, himself by oath or vow to carry out some good
        resolution which he has made? Hence St. Augustine says, in his epistle
        to Paulina and Armentarius, “Having made a vow, you have bound yourself,
        and cannot act otherwise.” And he further adds: “Never regret your vow,
        but rather rejoice that it is now no longer lawful for you to do what,
        to your detriment, you were able to do before.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further to be remembered that a work of lesser intrinsic worth is
        rendered more meritorious, if it is inspired by some motive of superior
        virtue. Thus, abstinence is more meritorious if it is practised from
        charity, and the merit is further increased if the motive be
        <i>latria</i>, which is of greater value than abstinence. Now a vow is
        an act of <i>latria</i>. It is a promise made to God, concerning those
        things which relate to His worship. Hence Isaiah says (19:21), “The
        Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall worship Him with
        sacrifices and offerings, and they shall make vows to the Lord, and
        perform them.” Thus we see that fasting will be more meritorious and
        more praiseworthy, if it is performed under vow. A counsel or command
        concerning this matter is given us in the words of Ps 75:12: “Vow, and
        pay to the Lord your God!” This command or exhortation would be futile,
        were not a good work done under vow more meritorious than one done
        without such an obligation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These facts being premised, we must now consider whether it be
        justifiable or not for a man to bind himself to enter the religious
        life. If it be true that it is a virtuous action to embrace the
        religious state, and that virtuous actions become more meritorious if
        they be done in fulffiment of a vow, those men must be acting in a
        praiseworthy manner when, being unable to become religious at once, bind
        themselves by vow to do so at a future time. This argument must be
        patent to all. save to those who, with Vigilantius, hold that the
        secular state is equal in merit to the religious life, or who have the
        still grosser folly to outdo the heresy of Vigilantius by presuming to
        assert that the religious state, which enjoys the approbation of the
        Church, is not a state of salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This audacious teaching does not only stultify the counsels of Christ,
        but is distinctly schismatical, as it contravenes the ordinances of the
        Church. But if, on the contrary, those who oblige themselves by vow to
        embrace the religious life, are inspired to do so by the Spirit of God
        and act in a praiseworthy manner, they also are to be commended who,
        working together with the Holy Spirit, endeavour by their exterior
        ministry to persuade their neighbours to do what the Spirit of God
        interiorly moves them to do. For, as St. Paul says (1 Cor 3:9), “We are
        God’s coadjutors,” that is, by our external ministry.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The foregoing remarks only apply to adults. We must now consider the
        question as to whether children, be they boys or girls, may lawfully
        bind themselves by vow to become religious. A distinction must be made
        between two kinds of vows: simple vows, and solemn vows. A simple vow
        consists in a mere promise. A solemn vow is a promise accompanied by
        some exterior manifestation, whereby a man actually offers himself to
        God. Thus the reception of Holy Order, the profession of a definite
        religious life made in the hands of a prelate, or the reception of the
        habit of professed religious, which is considered equivalent to
        religious profession, all solemnize a vow. Simple and solemn vows have
        different effects upon matrimony. A solemn vow is an obstacle to
        marriage, and annuls a contract of marriage already made. A simple vow
        does not annul a marriage, but is an impediment in the way of any
        contract of marriage after the vow is made.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Simple and solemn vows have, likewise different effects upon religious
        life. A solemn vow, made either by explicit or implicit profession,
        causes a man to become a monk or a brother in some religious order. A
        simple vow does not make a him a monk, for it leaves him with the
        ownership of his property, and does not annul his marriage, should he
        marry after taking such a vow. Now as a simple vow consists solely in a
        promise made to God, proceeding from the interior deliberation of the
        mind, such a vow possesses an efficacy of which no human law can deprive
        it. There are, nevertheless, two conditions under which a simple vow may
        be invalidated. First, if such due deliberation as would ratify a
        promise, have been wanting; thus a vow taken by a mad or delirious man
        would not be binding, as is laid down in
        <i>extra de regul. et transeuntibus ad relig. Sicut tenor</i>. Neither
        would any obligation attach to the vow of a child as yet incapable of
        fraud, or who had not attained to the use of reason, which in children
        is developed at such different ages that no certain rule can be laid
        down coacerning it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The other condition which would invalidate a simple vow is, in the event
        of a person vowing something to which he has not the power to give.
        Thus, if a slave makes a vow to go into religion, he (supposing him to
        have attained the use of reason) would be certainly bound to keep his
        vow, if his master permitted him to do so. But if his master would not
        ratify the vow, the slave could, without sin, revoke it. This is
        laid,down in the <i>Decreta, dist. 44, Si servus</i>, where it is said
        that “if a slave have, unknown to his master, been ordained, the master
        is entitled within a year of the ordination to prove that the slave is
        his property and to take him back.” And since a boy or girl is, during
        childhood, in the power of the father, the father may, if he so will,
        acknowledge the vow made by a child as an effect of divine inspiration.
        We read in the Book of Numbers (30:4), “If a woman vows anything, and
        binds herself by an oath, being in her father’s house, and but yet a
        girl in age: if her father knew the vow that she has promised, and the
        oath wherewith she has bound her soul, and held his peace, she shall be
        bound by the vow: whatsoever she promised and swore, she shall fulfil in
        deed. But if her father, as soon as he heard it, overruled it, both her
        vows and her oaths shall be void; neither shall she be bound to what she
        promised, because her father has overruled it.” From this passage it
        appears that boys or girls, under the age of puberty, are bound, as far
        as in them lies, to keep vows that they have made, unless their reason
        is defective. Nevertheless, as they are under the authority of their
        father, he can annul their vows. This is also made clear by the context
        of the passage in Numbers, which we have quoted, which speaks of the
        right of a husband to annul a vow made by his wife.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We cannot positively determine the age at which individuals reach the
        use of reason; but the period at which the subjection of one person to
        another ceases, can be distinctly defined. This time is for a girl the
        age of twelve years: for a boy the age of fourteen. This age is
        generally reckoned the time of puberty, as we see in
        <i>XX quaest. 2, cap. Puella, cap. Si in qualibet</i>. Thus with regard
        to a simple vow to enter religion, a person may be bound, in so far as
        it depends upon himself, by such a vow even before he has arrived at the
        age of puberty, provided that he is capable of fraud, and has attained
        the use of reason, so that he understands what he is doing. But this vow
        may be revoked by a father or a guardian who holds the place of a
        father. A solemn vow, on the other hand, made either explicitly or
        implicitly, requires certain exterior rites ordained by the Church. The
        Church exacts that both for the reception of Holy Orders, and for the
        making of a solemn vow, the candidate must have attained the age of
        puberty, which for a boy is fourteen years and for a girl twelve.
        Therefore a profession made by anyone under this age, even though the
        person is capable of fraud, does not render him a monk or brother of any
        religious order. This is the commonly accepted teaching of the Church,
        though Innocent III is said to have spoken otherwise.

          >Refutation of the Arguments Adduced in the Last Chapter</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        OUR last chapter consisted in an exposition of the arguments brought
        forward to prove that a vow did not add to the merit of a good work. Our
        present task is to answer these arguments. This we can easily do.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The words of Prosper, “We ought to fast, not out of necessity,” refer to
        a forced fast, in contradistinction to a voluntary one. This is proved
        by the context, “lest we should, by not fasting voluntarily, show
        ourselves unwilling rather than devout.” These words do not refer to the
        necessity imposed by a vow, for by a vow devotion, is increased. This
        appears from the very etymology of the word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second argument, viz. that which is done out of necessity is less
        meritorious than that which is done freely, must be understood of the
        necessity imposed on a man against his own will. But when a man lays
        upon himself the necessity of doing good, his action is thereby rendered
        more praiseworthy, since he who performs it is “a servant of justice,”
        which St. Paul exhorts us all to become (Rom 6:18). Hence St. Augustine,
        in his epistle to Paulina and Armentarius, exclaims, “Blessed necessity
        which constrains us to better things.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third argument, which refers to the conversion of the Jews of their
        own free will, does not appear relevant to our subject. For the will may
        be confirmed in good without any violation of its liberty; otherwise
        neither God nor the blessed in Heaven would enjoy free will. But
        coercion, proceeding either from violence or fear, is repugnant to
        liberty. Therefore, the Canon <i>De Judaeis</i> expressly condemns it,
        saying, “The holy Synod henceforth forbids violence to be used towards
        anyone to make them believe.” But neither a vow nor an oath do violence
        to a man; they merely serve to confirm his will in good. Therefore,
        neither a vow nor an oath render a man unwilling, but rather cause him
        to will more strongly, and to begin, in so far as may lie in his power,
        to execute what he has bound himself to. No one in his senses will say
        that it is unlawful to persuade Jews to bind themselves by vow or oath
        to be baptized.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fourth contention of our opponents is that sometimes those who have
        bound themselves by oath or vow to go into religion lapse, and falling
        into despair, abandon themselves to all manner of iniquity; and thus
        they become the children of hell, twofold more than they who led them to
        become religious. This objection is answered by St. Paul, “Shall their
        unbelief make the faith of God without effect?” (Rom 3:3). From which
        words we are to conclude that the fact that some men abuse grace is not
        detrimental to the perseverance of others in good. The Gloss says on
        this passage that the refusal of certain Jews to believe in no wise
        hinders others of their nation from accepting what God has promised to
        His faithful. In the same way, the fact that certain men, after taking a
        vow or an oath to embrace the religious life, change their minds and
        become worse than they were before, is no hindrance to others who,
        having taken a vow, persevere in its accomplishment. Therefore, they who
        persuade men to make a vow to become religious do not, so far as they
        are concerned, make them children of hell, but rather children of the
        Kingdom; since the number of those who persevere is greater than that of
        those who fall away.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is nevertheless possible (though God forbid it!) that they may, as
        appears by the exposition of St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, by their bad
        example lead those whom they influence into sin. Our argument seems to
        be supported by the words of St. Paul (1 Tim 5:11), “But the younger
        widows avoid,” an exhortation for which he gives the following reason:
        “Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith,”
        whereby, that is, they pledged themselves before God to continence. But,
        as St. Jerome says in his epistle <i>De monogamia ad Agerunchiam</i>, on
        account of those who have committed fornication against Christ their
        Spouse, the Apostle desires them to marry again, preferring a second
        marriage to fomication. For it is much better to be a wife for a second
        time, than to have commerce with a debauchee or with many adulterers.
        But St. Paul does not, on this account, forbid young widows to make a
        simple vow of continency—In fact, he rather commends such a practice,
        saying, “it is good for them if they so continue,” i.e. in their
        widowhood (1 Cor 7:8)—but he forbids widows who are living in wantonness
        to be assisted by the alms of the Church. “But the younger widow avoid,
        for when they have grown wanton in Christ they will marry” (1 Tim 5:11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As for the sixth argument, namely that some men who have made vows to go
        into religion have, nevertheless, remained in the world and beeome good
        bishops, it is patently contrary to fact. In the decree of Innocent,
        which treats of vows and their accomplishmeuts, we find the following
        passage, “You state in your letters to us that you made a solemn vow in
        the church of Grenoble to assume the religious habit, and that you
        further promised, in the hands of the Bishop of the same church, to
        fulfil this vow within the period of two months on your return from the
        Apostolic See. Nevertheless, heedless that the time for accomplishing
        your promise has expired, although unfaithful to a vow, you have been
        called to the government of the Church of Geneva. We counsel you then
        that if you desire to give peace to your conscience, you should renounce
        the see, and shouldest pay to the Most High your vows.” Hence it is
        plain that a man who has vowed to go into religion cannot, with a good
        conscience, retain a bishopric or an archdeaconate; and should he retain
        it, he would not be a good bishop or archdeacon, but a traitor to his
        vow.
      </p>

        The next contention, viz. that men should not be bribed to enter
        religion, is answered by the very chapter quoted in support of it. For
        it declares that “unless someone has the intention of feeding the poor,
        no one of any profession whatsoever is to be refused maintenance.” Hence
        it appears that the practice of burses for poor scholars, and of
        supporting them during their studies in order that they may be more fit
        to enter religion, is by no means to be condemned. Neither is it
        unlawful to bestow some material benefit upon a man, in order that he
        may be encouraged, by such a favour, to do better; but it would be
        unlawful to enter into a compact or agreement with him. Hence in the
        same chapter, it is laid down that all compacts and agreements must be
        avoided. Were it unlawful to encourage persons to spiritual good by
        means of material assistance, the custom, prevalent in certain churches,
        of giving a largesse to those who assist at the divine office, would be
        unjustifiable.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The eighth argument, viz. that it leads to unfaithfulness to persuade
        young persons to adopt such painful practices as fasting, watching, and
        the like, contains a fallacy which may easily be detected. For those who
        are received to the religious life, or who are bound by vow to enter it,
        are, from the very outset, shown its hardships. It does not lead men to
        unfaithfulness if, in order to persuade them to embrace a life whose
        sufferings are manifest, we, after the example of Christ, hold out to
        them the prospect of spiritual consolations. “Take my yoke upon you,”
        said our Lord, “and learn of Me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and
        you shall find rest for your soul” (Mt 11:29). In these words, physical
        labour is symbolised by the “yoke,” and spiritual consolation by the
        “rest” promised to those that bear it. Hence St. Augustine, in
        <i>De verbis Domini</i>, says, “They who bravely submit to the yoke of
        the Lord, undergo such dangers and difficulties that they appear to be
        called, not from labour to rest, but from rest to labour. But the Holy
        Spirit who is with them by the abundance of heavenly delights and the
        hope of future blessedness, sweetens all present bitterness and lightens
        all present loads.” Therefore, they who judge that men deceive
        themselves by undertaking hardships for Christ’s sake, merely show that
        they have had no experience of heavenly delights.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The ninth argument is quite irrelevant to the matter in hand. The
        statute of Pope Innocent, which is quoted, refers to solemn vows made at
        professions, not to simple vows whereby people bind themselves out of
        devotion to go intoreligion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The tenth objection, viz,that parents can annul the vows of children not
        yet arrived at the age of puberty, carries no weight. For the fact that
        an engagement may be broken does not make such an engagement sinful. It
        would be equally reasonable to say that whatever minors, that is persons
        under twenty-five years of age, may do to the detriment of their own
        interest is unlawful, because anything that they lose can be completely
        restored to them. Hence children commit no sin by taking a vow to go
        into religion, or by assuming the religious habit without their parents’
        permission, even though such vows can be annulled. Were they to commit
        sin by taking such vows, the fact would be noted by the Canons, which
        grant faculties to parents to dissolve the vows of children.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The eleventh argument, which rests upon quotations from the decretals
        <i>de apparatu</i>, and from the <i>Summae</i> of the jurists Raymund
        and Goffin, does not bear upon our point. The passages quoted refer to
        the solemn vow which makes a person a religious or a professed member of
        some order. Doctors of Canon law held different opinions about their
        vow, although it would seem inconsistent and ridiculous for professors
        of sacred learning to quote as authorities the little glosses of
        jurists, or to make them a basis of argument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The twelfth objection, that which concerns oaths, is likewise
        irrelevant, for the Canons do not forbid children to take oaths; they
        only prohibit their being obliged to do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fallacy contained in the thirteenth argument is easily detected.
        Children are bound by that profession of Christian faith which they have
        chosen in the Sacrament of Baptism. Therefore, they may be bound anew,
        and can make a further choice of the state of perfection. This, however,
        is not a very correct way of speaking, since in Baptism children receive
        the Christian religion and are bound again to God, making afresh their
        choice of Him from whom the sin of our first parents had separated them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Finally, the profane conclusion whereby these objeetions end, and which
        accuses children of folly, is an affront to pious ears. Who would
        presume to blame the holy child St. Benedict because, in his desire to
        please God alone, he left his father’s house, and sought for holy
        conversation and a solitary dwelling? Who but a heretic would blaspheme
        against St. John the Baptist, of whom we are told (Luke 1:80) that “the
        child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the desert
        until the day of his manifestation to Israel”? Such presumptuous words
        show that they who speak them are carnal men, who reckon as folly what
        is of the spirit of God. St. Ambrose says, in his commentary on the
        Gospel of Luke, “The Holy Spirit is not limited to age, nor extinguished
        by death, nor shut out by the womb.” St. Gregory, in his
        <i>Homilia Pentecostes</i>, likewise says, “He fills the harp-playing
        youth, and makes of him a Psalmist; He fills the herdsman who was
        uprooting a fig tree, and makes of him a Prophet: He fills the
        abstemious youth, and makes of him a venerable judge: He fills the
        fisherman, and makes of him a preacher: He fills the persecutor, and
        makes of him a teacher of the nations; He fills the publican, and makes
        of him an Evangelist.” I will further quote the words of St. Paul (1 Cor
        3:18), “If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him
        become a fool that he may become wise.” For he who is a fool in the
        wisdom of this world (which is folly in the sight of God) is no fool in
        the wisdom of God. The book of Proverbs (1:22), speaking to children,
        says, “O children, how long will you love childishness? Give heed to my
        reproof. I will utter my words [Vul: spirit] to you.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE must now examine how the adversaries of the religious life seek to
        withhold men from embracing it by decrying the perfection of this state,
        and especially the perfection of those religious whose possessions are
        not in common. In order to uphold their opinion they quote the following
        words from Prosper in his book, <i>De vita contemplativa</i> (<i
          >XII. quaest. I</i
        >), “We should possess the goods of the Church and, for the love of
        poverty, spurn our own possessions. The property of the Church is not
        private, but common. Therefore, anyone who has relinquished or sold his
        own belongings despises private property; but, when he is set over a
        Church, he becomes the administrator of all the possessions of that
        Church. St. Paulinus, as is well known, sold his large property and gave
        the effects to the poor; but, when he became Bishop, far from despising
        the possessions of his Church, he administered them with the utmost
        fidelity. This fact is sufficient evidence that we ought to relinquish
        our private belongings, on account of the imperfection attaching to
        them, but that it is quite possible (without any detriment to poverty),
        to possess ecclesiastical property, which is common.” Hence, our
        adversaries draw the conclusion that it is imperfect not to hold common
        property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They maintain their opinion by quoting the example of several Saints.
        Thus Gregory, with his money, built one monastery within the walls of
        Rome and six in Sicily. St. Benedict, that perfect guide of religious,
        accepted large donations for his monastery; and many other men, who have
        been zealous for evangelical perfection, have acted like manner. These
        great men, who were zealous seekers after evangelical perfection, would
        certainly not have pursued such a course, had the possession of goods in
        common been in any degree inconsistent with Apostolic and Evangelical
        perfection. Our opponents draw from this argument the further conclusion
        that those who possess nothing are not, therefore, the most perfect; and
        they add that the Apostles, whom our Lord commanded to possess nothing
        and to take nothing with them on their way, did nevertheless hold
        certain possessions in time of necessity. Hence, commenting on the words
        of Luke, “But now, he who has a purse let him take it, and likewise a
        bag,” the Gloss says that “now, when the hour of death was at hand, and
        the whole nation were in pursuit of the shepherd and the flock, Christ
        gave a rule befitting the occasion, allowing them to take what was
        necessary for the support of life.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is also argued that Christ Himself instituted the order of His
        disciples, whose successors, the bishops, and clerics, have property.
        Religious orders, on the other hand, whose members live in poverty
        without possessions, were formed by men. Now what Christ has instituted
        must be most perfect. Therefore it is more perfect to hold goods in
        common than to live without property. Our opponents likewise (incredible
        though it may appear) contend that the perfection taught by Christ has
        been in abeyance from the Apostolic times until now; and that it is in
        our days that certain orders have begun to live without possessing
        anything in common. The conclusion drawn from this proposition is that
        the absence of common property does not pertain to Evangelical
        perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another argument, brought forward by the enemies of the religious life,
        is that those who, after the time of the Apostles, held no goods in
        common, lived as did the Fathers of the desert, by the work of their
        hands. Therefore, they say, those who neither possess common property,
        nor live by their manual labour do not practise Evangelical perfection.
        They likewise hold that the counsel of renouncing wealth was given as a
        means whereby to free our minds from worldly care, as we learn from Luke
        12:22, “Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat,” and from
        St. Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians (7:32), “But I would have
        you be without solicitude.” Now they who have not sufficient property to
        provide them with the necessities of life are more disturbed by anxiety
        than those who hold certain possessions in common. Therefore the absence
        of common property is an obstacle to Evangelical perfection. It is
        further maintained that religious who possess nothing are compelled to
        busy themselves in the affairs of those who supply their necessities,
        and that this solicitude about temporal matters militates against
        Evangelical perfection. Therefore they who possess nothing are beset by
        impediments in the way of perfection. Finally, the adversaries of
        religious poverty say that it is impossible for anyone to possess
        nothing in common; for all must have food and clothing, which they could
        not obtain if they had no property. These are the arguments brought
        against the perfection of those who own no common property.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE must remember that the enemies of poverty impugn, not only the
        teaching, but the life of our Lord. Christ has taught us both by word
        and example to observe poverty in all things. St. Paul tells us (2 Cor
        8:9), “that being rich, He became poor for our sakes.” The Gloss,
        commenting on these words, says that “He took poverty upon Himself,
        although He did not lose His riches. Interiorly He was rich, exteriorly
        He was poor. He concealed the treasure of His Godhead, and revealed the
        poverty of His Manhood.” Hence those who follow Christ in poverty
        acquire great dignity, as we shall presently show. “Therefore (the Gloss
        concludes) let no one despise Him who, though poor in His dwelling, was
        rich in conscience. If we consider His life, from His first entry into
        the world, we shall see that He chose a poor maiden for His Mother, and
        willed to be needy and in want, and to have for His birthplace the
        poorest of poor cities. The stable is a monument of His poverty, as we
        are reminded in a certain address delivered at one of the synods of the
        Council of Ephesus.” “See (we quote part of this address) the most
        humble dwelling of Him who enriches Heaven. A crib suffices Him who sits
        above the Cherubim; and He who has joined the sea to the dry land is
        Himself swathed in swaddling bands. Mark His poverty here below;
        consider the abundance of His riches above.” But if Christ, as St. Paul
        says, had not become poor for our sakes, not for His own, could He not
        have chosen a wealthy mother and might He not have been born in His own
        house? If the abnegation of earthly possessions is of no account in
        Christian perfection, why should our Lord have deprived Himself even of
        a home? Therefore, let the enemies of poverty blush and be silent, while
        the glory of this virtue radiates from the crib of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, lest we may imagine that in his more mature years our Lord
        abandoned the povert y which He bore in childhood, let us consider His
        own words. “The Son of man,” He said, “has nowhere to lay His head (Mt
        8:20). St. Jerome makes the following comment on this text: “Christ
        spoke thus, as if to say, ‘Why should you desire to follow me for the
        sake of gaining worldly pomp and riches, since my poverty is so extreme
        that I have no dwelling of mine own, and since the roof under which I
        sleep belongs not to me?” And St. Chrysostom, writing on the same
        subject, says, “Observe how our Lord exemplifies in His deeds the
        poverty which He taught by His words. He had neither table nor lantern
        nor house nor any such thing,” And this poverty which He preached both
        by word and deed belongs to perfection. Thus we see that the entire
        abnegation of all earthly possessions forms part of the perfection of
        the Christian life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We find a further proof of the poverty practised by our Lord in the
        words which He spoke to St. Peter concerning the tribute money, “Go to
        the sea, and cast in a hook: and the fish which shall first come up,
        take; and when you open its mouth you shall find a coin; take it and
        give it to them for me and for you” (Mt 17:26). In his exposition of
        this text, St. Jerome says: “These words, understood simply, edify the
        hearer, showing as they do that the Lord was so poor that He had not
        nothing with which to pay tribute for Himself and His Apostle.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, someone may object, how then could Judas carry money in his purse?
        We answer that our Lord considered it criminal to use the money intended
        for the poor for His own purposes and that, in this, He has left us an
        example. But it is clear, and cannot be called in question by any
        Christian, that Christ practised the most sublime perfection in the
        tenor of His life, and therefore He taught the perfection of poverty.
        “If you would be perfect, go, sell all that you have and give to the
        poor, and come, follow me.” These words, according to St. Jerome,
        contain the highest rule of perfection. Therefore it is the perfection
        of poverty for men, after the example of Christ, to be destitute of all
        possessions and only to reserve something for the poor, especially for
        those dependent upon them, Thus our Lord took care of His disciples who
        had made themselves poor for His sake, reserving for their sustenance
        something from the things which were given Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But among all that Christ did and suffered during His mortal life, the
        example of His most holy Cross is, above all other things, proposed to
        Christians for their imitation. He Himself says, “If anyone would come
        after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” (Mt
        16:24). St. Paul also, speaking as though crucified with Christ, and
        exulting only in His Cross, says (Gal 6:17), “I bear the marks of the
        Lord Jesus in my body,” being a diligent follower of the example of the
        Cross. Now among all that is conspicuous in the Cross, poverty is
        everywhere apparent. So utter, indeed, was the destitution of our Lord
        upon the Cross that He suffered even bodily nakedness and exclaims in
        the person of the Psalmist (21:19), “ They parted my garments among
        them, and upon my vesture they cast lots.” Now men imitate this
        nakedness of the Cross by voluntary poverty, especially when they
        renounce the revenues of their possessions. Thus St. Jerome, writing to
        the priest Paulinus, says, “Now that you have heard the counsel of our
        Saviour: ‘If you would be perfect, go, sell all that you have and give
        to the poor and come, follow Me,’ put His words into practice and,
        stripped of all things, follow the nakedness of the Cross. So shall you
        more easily and more speedily scale Jacob’s ladder.” A little further
        on, he adds, “It is no great thing for a man to wear a sad and pallid
        countenance, to make a display of fasting, and to wear a beggarly cloak
        if, at the same time, he draws a princely income from his property.”
        Hence we see how truly those are enemies of the Cross of Christ who
        impugn poverty and, savouring earthly things, deem that material
        possessions tend to Christian perfection, and that the abnegation of
        such possessions detracts from such perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now that we have considered certain points in the life of Christ, in His
        birth, in His manhood, and in His death upon the Cross, let us proceed
        to reflect upon His teaching. In the instruction which He gave both to
        His disciples and to the multitudes, He began with poverty as a
        foundation, “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (Mt 5:3). St Jerome
        explains these words as follows: “By the poor in spirit are to be
        understood they who, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, have the will to
        be poor.” As St. Ambrose says, on the Gospel of Luke, “Both Evangelists
        mention the beatitude of poverty in the first place. And indeed poverty
        is the first in order of virtues, and the mother and producer of all
        others. For he who spurns earthly riches shall merit such as are
        eternal, neither can he deserve to receive the reward of the Kingdom of
        Heaven, who is possessed by the spirit of covetousness.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Basil further shows us in these words what is specially meant by
        poverty of spirit: “Blessed is he who is poor as a true disciple of
        Christ, who bore poverty for us. For the Lord Himself accomplished every
        work that leads to perfection, giving Himself as an example to those who
        will learn of Him,” Now we never read that Christ owned any possessions.
        Therefore poverty is no hindrance to the perfection of those who desire
        to renounce what they possess, for the love of Christ; on the contrary
        such povtrty greatly increases their perfection. Hence, when our Lord
        was sending forth His twelve chosen Apostles to preach, and when He had
        given them the power to perform miracles, He impressed upon them, as
        their first rule of life, the exercise of poverty, saying, “Do not
        possess gold nor silver, nor money in your purses, nor bag for your
        journey” (Mt 10:9). Thus, as Eusebius of Caesaraea says, “He forbade
        them the present use of gold, silver or brass, and also solicitude for
        their future needs. For he know that they who were to be healed by the
        Apostles and delivered by them from the violence of their passions would
        share their goods with them.” Eusebius further adds that “our Lord
        judged it fitting that they who were attracted by heavenly riches should
        despise earthly junk and should possess neither gold, nor silver nor any
        other property valued by men, but should esteem the heavenly treasures
        they were endowed with, as worth more then all such things. Therefore He
        made them soldiers of the Kingdom of Heaven, and told them to cherish
        poverty.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        “No soldier of God who desires to please Him entangles himself in the
        affairs of this life.” St. Jerome, commenting on the Gospel of St.
        Matthew, says, “He who, in the foregoing words, had forbidden the
        Apostles to possess riches, now almost prohibits them from providing
        themselves with the necessities of life, in order that they, the
        teachers of true religion, who were trained to believe that all things
        were ordered by the Providence of God, should show that they themselves
        took no thought for the morrow.” Again, St. Chrysostom, writing on the
        Gospel of St. Matthew, observes, “Our Lord, by this precept, first frees
        his disciples from bondage to riches; secondly, He delivers them from
        all solicitude, in order that they may give their entire attention to
        the word of God; thirdly, He teaches them His virtue. Thus then the
        precepts of the Gospel point out to us what manner of man he ought to be
        who preaches the Kingdom of God. He ought to be one who seeks not the
        support of material assistance, but, relying entirely on his Faith,
        reflects that the less he strives after these material things, the more
        God can supply him with them.” St. Ambrose speaks, in his commentary on
        the Gospel of St. Luke, has this to say: “It is evident that if the
        Apostles had accepted property, they would have been not less, but far
        more open to suspicion than if they had owned gold and silver; for it
        would have been thought that they preached for the sake of what they
        could gain. They would likewise have been far more occupied with anxiety
        about the cultivation of their fields. For land or vineyards are a far
        greater source of material profit than are moveable chattels.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is evident then from these expositions that the Apostles were
        forbidden to possess lands, vineyards or any other fixed property. But
        who, save a heretic, would say that the first instruction of the
        disciples, given them by Christ Himself, was contrary to the principles
        of evangelical perfection? They therefore who say that it is less
        perfect for religious orders to be destitute of common property are
        falsifying the doctrineof the Faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But we must finally consider in what manner these precepts of our Lord
        were observed by the Apostles. For, as St. Augustine says in his book
        <i>Contra mendacium</i>: “Holy Scripture contains not only the divine
        precepts, but also the life and conduct of the just; in order that if,
        by any chance, we may be uncertain how some commandment is to be
        understood, we may be enlightened by studying the example of holy men.”
        Now we know that before the Passion the Apostles possessed nothing and
        carried no provision ou their journeys. Luke (22: 35) reports that our
        Lord said to them, “When I sent you without purse, or bag or shoes, did
        you want anything? They said, ‘nothing’.” Immediately afterwards,
        however, “Then said He unto them, ‘But now he who has a purse, let him
        take it, and likewise a bag.” It might appear as if Christ, in these
        words, entirely rescinded His former precept; but the dispensation was
        only a temporary one, granted on account of impending persecution.
        Venerable Bede says, “He does not govern His disciples by the same rule
        in the time of persecution and in the time of peace. When He sent them
        to preach, He forbad them to take anything with them on the way; for it
        was His ordinance that those who preach the Gospel should live by the
        Gospel. When, however, the danger of death was imminent, and the whole
        nation was persecuting the Shepherd and the flock, He gave His disciples
        a rule befitting the time, allowing them to provide themselves with the
        necessities of life, until such time as the fury of their persecutors
        should be appeased, and a convenient season for preaching the Gospel
        should return. Hereby He also teaches us that for certain just causes,
        we may, without sin, somewhat relax the severity of our customary
        exercises.” We also see that absolute renunciation of earthly
        possessions forms part of the rigour of evangelical discipline.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If we enquire as to the manner in which, after the Passion, the Apostles
        observed this precept, and how they taught their successors to keep it,
        we shall find information in the fourth Chapter of the Acts of the
        Apostles, where we read, “And the multitude of belibvers had but one
        heart and one soul: neither did any one say that any of the things he
        possessed was his own, but all things were common to them.” It cannot be
        held that they possessed common property, such as lands or vineyards or
        anything of the kind, for in the same chapter of the Acts we read, “For
        as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought he
        price of the things they sold, and laid it down at the feet of the
        Apostles.” It is thus made clear that the rule of the evangelical life
        was that the necessities of life were possessed in common, and that
        property was absolutely resigned by its owners. St. Augustine points out
        in <i>De doctrina christiana</i> that this practice is conducive to the
        highest perfection. “The believers among the Jewish nation,” he says;
        “who formed the first Church, that of Jerusalem, proved most abundantly
        how advantageous it was for them to have grown up under the school
        master, viz., the Law. For they were so evidently under the influence of
        the Holy Spirit that they sold all their possessions, and laid the price
        at the feet of the Apostles to be distributed among the poor. We do not
        (he continues) find the same fact noted of any Church of the Gentiles;
        for they who had worshipped false gods, made by hands, were not found so
        open to the Holy Spirit.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Pope Melchiades, however, assigns a different reason for the same fact.
        In <i>XII, quaest. 1</i> he says, “The Apostles, foreseeing that the
        future Church would be founded among the Gentiles, did not acquire much
        property from the Jews, but only money for the sustenance of the needy.
        Now however, amidst much storm and stress, the Church gradually acquired
        a footing in the world, and it came to pass that not only entire
        nations, but even the Roman emperors, the rulers of the whole earth,
        flocked to profess the Faith of Christ and to receive Baptism.
        Constantine, that most religious prince, was the first to give
        permission not only for his subjects to become Christians, but also for
        Churches to be erected; and he ordained that certain land should be
        given up to this purpose.” In the following chapter, Pope Urban says,
        “The High Priests and Levites and others and the rest of the faithful
        saw that it would be more profitable if the bishops were to make over to
        the churches which they governed te lands and other property which was
        customarily sold. By means of the charges on these estates, the Bishops
        would be able, both at the present time and in the future, to provide
        more abundantly and conveniently for the needs of the faithful, living a
        common life, than they could have done by the sums realised from the
        sale of the property. Therefore they began to assign to the mother
        churches the landed property which they had hitherto sold; and they
        lived on the income derived from it.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence we see that it is better to have land in common, rather than
        chattels which can be sold to procure the necessities of life. Land was
        sold in the primitive Church, not because the Apostles esteemed that to
        be the best course, but because they foresaw that the Church would have
        no permanence among the Jews, partly on account of their infidelity, and
        partly because of the ruin which was to overwhelm their nation. The
        apparent inconsistency of these arrangements disappears, when we
        attentively consider the state of the case. For, in the early days of
        the Chutch, all her members were as holy as the most perfect of her
        children in later days. Therefore the Church had, in the order both of
        nature and of grace, to lay her foundations among the perfect; and
        consequently the Apostles ordained a mode of life consonant with
        perfection. St. Jerome, in his book <i>De illustribus viris</i>, says,
        “It seems as if at first the Church of believers had been of the
        standard that monks now endeavour and strive to reach. Nothing was the
        private property of anyone; among them were no rich nor poor;
        patrimonies were divided among the needy; and men devoted themselves to
        prayer, to perfect doctrine, and to continence.” This perfect mode of
        life was practised among the primitive believers not only in Judaea
        under the Apostle, but also in Egypt under St. Mark the Evangelist. This
        we learn from St. Jerome and also from Book II of the
        <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In process of time, however, many were to enter the Church who would not
        live up to this standard of perfection. This was not to the case before
        the dispersion of the Jews, but afterwards, when the Church was
        disseminated among the Gentiles. When this state of things came to pass,
        the prelates of the Churches judged that landed property might
        advantageously be bestowed upon the churches, and this not as before,
        for the sake of the perfect, but on account of the weaker brethren who
        could not attain to the perfection of the earlier Christians. But there
        were, nevertheless, both at that time and later, certain men who were
        zealous for primitive perfection and who, like the monks of Egypt,
        gathered themselves into congregations and renounced all possessions.
        St. Gregory (<i>III Dial.</i>) mentions a certain holy Isaac who, coming
        from Syria into Italy, practised in the West the perfection which he had
        learned in the East. His disciples would frequently humbly beseech him
        to accept, for the use of the monastery, the property offered to him;
        but, anxious to preserve his property inviolate, he made the decisive
        reply that “a monk seeking earthly possessions is no monk.” This saying
        cannot be understood to refer to private property, since we are told
        that what was offered to Isaac, was pressed on him for the use of his
        monastery. Neither is it to be inferred that all monks who hold
        possessions in common are deficient in religious perfection. The words
        of Isaac were instigated by his fear of his failing in the virtue of
        poverty, a danger which threatens many religious who own property in
        common. For, as St. Jerome says in his epitaph on Nepotian to the Bishop
        Hehodorus, “Some men are richer as religious than they were as laymen.
        Now that they belong to Christ the Poor, they own wealth which they
        never possessed when they belonged to Satan the opulent; and the Church
        mourns over the riches of those whom the world formerly regarded as
        beggars.” Hence St. Gregory, speaking of St. Isaac, says, “He feared to
        lose the treasure of his poverty, just as a miser fears to lose his
        hoard of perishable wealth, and the Lord, to manifest his holiness, has
        glorified him.” For, as St. Gregory tells us farther on, “he became
        known far and wide for his spirit of prophecy and his great gift of
        miracles.” Hence it is evident that the absence of any possessions,
        either common or private, is for some men the path to sublime
        perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We shall understand this more clearly, if we examine the motive
        underlying the counsels pertaining to evangelical perfection. These
        counsels are given in order that by their means men may be delivered
        from earthly solicitude, and thus be more free to serve God. St. Paul
        tells us as much, when he gives the council concerning virginity, “He
        who is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the
        Lord, how he may please God. But he who is with a wife is solicitous for
        the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and he is divided”
        (1 Cor 7:32). Hence we we that the more any course of action delivers us
        from worldly anxiety, so much the more does it pertain to evangelical
        perfection. Now it is clear that the possession of wealth and property
        distracts the soul from divine things, for, to use our Lord’s, simile,
        “He who received the seed among thorns is he who hears the word, and the
        care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches chokes up the word
        and he becomes fruitless” (Mt 13:18). St. Jerome’s commentary on these
        words runs as follows: “Riches ate flatterers, promising one thing and
        doing another. Their possession is most uncertain: for when they are
        carried here and there and seem likely to endure, they desert their
        owners or rejoice those who previously possessed them not.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The same thing is taught us in the parable of the supper (Luke 14:18),
        where one of the invited guests is represented as excusing himself from
        attendance by the words, “I have bought a farm, and I must go out and
        see it.” “What,” asks St, Gregory, “are we to understand by this farm
        except material possessions? That man then goes out to we his farm who
        thinks of nothing but exterior things.” At the end of the parable the
        master of the supper says to his servants, “Bring in here the poor and
        the feeble.” Commenting on which, St. Ambrose observes that “he who
        lacks the enjoyments of sin, sins more rarely; and he who has no worldly
        pleasures is more easily converted to God.” Thus we see that the entire
        absence of property and wealth of any kind leads to evangelical
        perfection. St. Augustine likewise says in his book
        <i>De verbis Domini</i>, “The little ones of Christ are those who have
        renounced all things and have followed Him, All that they had, they have
        given to the poor, in order to serve God free from any earthly tie.
        Being thus delivered from the burdens of the world, they soar upwards as
        if on wings. They are little because they are humble; but weigh them,
        and you will find them very heavy.” Now no sane person can say that the
        care of common property is not a worldly care. Therefore, it adds to
        their perfection when men serve God freed from such shackles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence we see that those who teach that the renunciation of common
        property for the love of Christ does not pertain to perfection, are
        inculcating a most dangerous error, and spreading an opinion completely
        at variance with Christian doctrine. The Gloss on the verse of Psalm 6,
        “Let them be turned back, and shamed very speedily,” says, “This fate
        does not befall the sinner in this world where, on the contrary, the
        workers of iniquity mock and put to the blush the little ones of Christ
        who have renounced all things for his sake.” Rather do the following
        words of Psalm 13:6 seem to apply to them: “You have confounded the
        counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.” The Gloss thus
        comments on this verse, “The needy is a member of Christ; and you have
        acted thus towards him because the Lord is his hope.” That very reason
        which ought to make you revere him only causes you so much the more to
        despise him. For what else do these men do save endeavour to contemn
        those who follow in its perfection the counsel of Christian poverty? And
        why do they despise them, except because their hope is established not
        in possessions, but in God?

        AFTER what has been already premised, it will be easy to answer the
        objections of those who maintain an opinion contrary to ours, and who
        hold that it is expedient to own property in common. It is certainly
        well to do so, for the sake of those who are not capable of that height
        of perfection practised by the faithful of the early Church, among whom,
        however, the imperfect were not wholly neglected. Thus, although they
        who followed sublime perfection did not own any property, yet even our
        Lord, to whom the angels ministered, kept a purse for the necessities of
        others, and because His Church was to possess funds, as St. Augustine
        says in his commentary on St. John’s Gospel. Therefore, if there is any
        congregation of which every member aspires to the highest perfection, it
        is expedient for such a congregation to own no possessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When, in the next place, it is stated that St. Benedict received ample
        possessions during his lifetime, this only proves that the possession of
        common property does not make monastic perfection absolutely impossible.
        It is no proof whatsoever that it is not more perfect to renounce
        possessions altogether, especially as St. Benedict declares in his Rule,
        that he had, in condescension to the weakness of the monks of his time,
        mitigated in certain particulars the rigour of the monastic life as it
        was ordained by earlier Fathers. The same remark applies to St. Gregory,
        who built monasteries, according to the rule drawn up by St. Benedict.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third argument, viz, that our Lord allowed His apostles to take with
        them in time of persecution purse and bag, tells rather against our
        opponents than for them. If, in the time of persecution the rule Was
        suspended, it proves that the ordinary rule was that the apostles should
        take with them neither purse nor bag. We do not read that in time of
        persecution the Apostles procured for themselves any possessions in
        common. Thus the argument of their conduct during persecution is
        irrelevant to our subject.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fourth assertion, viz. that our Lord did not establish an order of
        men possessing nothing, but an order of prelates who owned certain
        property, is a distinct falsehood. For when our Lord taught His
        disciples to possess neither gold nor silver, lest their hearts should
        be weighed down by temporal anxieties; and when He promised to those
        who, for His sake should renounce lands and houses, a reward not only in
        the next world but in this life also, so that they should resemble the
        Apostles in “having nothing yet possessing all things,” He made it clear
        that all who should hereafter follow this rule would be obeying His
        ordinance. Those who follow the saints who have founded various orders
        are, in reality, imitating not those holy founders, but Christ, whose
        precepts they preach. Our adversaries are either deceived on another
        point, or else they try to mislead us. Christ did not establish an order
        of bishops, or other clerics who were to own property, either in common
        or individually. He established such an order, indeed, but established
        it in perfect poverty. Later on, however, possessions were accepted by
        the Church in order, as we have seen, to be distributed by her.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As for the fifth assertion, viz. that Christian perfection has been in
        abeyance from the time of the Apostles until our own days, it is
        certain, on the contrary that far from being in abeyance, Christian
        perfection has flourished vigorously, both in Egypt and in other parts
        of the world. No man can set limits to God, or say that He is to draw
        all men to Himself at the same time, or in the same place; rather,
        according to the wisdom whereby He disposes all things sweetly, He
        provides at divers seasons the aids to man’s salvation peculiarly
        befitting those times. Has Christian teaching failed from the days of
        the masters and the doctors, Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose, Augustine, and
        the rest, until our times, in which men are even better instructed than
        they formerly were in Christian doctrine? Is it, according to the views
        of out opponents, unlawful to set again in motion any good work which
        for a while has been interrupted? If such be the case, it would be
        unlawful to suffer martyrdom or to work miracles, since both these good
        works have, for a time, been in abeyance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The sixth argument, viz. that those who possessed no common property
        used to live by the work of their hands, is a calumny against others as
        well against religious; for the Apostle who preached the Gospel
        maintained himself by manual labour. Is it a sin, then, for Bishops,
        Archdeacons and all who are officially bound to preach the Gospel not to
        live by the work of their hands? If they are not bound thus to maintain
        themselves, because Stl Paul laboured not out of necessity, but as a
        work of supererogation, why should that work be enforced upon religious,
        which was onlly supererogatory with the holy Fathers? No one can fulfil
        all works of supererogation; for one thing is superfluous in one man,
        and another in another man. But, granted that it is not supererogatory,
        but necessary that they who own no common property should live by the
        work of their hands, that necessity only extends to such labour as may
        prevent idleness. But idleness is prevented, not only by manual labour,
        but far more,by the study of Holy Scripture; such idleness performs a
        great work, as St. Augustine says. And the Gloss on the words of Ps 48,
        “My eyes have failed” etc., says, “He is not idle who only studies the
        word of God; neither does he accomplish more who performs external work
        than he who exercises himself in the knowledge of divinity. For wisdom
        is of all works the greatest.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Idleness is also prevented by the warfare which we wage against the
        enemies of the Faith, according to St. Paul’s injunction: “Labour like a
        good soldier of Jesus Christ (2 Tim 2:3). This the Gloss interprets to
        mean the preaching of the Gospel against the enemies of the Faith. This
        I acknowledge to be a necessary work, for those who have not otherwise a
        means of subsistence. For it is lawful for all preachers of the Gospel,
        even Monks, to live by the Gospel and by their ministry at the Altar.
        St. Augustine in <i>De opere monachorum</i> asks whether it is
        permissible for Monks to have any common property, save what they gain
        by their own labour. Is it not ridiculous to say that religious may
        receive large possessions as alms, and yet may not accept donations to
        provide for their simple daily needs? Therefore no necessity constrains
        those who do not possess common property to labour with their hands. We
        have, however, elsewhere spoken more fully on this point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The seventh argument deserves ridicule, rather than reply. For, who does
        not see that the task of heaping up riches—a task which seculars can
        barely achieve—involves far more anxiety of mind than that of merely
        procuring from the charity of the faithful and the mercy of God a
        simple, daily provision for the necessities of life.

        As for the eighth argument, viz. that religious must occupy themselves
        about the affairs of those who minister to them, I acknowledge that this
        is true. But the affairs about which they must be busied are such as
        concern the spiritual welfare of their benefactors, or their consolation
        when they are in trouble. Such solicitude is a work of charity by no
        means incompatible with religion. For, as St. James says, “Religion pure
        and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the orphan and
        the widow in their tribulation” (1:27).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The last argument is absolutely worthless. For the things used by
        religious for their support are not absolutely their own property or
        under their own control, but are ministered to them for their
        necessities by those who have the management of such things.

        This is all that occurs to me at present to write against the pernicious
        end erroneous teaching which deters some men from entering religious
        life. If any man desires to contradict my words, let him not do so by
        chattering before boys but let him write and publish his writings, so
        that intelligent persons may judge what is true, and may be able to
        confute what is false by the authority of the Truth,
