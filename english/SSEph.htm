The Legal stream is represented in Moses who was the greatest of prophets since, among other reasons, he\
proclaimed the Law to the people in the name of God, cf. <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 14; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 174, 4. The prophetic stream\
is obviously mentioned; following St. Jerome, St. Thomas includes Judges, Ruth and Kings in the prophetic books,\
cf. <i>De Com. et Part. S. Scrip. <\/i>The Sapiential stream, termed the &#8220;hagiographa,&#8221; makes up the rest of the Old\
Testament and is clearly included within his analogically conceived notion of the prophetic mission; those who wrote\
these books were aided by the &#8220;lumen divinum&#8221; which is the formally unifying factor in all prophecy, cf. <i>De Ver.\
<\/i>12, 12 ad 10; S.T. II-II, 174, 2 ad 3; 171, 3 ad 3. The writings of the New Testament trace their origin to the truly\
prophetic experience of the Apostles, cf. <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 14 ad 5; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 173, 2c; <i>In Matt. <\/i>10, n.2, v.20; <i>In loan. <\/i>18,\
Lect. 4, n.2; <i>In Rom. <\/i>12, Lect. 2. Thus the canonical Scriptures are sometimes attributed to &#8220;the Apostles and\
Prophets,&#8221; cf. <i>In 1 Tim.<\/i> 6, Lect. 1; <i>S.T.<\/i> 1, 1, 8 ad 2.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote14 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Charismatic graces are the <i>gratiae gratis datae <\/i>discussed in <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II 111, 4-5. St. Thomas&#8217; final position is to\
include all of these related to knowledge within his analogical conception of prophecy, cf. Prologue to II-II, 171.\
The unifying factor in the analogous reality is the &#8220;lumen divinum&#8221; or &#8220;lumen propheticum,&#8221; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 171, 3 ad\
3, which can vary in degree, <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 13; S.T. 174, 3; it can also penetrate to almost every level of reality, <i>S.T.<\/i>\
II-II, 171, 3. The expression &#8220;lumen&#8221; must be understood within the context of Aquinas&#8217; use of it in his analysis of\
man&#8217;s natural intellectual consciousness, cf. B. Lonergan, S.J., &#8220;The Concept of <i>Verbum <\/i>in the Writings of St.\
Thomas Aquinas,&#8221; <i>T.S.<\/i>, vol. 8 (1947), pp. 64-73. By it the prophet is enabled to judge events and issues in a\
supernatural manner. (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 173, 2). The &#8220;lumen fidei,&#8221; in its turn, enables men to assent voluntarily to the truths\
enunciated by the prophets (<i>ibid., <\/i>171, 3 ad 2; 5c; <i>D.V. <\/i>12, 2 <i>sed con.; In Boet. de Trin. <\/i>3, 1 ad 4). These two\
&#8220;lumina&#8221; are forms of the &#8220;lumen gratiae&#8221; (S.T. I-II, 109, 1c) but they differ in that the prophetic light is directed\
toward a supernatural judgment itself while the light of faith prepares the mind to assent to what God reveals through\
the prophets (D.V. 12, 1 ad 4 bis). On the importance of correctly understanding Aquinas&#8217; concept of <i>lumen <\/i>cf.\

  var WPFootnote15 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The analogical concept of prophecy is differentiated according to <i>content <\/i>into four general categories. One class,\
termed most properly prophetic in <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 171, 3, deals with future events which the prophet knows with divine\
assistance, cf. <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 2c, ad 1, ad 4; 3c; 10c; 11; <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154; <i>In Hebr. <\/i>6, Lect. 4; <i>In Rom. <\/i>3, Lect. 1; 12,\
Lect. 2; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 171, 3, 6 ad 2; 172, 1c; 174, 1c ad 1. A second category of prophecy occurs when the existence\
of supernatural mysteries is made known to a prophet; in <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154, this was designated as &#8220;sapientia&#8221; but by\
the time of his writing the prologue to <i>S.T.<\/i> 11-11, 171, St. Thomas had reverted to his position in <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 2c and\
<i>In Rom. <\/i>12, Lect. 2 where he incorporates this within an analogical notion of prophecy, cf. also <i>S.T.<\/i> 171, 3c and 174,\
3c; <i>In I Cor. <\/i>14, Lect. 1; for this prophecy in action cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 174, 6; <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 14 ad 1. The third class has\
to do with a supernaturally acquired knowledge of the existence of what is otherwise knowable by natural means.\
It is prophetic because these natural objects are seen &#8220;in lumine divino,&#8221; i.e., in reference to God and his plans, cf.\
<i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 13; S.T. 11-11, 174, 3c. Finally, a scarcely recognized fourth category, not yet noticed when he was\
composing <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, deals with the interpretation and propagation of the truths revealed in the other forms of\
prophecy. In <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154 and <i>In I Cor. <\/i>12, Lect. 2, St. Thomas saw the need of men supernaturally equipped to\
interpret what others had written; it was termed &#8220;interpretatio sermonis.&#8221; In commenting on I Cor. 14 he deepened\
his understanding of this grace, regarding it as a real type of prophecy, cf. <i>In I Cor. <\/i>14, Lects. 1, 2, 3, 5; also <i>In Rom.\
<\/i>12, Lect. 2. He grasped the broad dimensions prophecy had for St. Paul: &#8220;Someone is also termed a prophet solely\
by the fact that he proclaims the prophetic words in the Church, or expounds or chants them there.&#8221; <i>In I <\/i>Cor. 14,\
Lect. 1; also <i>ibid., 11, <\/i>Lect. 2; 14, Lect. 6; <i>In Tit. 1, <\/i>Lect. 3. Cf. note 18 below for further remarks.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote16 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The difference between charismatic graces and sanctifying grace is that the latter concerns man&#8217;s personal relations\
or union with God, whereas the former enable him to cooperate with other men in bringing them to God, cf. S.T. 1-11, 111, 1. Thus the &#8220;utilitas Ecclesiae&#8221; is the motive force in prophecy, cf. <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 2, 3 ad 11 &amp; 15; 5c; 13c;\
<i>In I Cor. <\/i>14, passim; In <i>Rom. <\/i>12, Lect. 2; S.T. 11-11, 171, Ic. P. Benoit, O.P., in his <i>Prophecy and Inspiration <\/i>(New\
York: Descl&eacute;e, 1961) pp. 103-111 tries to distinguish between the prophet and the sacred authors by saying that in\
the former the speculative judgment predominates and in the latter the practical judgment. This can find no support\
in St. Thomas who conceived of Prophecy&#8212;taken analogously&#8212;as directed toward assisting men in their total\
response to God in faith and morality, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 173, 2c; 174, 6c (note how be says &#8220;prophetica revelatio&#8221; is concerned with both faith and morals). It is possible to trace this dual aspect of supernatural knowledge, its speculative\
and practical qualities, from its origin in God&#8217;s knowledge though prophecy and Scripture to theology, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 14,\
16; I, 4c; 1, 3c. For the practical judgments involved in writing a book, cf. notes 17 to 23 below.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote17 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This is one of the key distinctions in Aquinas&#8217; analysis; he terms the first aspect or moment the prophetic &#8220;donum&#8221;\
and the seeond its &#8220;usus.&#8221; It runs throughout all of his analysis, cf. <i>De Ver. <\/i>12, 2c; 3 ad 15; 4c, ad 1 &amp; 3; 5c, ad 3;\
9c; 12 ad 4; 13c; <i>In I Cor. <\/i>14, 1 ff.; <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 171, 1c; 172, 3 ad 1; 4 ad 4; 173, 3c, ad 4; 4c; 174,\
2 ad 3; 3 ad 3; 4c. A revelation is always involved in the encounter in which the &#8220;donum&#8221; consists, <i>ibid., <\/i>171, 1 ad\
<i>4. <\/i>Benoit, op. <i>cit.<\/i>, pp. 109-11 departs front Aquinas by seeking to distinguish sharply between revelation and\
inspiration. For the Angelic Doctor revelation, like prophecy, was analogous. Benoit, on the other hand, is influenced\
by today&#8217;s tendency to think of passive revelation in the cut and dried terms of the manuals; we tend to regard a truth\
as either clearly and explicitly revealed or not revealed at all. But for St. Thomas man&#8217;s knowledge of the faith\
grows, truths are revealed slowly over a period of time (cf. notes 26 and 27 below). The Bible communicates this\
organic development of salvation-history to men up to its definitive apex in the revelation of the Word Incarnate\
himself. The whole of the Bible must be approached with faith; this does not mean that every sentence is a definable\
dogma.<\/p>\
<p>Much of the Scriptures deal with otherwise, naturally knowable subjects, such as Israel&#8217;s history, but as Aquinas\
points out (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 1, 7) these are related <i>in the light of <\/i>God&#8217;s plans for salvation-history. To initially perceive and\
judge this to be true required some type of revelation, and to assent to it requires faith. If biblical inspiration did not\
terminate in this analogous revelation why is it necessary to even posit a supernatural action in the formation of the\
Bible? Why must we approach all of Scripture with faith if only portions of it contain passive revelation and most\
of it does not? Benoit seems to overlook the fact that between the natural and the supernatural no medium area exists\
in which to fit a knowledge whether speculative or practical which is neither one nor the other. Nor is there a truly\
supernatural knowledge which is not also to some degree a revelation, at least in that it views and expresses some\
fact&#8212;otherwise knowable to reason perhaps&#8212;within the light of salvation-history.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote18 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>At first, St. Thomas did not connect the &#8220;interpretatio sermonis&#8221; (mentioned as the fourth class of prophecy in note\
15 above) with the prophetic mission. But in <i>In I Cor. 14, <\/i>Lect. 6 he began to understand this as an &#8220;usus prophetiae&#8221;\
and in <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 173, 2c and 176, 2 ad 4 be speaks of the corresponding &#8220;donum prophetiae.&#8221; The prologue to II-II,\
171 indicates in what this &#8220;donum&#8221; consists. It is the charismatic gift of faith which &#8220;grants a certain supereminent\
certitude of faith by which a man is fit to instruct others in what pertains to the faith.&#8221; <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 111, 4 ad 2. Benoit\
chose to develop Aquinas&#8217; concept of instrumentality in applying his analysis of prophecy to the sacred writers. I\
think St. Thomas&#8217; more frequently repeated insight into the difference between &#8220;donum&#8221; and &#8220;usus,&#8221; with their\
analogous nature, might prove more fruitful.<\/p>\
<p>For example, today the complex origin of the biblical books is well known; they were not, for the most part,\
composed by single authors, as was formerly held, but by various traditions. Cf. J. McKenzie, S.J., &#8220;The Social\
Character of Inspiration,&#8221; <i>C.B.Q.<\/i> vol. 24 (1962) pp. 115-24. Utilizing St. Thomas&#8217; fourth category of prophecy we\
can claim that the men who perpetuated the Old and early New Testament traditions had a deeper bond uniting them\
to the messages than the ordinary people. The latter accepted it as coming from God through the <i>virtue <\/i>of faith. This\
may also have been the personal response of the men who perpetuated the traditions, but their social responsibility\
required more. Those who originated the various prophetic, legal, sapiential, and New Testament traditions usually\
experienced the deep prophetic encounter and consequent active revelation needed to grasp and affirm supernatural\
mysteries. But these were perpetuated, and applied to changing times, by disciples in whom the prophetic &#8220;donum&#8221;\
was normally the charismatic grace of faith. Since this &#8220;gratia gratis data&#8221; clearly consists in a &#8220;prophetica revelatio&#8221;\
(cf. II-II, 171, prol.) there can be no doubt that the communication, whether oral or written (cf. II-II, 174, 6 obj. 2),\
flowing from it is really inspired in the sense in which &#8220;biblical inspiration&#8221; is used today.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote19 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>For the differentiation of prophecy according to the <i>manner <\/i>of its experience, cf. De <i>Ver. <\/i>12, 7, 12, 13; <i>In I Cor.\
<\/i>14, 1; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 173, 2, 3; 174, 2-4. Also Benoit, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, p. 37. As Benoit himself admits, his distinction between\
prophecy and inspiration on the basis of &#8220;lumen et species&#8221; and &#8220;lumen solum&#8221; cannot be supported by St. Thomas\
who expressly states concerning this &#8220;lumen&#8221;: &#8220;from the reception of which someone is constituted a prophet.&#8221; <i>(De\
Ver. <\/i>12, 1c; also <i>S.T.<\/i> 171, 3 ad 3; 173, 2c). The &#8220;lumen propheticum&#8221; is a passing impression on the prophet&#8217;s mind\
(11-11, 171, 2); yet St. Thomas does speak of an &#8220;habilitas&#8221; resulting from its reception (<i>ibid., <\/i>ad 2), indicating that\
there is a variation in degree. This &#8220;habilitas&#8221; must especially be remembered when discussing the prophetic\
&#8220;donum&#8221; operative in the charismatic gift of faith mentioned in note 18 above.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote20 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>De Ver. 12, <\/i>4c; <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 174, 3 ad 3; 173, 3 ad 4. For further references, cf. those given in note 17 above. This\
contrasts with the &#8220;donum&#8221;: &#8220;The gift of prophecy, which exists beyond the capacity of man, is given by God and\
not through the power of some created cause,&#8221; <i>ibid. <\/i>It seems to me that Benoit&#8217;s theory of inspiration, op. <i>cit.<\/i>, pp.<i>\
<\/i>88-132, would profit from this distinction between &#8220;donum&#8221; and &#8220;usus.&#8221; Fixing attention on the communication or\
&#8220;usus,&#8221; and this precisely under the form of writing, he conceives of inspiration as some sort of created &#8220;supernatural\
impulse&#8221; flowing from God to the sacred author, taking &#8220;the form of an immediate physical motion.&#8221; (<i>op. cit.<\/i>,<i> <\/i>p.\
120). This manner of explaining the divine action has already been shown as not that of St. Thomas, cf. B. Lonergan,\
&#8220;St. Thomas&#8217; Theory of Operation,&#8221; <i>T.S.<\/i> vol. 3 (1942), pp. 375-401, and his &#8220;St. Thomas&#8217; thought on <i>Gratia\
Operans,&#8221; ibid., <\/i>pp. 533-78. As a result, Benoit&#8217;s idea of the author&#8217;s instrumentality is much stricter than that of\
Aquinas. Cf. notes 21 to 23 below.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote21 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>That inspiration, for St. Thomas, pertains to the &#8220;donum&#8221; is evident from <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 171, 1 ad 4; also cf. Benoit,\
<i>op. cit., <\/i>pp. 68-69. So in <i>De Comm. et Part. S. Scrip.<\/i> he can distinguish the prophets, who often spoke in God&#8217;s\
name, and the hagiographers who: &#8220;inspired by the Holy Spirit [the <i>donum<\/i>]<i> <\/i>spoke, not on the part of the Lord, but\
as it were from themselves [<i>usus<\/i>].&#8221; Note that I say God&#8217;s &#8220;governance&#8221; was not immediate. His providence\
immediately extends to every detail in salvation-history ordering each to its end, but the carrying into effect&#8212;the\
&#8220;gubematio&#8221;&#8212;of these plans is mediated by secondary causes, cf. <i>S.C.G. <\/i>III<i>, <\/i>76, 77, 83, 94; <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 22, 3; 103, 6.\
Of course the &#8220;what&#8221; which the <i>donum <\/i>imparts shares in the latter&#8217;s analogical character as briefly sketched in note\
15 above. Even the most &#8220;natural&#8221; books of the Old Testament deal with their material in the light of Yahweh and\
his plans for his people; e.g. Numbers treating of the communal organization of the people centered about God&#8217;s\
abode, the ark and tabernacle, and the need to submit to their God-given leaders; or Proverbs seeking to implement\
&#8220;the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; with down-to-earth practical advice. Note also that the deficiency\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This was Thomas&#8217; insight expressed in S.T. II-II, 172, 3c. To appreciate its implications one must read the writings\
of Lonergan referred to in note 20 above; for a contemporary statement of the same basic idea, cf. his <i>Insight, p. <\/i>664.\
It discloses the major weakness in Benoit&#8217;s theory of inspiration (which he is trying to remedy) and those of others.\
They are worked out within the framework of either a Ba&ntilde;ez or a Molina who both agreed in the presupposition that\
God controls all events because he controls each. For Benoit the whole Bible is inspired because the Almighty\
controlled every single writer and literary piece. St. Thomas&#8217; concept of instrumentality, as Lonergan has\
demonstrated, affirms that God controls each event because he controls all. Applied to Scripture this means that each\
and every part of it is authored by God because he originated (cf. &#8220;Deus origo eius est&#8221; of <i>De Comm. et Part. <\/i>S.\
Scrip.) the whole process of the Bible&#8217;s formation. Thus he could state: &#8220;Furthermore, God also at the moment of\
his creation can create a subject that he might dispose the soul <i>in its very creation for <\/i>prophecy, and would grant\
it the prophetic grace.&#8221; S.T. II-II, 172, 3c. The difference between the instrumentality operative in the composing\
of the Scriptures and the Universal Instrumentality discussed by Lonergan, <i>T.S.<\/i> 1942, pp. 391-95, is that the\
Providence guiding the genesis of the Bible is an essential element in the special Providence concerned with\
salvation-history; cf. <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 111-113. Note the affinity this has with K. Rahner&#8217;s thesis: God&#8217;s willing of the\
Scriptures as a constitutive element in his willing of the Church, cf. his <i>Inspiration in the Bible <\/i>(N.Y.: Herder &amp;\
Herder, 1961). For valid criticisms and modifications of Rahner&#8217;s Theory, cf. Y. Congar, O.P., <i>Sainte Eglise <\/i>(Paris:\
Ed. du Cerf, 1963), pp. 187-200; and especially F. Crowe, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, pp. 85 and 90. B. Benoit is also broadening his\
conception of inspiration, cf. &#8220;Les Analogies de l&#8217;inspiration,&#8221; <i>Sacra Pagina, <\/i>Vol. I (Paris: Lecoffre, 1959), pp. 86-99. This is even more pronounced in his most recent article &#8220;R&eacute;v&eacute;lation et inspiration,&#8221; in the <i>Revue biblique<\/i>, Vol.\
72 (1963), pp. 321-370, where he knits revelation and inspiration more closely together than in his previous works.\
Failing to grasp the importance of Aquinas&#8217; distinction between <i>donum <\/i>and <i>usus<\/i> (pp. 325-336), he ends by defining\
revelation and inspiration in terms which approach those two aspects of the prophetic mission (pp. 367-368).<\/p>\

      Saint Thomas Aquinas is a paradox. He was a mystic and a rigorously
      scientific theologian. His attachment to Judaeo-Christianity was strong
      enough for him to appreciate and appropriate pagan truths. An
      Aristotelian, he never ceased utilizing Platonic insights. In him a deep
      reverence for the Church Fathers was coupled with an astonishing zest for
      novelty.

      was neither an Alexandrian nor an Antiochene, perhaps because he was both.
      No one has successfully categorized his approach to the Bible. Advocates
      of allegory claim him as their own and defenders of strictly literal
      interpretation praise him for asserting the sufficiency of the letter. A
      noted Oxford historian admires the revolutionary quality of his exegetical

    Is St. Thomas’ genius really so elusive? Or was he being eclectic at the
    expense of consistency?
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Aquinas effected a real break-through towards system in the domains of
    Christian philosophy and theology. But what did he do in the area of
    exegesis? During the centuries when his disciples were eagerly commenting on
    his Summa and his other systematic works, his commentaries on Scripture
    gradually became enveloped in thick layers of dust. The dust has been
    vigorously removed during the past few decades, but not all of it has
    settled. Nor does the present obscurity on just how systematic theology is
    related to Scripture clarify the situation.

    More than an Introduction would be necessary to come anywhere near an
    adequate treatment of the complex problems involved.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Nevertheless, a basic methodological distinction may go a long way in
    establishing St. Thomas’ position in the history of Christian exegesis. That
    distinction is between a biblical exegete’s presuppositions and his
    techniques.

    Both are operative in his exegesis, but in very different ways. Techniques
    are easy to identify; they pertain to the entire array of hermeneutical
    methods and sciences aimed at disclosing the human author’s intended
    meaning. Their range embraces everything from ancient history and
    comparative religion down to philology and lexicography. Exegetical
    presuppositions are harder to describe since they lie so close to the
    origins of meaning and expression in man, thus requiring greater
    self-understanding.

    </script>
    In the context of biblical exegesis, presuppositions have to do with what it
    means for the Bible to be both the Word of God and the words of men. This
    twofold meaning of the Bible corresponds to two fundamental presuppositions.
    Correlative to the Scriptures as the Word of God there is the faith of the
    exegete. Because the Word is mediated by men the exegete’s philosophical
    horizon is also a determining factor in his interpretations.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In the following pages I shall attempt to substantiate the thesis that, St.
    Thomas’ specific contributions to biblical exegesis were in the realm of the
    last mentioned presupposition, while on the level of techniques he adhered
    closely to the conventions of his day. His lectures on Ephesians can then be
    read within a general framework of his approach to the Bible.

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To understand the Bible more is needed than a good dose of hermeneutical
    techniques. They are an indispensable aid in determining the human author’s
    intended meaning. But this meaning is what no human being could affirm as
    true on his own power. To understand the Scriptures as its authors meant
    them to be understood is to accept what they proclaim: the history of
    salvation culminating in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus as
    revealing the ultimate meaning of human existence—a meaning only God could
    give it. A challenge to the religious conversion of faith is issued which no
    interpreter can explain away. Here St. Thomas is one with the entire
    Patristic tradition. Like an Irenaeus, an Origen, or an Augustine, Thomas
    had to respond to God’s Word with an unreserved faith before he could even
    hope to understand something of that Word’s meaning, and what it revealed
    about the meaning of his own existence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    More than faith is presupposed, however, to scriptural exegesis. Just as
    revelation is mediated by men, so the faith that responds to revelation does
    not replace the mind of the believer. Because God’s Word is mediated by men
    a tradition is necessary to proclaim the Word and explain it to endlessly
    varying audiences down the ages. Without this continual re-expression, the
    original inspired expression would be of little help. What good would come
    of printing the Greek New Testament on the front page of the
    <i>New York Times</i> ? Because faith does not replace the human mind, the
    operations and drives of human understanding are implicated in both the
    original expression and the tradition which re-expresses and interprets it.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The exegete’s task within the tradition, which he enters through faith, is
    to question the revealed message, not in doubt but in an effort to better
    understand it, and so contribute to its authentic transmission. What
    questions he asks, and how he answers them, will largely be determined by
    his philosophical horizon. Hence the presence of what contemporary German
    exegetes speak of as a <i>Begrifflichkeit</i>, the set of fundamental
    concepts employed by an interpreter in his questioning of God’s Word.

    Here is where St. Thomas marked a notable transition in regard to the
    Fathers. Before him biblical exegesis in the West had relied mostly on
    concepts borrowed from a Middle or Neoplatonism. In the great Origenist and
    Augustinian schools the conceptual orientation was to exemplary and final
    causality. The visible world and human history were symbols of spiritual
    realities known through illumination.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Aquinas’ appropriation of Aristotle introduced a different perspective from
    which to question God’s Word. For Thomas human knowing is impossible without
    sense and imagination. Efficient and formal causality receive greater
    recognition. The world and history take on their own value, they are not
    just symbolic of a higher realm. Reason with its philosophies and sciences
    is clearly differentiated from faith with its mysteries. Once this
    differentiation had occurred biblical inspiration became a problem in a way
    it could not have before. This in turn affected Thomas’ treatment of the
    senses of Scripture.

    The contrast between St. Augustine and the newly recovered Aristotle, which
    aroused his strongest passions, upset or modified his most cherished notions
    about the universe and its Creator, was bound to have a disturbing effect on
    his study of the Creator’s special book. Aristotle caused him to see
    Scripture as freshly as he saw all creation.

    Prior to St. Thomas no theologian had felt the necessity of analyzing the
    exact relationship between the divine and human authors of the Bible. Man’s
    knowing, and the world he knew, were not thought of as spheres in their own
    right; hence there was hardly any need to determine how both God and man
    could author the same book. Following Athenagoras of Athens, the human
    authors were described as the harp strings played by the Holy Spirit to
    produce the melody of the Scriptures.

    From his lectures on Scripture, St. Thomas became increasingly interested in
    the psychological and theological structures operative in the transmission

    the interplay of the divine and the human in mankind’s growth in
    supernatural knowledge receive more attention than the scattered patristic
    references accorded it. Not that Aquinas ever wrote a separate treatise on

    The other essential relationship in prophecy has to do with the use of the
    gift in prophetic communication. This is required by the very nature of the
    gift which is meant for the benefit of other men and not for the personal
    sanctification of the prophet. In the first relationship man receives
    passively from God; the “donum. prophetiae” is immediately caused by God.

    declared the sufficiency of the literal sense; nor did any of the
    commentators or theologians prior to St. Thomas. Several reasons account for
    this attitude. One was the grossly literal approach of those who insisted on
    taking figurative and metaphorical expressions in the Bible at their face
    value. Thus, Origen was convinced that an excessively literal interpretation
    lay at the roots of the Jew’s rejection of Christ for not fulfilling the
    messianic promises to the letter, and the Gnostic rejection of the Old
    Testament for its anthropomorphic portraits of God. Origen countered both by
    affirming that nothing in the Holy Books is unworthy of God, provided they
    are understood spiritually rather than literally.

    Beyond these apologetic and pastoral motivations, however, there existed a
    Platonic atmosphere in Christian thinking which disposed commentators to
    regard the biblical text as merely the necessary shell or veil that had to
    be pierced in order to get at the inner, nobler, spiritual message.
    Influenced by Philonic methods, Origen used his axiom, that nothing in the
    Bible is unworthy of God, to explain away obvious sins, such as Lot’s
    incest, as allegories. “Everything in Scripture is a mystery” since
    “everything in Scripture has a spiritual meaning, but not all of it has a

    St. Augustine furnished the groundwork for the proper relation between the

    Since the end of Scripture is the love and knowledge of God, if an
    interpretation contributes to this end, while failing to grasp the meaning

    St. Thomas’ unqualified adoption of the Aristotelian doctrine concerning the

    importance of the literal sense of Scripture. In this life, Christian
    contemplation, no matter how fully it attained to the reality, could never
    dispense with the imagined signs which guided it toward that reality. For
    St. Augustine, man was a soul and a body, the soul used the body; man’s
    intellectual knowledge is not received from sense objects, even sensation is
    an act of the soul using the sense organs.

    St. Thomas, however, opens the way for a closer analysis of the text and of
    history as expressing a divinely given meaning. Where the former concentrate
    on the plus-value of the symbol as pointing beyond itself, Aquinas directs

    This “incarnation” of the spiritual senses was further promoted by
    recognizing metaphor as a literal sense. Since words, whether spoken or

    meaning of the metaphorical text in accordance with what the author meant it

    By far, the greatest service which St. Thomas performed in regard to
    exegetical presuppositions was to assert plainly the sufficiency of the
    literal meaning. The literal is the only sense on which theological
    arguments can be based; St. Augustine and others had counseled that
    arguments must be adduced from “plain testimonies” but never would they have
    dreamt of identifying these exclusively with the literal sense.

    Consequently Holy Scripture sets up no confusion, since all meanings are
    based on one, namely, the literal sense. From this alone can arguments be
    drawn, and not, as St. Augustine mentions in his letter to Vincent the
    Donatist, from whatever is said according to allegory. Nor is anything lost
    from Sacred Scripture on this account, for nothing that is necessary to
    faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is not openly conveyed by
    the literal sense elsewhere.

    The exegetical presuppositions of St. Thomas provided the elements needed
    for the theoretical justification of a Christian exegete applying himself
    wholeheartedly to the interpretation of the literal sense. He could do this
    without fearing an Origenist censure that he was denying biblical
    inspiration. For only when the things which the author intended to signify
    through words were known could the further question be determined of what
    further realities God was signifying through those things. The distinction
    between the prophetic encounter and its communication assured the believing
    exegete that the Bible’s origin was both truly divine and really human. The
    Book was an object of both faith and scientific study. The affirmation of
    the sufficiency of the literal sense would allow him to appreciate the
    spiritual riches and salvific power of the inspired text itself. Finally,
    the identification of the literal meaning of the text and the intention of
    its authors fully warranted a study of the factors which shaped and
    influenced their mentality—their languages, cultures and historical
    contexts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The elements for a theoretical justification of historical biblical studies,
    however, must not be confused with the studies themselves. St. Thomas’
    thirteenth century unawareness of history as we know it today meant that he
    could not grasp the implications of his own presuppositions. This is
    evident, for example, in his adoption of the Origenist-Augustinian notion
    that the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets—the elite whose duty it was
    to lead the people—had an explicit faith in the mysteries of the Holy
    Trinity and Christ. Since the mass of the people were not ready for this,
    their faith was implicit in their acceptance of the Old Law in which these
    mysteries were prefigured.

    This did not lead Aquinas to posit mysteries behind every word of the Old
    Testament, but it does explain why the messianic prophecies, such as Isaiah
    (7:14), can be taken as referring directly to Christ in their literal

    Another instance was his acceptance of the Augustinian teaching on the
    multiplicity of the literal sense. God might have enabled the prophet or
    sacred author to comprehend many of the diverse meanings which others would
    draw out of what had been written—even if the human instruments did not in
    fact know these diverse meanings, surely God did.

    This demonstrates that St. Thomas’ exegetical presuppositions were in
    continuity with the old as well as open to the new. They were not delivered
    in the clear-cut, settled once and for all categories which theological
    manuals associate with Thomist thought. He was grappling with problems the
    impications of which are not yet fully comprehended today. One wonders
    whether the crises in Catholic interpretation of die Bible during the

    advanced, the presuppositional positions of Aquinas.

    No matter how fully its deficiencies were recognized, the Vulgate, as edited
    by Alcuin in 800, remained the quasi-official text for all the lectures at
    the University. Alcuin had no consistent policy in his divisions of the
    Text, and wide divergencies existed up to and including the twelfth century
    in the matter of citations. Stephen Langton seems to have worked out the
    present system of chapters near the end of Iiis teaching career. They were
    not long in becoming standard and, with a few precisions possibly due to
    Hugh St. Cher, remain in use today. Partitioning chapters into verses was

    Those who wrote the Scriptural canon, such as the Evangelists, Apostles and
    others like them, so firmly asserted the truth that they left nothing to be
    doubted. Thus it states: “And we know that his testimony is true,” (Jn
    21:24) and “If anyone preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have
    received, let him be anathema.” (Gal. 1:9). The reason for this is that only
    the canonical Scriptures are normative for faith. Whereas others who write
    about the truth do so in such a way that they do not want to be believed

    This does not imply that St. Thomas advocated <i>sola scriptura</i>; he
    could not abstract the Book from its living environment within ecclesial
    tradition. The generations of Christians stretching from Apostolic times
    down to their own were not viewed by the medieval mind as
    <i>separating</i> them from the integral Christian message but far more as
    <i>uniting</i> them to it. The Church Fathers were the incomparable guides

    The many glosses facilitated recourse to them; to each passage of a given
    book the glosses would attach an excerpt from one or more of the Fathers
    which explained or exemplified the text. Two glosses became standard
    textbooks in medieval exegesis: the <i>Glossa Ordinaria</i> which most
    probably originated with Anselm of Laon and his school, and the
    <i>Magna Glossatura</i> of Peter Lombard on the Psalms and letters of St.
    Paul. During the twelfth century the Masters of the Sacred Page not only had
    to comment on the biblical text but also to read, and interpret, if
    necessary, many of its patristic glosses. The task was formidable and by
    Thomas’ time it devolved on those contending for their baccalaureate to
    construe the text and its glosses. This left the master free to undertake
    the commentary proper.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Aquinas was not content with second-hand patristic sources, he often went
    back to the original works if they were available. When Urban IV requested
    him to compose a gloss on the four gospels, with particular attention to the
    Greek Fathers, St. Thomas included many quotations previously not given in
    the glosses; be even had translations of some Greek works made into Latin.
    When the <i>Expositio Continua</i> —or the <i>Catena Aurea</i> as it was
    popularly known—had been completed, it represented over twenty-two Latin
    Fathers and fifty-seven Greek Fathers. Critical scholars of the caliber of
    Erasmus had nothing but praise for it.

    Concordances and dictionaries were essential to thirteenth century reference
    works. St. Thomas probably had at his disposal some of the better known
    topical concordances, such as those of Rabanus Maurus or Thomas Gallus with
    their lists of subjects and the relevant scriptural passages. For verbal
    concordances he could check Hugh of St. Cher’s, or the
    <i>Concordantia Sancti Jacobi</i> and <i>Concordantiae Majores</i>, both the
    work of his confreres at St. Jacques. He might also refer to dictionaries,
    such as Alan of Lille’s <i>Dictinctiones Dictionum Theologicalium</i>, in
    which the words are illustrated by the literal and spiritual meanings they
    have in the Bible.

    In philology and textual criticism St. Thomas was not the equal of some of
    his contemporaries. He has been reproached for not learning Greek and Hebrew
    when he certainly had the opportunity to do so at Paris or Naples. But by
    his time specialization in these areas had already begun. Besides, his
    biographies leave the impression that Brother Thomas’ schedule was a tight
    one during his years as a student and professor—a fact corroborated by the
    enormous volume of his writing. The little Greek he knew, and the less
    Hebrew, was gleaned almost entirely from patristic references and the
    correctoria. These latter, e.g., that of Hugh of St. Cher and the Dominicans
    of St. Jacques, offered variant readings and emendations to the Alcuin
    Vulgate text used at Paris. St. Thomas relied on these for his textual
    criticism, not on a direct study of the manuscripts.

    References to pagan authors are also found in St. Thomas’ lectures on
    Scripture, though he was more hesitant in this practice than his
    contemporaries. Cicero, Ovid, Seneca, Plato, Democritus, the Stoics and
    others are interspersed in the commentaries. The one recurrent figure is, of
    course, Aristotle; his appearances nearly double all the rest put together.
    Aquinas was in the best Augustinian tradition when he affirmed that... the

    finds it.”

    God in a systematic and continuous manner. To this teaching he set aside the

    Each book was preceded by a prologue or introduction in which the
    authorship, subject matter and purpose of the writing was discussed with the
    aid of a scriptural quotation in which these were all supposed to be at
    least figuratively contained. From Guerric of St. Quentin Thomas adopted the
    custom of occasionally doing this within the framework of the four causes,
    formal and material, final and efficient. At other times he borrowed the
    introductory procedure of the grammarians and speaks of the matter,
    intention, and utility of the book. When he alluded to the author as the
    efficient cause, it is interesting to note that he never bothered to qualify
    the statement by adding “instrumental.”

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next came the commentaries proper with their divisions of the text,
    explanations, questions and replies. The familiar austerity and no-nonsense
    quality of Scholastic Latin is heightened in many of the lectures that have
    been preserved. St. Thomas’ commentaries fall into two groups. The first are
    expositiones, they were written by Aquinas himself or dictated outside of
    classes. In this category belong his commentaries on Isaias, Job, Jeremias,
    and Lamentations, the letter to the Romans, the first five chapters of St.
    John’s Gospel and the first seven on 1 Corinthians. The second group are
    termed <i>lecturae</i>, they are transcriptions or <i>reportationes</i> of
    the actual lectures he gave. With the exception of his very first
    commentary, that on St. Matthew, all the other <i>lecturae</i> were taken
    down by St. Thomas’ intimate companion and friend, Reginald of Piperno. Here
    belong his commentaries on St. John and the Pauline letters, possibly also
    those on the Psalms. That his <i>lecturae</i> on Romans and 1 Corinthians
    (1-10) are missing suggest that he may have used the <i>reportationes</i> in
    composing his expositions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The system of transcribing lectures was practiced throughout the twelfth and
    thirteenth centuries. No pretence at style was made; quotations were usually
    abruptly recorded without introduction and the references were normally left
    for the master to fill in later. University statutes required that a master
    correct the reports personally before they were published. The Official
    Catalogue of St. Thomas’ writings mentions that he corrected and approved of
    Reginald’s transcription of his lectures on St. John, and the catalogues of
    Tolomeo of Lucca (perhaps the earliest catalogue of his writings) and
    Bernard Gui state that Thomas also corrected the transcriptions of his
    lectures on St. Paul’s epistles.

    <i>Characteristics of St. Thomas’ Exegesis</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In the field of spiritual exegesis Thomas Aquinas exhibits a marked
    restraint when compared to interpreters such as Richard of St. Victor or
    Stephen Langton, and, to a less extent, in comparison with Hugh of St. Cher
    or St. Bonaventure. Conformable to custom, he differentiated plainly between
    the literal and spiritual when he was going to offer more than a literal
    exegesis of the text. Normally, these two were designated as “literal” and
    “mystical” respectively—although it may be closer to his mind to translate
    his <i>mystice</i> by “symbolically.” He was careful not to skip over the
    things which the words of Scripture immediately designate, the spiritual can
    only be constructed on a sound knowledge of the literal sense. Yet he had no
    guides as to when these things were actually used by God to signify some
    further reality. A result was that he he frequently followed patristic
    sources and saw spiritual meanings in minor events.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For example, the fig tree under which Nathaniel slept (Jn. 1:48) may be
    symbolically understood with St. Augustine as sin, or with St. Gregory as
    the Old Covenant. Our Lord’s words in John (11:7) “Let us go into Judea
    again,” symbolically proclaim the final conversion of the Jews. The gold,
    frankincense and myrrh of the Magi symbolize three different aspects of
    faith, deeds, and contemplation respectively.

    With the Fathers, nevertheless, St. Thomas was able to attain deep
    theological insights, e.g., the feeding of the crowds in John (6)
    symbolically refers to mankind’s spiritual nourishment on wisdom; the bread
    of life is both God’s wisdom incarnate in Christ and the Eucharistic
    sacrament.

    When reading St. Thomas’ literal exegesis, especially of the Old Testament
    books, one must keep in mind his acceptance of Origen’s and Augustine’s
    teaching on the prophets and elders of Israel having an explicit faith in
    Christian mysteries. In his commentaries, Aquinas at least twice reproaches
    Theodore of Mopsuestia for supposedly denying that any Old Testament texts
    could refer literally to Christ or the Church:

    Another [error] was that of Theodore who claimed that nothing brought
    forward in the Old Testament is literally applicable to Christ but only
    accommodated to him... Hence, “That it might be fulfilled” would have to be
    interpreted as though the evangelist had said “That it might be

    Against this Thomas maintains that some passages have Christ alone as their

    however, relate directly to some Old Testament personage who is a figure of

    Occasions in which the literal sense had only a Christian mystery as its

    Aquinas was aware of the need for extreme pliability in the exegete;
    definitive solutions were few and far between. Thus he frequently will give
    more than one interpretation of it passage—his use of “either... or” to
    introduce them indicates that it is not a question of his opting for a
    multiplicity of literal senses in these situations. He presented them and
    would sometimes add that this one or that seemed better to him; at other

    The literary context must be accounted for in any interpretation. Both St.
    Augustine and Richard of St. Victor had counseled this. In his Prologue to
    the Psalms, Aquinas enumerates some of the literary forms in the Bible:
    narration, admonition, commands, exhortation, prayer, praise, proverb and
    parable. Thus Matthew’s gospel was intended for the Jews and conforms to
    their manner of speaking. John does not offer an exact repetition of our
    Lord’s words but strives to bring out their deeper significance.

    Since “Scripture speaks according to the notions of the people” to whom it
    is addressed, the historical and cultural context must also be investigated.
    St. Thomas displays an interest in this aspect of exegesis although his
    historical horizon was narrow and his sources negligible. He probably
    consulted Peter Comestor’s <i>Historica Scholastica</i> which had become a
    standard reference work.

    The dialectical cast of St. Thomas’ interpretation of the literal sense runs
    through every page. Syllogisms are disclosed in St. Paul and the correct
    sequence of thoughts is commended in St. John.

    The chief ingredient of this approach to the Bible is the omnipresent
    divisions and subdivisions. Introduced by Hugh St. Cher, the method was
    utilized by both St. Albert and St. Bonaventure as well as St. Thomas. In
    the twelfth century, commentaries were content to take one verse at a time
    and attempt to exhaust its literal and spiritual significance; the students
    did not get a feel for the book as a whole. The dialectical procedure
    enabled Aquinas to define the main theme of a book and then relate each of
    its parts to this unifying center. The divisions could become as arbitrary
    as allegorism had been, but modern scholarship renders justice to many of
    Thomas’precisions.

    Finally, the dominant note in his exegesis is its theological import. The
    schoolmen could not study the Word of God passively. Unequipped with the
    requisite philological and historical knowledge, they questioned the sacred
    text with the conceptions available to them. Exposition merges with
    disputation as theological objections are proposed and answered within the
    commentary. To interpret the book of Job literally is to engage in a living
    dialogue with it concerning the problems of evil and predestination, of
    providence and retribution. The Bible was not an historical curiosity to be
    approached like an antiquated museum piece. The reported vision Aquinas had
    of Sts. Peter and Paul coming to aid him in interpreting a particular text
    demonstrates the vivid reality this Book and its authors had for him and his
    companions.

    A danger existed in St. Thomas’ tendency to develop the literal sense rather
    than explain it. This was the price he had to pay in his efforts to
    demonstrate in his day that the speculative and scientific theology he was

    We are confronted with the fact that St. Thomas, a master in theology, took
    as the matter of his official course the text itself of Scripture, the Old
    and New Testaments... This is of major significance. Undoubtedly in the
    history of Thomism the <i>Summa Theologica</i> has monopolized all the
    attention... But it is precisely here that a grave problem arises, and the
    first condition for understanding and solving it is not to forget that the
    <i>Summa</i> is planted in the soil of the Scriptures, not merely by some
    species of devotion which gives its rational systematization a pious aspect,
    but because of the very law of its genesis. The university education of the
    thirteenth century will produce disputations and <i>Summae</i> only within
    the framework of Scriptural teaching. This is an apt pedagogical expression
    of the law of theology: It cannot become a science except in communion with
    the Word of God, which is listened to first of all for itself alone. A tree
    cut from its roots dies, even though it remains standing.

    The Masters of the Sacred Page in thirteenth century Paris inherited from
    their predecessors a deep devotion to St. Paul. Thomas Aquinas made no
    secret of it. His commentaries on the Pauline letters practically double
    those on any other sacred author. He apparently intended to go over the
    letters a second time, converting the transcribed <i>lecturae</i> into
    expositions—some even hold that his redactions of Romans and 1 Corinthians
    were the result of an uncompleted second series of public lectures on Paul.

    If the Psalter and the letters of St. Paul are the two most frequently used
    writings in the Liturgy, it may well be because “in both nearly the whole of
    theological teaching is contained.” Aquinas praises the Apostle to the

    was full of the Christ whose mysteries he proclaimed to all men.

    Everyone agrees in situating the first series of lectures on St. Paul within

    most other scholars prefer the earlier part of this period, from 1259 to
    1265, as the most likely time of the lectures. This would mean that the
    majority of them were given while Thomas was teaching at the court of Urban

    could range from one to four and possibly five—no probable dates for
    lectures on individual letters can be offered. If he followed the sequence

    chronological order—the letter to the Ephesians would have fallen in the
    middle of his course. Thus a <i>caeteris paribus</i> guess, which carries
    little weight in historical matters, would place his Ephesian lectures
    between 1261 to 1263 if Mandonnet is followed, or 1266 in Synave’s scheme.

    In developing the main theme of his lectures on Ephesians, the unity of the
    faithful in Christ, Aquinas continually pointed out the central position of
    Christ in salvation-history. The whole of Chapter One pivots around the
    blessings which men have received in Christ. Through him we are chosen,
    predestined, and adopted as God’s children, worthy to partake of eternal
    beatitude and bodily resurrection (Lect. 1). The Father loves us because he
    sees his own Son in us; only Christ can justify and save us (Lect. 2). The
    life-giving mystery revealed through the Apostles is the advent of God in
    Christ and the recapitulation of everything in Him (Lect. 3). The acceptance
    of this mystery in faith is dependent on Christ (Lect. 5).. As Christ is the
    model and form of our justice, so his exultation sets the pattern for
    mankind’s resurrection (Lect. 7). In this exultation Christ exercises a
    supreme fullness of power over the entire universe (Lect. 8).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This sets the stage for Chapter Two in which St. Thomas comments on the
    effects of Christ’s power. The slavery to sin in which Jew and pagan were
    plunged (Lect. 1) was destroyed by God’s unique mercy, justifying us in
    Christ (Lect. 2). Only Christ can accomplish this salvation (Lect. 3). The
    alienation between Jew and pagan (Lect. 4) was completely annihilated by the
    overpowering unification of mankind effected by the God-man (Lect. 5). Now
    all the races of men have access by Christ, in the Spirit, to the Father
    (<i>ibid.</i>). A new community of men is formed whose foundation is Christ
    (Lect. 6).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In the lectures on Chapter Three the special role of the Apostles in
    disseminating knowledge of this mystery is dis cussed. The blessings
    outlined in Chapters One and Two are reiterated in the context of this
    apostolic mission. Christ is Lord of history (Lect. 3), and the essence of
    our faith consists in affirming his true divinity and humanity (Lect. 5) The
    moral exhortations and precepts of Chapters Four to Six are to assist the
    Ephesians in preserving the ecclesial unity Christ has established and
    strengthened by his gifts. St Thomas certainly cannot be accused of failing
    to impress on his students the profoundly Christological nature of mankind’s
    return to God. If later Thomists are justly reprimanded for this, it is only
    insofar as they have failed to sink the roots of their theology as deeply
    into the Word of God as their master did.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The lectures on Ephesians exhibit all the characteristics of Thomas’
    exegesis. The Prologue considers the four causes of the letter while
    allegorizing on a verse from Psalm 74. Parallel passages from other parts of
    Scripture are generously sprinkled throughout the commentary. Since it is a
    transcription or <i>reportatio</i> by Reginald, these quotations are often
    jotted down without any introductory phrase linking them to the previous
    thought. Yet the connection is not difficult to perceive in the majority of
    cases since they merely substantiate or illustrate what preceded.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Aquinas’ typically thirteenth century interest in the theological import of
    the biblical text is evident on every page. Though few in number,
    similarities to the twelfth century biblical-moral school of exegesis can
    also be detected.

    Thus, in Lecture 4 of Chapter One he describes how civil elections were
    performed at his time. A contemporary maxim is quoted in Lecture 6 of
    Chapter Five when Thomas assures his students that the caution St. Paul was
    recommending had nothing in common with that advised in the saying “si non
    caste, tamen caute.” An echo of Stephen Langton’s concern for refrom can be
    heard in his categorical statement that bishops, the successors of the
    Apostles, are to leave temporal administration to deacons since their
    spiritual duties are a full time job (Ch. 4, Lect. 4). The observation must
    have met with a rather cool reception at the papal court in Orvieto where it
    was probably made.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Dialectical procedures are well represented. Objections and answers
    regarding the Apostle’s thought are frequent, and in Chapter Five we are
    told how Paul demonstrated one of his minor (Lect. 3) and major premises
    (Lect. 5). The general lines of St. Thomas’ divisions of the letter to the
    Ephesians are excellent; they compare well with those given by modem
    exegetes.

    St.,Thomas once symbolized his attitude before the mysteries of God’s Word
    in an allegory on Jacob and the angel. It reveals the paradox of Aquinas,
    the theologian’s insatiable curiosity before mystery and the mystic’s
    profound reverence before the Infinite. Here we glimpse the restless spirit
    hidden beneath the unattractive and arid cadences of a school man’s language
    and methods:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in">
    The whole night they wrestled, muscles straining, neither yielding; but at
    daybreak the angel disappeared, apparently leaving the field clear to his
    adversary. But Jacob then felt a violent pain in his thigh. He was left
    wounded and limping. It is thus that the theologian grapples with the
    mystery when God brings him face to face with it. He is taut, like a bent
    bow, grappling with human language; he struggles like a wrestler; he even
    seems to win the mastery. But then he feels a weakness, a weakness at once
    painful and consoling, for to be thus defeated is in fact the proof that his
    combat was divine.

      each lecture, where the divisions of the text are given, the lack of any
      system of verse enumeration obliged Aquinas to quote the first few words
      of each of the passages pertaining to the subdivisions he was making. To
      avoid needless repetition I have substituted, in parentheses, the chapter
      and verse numbers of these quotations. The laconic abruptness of
      Reginald’s transcription has been mitigated only to the extent of adding
      bracketed words or phrases, not found in the original, in order to form a
      complete sentence or clarify a hazy reference.</span

    Technical Latin words are given in either notes or brackets whenever it
    seemed advisable to depart from the accustomed way of rendering them in
    English. At times, the ponderous and repetitive introductory phrases are
    shortened, for instance, “Concerning which it must be known that...,” might
    read “Note that this...” Throughout the work my objective has been to
    produce as accurate and readable a translation as circumstances and ability
    permit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    The notes provide the references in the pagan, patristic and medieval
    authors whom St. Thomas quotes or alludes to in his commentary. In them I
    have also explained, however briefly and inadequately, some points in
    Aquinas’ teaching which he happens to illustrate or presuppose in the course
    of a lecture. These range from cosmology and psychology to metaphysics and
    speculative theology. Further developments of an insight have also been
    indicated, or how the results of his inquiry compare with those of more
    recent studies.

    In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Fathers Charles
    English, O.C.S.O., and Emmanuel Rodriguez, O.C.S.O., and Brother John
    Kohlreiser, O.C.S.O., for assisting me with the reference material. I am

    Gallagher for their helpful suggestions and encouragement.
