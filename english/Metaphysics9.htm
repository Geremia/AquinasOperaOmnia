        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 1045b 27-1046a 35

      <p>
        742. We have dealt then with the primary kind of being and the one to
        which all the other categories of being are referred, namely, substance.
        For it is in reference to the concept of substance that the other
        categories are called beings, i.e., quantity, quality, and others which
        are spoken of in this way; for all involve the concept of substance, as
        we have stated in our first discussions (562). And since being is used
        in one sense of quiddity or quantity or quality, and in another sense of
        potency and actuality and activity, let us now establish the truth about
        potency and actuality. And first let us consider potency in the most
        proper sense of the term, although not the one most useful for our
        present purpose; for potency and actuality are found in more things than
        those which are referred merely to motion. But when we have spoken about
        this sense of potency we shall, in our discussions about actuality, also
        explain the other senses of potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        743. That the terms potency and can are used in many senses we have made
        evident elsewhere (467). And all of those senses of potency which are
        equivocal may be dismissed; for some senses of potency [or power] are
        merely figurative, as in geometry. And we say that things are possible
        or impossible because they either are or are not in some particular way.
        But all those potencies belonging to the same species are principles and
        are referred to one primary kind of potency, which is the principle of
        change in some other thing inasmuch as it is other. For one kind is a
        potency for being acted upon, which is in the patient and is the
        principle of its being passively moved by another inasmuch as it is
        other; and another kind of potency is the state of insusceptibility to
        change for the worse and to corruption by some other thing inasmuch as
        it is other, i.e., by a principle of change. And the intelligible
        character of the primary kind of potency is found in all of these terms.
        Again, these potencies are said to be potencies either just for acting
        or for being acted upon, or for acting or being acted upon well, so that
        in these latter kinds of potencies the notes of the prior kind are
        somehow present.
      </p>
      <p>
        744. It is evident, then, that in one sense the potency for acting and
        for being acted upon are one; for a thing is potential both because it
        itself has the potency for being acted upon, and because something else
        can be acted upon by it. And in another sense these potencies are
        different; for the one is in the patient, since it is because it has a
        principle, and because matter is a principle, that the patient is acted
        upon and changed by something else. For what is oily is capable of being
        burnt, and what is yielding in some way is capable of being broken (and
        the supposit is capable of being expressed);’ and the same is true in
        other cases. And another kind of potency is in the agent, as the potency
        to heat and the potency to build-the former in the thing capable of
        heating, and the latter in the person capable of building. Hence,
        inasmuch as a thing is by nature a unity, it cannot be acted upon by
        itself; for it is one thing and not also something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        745. And incapacity or impossibility is the privation contrary to such
        potency, so that every potency and incapacity belong to the same subject
        and refer to the same attribute. And there are various kinds of
        privation; for there is one kind of privation when a thing does not have
        some attribute which it is naturally disposed to have, either in
        general, or when it is naturally disposed to have it. And this is so
        either in a particular way, for example, completely, or even in any way
        at all. And in some cases if things are naturally disposed to have some
        attribute and do not have it as a result of force, we say that they are
        deprived of it.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Different kinds of potency</i></p>
      <p>
        1768. Having established the truth about being as divided into the ten
        categories, the Philosopher’s aim here is to establish the truth about
        being as divided into potency and actuality. This is divided into two
        parts. In the first he links up this discussion with the foregoing one,
        and explains what he intends to do in this book. In the second (1773) he
        carries out his announced plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly points out, first, that he has already discussed above
        the primary kind of being to which all the other categories of being are
        referred, namely, <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span>. And
        he explains that all the other categories are referred to substance as
        the primary kind of being, because all other beings— quantity, quality,
        and the like—involve the concept of substance. For being is said of
        quantity because it is the measure of substance; and of quality because
        it is a certain disposition of substance; and the same thing applies in
        the case of the other categories. This is evident from the fact that all
        accidents involve the concept of substance, since in the definition of
        any accident it is necessary to include its proper subject; for example,
        in the definition of <i>snub</i> it is necessary to include nose. This
        was made clear at the beginning of Book VII (1347).
      </p>
      <p>
        1769. But being is variously divided. (1) One division is based on its
        designation as whatness (i.e., substance), quantity or quality, which is
        its division into
        <span style="font-weight: bold">the ten categories</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Another is its division into
        <span style="font-weight: bold">potency and actuality</span> or
        activity, from which the word actuality [or act] is derived, as is
        explained later on (1805). And for this reason it is now necessary to
        deal with potency and actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1770. It is first necessary to speak of potency in its most proper
        sense, although not the one which is most useful for our present
        purpose. For potency and actuality are referred in most cases to things
        in motion, because motion is the actuality of a being in potency. But
        the principal aim of this branch of science is to consider potency and
        actuality, not insofar as they are found in mobile beings, but
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >insofar as they accompany being in general</span
        >. Hence potency and actuality are also found in immobile beings, for
        example, in intellectual ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        1771. And when we shall have spoken about the potency found
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">in mobile things</span>, and
        about its corresponding actuality, we will also be able to explain
        potency and actuality insofar as they are found in the intelligible
        things classed as separate substances, which are treated later on
        (1867). This order is a fitting one, since
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">sensible</span> things, which
        are in motion, are
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">more evident</span> to us, and
        therefore by means of them we may attain a knowledge of the substances
        of immobile things.
      </p>
      <p>1773. <b>That the terms</b> (743).</p>
      <p>
        Then he deals with potency and actuality; and this is divided into three
        parts. In the first he discusses potency; and in the second (1823),
        actuality; and in the third (1844), the relationship of actuality to
        potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. In the first of these he discusses
        potency itself. In the second (1787) he discusses potency in relation to
        the things in which it is found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. In the first he deals with potency;
        and in the second (1784), with incapacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains the
        different senses of potency. Second (1781), he makes evident a truth
        about potency from the things previously laid down.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that it has been shown elsewhere, i.e., in
        Book V of this work (954) that the words potency and can have a
        multiplicity of meanings. But in some cases this multiplicity is a
        multiplicity of equivocation, and in others it is a multiplicity of
        analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For (1) some things are said to be capable or incapable because they
        have some principle (+) within themselves, and this refers to those
        senses in which all potencies are said to be such not equivocally but
        <span style="font-weight: bold">analogously</span>. (2) But other things
        are not said to be capable or able because of some principle which they
        have (~) within themselves; and in their case the term potency is used
        <span style="font-weight: bold">equivocally</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1774. Therefore, with regard to those senses in which the term potency
        is used <span style="font-weight: bold">equivocally</span>, he says that
        these must be dismissed for the present. For the term potency is
        referred to some things, not because of some principle which they have,
        but in a figurative sense, (1) as is done in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">geometry</span>; for the square of a
        line is called its power (<i>potentia</i>), and a line is said to be
        capable of becoming its square. (2) And similarly in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">numbers</span> it can be said that the
        number three is capable of becoming the number nine, which is its
        square; because when the number three is multiplied by itself the number
        nine results, for three times three makes nine; and when a line, which
        is the root of a square, is multiplied by itself, a square results. And
        the same thing applies in the case of numbers. Hence the root of a
        square bears some likeness to the matter from which a thing is made; and
        for this reason the root is said to be capable of becoming its square as
        matter is capable of becoming a thing.

        1775. And (3) similarly in the considerations of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">logic</span> we say that some things are
        possible or impossible, not because of some potency, but because they
        either are or are not in some way; for those things are called possible
        whose opposites can be true, whereas those are called impossible whose
        opposites cannot be true. This difference depends on the relationship of
        predicate to subject, because sometimes the predicate is repugnant to
        the subject, as in the case of impossible things, and sometimes it is
        not, as in the case of possible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1776. Passing over these senses of potency, then, we must consider those
        potencies which are reduced to one species, because each of these is a
        principle. And all potencies spoken of in this sense are reduced to some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">principle</span> from which all the
        others derive their meaning; and this is an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">active</span> principle, which is the
        source of change in some other thing inasmuch as it is other. He says
        this because it is possible for an active principle to be at the same
        time in the mobile or patient, as when something moves itself; although
        it is not mover and moved, or agent and patient, in the same respect.
        Hence the principle designated as active potency is said to be a
        principle of change in some other thing
        <span style="font-weight: bold">inasmuch as it is other</span>; because,
        even though an active principle can be found in the same thing as a
        passive principle, this still does not happen insofar as it is the same,
        but insofar as it is other.
      </p>
      <p>
        1777. That the other potencies are reduced to this principle which is
        called <span style="font-weight: bold">active potency</span> is evident;
        for in one sense passive potency means the principle by which one thing
        is moved by some other thing inasmuch as it is other. He says this
        because, even if the same thing might be acted upon by itself, this
        still does not happen insofar as it is the same, but insofar as it is
        other. Now this potency is reduced to a first active potency, because
        when anything undergoes change this is caused by an agent. And for this
        reason passive potency is also reduced to active potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        1778. In another sense potency means a certain state of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">insusceptibility</span> (or
        impossibility) “to change for the worse,” i.e., a disposition whereby a
        thing is such that it cannot undergo change for the worse; i.e., that it
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >cannot undergo corruption as a result of some other thing</span
        >
        “inasmuch as it is other,” namely, by a principle of change which is an
        active principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        1779. Now it is evident that both of these senses of potency imply
        something <span style="font-weight: bold">within us</span> which is
        referred to the undergoing of a change. For (1) in the one sense the
        term designates a principle by reason of which someone
        <span style="font-weight: bold">cannot be acted upon</span>; and (2) in
        the other sense it designates a principle by reason of which someone
        <span style="font-weight: bold">can be acted upon</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, since the state of being acted upon depends on action, the
        definition “of the primary kind of potency,” namely,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">active</span> potency, must be given in
        the definition of both senses of potency. Thus these two senses of
        potency are reduced to the first, namely, to active potency, as to
        something prior.
      </p>
      <p>
        1780. Again, in another sense potencies are spoken of not only in
        relation to acting and being acted upon but in relation to what is done
        <span style="font-weight: bold">well</span> in each case. For example,
        we say that someone is capable of walking, not because he can walk in
        any way at all, but because he can walk well; and in an opposite sense
        we say of one who limps that he cannot walk. Similarly, we say that wood
        is capable of being burned because it can be burned easily; but we say
        that green wood is incapable of being burned because it cannot be burned
        easily. Hence it is clear that in the definitions of those potencies
        which are described as potencies for acting and being acted upon well,
        there are included the concepts of those primary potencies which were
        described as potencies for acting and being acted upon without
        qualification; for example, to act is included in to act and to be acted
        upon is included in to be acted upon well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence it is obvious that all of these senses of potency are reduced to
        one primary sense, namely, to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">active</span> potency; and therefore it
        is also evident that this multiplicity is not the multiplicity of
        equivocation but of <span style="font-weight: bold">analogy</span>.
      </p>
      <p>1781. <b>It is evident, then</b> (744).</p>
      <p>
        From what has been said he now indicates something that is true about
        the foregoing potencies. He says that in one sense the potency for
        acting and that for being acted upon are one, and in another sense they
        are not. (1) They are <span style="font-weight: bold">one</span> potency
        if the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >relationship of the one to the other</span
        >
        is considered; for one is spoken of in reference to the other. For a
        thing can be said to have a potency for being acted upon, either because
        it has of itself a potency by which it may be acted upon, or because it
        has a potency by which something else may be acted upon by it. And in
        this second sense active potency is the same as passive potency; for by
        reason of the fact that a thing has active potency it has a power by
        which something else may be acted upon by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1782. (2) However, if these two potencies—active and passive—are taken
        in reference to the
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">subject</span> in which they
        are found, then in this sense active and passive potency are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">different</span>; for passive potency
        exists in a patient, since a patient is acted upon by reason of some
        principle existing within itself; and matter is of this sort. Now
        passive potency is nothing but the principle by which one thing is acted
        upon by another; for example, to be burned is to undergo a change, and
        the material principle by reason of which a thing is capable of being
        burned is the oily or the fat. Hence the potency itself is present as a
        passive principle in the thing capable of being burned. And similarly
        what yields to the thing touching it so that it receives an impression
        from it, as wax or something of this sort, is capable of doing so
        inasmuch as it is impressionable. “And the supposit,” i.e., the male, is
        the proper subject of the modification resulting in an eunuch. The same
        is true of other things which are acted upon insofar as they have within
        themselves a principle for being acted upon, which is called passive
        potency. But active potency is in the agent, as heat in the thing which
        heats and the art of building in the builder.
      </p>
      <p>
        1783. And since active potency and passive potency are present in
        different things, it is obvious that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >nothing is acted upon by itself inasmuch as it is naturally disposed
          to act or to be acted upon</span
        >. However, it is possible for something to be acted upon by itself
        accidentally, as a physician heals himself not inasmuch as he is a
        physician but inasmuch as he is ill. But in this case a thing is not
        acted upon by itself, because, properly speaking, one of the aforesaid
        principles is present in one and the same thing, and not the other. For
        the principle of being acted upon is not present in the one having the
        principle of action except accidentally, as has been said (1782).
      </p>
      <p>1784. <b>And incapacity</b> (745).</p>
      <p>
        Here he establishes the truth about
        <span style="font-weight: bold">incapacity</span>, saying that
        incapacity (which is the contrary of the above-mentioned potency or
        capacity) or impossibility (which is referred to incapacity of this
        sort) is the <i>privation</i> of the potency in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he says this to distinguish it from the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">impossible</span> which signifies some
        mode of falsity, which is not referred to any incapacity, just as the
        possible is also not referred to any potency. For since privation and
        possession belong to the same subject and refer to the same attribute,
        potency and incapacity must belong to the same subject and refer to the
        same attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence there are as many senses of incapacity as there are of potency, to
        which it is opposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        1785. But it must be noted that the term privation is used in many
        senses. For in one sense whatever does not have some attribute can be
        said to be deprived of it, as when we say that a stone is deprived of
        sight because it does not have sight; and in another sense a thing is
        said to be deprived only of what it can have and does not have. And this
        may happen in two ways: in one way when the thing does not have it at
        all, as a dog is said to be deprived of sight when it does not have it;
        and, in another way, if it does not have it when it is naturally
        disposed to have it. Hence a dog is not said to be deprived of sight
        before the ninth day. This sense of privation is again divided. For in
        one sense a thing is said to be deprived of some attribute because it
        does not have it in a particular way, namely, completely and well; as
        when we say that someone who does not see well is blind. And in another
        sense a thing is said to be deprived of some attribute when it does not
        have it in any way at all; for example, we say that a person is deprived
        of sight who does not have sight at all. But sometimes force is included
        in the notion of privation, and then we say that some things are
        deprived of certain attributes when those which they are naturally
        disposed to have are removed by force.<br /></p

      <p>
        746. And since some such principles are present in non-living things,
        and others in living things and in the soul, and in the soul having
        reason, it is evident that some potencies will be devoid of reason and
        others will be rational. And for this reason all the arts and productive
        sciences are potencies; for they are principles of change in some other
        thing inasmuch as it is other.
      </p>
      <p>
        747. And all those potencies which are rational are open to contrary
        determinations, and those which are irrational are each determined to
        one thing; for example, what is hot is capable of heating, whereas the
        medical art is concerned with both sickness and health.
      </p>
      <p>
        748. And the reason of this is that science is a conception [or rational
        plan], and the same conception explains both a thing and its privation,
        though not in the same way. And in one sense it is a conception of both,
        and in another it applies rather to the existent thing. Hence it is
        necessary that such sciences should deal with contraries, but with one
        directly and with the other indirectly; for the conception applies to
        one essentially, but to the other in a kind of accidental way, because
        it explains the contrary by negation and removal. For the contrary is
        the primary privation, and this is the removal of the other term.
      </p>
      <p>
        749. Moreover, since contraries do not exist in the same subject, and
        since a science is a potency in a being which possesses a rational plan,
        and the soul has a principle of motion, it follows that, while what is
        healthful produces only health, and what is capable of heating produces
        only heat, and what is capable of cooling produces only cold, one who
        has a science may be occupied with both contraries. For reason extends
        to both but not in the same manner, and it exists in a soul which
        possesses a principle of motion Hence the soul will initiate both by the
        same principle by joining both to the same rational plan. And for this
        reason those things whose potency is rational produce effects contrary
        to those whose potency is irrational; for one principle of contrary
        determinations is contained in the rational plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        750. It is also evident that a potency for doing something well involves
        the potency of merely doing something or undergoing some change. But the
        latter does not always involve the former; for he who does a thing well
        must do it, but he who does something need not do it well.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Subjects of potency</i></p>
      <p>
        1786. Having explained the different senses in which the term potency is
        used, here the Philosopher establishes the truth about potency in
        relation to the things in which it is found. This is divided into two
        parts. In the first (1786) he shows how these potencies differ from each
        other on the basis of a difference in their subjects. In the second
        (1795) he shows how potency and actuality are simultaneous or not in a
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows how
        potencies differ on the basis of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">difference in their subjects</span>. He
        says that, since potencies are principles both for acting and being
        acted upon, some of these principles are in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">non-living</span> things and some in
        living ones. And since
        <span style="font-weight: bold">living</span> things are composed of
        body and soul, and the principles for acting and being acted upon which
        are present in the body of living things do not differ from those in
        non-living ones, he therefore adds “and in the soul,” because the
        principles of action which are present in the soul clearly differ from
        those present in non-living things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1787. Again, there are several kinds of souls, and many of these do not
        differ to any great extent both in acting and in being acted upon from
        non-living things which act by natural instinct; for the parts of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nutritive and sentient</span> soul act
        by natural impulse. Now only the rational part of the soul has dominion
        over its acts, and it is in this respect that it differs from non-living
        things. Therefore, having pointed out the difference between souls, he
        adds “and in the soul having reason,” because those principles of living
        things which are found in the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational</span> part of the soul differ
        specifically from those of non-living things. Hence it is evident that
        some powers of the soul are irrational and others rational.
      </p>
      <p>
        1788. He explains what he means by those which are rational, when he
        adds that (1) “all the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">productive</span> arts,” as the building
        and constructive arts and the like, whose actions pass over into (+)
        external matter, and (2) all sciences which do not perform actions that
        pass over into (~) external matter, as the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">moral</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">logical</span> sciences—all arts of this
        kind, I say, are <i>powers</i>. And this is concluded from the fact that
        they are principles of change in some other thing inasmuch as it is
        other. This is the definition of active power, as is clear from what was
        said above.
      </p>
      <p>1789. <b>And all those</b> (747).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives the difference between the above-mentioned potencies.
        He says that the same rational potencies are (+) open to contrary
        determinations as the art of medicine, which is a potency, as has been
        explained (1404-7), can produce both health and sickness.
      </p>
      <p>
        But irrational potencies are not (~) open to contrary determinations,
        but properly speaking each is determined to one thing; for example, the
        heat of the sun has as its proper effect to heat, although it can be the
        cause of coldness inasmuch as by opening the pores it causes the loss of
        internal heat; or by absorbing the matter of a hot humor it destroys the
        heat and thereby cools.
      </p>
      <p>1790. <b>And the reason</b> (748).</p>
      <p>
        Then the Philosopher gives the reason for the aforesaid difference, and
        it is as follows: a <span style="font-weight: bold">science</span>,
        which is a rational potency, is a conception of the thing known existing
        in the mind. Now the same conception explains both the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">thing and its privation</span>, although
        not in the same way, because it first makes known the existing thing and
        subsequently its privation; for example, the power of sight itself is
        known properly by means of the notion of sight, and then blindness is
        known, which is nothing but the very lack of sight in a thing naturally
        disposed to have it. Hence, if science is a conception of the thing
        known existing in the mind, the same science must deal with
        contraries—with one primarily and properly, and with the other
        secondarily; for example, the art of medicine is cognitive and
        productive primarily of health and secondarily of sickness, because, as
        has been pointed out, this art has to do with the conception of the
        thing known in the mind, and this conception is of one of the contraries
        directly and of the other indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        1791. And since the remarks which the Philosopher had made above about
        privation he afterwards transferred to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">contraries</span>, he shows that the
        same conception applies to a contrary and to a privation; for just as a
        privation is explained by negation and removal (for example, the removal
        of sight explains blindness), in a similar fashion a contrary is
        explained by negation and removal; because privation, which is merely
        the removal of some attribute, is a sort of first principle among
        contraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        For in the case of all contraries one stands as something perfect and
        the other as something imperfect and the privation of the former; black,
        for example, is the privation of white, and cold is the privation of
        heat. Thus it is evident that the same science extends to contraries.
      </p>
      <p>1792. <b>Moreover, since</b> (749).</p>
      <p>
        He next develops this point, and he begins to give the reason for the
        aforesaid difference. For it is clear that natural things act by reason
        of the forms present in them. But contrary forms cannot exist in the
        same subject. Therefore it is impossible for the same natural thing to
        produce contrary effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But science is a potency for acting and a principle of motion, because a
        person has an idea of the thing to be made and this principle of motion
        is in the mind. And since this is so it follows that natural things
        produce only one effect; for example, what is healthful produces only
        health, and what is capable of heating produces only heat, and what is
        capable of cooling produces only cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        But one who acts by science may be occupied with both contraries,
        because the conception of both contained in the soul is the same; for
        the soul possesses the principle of such motion, although not in the
        same way, as has been explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        1793. Therefore, just as a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">natural</span> activity proceeds to
        bring about its effect as though it were united to its form, which is
        the principle of action whose likeness remains in the effect, in a
        similar fashion the <span style="font-weight: bold">soul</span> by its
        activity proceeds to bring about both opposites “by the same principle,”
        i.e., by the conception which is one for the two opposites, uniting both
        motions to this principle and causing both to terminate in it inasmuch
        as the likeness of this principle is verified in both of the opposites
        brought into being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore it is evident that rational powers produce an effect opposite
        to irrational powers, because a rational power produces contrary
        effects, whereas an irrational power produces only one effect. The
        reason is that a single principle of contrary effects is contained in
        the conception belonging to a science, as has been explained.
      </p>
      <p>1794. <b>It is also evident</b> (750).</p>
      <p>
        He explains the relationship of some of the senses of potency mentioned
        above to those which come under them. For it was stated above that a
        thing is said to have active or passive potency, sometimes only because
        it can act or be acted upon, and sometimes because it can act or be
        acted upon well. Therefore he says that the potency for acting or being
        acted upon well involves the potency for acting or being acted upon, but
        not the reverse. For it follows that someone acts if he acts well, but
        the opposite of this is not true.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapters 3 & 4: 1046b 29-1047b 30
      </p>
      <p>
        751. There are some, such as the members of the Megaric school, who say
        that a thing has a potency for acting only when it is acting, and that
        when it is not acting it does not have this potency; for example, one
        who is not building does not have the power of building, but only one
        who is building when he is building; and it is the same in other cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        752. It is not difficult to see the absurd consequences of this
        position. For it is evident, according to this view, that a man will not
        be a builder if he is not building, because to be a builder is to be
        able to build. The same is true in the case of the other arts.
        Therefore, if it is impossible to have such arts unless one has at some
        time learnt and acquired them, and if it is impossible not to have them
        unless one has at some time lost them (either through forgetfulness or
        through some change or through the passage of time; for this cannot
        occur as a result of the object being destroyed, since it always
        exists), when one will have ceased to use an art he will not have it;
        and yet he will be able to build forthwith, thus somehow getting it back
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        753. And the same thing will be true in the case of non-living things;
        for neither the cold nor the hot nor the sweet nor the bitter nor any
        sensible thing will exist in any way at all if they are not being
        sensed. Hence they will have to maintain the theory that Protagoras did.
      </p>
      <p>
        754. In fact nothing will have senses unless it is sensing or acting.
        Therefore, if that is blind which does not have the power of sight,
        though it is designed by nature to have it, and when it is designed by
        nature to have it, and so long as it exists, the same persons will be
        blind many times during the day; and deaf as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        755. Further, if what is deprived of a potency is incapable, it will be
        impossible for that to come into being which has not yet been generated;
        but he who says that what cannot possibly be generated either is or will
        be, is in error; for this is what impossible or incapable means. Hence
        these theories do away with both motion and generation; for what is
        standing will always stand, and what is sitting will always sit, because
        if it is sitting it will not get up, since it is impossible for anything
        to get up which has no possibility of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        756. Therefore, if it is impossible to maintain this, it is evident that
        potency and actuality are distinct. But these views make potency and
        actuality the same, and for this reason it is no small thing which they
        seek to destroy. Hence it is possible for a thing to be capable of being
        and yet not be, and for a thing not to be and yet be capable of being.
        And it is similar in the case of the other categories; for example, a
        thing may be capable of walking and yet not walk, and be capable of not
        walking and yet walk.
      </p>
      <p>
        757. Moreover, a thing has a potency if there is nothing impossible in
        its having the actuality of that of which it is said to have the
        potency. I mean, for example, that if a thing is capable of sitting, and
        it turns out to be sitting, there will be nothing impossible in its
        having a sitting position; and it is similar if it is capable of being
        moved or of moving something, or of standing or causing a thing to
        stand, or of being or coming to be, or of not being or not coming to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        758. And the word actuality, which is combined with entelechy, is
        extended chiefly from motion to other things; for actuality seems to be
        identified mainly with motion. And for this reason they do not assign
        motion to non-existent things, but they do assign the other categories.
        For example, non-existent things are considered the objects of intellect
        and desire but not to be in motion. And the reason is that they would
        have to exist actually even though they did not exist actually; for some
        non-existent things are potential. Yet they do not exist, because they
        do not exist in complete actuality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 4</p>
      <p>
        759. Now if what has been called potential or possible is such because
        something follows from it, it is evident that it cannot be true to say
        that a thing is possible but will not be, because things which cannot
        possibly be would then disappear. An example would be if someone,
        thinking that nothing is impossible, were to affirm that it is possible
        for the diagonal of a square to be commensurate, even though it is not
        commensurate; because nothing prevents a thing that is capable of being
        or of coming to be from not being or not coming to be. But this
        conclusion necessarily follows from the things laid down above. And if
        we suppose that which is not but is capable I of being, to be or to have
        come into being, nothing would be impossible. But in this case something
        impossible will occur; for it is impossible that a diagonal be
        commensurate. For to be false and to be impossible are not the same; for
        while it is false that you are now standing, it is not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        760. And at the same time it is evident that, if when A exists B must
        exist, then if A is possible B must be possible; for if it is not
        necessary that B be possible, there is nothing to prevent its not being
        possible. Therefore, let A be possible. And if A is possible, then when
        A is possible, if A is assumed to exist, nothing impossible follows, but
        B necessarily exists. But this was supposed to be impossible. Therefore,
        let B be impossible. Then if B must be impossible, A must be so. But the
        first was supposed to be impossible; therefore so also is the second.
        Hence, if A is possible, B will be possible also, i.e., if they are so
        related that, when A exists, B must exist. Therefore, if when A and B
        are so related, B is not possible, then A and B will not be related in
        the way supposed. On the other hand, if, when A is possible, B must be
        possible, then if A exists, B must exist. For to say that B must be
        possible if A is possible, means that, if A exists both when it exists
        and in the way in which it is possible for it to exist, then B must also
        exist and exist in that way.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Objection 1: A thing has potency only when it is acting</i></p>
      <p>
        1795. Having compared one kind of potency with another in the above
        discussion, here the Philosopher begins to explain how potency and
        actuality are found in the same subject. This is divided into two parts.
        In the first he rejects the false opinions of some men. In the second
        (1815) he establishes the truth (“And since among”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. In the first part he rejects the
        opinion of those who said that a thing is possible or potential only
        when it is in a state of actuality. In the second part (1810) he rejects
        the opinion of those who maintain the reverse of this: that all things
        are potential or possible, even though they are not in a state of
        actuality (“Now if what”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he rejects the
        erroneous opinion referred to. Second (1804), he explains what it is to
        be potential or possible, and what it is to be actual (“Moreover, a
        thing”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he gives this
        opinion. Second (1796), he destroys it (“It is not difficult”). Third
        (1803), he draws his intended conclusion (“Therefore, if it”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that some said that a thing is in a state of
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >potency or capability only when it is acting</span
        >; for example, a man who is not actually building is incapable of
        building, but he is capable of building only when he is actually
        building; and they speak in a similar way about other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for this position seems to be that they thought that all
        things come about
        <span style="font-weight: bold">necessarily</span> because of some
        connection between causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus if all things come about necessarily, it follows that those things
        which do not, are <span style="font-weight: bold">impossible</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1796. <b>It is not difficult</b> (752).<br />
        Then he adduces arguments against the above opinion, and these reduce it
        to its absurd consequences. The first is as follows: to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">building</span> is to have the power or
        capability of building. Therefore, if no one has the power or capability
        of acting except when he is acting, no one is a builder except when he
        is building. And the same thing will be true of the other arts; for all
        arts are certain capabilities or potencies, as has been pointed out
        (1786). It follows, then, that no one will have an art except when he is
        exercising it.
      </p>

      <p>
        1797. But this is shown to be impossible if two assumptions are made.
        The first is this: if someone did not at first have an art, it would be
        impossible for him to have it later unless he had learned it or acquired
        it in some way, i.e., by discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        1798. The second assumption is that if someone had an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">art</span> it would be impossible for
        him not to have the same art later
        <span style="font-weight: bold">unless he lost it</span> in some way,
        either through forgetfulness or through some illness or through the
        passage of a long time during which the knowledge was not exercised; for
        this is the cause of forgetfulness. Now it cannot be that someone should
        lose an art as a result of the destruction of its object, as it
        sometimes happens that true knowledge is lost when a thing is changed;
        for example, when someone makes a true judgment that Socrates is
        sitting, his true judgment is destroyed when Socrates stands up. But
        this cannot be said about an art; for an art is not a knowledge of what
        exists, but of what is to be made; and so long as the matter from which
        an art can produce something continues to exist, the object of that art
        always exists. Hence an art cannot be lost when its object is destroyed,
        except in the ways mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        1799. Now from these two assumptions the Philosopher argues as follows:
        if a man does not have an art except when he is exercising it, then when
        he begins to exercise it he has it anew. Therefore he must either have
        learned it or acquired it in some other way. And similarly when he
        ceases to exercise an art it follows that he lacks that art, and thus he
        loses the art which he previously had either through forgetfulness or
        through some change or through the passage of time. But both of these
        are clearly false; and therefore it is not true that someone has a
        potency only when he is acting.
      </p>
      <p>1800. <b>And the same</b> (753).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which now has to do with the
        irrational principles present in non-living things, namely, hot and
        cold, sweet and bitter, and other qualities of this kind, which are
        active principles changing the senses and thus are potencies. Now if
        potency is present in a thing only when it is acting, it follows that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >nothing is hot or cold, sweet or bitter, and so forth, except when it
          is being sensed through a change in the senses</span
        >. But this is clearly false; for if it were true it would follow that
        Protagoras’ opinion would be true, since he said that all the properties
        and natures of things have existence only in being sensed and in being
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from this it would follow that contradictories would be true at the
        same time, since different men have contradictory opinions about the
        same thing. Now the Philosopher argued dialectically against this
        position above in Book IV (636). Therefore it is false that potency
        exists only when there is activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        1801. Here he gives the third argument, which is as follows:
        <span style="font-weight: bold">sense</span> is a kind of potency.
        Therefore, if potency exists only when there is activity, it follows
        that a man has sensory power only when he is sensing, for example, the
        power of sight or hearing. But one who does not have the power of sight
        although he is naturally disposed to have it is blind; and one who does
        not have the power of hearing is deaf. Hence he will be blind and deaf
        many times on the same day. But this is clearly false, for a blind man
        does not afterwards regain sight nor a deaf man hearing.
      </p>
      <p>1802. <b>Further, if what</b> (755).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth argument, which is as follows: it is impossible
        for a thing to act which does not have the power to act. Therefore, if
        one has a potency or power only when he is acting, it follows that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >when he is not acting it is impossible for him to act</span
        >. But whoever says that something incapable of happening either is or
        will be, is mistaken. This is evident from the meaning of the word
        impossible; for the impossible is said to be false because it cannot
        happen. It follows, then, that something which is not is incapable of
        coming to be in any way. And thus potency so understood will do away
        with motion and generation, because one who is standing will always
        stand, and one who is sitting will always sit. For if anyone is sitting,
        he will never stand afterwards, because so long as he is not standing he
        does not have the power to stand. Hence it is impossible for him to
        stand, and consequently it is impossible for him to get up. Similarly
        what is not white will be incapable of being white, and thus could not
        be made white. The same holds true in the case of all other things.
      </p>
      <p>1803. <b>Therefore, if</b> (756).</p>
      <p>
        He draws his intended conclusion, saying that, if the absurdities
        mentioned above cannot be admitted, it is obvious that potency and
        actuality are distinct. But those who hold the foregoing position make
        potency and actuality the same insofar as they say that something has
        potency only when it is in a state of actuality. And from this it is
        evident that they wish to remove from nature something of no little
        importance, for they eliminate motion and generation, as has been stated
        (1802). Hence, since this cannot be admitted, it is obvious that
        something is capable of being which yet is not, and that something is
        capable of not being which yet is. And “it is similar in the case of the
        other categories,” or predicaments, because it is possible from someone
        who is not walking to walk, and conversely it is possible from someone
        who is walking not to walk.
      </p>
      <p>1804. <b>Moreover, a thing</b> (757).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains what it is to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">potential</span> and what it is to be
        actual. First, he explains what it is to be potential. He says that that
        is said to be potential
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >from which nothing impossible follows when it is assumed to be
          actual</span
        >; for example, if one were to say that it is possible for someone to
        sit if nothing impossible follows when he is assumed to sit. And the
        same holds true of being moved and of moving something, and other cases
        of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>1805. <b>And the word “actuality”</b> (758).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he explains what it is to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">actual</span>. He says that the word
        actuality is used to signify <i>entelechy</i> and perfection, namely,
        the form, and other things of this kind, as any action at all, is
        derived properly from <span style="font-weight: bold">motion</span>, so
        far as the origin of the word is concerned. For since words are signs of
        intellectual conceptions, we first give names to those things which we
        first understand, even though they may be subsequent in the order of
        nature. Now of all acts which are perceived by us in a sensible way,
        motion is the best known and most evident to us; and therefore the word
        actuality was first referred to motion, and from motion the word was
        extended to other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1806. And for this reason motion is not attributed to (~) non-existent
        things, although certain of the other categories mentioned above are
        attributed to non-existents; for we say that non-existent things are
        intelligible, or thinkable, or even desirable, but we do not say that
        they are moved. For, since to be moved means to be actual, it follows
        that things which do not exist actually would exist actually; but this
        is obviously false. For even if some non-existent things are potential,
        they are still not said to be, since they are not actual.
      </p>
      <p><i>Objection 2: All things are possible.</i></p>
      <p>1807. <b>Now if what</b> (759).</p>
      <p>
        Having destroyed the opinion of those who claim that nothing is possible
        except when it is actual, the Philosopher now destroys the opposite
        opinion of those who claim
        <span style="font-weight: bold">that all things are possible</span>; and
        in regard to this he does two things. First, he destroys this opinion.
        Second (1810), he establishes a truth about the succession of possible
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that if it is true that a thing is said to
        be possible because something follows from it, inasmuch as the possible
        has been defined as that from which nothing impossible follows if it is
        assumed to exist, it is evident that the statements of some thinkers
        that anything is possible even if it never will be, cannot be true,
        since as a result of this position impossible things will be eliminated.
        For example, if one were to say that the diagonal of a square can be
        commensurate with a side, even though it is not commensurate with it
        (and one might speak in the same way about other impossible things), and
        not think that it is impossible for the diameter of a square to be
        commensurate with a side, those who maintain this position, I say, speak
        truly in one sense and in another they do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        1808. For there are some things which nothing will prevent us from
        designating as capable or possible of coming to be, even though they
        never will be or ever come to be; but this cannot be said of all things.
        Yet according to the doctrine laid down above, and which we are now to
        assume, only those things are capable of being or coming to be, even
        though they are not, from which nothing impossible follows when they ate
        posited. However, when it is posited that the diagonal of a square is
        commensurate, an impossible conclusion follows. Thus it cannot be said
        that it is possible for the diagonal to be commensurate, for it is not
        only false but impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1809. Now some things are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">false only but not impossible</span>, as
        that Socrates sits or that he stands. For to be false and to be
        impossible are not the same; for example, it is false that you are now
        standing, but it is not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore the foregoing opinion is true of some things, because some are
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >possible even though they are false</span
        >. However, it is not true of all things, because some are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">both false and impossible</span>.
      </p>
      <p>1810. <b>And at the same</b> (760).</p>
      <p>
        And since he had said that a thing is judged possible because nothing
        impossible follows from it, he indicates the way in which there are
        possible consequents. He says that not only is the position in question
        destroyed by the definition of the possible given above, but it is also
        evident at the same time that, if the antecedent of a conditional
        proposition is possible, the consequent will also be possible; for
        example, if this conditional proposition “If when A is, B is,” is true,
        then if A is possible, B must be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1811. Now in order to understand this we must note that the word
        <i>possible</i> is used in two senses: (1) It is used, first, in
        contradistinction to the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">necessary</span>, as when we call those
        things possible which are capable either of being or not being. And when
        possible is taken in this way, the foregoing remarks do not apply. For
        nothing prevents the antecedent from being capable of being or not
        being, even though the consequent is necessary, as is clear in this
        conditional proposition, “If Socrates laughs, he is a man.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1812. (2) The word possible is used in a second sense inasmuch as it is
        common both to those things which are necessary and to those which are
        capable of being or not being, according as the possible is
        distinguished from the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">impossible</span>. And the Philosopher
        is speaking of the possible in this way here when he says that the
        consequent must be possible if the antecedent was possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1813. For let it be assumed that this conditional proposition is true:
        If A is, then B is; and let it be assumed that the antecedent, A, is
        possible. Then it is necessary that B either be possible or not. Now if
        it is necessary, then the assumption follows. But if it is not
        necessary, nothing prevents the opposite from being assumed, namely,
        that B is not possible. But this cannot stand; for A is assumed to be
        possible, and when it is assumed to be possible, it is at the same time
        assumed that nothing impossible follows from it; for the possible was
        defined above as that from which nothing impossible follows. But B
        follows from A, as was assumed, and B was assumed to be impossible; for
        to be impossible is the same as not to be possible. Therefore A will not
        be possible if B, which was held to be impossible, follows from it.
        Therefore let B be assumed to be impossible, and if it is impossible and
        given A, B must exist, then both the first and the second, namely, A and
        B will be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1814. In which place it must be noted that the following proposition is
        correct: (+) if the consequent is impossible, the antecedent is
        impossible; but (~) the reverse is not true. For nothing prevents
        something necessary from being a consequence of the impossible, as in
        this conditional proposition, “If man is an ass, he is an animal.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore what the Philosopher says here must not be understood as
        meaning that, if the first, i.e., the antecedent, were impossible, then
        the second, i.e., the consequent, would also be impossible. But it must
        be understood to mean that, if the consequent is impossible, both will
        be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore it is obvious that, if A and B are so related that, when A is,
        B must be, it necessarily follows that, if A is possible, B will be
        possible; and if B is not possible when A is possible, then A and B are
        not related in the way supposed, namely, that B follows from A. But it
        is necessary that when A is possible B must be possible, if when A
        exists it is necessary that B exist. Therefore when I say “If A is, B
        is,” this means that B must be possible if A is possible, in the sense
        that it is possible for B to exist at the same time and in the way in
        which A is possible; for it is not possible that it should exist at any
        time and in any way.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 5: 1047b 31-1048a 24
      </p>
      <p>
        761. And since among all potencies some are innate, as the senses, and
        some are acquired by practice, as the power of playing the flute, and
        some by learning, as artistic powers, those which are acquired by
        practice and by the use of reason must be acquired by previous exercise.
        But this is not necessary in the case of those which are not such and
        which involve passivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        762. Now that which is capable is capable of something at some time and
        in some way, and has all the other qualifications which must be included
        in the definition; and some things can cause motion according to a
        rational plan and their potencies are rational, whereas other things are
        devoid of any rational plan and their potencies are irrational. And the
        former potencies must exist in living things, whereas the latter exist
        in both kinds of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        763. And since this is so, then in the case of the latter potencies,
        when the thing that is capable of acting and the one that is capable of
        being acted upon come close to each other, the one must act and the
        other be acted upon; but in the case of the former potencies this is not
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        764. For the latter are all productive of one effect, whereas the former
        are productive of contrary effects. Hence they would produce contrary
        effects at the same time, that is, if they were to act on a proximate
        patient without something determining them. But this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        765. Therefore there must be some other thing which is the proper cause
        of this, and by this I mean appetite or choice. For whatever a thing
        chiefly desires this it will do, when, insofar as it is potential, it is
        present and comes close to the thing which is capable of being acted
        upon. Hence every potency endowed with reason, when it desires something
        of which it has the potency and insofar as it has it, must do this
        thing. And it has this potency when the thing capable of being acted
        upon is present and is disposed in a definite way; but if it is not, it
        will not be able to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        766. For it is unnecessary to add this qualification: when nothing
        external hinders it; for the agent has the potency insofar as it is a
        potency for acting. But this is not true of all things but only of those
        which are disposed in a definite way, in the case of which external
        obstacles will be excluded; for they remove some of the qualifications
        which are given in the definition of the capable or possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        767. And for this reason if such things wish or desire to do two things
        or contrary things at the same time, they will not do them; for they do
        not have the potency for doing both at the same time, nor is it possible
        to do them at the same time, since it is those things which they have
        the capacity of doing that they do.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>How potency precedes or follows act</i></p>
      <p>
        1815. Having rejected the false opinions about potency and actuality the
        Philosopher now establishes the truth about them; and in regard to this
        he does two things. First, he shows how actuality is prior to potency in
        the same subject; and second (1816), how potency, when it is prior to
        actuality, is brought to a state of actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that, since (1) some potencies are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">innate</span> in the things of which
        they are the potencies, as the sensory powers in animals; and (2) some
        are <span style="font-weight: bold">acquired</span> by practice, as the
        art of flute-playing and other operative arts of this kind; and some are
        acquired by teaching and learning, as medicine and other similar arts;
        all of the abovementioned potencies which we have as a result of
        practice and the use of reason must first be exercised and their acts
        repeated before they are acquired. For example, one becomes a harpist by
        playing the harp, and one becomes a physician by studying medical
        matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        But (1) other potencies which are not acquired by practice but which
        belong to us by nature and are passive, as is evident in the case of
        sensory powers, are not a result of exercise; for one does not acquire
        the sense of sight by seeing but actually sees because he has the power
        of sight.
      </p>
      <p>1816. <b>Now that which</b> (762).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how those potencies which are prior to actuality are
        brought to actuality; and in regard to this he does two things. First,
        he shows how different potencies—rational and irrational
        potencies—differ from each other in this respect. Second (1820), he
        shows how rational potencies are brought to a state of actuality
        (“Therefore, there must”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he lays down certain
        conditions required for the study of the aforesaid differences, and (1)
        one of these is that it is necessary to consider several qualifications
        in the definition of the <i>capable or potential</i>. For the capable
        does not refer to just anything at all but to something
        <span style="font-weight: bold">definite</span>. Hence the capable must
        be capable of something, such as to walk or to sit. And similarly what
        can act or be acted upon cannot act or be acted upon at any time
        whatever; for example, a tree can bear fruit only at some definite time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, when it is said that something is capable, it is necessary to
        determine <span style="font-weight: bold">when</span> it is capable. And
        it is also necessary to determine
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in what way</span> it is capable, for
        that which is capable can neither act nor be acted upon in every way;
        for example, one can walk in this way, namely, slowly, but not rapidly.
        And the same thing is true of the other qualifications which they are
        accustomed to give in the definitions of things, for example, by what
        instrument, in what place, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        1817. Another qualification which he lays down is that (a) some things
        are capable of something because of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational</span> plan, and the potencies
        for these capabilities are rational. (b) But some capabilities are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">irrational</span>, and the potencies for
        these are irrational. Again, rational potencies can exist only in living
        things, whereas irrational potencies can exist in both, i.e., in both
        living and nonliving things. And they exist not only in plants and in
        brute animals, which lack reason, but also in men themselves, in whom
        are found certain principles both of acting and of being acted upon
        which are irrational; for example, the powers of nutrition and growth,
        and weight, and other accidents of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>1818. <b>And since</b> (763).</p>
      <p>
        (2) Second, he gives the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">difference</span> between the potencies
        in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says that in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">irrational</span> potencies when the
        thing capable of being acted upon comes close to the thing which is
        capable of acting, then in accordance with that disposition whereby that
        able to be acted upon can be acted upon and that capable of acting can
        act, it is (+)
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessary</span> that the one
        be acted upon and that the other act. This is clear, for instance, when
        something combustible comes in contact with fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational</span> potencies this is not
        necessary; for no matter how close some material may be brought to a
        builder, it is not (~) necessary that he build something.
      </p>
      <p>1819. <b>For the latter</b> (764).</p>
      <p>
        (3) Third, he gives the reason for the difference pointed out. (a) He
        says that <span style="font-weight: bold">irrational</span> potencies
        are such that each is productive of only one effect, and, therefore,
        when such a potency is brought close to something that is capable of
        being acted upon, it must produce the one effect which it is capable of
        producing.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) But one and the same
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational</span> potency is capable of
        producing contrary effects, as was said above (1789-93). Therefore, if,
        when it is brought close to something capable of being acted upon, it
        would be necessary for it to bring about the effect which it is capable
        of producing, it would follow that it would produce contrary effects at
        the same time; but this is impossible. For example, it would follow that
        a physician would induce both health and sickness.
      </p>
      <p>1820. <b>Therefore there must</b> (765).</p>
      <p>
        He then shows
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >what is necessary in order for rational potencies to begin to
          act</span
        >, seeing that closeness to the thing capable of being acted upon is not
        sufficient. In regard to this he does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he reveals the principle by which a rational potency is made to
        act. He concludes from the above discussions that since a rational
        potency has a common relationship to two contrary effects, and since a
        definite effect proceeds from a common cause only if there is some
        proper principle which determines that common cause to produce one
        effect rather than the other, it follows that it is necessary to posit,
        in addition to the rational power which is common to two contrary
        effects, something else which
        <span style="font-weight: bold">particularizes</span> it to one of them
        in order that it may proceed to act. And this “is appetite or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">choice</span>,” i.e., the choosing of
        one of the two, or the choice which involves reason; for it is what a
        man intends that he does, although this occurs only if he is in that
        state in which he is capable of acting and the patient is present.
        Hence, just as an irrational potency which is capable of acting must act
        when its passive object comes close to it, in a similar fashion every
        rational potency must act (a) when it desires the object of which it has
        the potency, and (b) in the way in which it has it. And it has the power
        of acting when the patient is present and is so disposed that it can be
        acted upon; otherwise it could not act.
      </p>
      <p>1821. <b>For it is unnecessary</b> (766).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he answers an implied question. For since he had said that
        everything capable of acting as a result of a rational plan, when it
        desires something of which it is the potency, acts of necessity on the
        patient before it, someone could ask why he did not add this
        qualification, namely, “when nothing external hinders it”; for it has
        been said that it must act if it has sufficient power to act. But this
        does not occur in any and every way, but only when the thing having the
        potency is disposed in some particular way; and in this statement
        external obstacles are excluded. For the things which hinder it
        externally remove some of it desires, and assuming that some the
        qualifications laid down in the common definition of the capable or
        possible, so that it is not capable at this time or in this way or the
        like.
      </p>
      <p>
        1822. <b>And for this</b> (767).<br />
        Third, he instructs us to avoid the absurd conclusions which he first
        said would follow, namely, that a rational potency would produce
        contrary effects at the same time. For if it is necessary that a
        rational potency should do what it should wish either by reason or by
        sense appetite, and granted that it should wish to do two different or
        contrary things at the same time, it does not follow for this reason
        that they will do them. For they do not have power over contrary effects
        in such a way that they may do contrary things at the same time; but
        they act according to the way in which they have a potency, as has been
        explained (1816-20).<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 6: 1048a 25-1048b 36
      </p>
      <p>
        768. Since we have dealt with the kind of potency which is related to
        motion, let us now determine about actuality both what it is and what
        kind of thing it is. For in making our distinctions it will become
        evident at the same time with regard to the potential not only that we
        speak of the potential as that which is disposed by nature to move
        something else or be moved by something else, either in an unqualified
        sense or in some special way, but also that we use the word in a
        different sense as well. And for this reason we will also come upon
        these points in making our investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
        769. Now actuality is the existence of a thing not in the sense in which
        we say that a thing exists potentially, as when we say that Mercury is
        potentially in the wood, and a half in the whole, because it can be
        separated from it, or as we say that one who is not theorizing is a man
        of science if he is able to theorize; but in the sense in which each of
        these exists actually.
      </p>
      <p>
        770. What we mean becomes evident in particular cases by induction, and
        we should not look for the boundaries of every thing, but perceive what
        is proportional; for it is as one who is building to one capable of
        building, and as one who is awake to one who is asleep, and as one who
        sees to one whose eyes are closed but who has the power of sight, and as
        that which is separated out of matter to matter, and as that which has
        been worked on to that which has not; and let actuality be defined by
        one member of this division and potency by the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        771. However, things are not all said to be actual in the same way, but
        proportionally, as this is in that or to that; indeed, some are as
        motion to potency, and others as substance to some matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        772. But the infinite and the void and all other such things are said to
        exist potentially and actually in a different sense from that which
        applies to many beings, for example, from that which sees or walks or is
        visible. For these things can be verified, and verified without
        qualification; for what is visible is so designated sometimes because it
        is being seen and sometimes because it is capable of being seen. But the
        infinite does not exist potentially in the sense that it will ever have
        actual separate existence, but it exists potentially only in knowledge.
        For since the process of division never comes to an end, this shows that
        this actuality exists potentially, but not that it ever exists
        separately.’ Therefore, regarding actuality, both what it is and what
        kind of thing it is will be evident to us from these and similar
        considerations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Kinds of act</i></p>
      <p>
        1823. Having drawn his conclusions about potency, Aristotle now
        establishes the truth about actuality; and this is divided into two
        parts. In the first he establishes what actuality is. In the second
        (1832) he establishes what is true when something is in potency to
        actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he links this up with
        the preceding discussion. He says that, since we have dealt with the
        kind of potency which is found in mobile things, i.e., the kind which is
        an active or passive principle of motion, we must now explain what
        actuality is and how it is related to potency; because when we will have
        distinguished the kinds of actuality, the truth about potency will
        become evident from this at the same time. For actuality is found not
        only in mobile things but also in immobile ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        1824. And since potency is referred to actuality, it is evident from
        this that capability or potency taken in reference to action is
        attributed not only (1) to something that is naturally disposed (+) to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">move</span> something else actively or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">be moved</span> by something else
        passively, either in an unqualified sense, inasmuch as potency is
        referred alike to acting and being acted upon, or in some special way,
        inasmuch as potency is referred to what is able to act or be acted upon
        well; but (2) capability or potency is also referred to that actuality
        which is devoid of (~) <span style="font-weight: bold">motion</span>.
        For although the word actuality is derived from motion, as was explained
        above (1805), it is still
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >not motion alone that is designated as actuality</span
        >. Hence, neither is potency referred only to motion. It is therefore
        necessary to inquire about these things in our investigations.
      </p>
      <p>1825. <b>Now actuality</b> (769).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he establishes the truth about actuality. First, he shows what
        actuality is; and second (1828), how it is used in different senses in
        the case of different things (“However, things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows what
        <span style="font-weight: bold">actuality</span> is. He says that a
        thing is actual when it exists but not in the way in which it exists
        when it is potential. (a) For we say that the image of Mercury is in the
        wood potentially and not actually before the wood is carved; but once it
        has been carved the image of Mercury is then said to be in the wood
        actually. (b) And in the same way we say that any part of a continuous
        whole is in that whole, because any part (for example, the middle one)
        is present potentially inasmuch as it is possible for it to be separated
        from the whole by dividing the whole; but after the whole has been
        divided, that part will now be present actually. (c) The same thing is
        true of one who has a science and is not speculating, for he is capable
        of speculating even though he is not actually doing so; but to be
        speculating or contemplating is to be in a state of actuality.
      </p>
      <p>1826. <b>What we mean</b> (770).</p>
      <p>
        Here he answers an implied question; for someone could ask him to
        explain what actuality is by giving its definition. And he answers by
        saying that it is possible to show what we mean (i.e., by actuality) in
        the case of singular things by proceeding inductively from examples,
        “and we should not look for the boundaries of everything,” i.e., the
        definition. For
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >simple notions cannot be defined</span
        >, since an infinite regress in definitions is impossible. But actuality
        is one of those first simple notions. Hence it cannot be defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        1827. And he says that we can see what actuality is by means of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">proportion</span> existing between two
        things. For example, we may take the proportion of one who is building
        to one capable of building; and of one who is awake to one asleep; and
        of one who sees to one whose eyes are closed although he has the power
        of sight; and “of that which is separated out of matter,” i.e., what is
        formed by means of the operation of art or of nature, and thus is
        separated out of unformed matter, to what is not separated out of
        unformed matter. And similarly we may take the proportion of what has
        been prepared to what has not been prepared, or of what has been worked
        on to what has not been worked on. But in each of these opposed pairs
        one member will be actual and the other potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        And thus
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >by proceeding from particular cases</span
        >
        we can come to an understanding in a proportional way of what actuality
        and potency are.
      </p>
      <p>1828. <b>However, things</b> (771).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that the term actuality is used in different senses; and
        he gives two different senses in which it is used. (1) First, actuality
        means <span style="font-weight: bold">action, or operation</span>. And
        with a view to introducing the different senses of actuality he says,
        first, that we do not say that all things are actual in the same way but
        in different ones; and this difference can be considered according to
        different proportions. For a proportion can be taken as meaning that,
        just as one thing is in another, so a third is in a fourth; for example,
        just as sight is in the eye, so hearing is in the ear. And the relation
        of substance (i.e., of form) to matter is taken according to this kind
        of proportion; for form is said to be in matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1829. There is another meaning of proportion inasmuch as we say that,
        just as this is related to that, so another thing is related to
        something else; for example, just as the power of sight is related to
        the act of seeing, so too the power of hearing is related to the act of
        hearing. And the relation of motion to motive power or of any operation
        to an operative potency is taken according to this kind of proportion.
      </p>
      <p>1830. <b>But the infinite</b> (772).</p>
      <p>
        (2) Second, he gives the other sense in which the word actuality is
        used. He says that the infinite and the empty or the void, and all
        things of this kind, are said to exist potentially and actually in a
        different sense from many other beings; for example, what sees and what
        walks and what is visible. For it is fitting that things of this kind
        should sometimes exist in an unqualified sense either only potentially
        or only actually; for example, the visible is only actual when it is
        seen, and it is only potential when it is capable of being seen but is
        not actually being seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        1831. But the <i>infinite</i> is not said to exist potentially in the
        sense that it may sometimes have separate actual existence alone; but in
        the case of the infinite, actuality and potentiality are distinguished
        only <span style="font-weight: bold">in thought</span> and in knowledge.
        For example, in the case of the infinite in the sense of the infinitely
        divisible, actuality and potentiality are said to exist at the same
        time, because the capacity of the infinite for being divided never comes
        to an end; for when it is actually divided it is still potentially
        further divisible. However, it is never actually separated from
        potentiality in such a way that the whole is sometimes actually divided
        and is incapable of any further division.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the same thing is true of the <i>void</i>; for it is possible for a
        place to be emptied of a particular body, but not so as to be a complete
        void, for it continues to be filled by another body; and thus in the
        void potentiality always continues to be joined to actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same thing is true of <i>motion and time</i> and other things of
        this kind which do not have complete being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then at the end he makes a summary of what has been said. This is
        evident in the text.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        773. However, we must determine when each thing is in a state of potency
        and when it is not; for a thing is not potential at just any time at
        all; for example, in the process of generation is earth. potentially a
        man? Or is it not, but rather when it has become seed? But perhaps even
        this is not true in an unqualified sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        774. Therefore, in like manner, it is not everything which will be
        healed by the art of medicine or by chance, but there is something which
        is capable of being healed, and this is what is potentially healthy. And
        the intelligible expression of what comes to exist actually after
        existing potentially as a result of intellect is that it is something
        which when willed comes to be if no external impediment hinders it. And
        in the other case, namely, in that of the thing which gets well by
        itself, health exists potentially when nothing within the thing hinders
        it. The same is true of those things which are potentially a house; for
        if there is nothing in these things, i.e., in the matter, which prevents
        them from becoming a house, and if there is nothing which must be added
        or taken away or changed, this is potentially a house. The same is true
        of all other things which have an external principle of generation. And
        in the case of those things which have their principle of change within
        themselves, a thing will also be potentially any of those things which
        it will be of itself if nothing external hinders this. For example, seed
        is not yet such, because it must be present in some other thing and be
        changed. But when it is already such as a result of its own principle,
        it is now this thing potentially; but in the other state it needs
        another principle; for example, earth is not yet a statue potentially,
        but when changed it becomes bronze.
      </p>
      <p>
        775. Now it seems that the thing of which we are speaking is not a that
        but a “thaten”; for example, a chest is not wood but wooden; and wood is
        not earth but earthen. And the same thing would be true if earth were
        not something else but a “thaten.” And that other thing is always
        potentially (in an unqualified sense) the thing which follows it, as a
        chest is not earth or earthen but wooden; for this is potentially a
        chest and the matter of a chest; and wood in an unqualified sense is the
        matter of a chest in an unqualified sense; but this wood is the matter
        of this chest. And if there is some first thing which is not said to be
        “thaten” as regards something else, this is prime matter; for example,
        if earth is of air, and air is not fire but of fire, then fire is prime
        matter, and is a particular thing. For a universal and a subject differ
        in this respect that a subject is a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        776. For example, the subject of modifications is man, body and animal,
        whereas the modification is musical or white. And when music comes to a
        subject, the subject is not called music but musical; and a man is not
        called whiteness but white; and he is not called walking or motion but
        what walks or is moved, like a “thaten.”
      </p>
      <p>
        777. Therefore all those modifying attributes which are predicated in
        this way have substance as their ultimate subject; whereas those which
        are not predicated in this way, but the predicate is a form or a
        particular thing, have matter and material substance as their ultimate
        subject. Therefore it is only fitting that the term “thaten” happens to
        be predicated of matter and the modifying attributes; for both are
        indeterminate. It has been stated, then, when a thing is said to exist
        potentially, and when it is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Potency proximate to act</i></p>
      <p>
        1832. Having shown what actuality is, here the Philosopher intends to
        show both when and in virtue of what sort of disposition a thing is said
        to be in a state of potency for actuality. In regard to this he does two
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First (1832), he states what he intends to do. He says that it is
        necessary to determine when a thing is in potency and when it is not.
        For it is not at just any time and when disposed in just any way that a
        thing can be said to be in potentiality even to what comes from it; for
        it could never be said that earth is potentially a man, since obviously
        it is not; but it is rather said to be potentially a man when the seed
        has already been generated from a preceding matter. And perhaps it never
        is potentially a man, as will be shown below.
      </p>
      <p>1833. <b>Therefore, in like manner</b> (774).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he answers the question which was raised; and in regard to this
        he does two things. First, he explains the sort of disposition which
        matter must have in order to be said to be in potency to actuality.
        Second (1839), he shows that it is only what is in matter that gets its
        name from matter disposed in some particular way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first it must be understood, as he said above in Book
        VII (1411), that the effects of certain arts may also come about without
        art; for while a house is not produced without art, health may be
        produced without the art of medicine through the operation of nature
        alone. And even though what comes to be by nature may not be fortuitous
        or a result of chance, since nature is an efficient cause in the proper
        sense, whereas fortune or chance is an efficient cause in an accidental
        sense, nevertheless, because the one who is healed by nature is healed
        without the application of any art, he is said to be healed by chance.
        For nothing prevents an effect which is not fortuitous in itself from
        being said to be fortuitous in relation to someone who does not consider
        the proper cause of such an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        1834. Hence he says that it is not just anyone at all or anyone disposed
        in any way at all who is healed by medicine or by chance; but it is
        someone having the capability by reason of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">definite disposition</span> who is
        healed either by nature or by art; for to all active principles there
        correspond definite passive principles. And it is the thing having this
        capability, which nature or art can bring to a state of actual health by
        a single action, that is potentially healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        1835. And in order that this kind of capability or potency may be more
        fully known he adds its definition both with reference to the operation
        of art and to that of nature. (1) Hence he says that the capable or
        potential is what comes to exist actually from existing potentially as a
        result of <span style="font-weight: bold">intellect or art</span>. For
        “the intelligible expression,” or definition, of the capable is this: it
        is something which the artist immediately brings to actuality when he
        wills it if no external impediment hinders it. And the patient is then
        said to be potentially healthy, because he becomes healthy by a single
        action of art. (2) However, in the case of those who are healed by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nature</span>, each is said to be
        potentially healthy when there is nothing hindering health which has to
        be removed or changed before the healing power within the patient
        produces its effect in the act of healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1836. Now what we have said about the act of healing, which is brought
        about by the art of healing, can also be said about the other activities
        produced by the other arts. For matter is potentially a house when none
        of the things present in the matter prevent the house from being brought
        into being immediately by a single action, and when there is nothing
        that should be added or taken away or changed before the matter is
        formed into a house, as clay must be changed before bricks are made from
        it; and as something must be taken away from trees by hewing them and
        something added by joining them so that a house may be brought into
        being. Clay and trees, then, are not potentially houses, but bricks and
        wood already prepared are.
      </p>
      <p>
        1837. And the same holds true in the case of other things whether their
        principle of perfection is outside of them, as in the case of artificial
        things, or within them, as in the case of natural things. And they are
        always in potency to actuality
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >when they can be brought to actuality by their proper efficient
          principle without any external thing hindering them</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, seed is not such, for an animal must be produced from it
        through many changes; but when by its proper active principle, i.e.,
        something in a state of actuality, it can already become such, it is
        then already in potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        1838. But those things which have to be changed before they are
        immediately capable of being brought to actuality require a different
        efficient principle, namely, the one
        <span style="font-weight: bold">preparing the matter</span>, which is
        sometimes different from the one
        <span style="font-weight: bold">finishing</span> it off, which induces
        the final form. For example, it is obvious that earth is not yet
        potentially a statue, for it is not brought to actuality by a single
        action or by a single agent; but first it is changed by nature and
        becomes bronze, and afterwards it becomes a statue by art.
      </p>
      <p>1839. <b>Now it seems</b> (775).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that a compound derives its
        <span style="font-weight: bold">name</span> from such matter which is in
        potency to actuality; and in regard to this he does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he shows how a compound derives its name from matter, saying that
        what is produced from matter is not called a <i>that</i> but a
        <i>that-en</i> (<i>ecininum</i>). This expression is not used in the
        Latin but it is used according to the custom of the Greeks to designate
        what comes from something else as from matter, as if to say that matter
        is not predicated abstractly of what comes from it, but derivately, as a
        chest is not wood but wooden; and as wood is not earth but earthen. And,
        again, if earth should have another matter prior to it, earth would not
        be that matter but “that-en,” i.e., it will not be predicated of earth
        abstractly but derivatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        1840. Yet such predication is made, because what is potential in a
        definite way is always predicated of the thing which immediately comes
        after it. For example, earth, which cannot be said to be potentially a
        chest, is not predicated of a chest either abstractly or derivatively;
        for a chest is neither earth nor earthen but wooden, because wood is
        potentially a chest and the matter of a chest. Wood in general is the
        matter of a chest in general, and this particular wood is the matter of
        this particular chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        1841. But if there is some first thing which is not referred to
        something else as a “that-en,” i.e., something which does not have
        something else predicated of it derivatively in the above way, this will
        be first matter. For example, if air is the matter of earth, as some
        have said (86), air will be predicated derivatively of earth, so that
        earth will be said to be of air (or airy). And similarly air will be
        said to be of fire and not fire, if fire is its matter. But if fire does
        not get its name from any prior matter, it will be first matter
        according to the position of Heraclitus (87). But here it is necessary
        to add “if it is something subsistent” in order to distinguish it from a
        universal; for a universal is predicated of other things but other
        things are not predicated of it—yet it is not matter, since it is not
        something subsistent. For a universal and a subject differ in that a
        subject is a particular thing whereas a universal is not.
      </p>
      <p>1842. <b>For example</b> (776).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives an example of derivative predication, saying that just
        as the subject of modifications, for example, man, body, or animal, has
        modifications predicated of it derivatively, in a similar fashion matter
        is predicated derivatively of that which comes from matter. Now “the
        modification is musical and white”; but the subject to which music
        accrues is not called music in the abstract, but is called musical
        derivatively; and man is not called whiteness but white. Nor again is
        man called walking or motion in the abstract, but what walks or is moved
        “as a that-en,” i.e., what gets a name [from something else].
      </p>
      <p>1843. <b>Therefore all</b> (777).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he compares both methods of giving names to things. He says that
        all those names which are predicated derivatively in this way, as the
        accidents mentioned, have substance as the ultimate subject which
        sustains them; but in all those cases in which the predicate is not
        derivative but is a form or a particular thing, such as wood or earth,
        in such predications the ultimate subject sustaining the rest is matter
        or material substance. And it is only fitting “that the term ‘that-en’
        happens to be predicated” derivatively “of matter and the modifying
        attributes,” i.e., accidents, both of which are indeterminate. For an
        accident is both made determinate and defined by means of its subject,
        and matter by means of that to which it is in potency. Lastly he
        summarizes his remarks, and this part is evident.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        778. Since we have established the different senses in which the term
        prior is employed (457), it is evident that actuality is prior to
        potency. And by potency I mean not only that definite kind which is said
        to be a principle of change in another thing inasmuch as it is other,
        but in general every principle of motion or rest. For nature also
        belongs to the same thing, since it is in the same genus as potency; for
        it is a principle of motion, although not in another thing but in
        something inasmuch as it is the same. Therefore actuality is prior to
        all such potency both in intelligibility and in substance; and in time
        it is prior in one sense, and in another it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        779. It is evident, then, that actuality is prior to potency in
        intelligibility; for what is potential in a primary sense is potential
        because it is possible for it to become actual. I mean, for example,
        that it is what is capable of building that can build, and what is
        capable of theorizing that can theorize, and what is capable of being
        seen that can be seen. And the same reasoning also applies in the case
        of other things; and therefore it is necessary that the conception or
        knowledge of the one should precede that of the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        780. And actuality is prior to potency in time in the sense that an
        actuality which is specifically but not numerically the same as a
        potency is prior to it. I mean that the matter and & seed and the thing
        capable of seeing, which are a man and grain and seeing potentially but
        not yet actually, are prior in time to this man and to grain and to the
        act of seeing which exist actually. But prior to these are other
        actually existing things from which these have been produced; for what
        is actual is always produced from something potential by means of
        something which is actual. Thus man comes from man and musician from
        musician; for there is always some primary mover, and a mover is already
        something actual. And in our previous discussions (598; 611) concerning
        substance it was stated that everything which comes to be is produced
        from something, and this is specifically the same as itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        781. And for this reason it seems to be impossible that anyone should be
        a builder who has not built something, or that anyone should be a
        harpist who has not played the harp. And the same holds true of all
        others who are learning; for one who is learning to play the harp learns
        to play it by playing it. And the same holds true in other cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        782. From this arose the sophistical argument that one who does not have
        a science will be doing the thing which is the object of this science;
        for one who is learning a science does not have it.
      </p>
      <p>
        783. But since some part of what is coming to be has come to be, and in
        general some part of what is being moved has been moved (as became
        evident in our discussions on motion), perhaps one who is learning a
        science must have some part of that science. Hence it is also clear from
        this that actuality is prior to potency both in the process of
        generation and in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Priority of act in time</i></p>
      <p>
        1844. Having established the truth about potency and actuality, the
        Philosopher now compares one with the other; and this is divided into
        two parts. In the first part he compares them from the viewpoint of
        priority and posteriority; in the second (1883), in terms of being
        better or worse; and in the third (1888), in reference to knowledge of
        the true and the false.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains his aim,
        saying that, since it has been established above, in Book V (936), that
        the term prior is used in different senses, it is evident that actuality
        is prior to potency in different ways. And we are now speaking of
        potency not only inasmuch as it is a principle of motion in some other
        thing as other, as active potency was defined above (1776), but
        universally of every principle, whether it be a principle that causes
        motion or a principle of immobility or rest or a principle of action
        devoid of motion (e.g., understanding), because nature also seems to
        belong to the same thing as potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        1845. For <i>nature</i> is in the same genus as potency itself because
        each is a principle of motion, although nature is not a principle of
        motion in some other thing but in the thing in which it is present as
        such, as is made clear in Book Il of the Physics. However, nature is a
        principle not only of motion but also of immobility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence actuality is prior to all such potency both in intelligibility and
        in substance. And in one sense it is also prior in time, and in another
        it is not.
      </p>
      <p>1846. <b>It is evident</b> (779).</p>
      <p>
        Second he proves his thesis. First, he shows that
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >actuality is prior to potency in intelligibility</span
        >. Second (1847), he shows how it is prior in time, and how it is not.
        Third (1856), he shows how it is prior in substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is proved as follows: anything that must be used in defining
        something else is prior to it in intelligibility, as animal is prior to
        man and subject to accident. But potency or capability can only be
        defined by means of actuality, because the first characteristic of the
        capable consists in the possibility of its acting or being actual. For
        example, a builder is defined as one who can build, and a theorist as
        one who can theorize, and the visible as what can be seen; and the same
        is true in other cases. The concept of actuality must therefore be prior
        to the concept of potency, and the knowledge of actuality prior to the
        knowledge of potency. Hence Aristotle explained above what potency is by
        defining it in reference to actuality, but he could not define actuality
        by means of something else but only made it known inductively.
      </p>
      <p>1847. <b>And actuality</b> (780).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how actuality is prior to potency
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in time</span>, and how it is not. In
        regard to this he does two things. First, he makes this clear in the
        case of passive potencies; and second (1850), in the case of certain
        active potencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, (+) first, that actuality is prior to potency in
        time in the sense that in the same
        <span style="font-weight: bold">species</span> the agent, or what is
        actual, is prior to what is potential; but (~) in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">numerically one</span> and the same
        thing what is potential is prior in time to what is actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        1848. This is shown as follows: if we take
        <span style="font-weight: bold">this man</span> who is now actually a
        man, prior to him in time there was a matter which was potentially a
        man. And similarly seed, which is potentially grain, was prior in time
        to what is actually grain. And “the thing capable of seeing,” i.e.,
        having the power of sight, was prior in time to the thing actually
        seeing. And prior in time to the things having potential being there
        were certain things having actual being, namely,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">agents</span>, by which the former have
        been brought to actuality. For what exists potentially must always be
        brought to actuality by an agent, which is an actual being. Hence what
        is potentially a man becomes actually a man as a result of the man who
        generates him, who is an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">actual</span> being; and similarly one
        who is potentially musical becomes actually musical by learning from a
        teacher who is actually musical. And thus in the case of anything
        potential there is always some first thing which moves it, and this
        mover is actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows, then, that even though the same thing numerically exists
        potentially prior in time to existing actually, there is still also some
        actual being of the same species which is prior in time to the one that
        exists potentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        1849. And because someone could be perplexed about some of the
        statements which he had made, he therefore adds that these have been
        explained above; for it was pointed out in the foregoing discussions
        about substance—in Book VII (1383; 1417)—that everything which comes to
        be comes from something as matter, and by something as an agent. And it
        was also stated above that this agent is specifically the same as the
        thing which comes to be. This was made clear in the case of univocal
        generations, but in the case of equivocal generations there must also be
        some likeness between the generator and the thing generated, as was
        shown elsewhere (1444-47).
      </p>
      <p>1850. <b>And for this reason</b> (781).</p>
      <p>
        He explains the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">temporal sequence</span> of actuality
        and potency in the case of certain active potencies; and in regard to
        this he does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he explains what he intends to do. For it was said above (1815)
        that there are certain operative potencies whose very actions must be
        understood to be performed or exercised beforehand, as those acquired by
        practice or instruction. And with regard to these he says here that in
        those things which are
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >numerically the same, actuality is also prior</span
        >
        to potency. For it seems impossible that anyone should become a builder
        who has not first built something; or that anyone should become a
        harpist who has not first played the harp.
      </p>
      <p>
        1851. He draws this conclusion from the points laid down above; for it
        was said above (1848) that one who is potentially musical becomes
        actually musical as a result of someone who is actually musical—meaning
        that he learns from him; and the same thing holds true of other actions.
        Now one could not learn an art of this kind unless he himself performed
        the actions associated with it; for one learns to play the harp by
        playing it. This is also true of the other arts. It has been shown,
        then, that it is impossible to have potencies of this sort unless their
        actions are also first present in one and the same subject numerically.
      </p>
      <p>1852. <b>From this arose</b> (782).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he raises a sophistical objection against the above view. He
        says that “a sophistical argument arose,” i.e., an apparently cogent
        syllogism which contradicts the truth, and it runs as follows: one who
        is learning an art exercises the actions of that art. But one who is
        learning an art does not have that art. Hence one who does not have a
        science or an art is doing the thing which is the object of that science
        or art. This seems to be contrary to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>1853. <b>But since some</b> (783).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he answers this objection by stating a position which was
        discussed and proved in the <i>Physics</i>, Book VI; for there he proved
        that being moved is always prior to having been moved, because of the
        division of motion. For whenever any part of a motion is given, since it
        is divisible, we must be able to pick out some part of it which has
        already been completed, while the part of the motion given is going on.
        Therefore whatever is being moved has already been partly moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        1854. And by the same argument, whatever is coming to be has already
        partly come to be; for even though the process of producing a substance,
        with reference to the introduction of the substantial form, is
        indivisible, still if we take the preceding alteration whose terminus is
        generation, the process is divisible, and the whole process can be
        called a production. Therefore, since what is coming to be has partly
        come to be, then what is coming to be can possess to some degree the
        activity of the thing in which the production is terminated. For
        example, what is becoming hot can heat something to some degree, but not
        as perfectly as something that has already become hot. Hence, since to
        learn is to become scientific, the one learning must already have, as it
        were, some part of a science or an art. It is not absurd, then, if he
        should exercise the action of an art to some degree; for he does not do
        it as perfectly as one who already has the art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1855. But in reason itself there are also naturally inherent certain
        seeds or principles of the sciences and virtues, through which a man can
        pass to some degree into the activity of a science or a virtue before he
        has the habit of the science or the virtue; and when this has been
        acquired he acts perfectly, whereas at first he acted imperfectly.
        Lastly he summarizes the above discussion, as is evident in the text.<br /></p

        784. But actuality is also prior in substance; (1) because those things
        which are subsequent in generation are prior in form and substance; for
        example, man is prior to boy, and human being to seed; for the one
        already has its form, but the other has not.
      </p>
      <p>
        785. And (2) because everything which comes to be moves toward a
        principle, namely, its goal [or end]. For that for the sake of which a
        thing comes to be is a principle; and generation is for the sake of the
        goal. And actuality is the goal, and it is for the sake of this that
        potency is acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
        786. For animals do not see in order that they may have the power of
        sight, but they have the power of sight in order that they may see.
      </p>
      <p>
        787. And similarly men have the science of building in order that they
        may build, and they have theoretical knowledge in order that they may
        speculate; but they do not speculate in order that they may have
        theoretical knowledge, unless they are learning by practice. And these
        latter do not speculate [in a perfect way], but either to some degree or
        because they do not need to speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
        788. Further, matter is in potency up to the time at which it attains
        its form; but when it exists actually, it then possesses its form. And
        the same holds true in the case of other things, even of those whose
        goal is motion. And for this reason, just as those who are teaching
        think that they have reached their goal when they exhibit their student
        performing, so it is with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        789. For if this were not so, Pauson’s Mercury would exist again,
        because it would not be more evident whether scientific knowledge is
        internal or external, as is the case with the figure of Mercury. For the
        activity is the goal, and the actuality is the activity. And for this
        reason the term actuality is used in reference to activity and is
        extended to completeness.
      </p>
      <p>
        790. But while in the case of some things the ultimate effect is the use
        (as, for example, in the case of sight the ultimate effect is the act of
        seeing, and no other work besides this results from the power of sight),
        still from some potencies something else is produced; for example, the
        art of building produces a house in addition to the act of building. Yet
        in neither case is the act any less or any more the end of the potency;
        for the act of building is in the thing being built, and it comes into
        being and exists simultaneously with the house. Therefore in those cases
        in which the result is something other than the use, the actuality is in
        the thing being produced; for example, the act of building is in the
        thing being built, and the act of weaving in the thing being woven. The
        same holds true in all other cases. And in general, motion is in the
        thing being moved. But in the case of those things in which nothing else
        is produced besides the activity, the activity is present in these, as
        the act of seeing is in the one seeing, and the act of speculating in
        the one speculating, and life in the soul. Accordingly, happiness is in
        the soul, for it is a kind of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        791. It is evident, then, that substance or form is actuality. Hence it
        is clear according to this argument that actuality is prior to potency
        in substance. And, as we have said (780), one actuality is always prior
        to another in time right back to that actuality which is always the
        first principle of motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Priority of act substantially</i></p>
      <p>
        1856. Having shown that actuality is prior to potency in intelligibility
        and in one sense in time, the Philosopher now shows that it is prior in
        substance. This was the third way given above (1845) in which actuality
        is prior to potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is divided into two parts. In the first part he proves his thesis
        by arguments taken from things which are sometimes potential and
        sometimes actual. In the second part (1867) he proves his thesis by
        comparing eternal things, which are always actual, with mobile things,
        which are sometimes actual and sometimes potential (“But actuality”).
      </p>
      <p>
        And since to be prior in substance is to be prior in perfection, and
        since perfection is attributed to two things, namely, to the form and to
        the goal [or end], therefore in the first part he uses two arguments to
        prove his thesis. The first of these pertains to the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">form</span>, and the second (1857) to
        the goal, given at the words, “And because.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that actuality is prior to potency not only
        in intelligibility and in time “but in substance,” i.e., in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">perfection</span>; for the form by which
        something is perfected is customarily signified by the term
        <i>substance</i>. This first part is made clear by this argument: those
        things which are subsequent in generation are “prior in substance and
        form,” i.e., in perfection, because the process of generation always
        goes
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >from what is imperfect to what is perfect</span
        >; for example, in the process of generation man is subsequent to boy,
        because man comes from boy; and human being is subsequent to seed. The
        reason is that man and human being already have a perfect form, whereas
        boy and seed do not yet have such a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, since in numerically one and the same subject actuality is
        subsequent to potency both in generation and in time, as is evident from
        the above, it follows that actuality is prior to potency in substance
        and in intelligibility.
      </p>
      <p>1857. <b>And (2) because</b> (785).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the same point by an argument involving the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">goal</span> of activity. First, he sets
        forth the argument. Second (1858), he explains one of the principles
        assumed in his argument (“For animals”). Third (1862), he settles an
        issue which could cause difficulty in the above argument (“But while”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that everything which comes to be when it
        moves towards its goal moves towards a principle. For a goal, or that
        for the sake of which a thing comes to be, is a principle because it is
        the first thing intended by an agent, since it is that for the sake of
        which generation takes place. But
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >actuality is the goal of potency</span
        >, and therefore actuality is prior to potency and is one of its
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>1858. <b>For animals</b> (786).</p>
      <p>
        He now explains the position which he maintained above, namely, that
        actuality is the goal of potency. He makes this clear, first, in the
        case of <span style="font-weight: bold">natural active potencies</span>.
        He says (~) that animals do not see in order that they may have the
        power of sight, but (+) they rather have the power of sight in order
        that they may see. Thus it is clear that potency exists for the sake of
        actuality and not vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>1859. <b>And similarly</b> (787).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he makes the same thing clear in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational potencies</span>. He says that
        men have the power of building in order that they may build; and they
        have “theoretical knowledge,” or speculative science, in order that they
        may speculate. However, they do not speculate in order that they may
        have theoretical knowledge, unless they are learning and meditating
        about those matters which belong to a speculative science in order that
        they may acquire it. And these do not speculate perfectly but to some
        degree and imperfectly, as has been said above (1853-55), because
        speculation is not undertaken because of some need but for the sake of
        using science already acquired. But there is speculation on the part of
        those who are learning because the need to acquire science.
      </p>
      <p>1860. <b>Further, matter</b> (788).</p>
      <p>
        Third he makes the same point clear in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">passive potencies</span>. He says that
        matter is in potency until it receives a form or specifying principle,
        but then it is first in a state of actuality when it receives its form.
        And this is what occurs in the case of all other things which are moved
        for the sake of a goal. Hence, just as those who are teaching think they
        have attained their goal when they exhibit their pupil whom they have
        instructed performing those activities which belong to his art, in a
        similar fashion nature attains its goal when it attains actuality. Hence
        it is made evident in the case of natural motion that actuality is the
        goal of potency.
      </p>
      <p>1861. <b>For if this were not</b> (789).</p>
      <p>
        Fourth, he proves his thesis by an argument from the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">untenable consequences</span>. He says
        that if a thing’s perfection and goal do not consist in actuality, there
        would then seem to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">no difference</span> between someone
        wise, as Mercury was, and someone foolish, as Pauson was. For if the
        perfection of science were not in the one acting, Mercury would not have
        exhibited it in his own science, if he had “internal scientific
        knowledge,” i.e., in reference to its internal activity, “or external,”
        i.e., in reference to its external activity, as neither would Pauson.
        For it is by means of the actual use of scientific knowledge, and not by
        means of the potency or power, that one is shown to have a science;
        because activity is the goal of a science, and activity is a kind of
        actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for this reason the term actuality is derived from
        <span style="font-weight: bold">activity</span>, as has been stated
        above (1805); and from this it was extended to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">form</span>, which is called
        completeness or perfection.
      </p>
      <p>1862. <b>But while</b> (790).</p>
      <p>
        He explains a point which could cause a difficulty in the foregoing
        argument. For since he had said that some
        <span style="font-weight: bold">product</span> is the goal of activity,
        one could think that this is true in all cases. But he denies this,
        saying that the ultimate goal or end of some active potencies consists
        in the <span style="font-weight: bold">mere use</span> of those
        potencies, and not in something produced by their activity; for example,
        the ultimate goal of the power of sight is the act of seeing, and there
        is no product resulting from the power of sight in addition to this
        activity. But in the case of some active potencies something else is
        produced in addition to the activity; for example, the art of building
        also produces a house in addition to the activity of building.
      </p>
      <p>
        1863. However, this difference does not cause actuality to be the goal
        of potency to a lesser degree in the case of some of these potencies and
        to a greater degree in the case of others; for the activity is in the
        thing produced, as the act of building in the thing being built; and it
        comes into being and exists simultaneously with the house. Hence if the
        house, or the thing built, is the goal, this does not exclude actuality
        from being the goal of potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        1864. Now it is necessary to consider such a difference among the
        aforesaid potencies, because (1) when something else is produced besides
        the actuality of these potencies, which is activity, the activity of
        such potencies is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in the thing being produced</span> and
        is their actuality, just as the act of building is in the thing being
        built, and the act of weaving in the thing being woven, and in general
        motion in the thing being moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is true, because when some product results from the activity of
        a potency, the activity perfects the thing being produced and not the
        one performing it. Hence it is in the thing being produced as an
        actuality and perfection of it, but not in the one who is acting.
      </p>
      <p>
        1865. But (2) when nothing else is produced in addition to the activity
        of the potency, the actuality then exists
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in the agent</span> as its perfection
        and does not pass over into something external in order to perfect it;
        for example, the act of seeing is in the one seeing as his perfection,
        and the act of speculating is in the one speculating, and life is in the
        soul (if we understand by life vital activity). Hence it has been shown
        that happiness also consists in an activity of the kind which exists in
        the one acting, and not of the kind which passes over into something
        external; for happiness is a good of the one who is happy, namely, his
        perfect life. Hence, just as life is in one who lives, in a similar
        fashion happiness is in one who is happy. Thus it is evident that
        happiness does not consist either in building or in any activity of the
        kind which passes over into something external, but it consists in
        understanding and willing.
      </p>
      <p>1866. <b>It is evident</b> (791).</p>
      <p>
        Lastly he retraces his steps in order to draw the main conclusion which
        he has in mind. He says that it has been shown from the above discussion
        that a thing’s substance or form or specifying principle is a kind of
        actuality; and from this it is evident that actuality is prior to
        potency <span style="font-weight: bold">in substance</span> or form. And
        it is prior <span style="font-weight: bold">in time</span>, as has been
        stated above (1848), because the actuality whereby the generator or
        mover or maker is actual must always exist first before the other
        actuality by which the thing generated or produced becomes actual after
        being potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this goes on until one comes to the first mover, which is actuality
        alone; for whatever passes from potency to actuality requires a prior
        actuality in the agent, which brings it to actuality.<br /></p

      <p style="text-align: center">
        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 8: 1050b 6-1051a 3
      </p>
      <p>
        792. But actuality is prior to potency in a more fundamental sense; for
        eternal things are prior in substance to corruptible ones, and nothing
        eternal is potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        793. The reason of this is that every potency is at the same time a
        potency for opposite determinations. For what is incapable of existing
        does not exist in any way; and it is possible for everything that is
        capable of existing not to exist actually. Therefore whatever is ca able
        of existinly may either be or not be, and thus the same thing is capable
        both of being and of not being. But what is capable of not being may
        possibly not be; and what may possibly not be is corruptible: either
        absolutely, or in the sense in which it is said to be possible for it
        not to be, either according to place or to quantity or to quality. And
        the term <i>absolutely</i> means <i>in reference to substance</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        794. Therefore nothing that is incorruptible in an absolute sense is
        potential in an absolute sense. But there is nothing that hinders it
        from being so in other respects, for example, in reference to quality or
        to place. Therefore all incorruptible things are actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        795. And none of those things which exist necessarily are potential. In
        fact such things are the first; for if they did not exist, nothing would
        exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        796. Nor is eternal motion potential, if there be such a thing; and if
        anything is moved eternally, it is not moved potentially except in
        reference to whence and whither. And nothing prevents the matter of this
        sort of thing from existing.
      </p>
      <p>
        797. And for this reason the sun and the stars and the entire heaven are
        always active, and there is no need to fear, as the natural philosophers
        do, that they may at some time stand still. Nor do they tire in their
        activity; for in them there is no potency for opposite determinations,
        as there is in corruptible things, so that the continuity of their
        motion should be tiresome. For the cause of this is that their substance
        is matter and potency and not actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        798. Moreover, incorruptible things are imitated by those which are in a
        state of change, such as fire and earth; for these latter things are
        always active, since they have motion in themselves and of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        799. But all other potencies which have been defined are potencies for
        opposite determinations; for what is capable of moving something else in
        this way is also capable of not moving it in this way, i.e., all those
        things which act by reason. And irrational potencies will also be
        potencies for opposite determinations by being absent or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        800. If, then, there are any natures or substances such as those
        thinkers who in their theories proclaim the Ideas to be, there will be
        something much more scientific than science itself, and something much
        more mobile than motion itself; for the former will rather be the
        actualities and the latter the potencies of these. Hence it is evident
        that actuality is prior to potency and to every principle of change.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Act prior in incorruptible things</i></p>
      <p>
        1867. Aristotle proved above that actuality is prior to potency in
        substance, definition and perfection, by arguments drawn from
        corruptible things themselves; but here he proves the same point by
        comparing eternal things with corruptible ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part is divided into two members. In the first (1867) he proves his
        thesis; and in the second (1882), by the thesis thus proved, he rejects
        a certain statement made by Plato (“If, then”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he proves his thesis.
        This he does by the following argument: eternal things are compared to
        corruptible ones as actuality to potency; for eternal things as such are
        not in potency, whereas corruptible things as such are in potency. But
        eternal things are
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >prior to corruptible ones in substance and perfection</span
        >; for this is evident (1856). Hence actuality is prior to potency both
        in substance and perfection. He says that his thesis is proved in a more
        proper way by this argument, because actuality and potency are not
        considered in the same subject but in different ones, and this makes the
        proof more evident.
      </p>
      <p>1868. <b>The reason</b> (793).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves one assumption which he made, namely, that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >nothing eternal is in potency</span
        >; and in regard to this he does two things. First, he gives an argument
        to prove this, and it runs as follows: every potency is at one and the
        same time a potency for opposite determinations. Now he does not say
        this about active potency, for it has already been shown (1789) that
        irrational potencies are not potencies for opposite determinations; but
        he is speaking here of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">passive potency</span>, on the basis of
        which a thing is said to be capable of being and not being either
        absolutely or in a qualified sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1869. Now the claim which he made he proves by an argument to the
        contrary; because where such potency does not exist, neither of the
        opposite determinations is possible; for what is incapable of being
        never exists in any way. For if a thing is incapable of being, it is
        impossible for it to be, and it is necessary for it not to be. But what
        is capable of being may possibly not be actual. Hence it is evident that
        what is capable of being may either be or not be; and thus the potency
        is at one and the same time a potency for opposite determinations,
        because the same thing is in potency both to being and non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        1870. But what is capable of not being may possibly not be, for these
        two statements are equivalent ones. Moreover, what may possibly not be
        is corruptible either absolutely or in a qualified sense inasmuch as it
        is said to be possible for it not to be. For example, if it is possible
        for some body not to be in place, that body is corruptible as far as
        place is concerned; and the same applies to quantity and quality. But
        that is corruptible in an absolute sense which is capable of not
        existing substantially. Therefore it follows that everything potential
        inasmuch as it is potential is corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>1871. <b>Therefore nothing</b> (794).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he draws from the foregoing the conclusion at which he aims; and
        in regard to this he does three things. First, he concludes to this
        thesis about eternal things, inferring from the observations made above
        that, if everything potential is corruptible, it follows that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >nothing which is incorruptible in an absolute sense is a potential
          being</span
        >, provided that we understand incorruptible things in an absolute sense
        and potential being (~) in an absolute sense in reference to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1872. But nothing prevents something that is incorruptible in an
        absolute sense from being potential (+) in a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">qualified</span> sense, in reference
        either to quality or to place. For example, the moon is in a state of
        potency to being illuminated by the sun; and when the sun is in the east
        it is in a state of potency with regard to being in the west. It is
        evident from what has been said, then, that all eternal things as such
        are actual.
      </p>
      <p>1873. <b>And none</b> (795).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he comes to the same conclusion about
        <span style="font-weight: bold">necessary</span> things as he did about
        eternal things, because even in corruptible things there are certain
        necessary aspects; for example, man is an animal, and every whole is
        greater than its part. Hence he says that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >nothing necessary is potential</span
        >; for necessary things are always actual and incapable of being or not
        being. And those things which are necessary are the first of all things,
        because if they ceased to exist, none of the others would exist; for
        example, if essential predicates, which are referred to a subject
        necessarily, were taken away, accidental predicates, which can be
        present and not present in some subject, could not be present in any
        subject. It follows, then, that actuality is prior to potency.
      </p>
      <p>1874. <b>Nor is</b> (796).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he comes to the same conclusion about
        <span style="font-weight: bold">eternal motion</span> as he did about
        eternal substances; and in regard to this he does three things. First,
        from what has been said above he concludes to his thesis. He says that,
        if some motion is eternal, that motion is not potential; nor is anything
        that is moved eternally in a state of potency to motion, but it is in a
        state of potency to this or to that place, i.e., inasmuch as it goes
        from this place to that place. For since motion is the actuality of
        something in potency, everything which is being moved must be in potency
        to the goal of that motion, not however as regards motion itself, but as
        regards some place to which it tends by its motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        1875. And since what is being moved must have matter, he adds that
        nothing prevents a thing which is being moved by an eternal motion from
        having matter; because, even though it is not in potency to motion in an
        absolute sense, it is nevertheless in potency to this or to that place.
      </p>
      <p>1876. <b>And for this</b> (797).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he draws a corollary from the above discussion. For since what
        is being moved by an eternal motion is not in potency to motion itself
        (and the motion of the heavens is eternal according to the discussion in
        Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i>), it follows that the sun and the moon
        and the stars and the entire heaven are always active, because they are
        always being moved and are acting by means of their motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        1877. Nor is it to be feared that at some time the motion of the heavens
        may cease, as “some of the natural philosophers feared it would,”
        namely, Empedocles and his followers, who held that at times the world
        is destroyed by discord and is restored again by friendship. Hence he
        says that this is not to be feared, because they are not potentially
        immobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        1878. And for this reason too incorruptible things insofar as they are
        being moved do not tire in their activity, because “the potency for
        opposite determinations” is not found in them, namely, the ability to be
        both moved and not moved, as is found in corruptible things, which have
        these as a result of motion. And thus in this way continuous motion
        becomes laborious for them. For corruptible things labor insofar as they
        are moved; and the reason is that they are in a state of potency both
        for being moved and not being moved, and it is not proper to them by
        reason of their substantial nature always to be undergoing motion. Hence
        we see that the more laborious any motion is, the nearer also does the
        nature of the thing come to immobility; for example, in the case of
        animals it is evident that motion in an upward direction is more
        laborious.
      </p>
      <p>
        1879. Now what he says here about the continuity of celestial motion is
        in keeping with the nature of a celestial body, which we know by
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >But this is not prejudicial to the divine will, on which the motion
          and being of the heavens depend</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>1880. <b>Moreover, incorruptible things</b> (798).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he compares corruptible bodies with incorruptible ones from the
        viewpoint of activity. First, he does this insofar as they are alike. He
        says that the bodies of those things whose being involves change
        resemble incorruptible bodies insofar as they are always acting; for
        example, fire, which of itself always produces heat, and earth, which of
        itself always produces proper and natural activities. And this is true
        because they have motion and their own proper activity of themselves—
        inasmuch, namely, as their forms are principles of such motions and
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>1881. <b>But all the other</b> (799).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he compares them insofar as they are unlike. He says that in
        contrast with eternal things, which are always actual, the other
        potencies of mobile things, about which the truth has been established
        above, are all potencies for opposite determinations. But this is
        verified in a different way; for (1)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rational</span> potencies are potencies
        capable of opposite determinations because they can move in this way or
        not, as has been said above (1789); whereas (2)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">irrational</span> potencies, though
        acting in one way, are themselves also potencies of opposite
        determinations in view of the fact that they can be present in a subject
        or not; for example, an animal can lose its power of vision.
      </p>
      <p>1882. <b>If, hen</b> (800).</p>
      <p>
        As a result of what has been said he rejects a doctrine of Plato. For
        Plato claimed that there are certain separate Forms, which he held to
        have being in the highest degree; say, a separate science, which he
        called science-in-itself; and he said that this is foremost in the class
        of knowable entities. And similarly he maintained that motion-in-itself
        is foremost in the class of mobile things. But according to the points
        made clear above, something else besides science-in-itself will be first
        in the class of knowable things; for it was shown that actuality is
        prior to potency in perfection, and science itself is a kind of potency.
        Hence speculation, which is the activity of science, will be more
        perfect than science is; and the same will apply in the case of other
        things of this kind. Lastly he summarizes his discussion, saying that

        801. Furthermore, that actuality is also better and more excellent and
        more honorable than good potency is evident from the following: all
        things which are spoken of as potential are alike capable of contrary
        determinations; for example, what is said to be capable of being well is
        the same as what is capable of being ill, and simultaneously has both
        capabilities; for it is the same potency that is capable of being well
        and being ill, and of being at rest and in motion, and of building and
        demolishing, and of being built and being demolished. Therefore the
        capacity for contrary determinations belongs to the same thing at the
        same time; but it is impossible for contrary determinations to belong to
        the same thing at the same time, for example, being well and ailing.
        Hence one of these must be good; but the potency may be both alike or
        neither; and therefore the actuality is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        802. And also in the case of evil things the goal or actuality must be
        worse than the potency; for it is the same potency that is capable of
        both contraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        803. It is clear, then, that evil does not exist apart from things; for
        evil is by its very nature subsequent to potency.
      </p>
      <p>
        804. Hence in those things which exist from the very beginning and are
        eternal, there is neither evil nor wrong nor corruption; for corruption
        belongs to evil things.
      </p>
      <p>
        805. And it is also by activity that geometrical constructions are
        discovered, because they are discovered by dividing. For if they had
        already been divided, they would be evident; but they are now present
        potentially. Why, for example, are the angles of a triangle equal to two
        right angles? Because the angles grouped around one point are equal to
        two right angles. Hence, if the line next to the one side were extended,
        the answer would be clear to anyone seeing the construction. Again, why
        is an angle in a semicircle always a right angle? Because, if its three
        lines are equal, two of which form the base and the other rests upon the
        middle point of the base, the answer will be evident to anyone who sees
        the construction and knows the former proposition. Hence, it is evident
        that constructions which exist potentially are discovered when they are
        brought to actuality; and the reason is that the intellectual
        comprehension of a thing is an actuality. Hence the potency proceeds
        from an actuality, and it is because people make these constructions
        that they attain knowledge of them. For in a thing numerically one and
        the same, actuality is subsequent in the order of generation.

      <p><i>Act is better in good things</i></p>
      <p>
        1883. Having compared actuality and potency from the viewpoint of
        priority and posteriority, the Philosopher now compares them from the
        viewpoint of good and evil; and in regard to this he does two things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he says that in the case of good things actuality is better than
        potency; and this was made clear from the fact that the potential is the
        same as what is capable of contrary determinations; for example, what
        can be well can also be ill and is in potency to both at the same time.
        The reason is that the potency for both is the same—for being well and
        ailing, and for being at rest and in motion, and for other opposites of
        this kind. Thus it is evident that a thing can be in potency to contrary
        determinations, although contrary determinations cannot be actual at the
        same time. Therefore, taking each contrary pair separately, one is good,
        as health, and the other evil, as illness. For in the case of contraries
        one of the two always has the character of something defective, and this
        pertains to evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        1884. Therefore what is actually good is good alone. But the potency may
        be related “to both” alike, i.e., in a qualified sense—as being in
        potency. But it is neither in an absolute sense—as being actual. It
        follows, then, that actuality is better than potency; because what is
        good in an absolute sense is better than what is good in a qualified
        sense and is connected with evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        1885. <b>And also</b> (802).<br />
        Second, he shows on the other hand that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >in the case of evil things the actuality is worse than the
          potency</span
        >; and in regard to this he does three things.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, he proves his thesis by the argument introduced above; for what
        is evil in an absolute sense and is not disposed to evil in a qualified
        sense is worse than what is evil in a qualified sense and is disposed
        both to evil and to good. Hence, since the potency for evil is not yet
        evil, except in a qualified sense (and the same potency is disposed to
        good, since it is the same potency which is related to contrary
        determinations), it follows that actual evil is worse than the potency
        for evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        1886. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is clear, then</span> (803).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he concludes from what has been said that evil itself is not a
        nature distinct from other things which are good by nature; for evil
        itself is subsequent in nature to potency, because it is worse and is
        farther removed from perfection. Hence, since a potency cannot be
        something existing apart from a thing, much less can evil itself be
        something apart from a thing.
      </p>
      <p>1887. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence in those</span> (804).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he draws another conclusion. For if evil is worse than potency,
        and there is no potency in eternal things, as has been shown above
        (1867), then
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >in eternal things there will be neither evil nor wrong nor any other
          corruption</span
        >; for corruption is a kind of evil. But this must be understood insofar
        as they are eternal and incorruptible; for nothing prevents them from
        being corrupted as regards place or some other accident of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>1888. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is</span> (805).</p>
      <p>
        Having compared potency and actuality from the viewpoint of priority and
        posteriority and from that of good and evil, be now compares them with
        reference to the understanding of the true and the false. In regard to
        this he does two things. First (805:C 1888), he compares them with
        reference to the act of understanding; and second (806:C 1895), with
        reference to the true and the false (“Now the terms”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (805), that “geometrical constructions,”
        i.e., geometrical descriptions, “are discovered,” i.e., made known by
        discovery in the actual drawing of the figures. For geometers discover
        the truth which they seek by dividing lines and surfaces. And division
        brings into actual existence the things which exist potentially; for the
        parts of a continuous whole are in the whole potentially before division
        takes place. However, if all had been divided to the extent necessary
        for discovering the truth, the conclusions which are being sought would
        then be evident. But since divisions of this kind exist potentially in
        the first drawing of geometrical figures, the truth which is being
        sought does not therefore become evident immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        1889. He explains this by means of two examples, and the first of these
        has to do with the question, “Why are the angles of a triangle equal to
        two right angles?” i.e., why does a triangle have three angles equal to
        two right angles? This is demonstrated as follows.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="Metaph9b.jpg" /></p>
      <p>
        Let ABC be a triangle having its base AC extended continuously and in a
        straight line. This extended base, then, together with the side BC of
        the triangle form an angle at point C, and this external angle is equal
        to the two interior angles opposite to it, i.e., angles ABC and BAC. Now
        it is evident that the two angles at point C, one exterior to the
        triangle and the other interior, are equal to two right angles; for it
        has been shown that, when one straight line falls upon another straight
        line, it makes two right angles or two angles equal to two right angles.
        Hence it follows that the interior angle at the point C together with
        the other two interior angles which are equal to the exterior angle,
        i.e., all three angles, are equal to two right angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1890. This, then, is what the Philosopher means when he says that it may
        be demonstrated that a triangle has two right angles, because the two
        angles which meet at the point C, one of which is interior to the
        triangle and the other exterior, are equal to two right angles. Hence
        when an angle is constructed which falls outside of the triangle and is
        formed by one of its sides, it immediately becomes evident to one who
        sees the arrangement of the figure that a triangle has three angles
        equal to two right angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1891. The second example has to do with the question, “Why is every
        angle in a semicircle a right angle?” This is demonstrated as follows.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="Metaph9a.jpg" /></p>
      <p>
        Let ABC be a semicircle, and at any point B let there be an angle
        subtended by the base AC, which is the diameter of the circle. I say,
        then, that angle B is a right angle. This is proved as follows: since
        the line AC is the diameter of the circle, it must pass through the
        center. Hence it is divided in the middle at the point D, and this is
        done by the line DB. Therefore the line DB is equal to the line DA,
        because both are drawn from the center to the circumference. In the
        triangle DBA, then, angle B and angle A are equal, because in every
        triangle having two equal sides the angles above the base are equal.
        Thus the two angles A and B are double the angle B alone. But the angle
        BDC, since it is exterior to the triangle, is equal to the two separate
        angles A and B. Therefore angle BDC is double the angle B alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        1892. And it is demonstrated in the same way that angle C is equal to
        angle B of the triangle BDC, because the two sides DB and DC are equal
        since they are drawn from the center to the circumference, and the
        exterior angle, ADB, is equal to both. Therefore it is double the angle
        B alone. Hence the two angles ADB and BDC are double the whole angle
        ABC. But the two angles ADB and BDC are either right angles or equal to
        two right angles, because the line DB falls on the line AC. Hence the
        angle ABC, which is in a semicircle, is a right angle.
      </p>
      <p>
        1893. This is what the Philosopher means when he says that the angle in
        a semicircle may be shown to be a right angle, because the three lines
        are equal, namely, the two into which the base is divided, i.e., DA and
        DC, and the third line, BD, which is drawn from the middle of these two
        lines and rests upon these. And it is immediately evident to one who
        sees this construction, and who knows the principles of geometry, that
        every angle in a semicircle is a right angle.
      </p>
      <p>
        1894. Therefore the Philosopher concludes that it has been shown that,
        when some things are brought from potency to actuality, their truth is
        then discovered. The reason for this is that understanding is an
        actuality, and therefore those things which are understood must be
        actual. And for this reason potency is known by actuality. Hence it is
        by making something actual that men attain knowledge, as is evident in
        the constructions described above. For in numerically one and the same
        thing actuality must be subsequent to potency in generation and in time,
        as has been shown above.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        806. Now the terms being and non-being are used in one sense with
        reference to the categorical figures; and in another with reference to
        the potentiality or actuality of these or their contraries; and in still
        another sense they are referred most properly to truth and falsity.
      </p>
      <p>
        807. And in things this consists in being combined or being separated.
        Hence he who thinks that what is separated is separated, and that what
        is combined is combined, is right; but he who thinks about things
        otherwise than as they are, is wrong. And it is necessary to consider
        what we mean when we say that truth and falsity exist or do not exist.
        For it is not because we are right in thinking that you are white that
        you are white, but it is because you are white that in saying this we
        speak the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        808. Therefore, if some things are always combined and it is impossible
        for them to be separated, and others are always separated and it is
        impossible for them to be combined, and others admit of both contraries,
        then being consists in being combined and being one, and non-being
        consists in not being combined and being many. Therefore with regard to
        contingent things the same opinion or statement becomes true and false,
        and it is possible for it at one time to be true and at another to be
        false. But with regard to those things which are incapable of being
        otherwise than as they are, an opinion is not sometimes true and
        sometimes false, but one. is always true and the other always false.
      </p>
      <p>
        809. However, with regard to things which are not composite, what is
        being and non-being, and what is truth and falsity? For such things are
        not composite so as to exist when combined and not exist when separated;
        for example, the proposition “The wood is white,” or the proposition
        “The diagonal is incommensurable.” Nor will truth and falsity still be
        present in them in the same way as in other things. And just as truth is
        not the same in these things, in a similar fashion neither is being the
        same.
      </p>
      <p>
        810. But truth or falsity is as follows: to come in contact with a thing
        and to express it is truth (for expression is not the same as
        affirmation), and not to come in contact with a thing is ignorance. For
        it is impossible to be deceived about a thing’s quiddity, except in an
        accidental sense; and the same holds true in the case of incomposite
        things, for it is impossible to be deceived about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        811. And they are all actual and not potential, for otherwise they would
        be generated and corrupted. But being itself is neither generated nor
        corrupted; otherwise it would be generated out of something. Therefore,
        regarding all those things which are really quiddities and actualities,
        it is impossible to be deceived about them, but one must either know
        them or not. But concerning them we may ask what they are, namely,
        whether they are such and such or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        812. Now considering being in the sense of truth and non-being in the
        sense of falsity, in the case of composite beings there is truth if the
        thing is combined with the attribute attributed to it; in the case of
        simple beings the thing is just simply so. And if a thing is truly a
        being, it is so in some particular way; but if it is not, it does not
        exist at all. Again, truth means to know these beings, and there is
        neither falsity nor deception about them but only ignorance; but not
        ignorance such as blindness is, for blindness is as if one did not have
        intellective power at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        813. And concerning immobile things it is also evident that there is no
        deception about them as regards time, if one assumes that they are
        immobile. For example, if one assumes that a triangle does not change,
        he will not be of the opinion that at one time its angles are equal to
        two right angles and that at another time they are not; for otherwise it
        would change. But he might assume that one thing has such and such a
        property and that another has not; for example, one might assume that no
        even number is a prime number, or that some are and some are not. But
        this is impossible as regards one single number; for one will not assume
        that one thing is such and another is not; but whether he speaks truly
        or falsely, a thing is always disposed in the same way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Truth and falsehood</i></p>
      <p>
        1895. Here the Philosopher compares actuality to potency with reference
        to truth and falsity; and in regard to this he does three things. First,
        he claims that truth and falsity are chiefly referred to actuality.
        Second (1896), he explains what he aims to do (“And in things”). Third
        (1917), he draws a corollary (“And concerning”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that, since being and non-being, which is
        its opposite, are divided in two ways: first, into the different
        categories—substance, quantity, quality and so forth; and second, into
        the potency and actuality of one or the other of contraries (since
        either one of two contraries may be actual or potential), it follows
        that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >true and false are most properly predicated of what is actual</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>1896. <b>And in things</b> (807).</p>
      <p>
        He now proves his thesis; and in regard to this he does three things.
        First, he makes this clear in the case of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">continuous</span> substances; and second
        (1901), in that of simple substances (“However, with regard”). Third
        (1914), he summarizes both of these (“Now considering”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains his
        thesis, saying that in things “this,” i.e., being true or false,
        consists merely in being combined or being separated. Hence one who
        thinks that to be <span style="font-weight: bold">separated</span> which
        is separated in reality, has a true opinion—for example, one who thinks
        that man is not an ass. And the same is true of one who thinks that to
        be <span style="font-weight: bold">combined</span> which is combined in
        reality—for example, one who thinks that man is an animal. But, on the
        other hand, one who relates things in thought in a different way than
        they are in their own proper nature has an erroneous opinion—for
        example, one who thinks that man is an ass, or that he is not an
        animal—because when a thing is or is not, it is then said to be true or
        false.
      </p>
      <p>
        1897. This must be understood as follows: you are not white because we
        think truly that you are white; but conversely we think you are white
        because you are white. Hence it has been shown that the way which a
        thing is disposed is the cause of truth both in thought and in speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        1898. He adds this in order to clarify what he said above, namely, that
        in things truth and falsity consist in being combined and being
        separated. For
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >the truth and falsity found in speech and in thought must be traced
          to a thing’s disposition as their cause</span
        >. Now when the intellect makes a combination, it receives two concepts,
        one of which is related to the other as a form; hence it takes one as
        being present in the other, because predicates are taken formally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, if such an operation of the intellect should be traced to a
        thing as its cause, then in composite substances the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">combination of matter and form</span>,
        or also the combination of subject and accident, must serve as the
        foundation and cause of the truth in the combination which the intellect
        makes in itself and expresses in words. For example, when I say,
        “Socrates is a man,” the truth of this enunciation is caused by
        combining the form humanity with the individual matter by means of which
        Socrates is this man; and when I say, “Man is white,” the cause of the
        truth of this enunciation is the combining of whiteness with the
        subject. It is similar in other cases. And the same thing is evident in
        the case of separation.
      </p>
      <p>1899. <b>Therefore</b> (808).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he concludes from what has been said that, if the combining and
        separating of a thing is the cause of the truth and falsity in thought
        and in speech, the difference between truth and falsity in thought and
        in speech must be based on the difference between the combining and
        separating of what exists in reality. Now in reality such difference is
        found to involve combination and separation, because (1) some things are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">always combined</span> and it is
        impossible for them to be separated; for example, sentient nature is
        always united to the rational soul, and it is impossible for the latter
        to be separated from the former in such a way that the rational soul may
        exist without the power of sensation, although on the other hand a
        sentient soul can exist without reason. Again, (2) some things are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">separated</span> and it is impossible
        for them to be combined, for example, black and white, and the form of
        an ass and that of a man. Again, (3) some things are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">open to contraries</span>, because they
        can be combined and separated, as man and white and also running.
      </p>
      <p>
        1900. However, the being in which the intellect’s act of combining
        consists, inasmuch as there is affirmation, indicates a certain
        composition and union; whereas non-being, which negation signifies, does
        away with composition and union and indicates plurality and otherness.
        Hence it was shown that in the case of things
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >which may be combined and separated</span
        >
        one and the same statement is sometimes true and sometimes false; for
        example, the statement “Socrates is sitting” is true when he is sitting;
        but the same statement is false when he gets up. And the same holds true
        in the case of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with regard to those things which cannot be otherwise than they are,
        i.e., those
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >which are always combined or separated</span
        >, it is impossible for the same thought or statement to be sometimes
        true and sometimes false; but what is true is always true, and what is
        false is always false; for example, the proposition “Man is an animal”
        is true, but the proposition “Man is an ass” is false.
      </p>
      <p>1901. <b>However, with regard</b> (809).</p>
      <p>
        He now explains how truth and falsity can be present in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">simple</span> things; and in regard to
        this he does three things. First, he shows that truth is not present in
        the same way in simple things and in composite ones. He says that in the
        case of things which are not composite but simple, such as immaterial
        substances, truth or falsity is not present in them (~) as a result of
        any combination or separation which occurs in reality, but (+) arises
        because their
        <span style="font-weight: bold">quiddity is known or not known</span>.
        For when we acquire knowledge of the quiddity of any simple being, the
        intellect seems to be true; and when we fail to acquire knowledge of its
        quiddity, but attribute something else to it, the intellect is then
        false.
      </p>
      <p>
        1902. For there is no composition in simple beings as a consequence of
        which it could be said that, when the thing is combined, the intellect
        in making a combination is then true; or that, when that is separated in
        reality which the intellect combines, the intellect is then not true. Or
        to express this in a different way, there is no composition in simple
        things by reason of which, when we express affirmatively that it is so,
        its composition is signified; and when we express negatively that it is
        not so, its separation is signified; as, for example, in the case of
        composite things, when it is said that a piece of wood is white, its
        composition is signified, or when it is said that it is not white, or
        that the diagonal is not commensurable, its separation is signified.
      </p>
      <p>
        1903. Thus it is evident that truth and falsity are not present in
        simple things in the same way as in composite things. Nor is this
        surprising, since
        <span style="font-weight: bold">being also is not the same in both</span
        >; but the being of composite things results from their components,
        whereas that of simple things does not. Now truth follows being,
        because, as was said in Book II (298) of this work, the structure of
        things in being and in truth is the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence those things which are not similar in being are not similar in
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>1904. <b>But truth</b> (810).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows how truth and falsity are present in simple things. He
        says that in the case of simple things truth and falsity are such as
        will be explained; for to come in contact with a simple thing through
        the intellect, in such a way as to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">apprehend what it is</span> “and to
        express it,” i.e., to signify this simple thing by a word, constitutes
        the truth present in simple things. And since sometimes the word “to
        express” is taken for affirmative predication, which involves
        composition, he rejects this interpretation. He says that affirmation
        and expression are not the same, because affirmation occurs when one
        thing is predicated of something else, and this implies combination,
        whereas expression is the simple utterance of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        1905. Therefore to come in contact with simple things through the
        intellect and to express them constitutes truth; but not to come in
        contact with them is not to know them at all. For whoever does not grasp
        the quiddity of a simple thing is completely ignorant of it; because one
        cannot both know and not know something about it, since it is not
        composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1906. Moreover, since he had said that to come in contact with simple
        things is to express their truth, it would seem that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">not to come in contact</span> with them
        is (~) to be false or in error. He did not say this, however, but said
        that not to come in contact with them is (+) not to know them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence he gives the reason why not to come in contact with them is not to
        be in error about them, saying that it is possible to be in error about
        their quiddity only accidentally; and this must be understood as
        follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        1907. It was said above in Book VII (1362) and in Book VIII (1710) that
        in the case of simple substances the thing itself and its quiddity are
        one and the same. Hence, since a simple substance is its own quiddity,
        the judgment about the knowledge of a simple substance and the judgment
        about the knowledge of its quiddity are one and the same. But the
        intellect is deceived about a quiddity only accidentally; for either a
        person comes in contact with a thing’s quiddity through his intellect,
        and then he truly knows what that thing is; or he does not come in
        contact with it, and then he does not know what it is. Hence, with
        regard to such a thing the intellect is neither true nor false. This is
        why Aristotle says in Book III of <i>The Soul</i> that, just as a sense
        is always true with regard to its proper object, in a similar fashion
        the intellect is always true with regard to its proper object—quiddity.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the fact that the intellect is not deceived about a thing’s quiddity
        applies not only in the case of simple substances but also in that of
        composite ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        1908. Now it is necessary to consider how one may be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidentally deceived</span> about a
        quiddity. For a person is deceived about a quiddity only as a result of
        combining or separating; and with regard to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">composite</span> substances this may
        occur in two ways. (1) First, it may occur by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">combining</span> a definition with
        something defined or by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">separating</span> them; for example, if
        someone were to say that an ass is a mortal rational animal, or that a
        man is not a mortal rational animal, both would be false. (2) Second,
        insofar as a definition is composed of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">parts</span> which are incompatible with
        each other; for example, if someone were to give this definition—man is
        a non-sensible animal. Thus a definition is said to be false in the
        first way because it is not the definition of this thing; and in the
        second way it is said to be false in itself, as the Philosopher has
        instructed us above in Book V (1132).
      </p>
      <p>
        1909. Now we can be deceived accidentally about the quiddity of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">simple</span> substances only in the
        first way; for their quiddity is not composed of many parts in the
        combining and separating of which falsity can arise.
      </p>
      <p>1910. <b>And they are</b> (811).</p>
      <p>
        He adapts his remarks about simple substances to his main thesis, in
        which he shows that truth involves actuality rather than potency.
        Indeed, he had shown this to be true in the case of composite substances
        insofar as their truth embodies combination and separation, which
        designate actuality. But he shows that this is true in the case of
        simple substances from the fact that they do not contain falsity but
        only truth. And for this reason they are not potential but actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        1911. He accordingly says that all simple substances are actual beings
        and are never potential ones; for if they were sometimes actual and
        sometimes potential, they would be generated and corrupted. But this
        cannot be the case, as has been shown above (1715), for substances of
        this kind are forms alone, and for this reason they are also beings of
        themselves. Now what exists of itself is neither generated nor
        corrupted, for everything that is generated is generated from something.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >But being in an absolute sense cannot be generated from
          anything</span
        >; for there is nothing apart from being but only apart from some
        particular being, just as there is some being apart from man. Hence this
        being can be generated in a qualified sense, but being in an absolute
        sense cannot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence what is a being of itself, because it is a form, from which being
        naturally follows, cannot be generated; and for this reason it is not
        sometimes potential and sometimes actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        1912. Therefore, since truth consists chiefly in actuality, it is
        unfitting that there should be error or falsity in all those things
        which are actual only and are what something truly is, since they are
        quiddities or forms; but they must either be understood if they are
        grasped by the intellect, or not be understood at all if they are not
        grasped by the intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        1913. But even though it is impossible to be (~) deceived about these
        things as regards their <span style="font-weight: bold">essence</span>,
        this is nevertheless (+ possible when “we ask what they are,” i.e.,
        whether they are of such and such a nature or not. Hence it is possible
        to be deceived about them
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidentally</span>, as someone might
        ask whether a simple substance is fire or a corporeal substance or not,
        because if it is held to be a corporeal substance, there will be falsity
        accidentally as a result of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">combination</span>.
      </p>
      <p>1914. <b>Now considering</b> (812).</p>
      <p>
        He summarizes the statements he has made about truth and falsity both
        with reference to composite things and to simple ones. He says that this
        being which signifies truth and non-being which signifies falsity
        (because he who says that a man is white signifies this to be true; and
        he who says that a man is not white signifies this to be false), being
        and non-being in this sense, I say, are used (1) in one way in the case
        of the <span style="font-weight: bold">composition of things</span>.
        That is, there is truth if what the intellect combines is combined in
        reality, but there is falsity if what the intellect combines when it
        understands or forms a proposition is not combined in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1915. (2) And truth exists in a different way in the case of simple
        things, if what is truly a being,” i.e., the quiddity or substance of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">simple</span> thing, is as it is
        understood to be; but if it is not as it is understood to be, no truth
        exists in the intellect. Thus truth consists in understanding these
        things; but concerning them there is neither falsity nor error in the
        intellect, as has been explained (1912), but ignorance; for if one does
        not grasp the quiddity of a thing, one does not know that thing in any
        way at all. In the case of composite things, however, one can know one
        of their properties and be deceived about the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        1916. Furthermore, he shows what sort of ignorance this is when he says
        that this ignorance is not “a privation such as blindness,” which is the
        privation of the power of sight. Hence that ignorance would be similar
        to blindness if one did not have the intellective power of acquiring
        knowledge of simple substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from this it is evident that according to the opinion of Aristotle
        the human intellect can acquire an understanding of simple substances.
        This is a point which he seems to have left unsolved in <i>The Soul</i>,
        Book III:3.
      </p>
      <p>1917. <b>And concerning</b> (813).</p>
      <p>
        Here he introduces a corollary. He says that it is evident from what has
        been said that there is no error about (~) immobile things as regards
        <span style="font-weight: bold">time</span>. But in the case of (+)
        contingent things, which are not always so, it is possible to be in
        error about them as regards time; for example, if Socrates is going to
        sit down and someone were to judge this to be so, he could be deceived
        insofar as he might judge that Socrates is going to sit down when he is
        not. The same thing would be true if someone were to think that an
        eclipse will occur when it will not. But in the case of immobile things
        and those which always are, the above can occur only in one way, i.e.,
        if someone were to think that these things are mobile and that they do
        not always exist; for he is then in error about them, but he would not
        be in error as regards time. Hence he says that, if someone thinks that
        they are immobile, he will not be deceived about them as regards time.
      </p>
      <p>
        1918. He says this, then, because, if someone assumes that they are
        immobile, he will not think that they sometimes are and sometimes are
        not, and thus he is not deceived about them as regards time. For
        example, if someone thinks that a triangle is unchangeable, he will not
        be of the opinion that the sum of its angles will sometimes equal two
        right angles and sometimes will not, for it would then be both
        changeable and unchangeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        1919. But in the case of immobile things it is possible to consider
        under one common aspect one thing that has such and such a property and
        another that has not; for example, it is possible to understand that
        under triangle some triangles are equilateral and others are not. And it
        is possible to ask whether no even number is prime, or whether some are
        and some are not—a prime number being one which the unit alone measures.
        Hence among even numbers only the number two is a prime number, but none
        of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        And regarding what is numerically one, in the case of immobile things it
        is impossible to be in error or to be deceived even in this [taking one
        thing that has and another that has not a certain property]. For in the
        case of something numerically one it is impossible for anyone to think
        that one individual can be so and another not be so; for what is
        numerically one is not divided into many. Hence he will have to say what
        is true or false in an unqualified sense, since what is numerically one
        always exists in the same way and is incapable of being diversified
        either in point of time or of subjects. From this it is clear that truth
        has to do with actuality; for immobile things as such are always actual.
