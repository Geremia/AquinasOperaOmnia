    It seems that he did, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The Master says: “Before sin, man saw God independently of any medium.”
    But to see God independently of any medium is to see God through His
    essence. Therefore in the state of innocence man saw God through His
    essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. It was said that the Master means that man saw God without a medium as
    far as obscurity due to sin is concerned, but not that he saw God without
    using creatures as a medium.—On the contrary, in that same place the Master
    says that, since we see God through a medium, we must reach Him by means of
    visible creatures. Therefore, he seems to mean the use of creatures as a
    medium. But to see without the use of creatures as a medium is to see
    through the essence. Therefore.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In Philippians (4:7) it is said: “And the peace of God, which surpasseth
    all understanding.” But this means the peace which God gives the blessed in
    heaven. The Gloss explains it in this way: “All understanding, that is, our
    understanding, not the understanding of those who always see the face of the
    Father.” From this we see that the peace or joy of the blessed surpasses the
    understanding of all those who do not possess that joy. But Adam in his
    innocence saw the joys of the blessed. Hence, Gregory says: “Man, losing
    himself by sin, could not then see those joys of heaven which he was
    accustomed to contemplate before.” Therefore, in that state Adam possessed
    the joy of heaven.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Hugh of St. Victor says: “In that state man knew his Creator with the
    knowledge with which He was then more clearly seen as present in
    contemplation. But to see God as present in contemplation would seem to be
    to see Him through His essence. Therefore, in the state of innocence Adam
    saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Man was made to see God. For God made rational creatures to participate
    in His beatitude. This consists in seeing Him, as is shown in the
    <i>Sentences.</i> Therefore, if Adam in the state of innocence did not see
    God through His essence, this was only because some medium prevented him
    from doing so. However, the medium due to sin did not prevent him, for he
    was then free from sin. Nor did the use of creatures as a medium prevent
    him, for God is closer to the rational soul than any creature is. Therefore,
    in the state of innocence Adam saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. just as the affective part of man is perfected only by the highest good,
    so the cognitive part is perfected only by the highest truth, as is clear
    from <i>Spirit and Soul</i>. But everyone has within him the desire of his
    perfection. Therefore, in his original state Adam desired to see God through
    His essence. But whoever is deprived of that which he desires suffers.
    Therefore, if Adam did not then see God through His essence, he suffered.
    However, this is false, because suffering, since it is a punishment, cannot
    precede sin. Therefore, he saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The soul of man “is so made to God’s image that it is formed by the first
    truth itself without the interposition of any creature,” as is said in
    <i>Spirit and Soul</i>. But the image remained pure and whole in man in the
    state of innocence. Therefore, he was brought to the highest truth itself
    without any medium. Consequently, he saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. For us actually to understand something, all that is needed is the
    formation of actually intelligible species through abstraction from matter
    and the conditions of matter, which is the work of the agent intellect, and
    reception in our understanding, which is the work of the possible intellect.
    But the divine essence is of itself intelligible, inasmuch as it is
    completely separated from matter. It was also at the very center of man’s
    soul, since God is said to be in all things through His essence. Therefore,
    since in the state of innocence there would be no obstacle in the soul of
    man, it seems that he saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Since in the state of innocence Adam’s soul was properly ordered, higher
    reason was not less perfectly disposed toward its object than lower reason
    toward its proper object. But lower reason, whose task it is to give its
    attention to temporal things, could see those temporal things immediately.
    Therefore, higher reason, whose task it is to contemplate eternal things,
    could see immediately the eternal essence of God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. That by which something is made actually sensible, namely, light, is
    known immediately by the sense of sight. Therefore, that by which something
    becomes actually intelligible is known immediately by man’s understanding.
    But a thing is made actually intelligible by another only in so far as that
    other is in act. So, since God alone is pure act, He Himself is that by
    which all things become intelligible. Therefore, man’s understanding in the
    first state saw God immediately, since then it had no obstacle.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. Damascene says that in the state of innocence man “had a life which was
    blessed and rich in all things.” But life’s beatitude consists in seeing God
    through His essence. Therefore, he then saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Damascene says: “Man was then refreshed by the enjoyment of the sweetest
    contemplation, like another angel.” But the angels see God through His
    essence. Therefore, in that state Adam saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. Man’s nature was more perfect in the state of innocence than after the
    fall. But after the fall some were allowed to see God through His essence
    while they still lived in this mortal life, as Augustine says of Paul and
    Moses. Therefore, with much greater reason Adam in the state of innocence
    saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. The Gloss on Genesis (2:2 1), “Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon
    Adam,” says: “The correct interpretation is that Adam was made to fall into
    the ecstasy so that his mind, becoming a part of the angelic court and
    entering the sanctuary of God, might understand the last things.”“ From this
    it seems that that sleep was a kind of rapture. But those who are enraptured
    see God through His essence. Therefore, Adam, also, saw Him through His
    essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. According to Damascene, Adam was placed not only in a corporeal but also
    in a spiritual paradise. But spiritual paradise is nothing other than
    beatitude, which consists in the sight of God through His essence.
    Therefore, he saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. Augustine says: “In the state of innocence nothing was missing which a
    good will could acquire.” But a good will could acquire the sight of God
    through His essence. Therefore, this was not missing in the first parents.
    Therefore, they saw God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine says. that the sight of God through His essence is “the whole
    reward” of the saints. But in the state of innocence Adam was not one of the
    blessed. Therefore, he did not see God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Bernard says that in this life God can be loved entirely, but not seen
    entirely. But He would be seen entirely if He were seen through His essence,
    since His essence is simple. Therefore, while he was in this life Adam could
    not see God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. When the soul is weighed down by the burden of the flesh, it loses
    distinct knowledge of things. Hence, Boethius says: “Retaining the sum
    total, it loses the individuals.” But in the state of innocence man’s soul
    was weighed down to some extent by the body, although not as much as after
    sin. Therefore, he was withheld from sight of the divine essence, for which
    the mind must be most perfectly disposed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. It is proper to Christ alone to be wayfarer and possessor at the same
    time. But in the state of innocence Adam was a wayfarer, as is clear from
    the fact that he could sin. Hence, he was not a possessor, and so did not
    see God through His essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Some have said that there is sight of God through His essence not only in
    hcavcn but also in this life, although not as perfectly in this life as in
    heaven. According to this opinion, man in the state of innocence had a sight
    midway between the sight of the blessed and the sight of man after the fall.
    For he saw less perfectly than the blessed, but more perfectly than man can
    see after the fall.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But this position is contrary to the testimony of Scripture, which
    consistently makes the sight of God man’s final beatitude. Hence, from the
    very fact that a man sees God through His essence he is blessed. Thus, as
    the common opinion maintains, no one still on the way to beatitude can see
    God through His essence, not even Adam in the state of innocence. And reason
    can show the truth of this.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For every nature has something ultimate in which its final perfection
    consists. Now, the perfection of man, in so far as he is man, consists only
    in the act of understanding, by which he is constituted man. However, in the
    activity of understanding different levels can be distinguished in two ways.
    In one they derive from the diversity of intelligible objects. For, as the
    intelligible object which a person understands is more noble, so the more
    noble is his intelligence. For this reason, the <i>Ethics</i> says that the
    most perfect activity of understanding is the activity of that understanding
    which is well ordered to the best intelligible thing, just as the most
    beautiful physical sight is that of the sight “which is well ordered to the
    most beautiful object of sight.” In the other way, levels in the activity of
    understanding derive from the manner of understanding. For it is possible
    for one and the same intelligible object to be understood differently by
    different minds, more perfectly by one, and less perfectly by another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, it is not possible for the final limit of human perfection to be
    taken according to some manner of understanding, for among these modes of
    understanding one can perceive an infinite number of levels, one of which
    understands more perfectly than another. Nor is there any one who
    understands so perfectly that it is impossible to devise another who
    understands more perfectly, except God, who understands everything with
    infinite clarity. Hence, the final term of human perfection must lie in the
    understanding of some most perfect intelligible object, which is the divine
    essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, every rational creature finds its beatitude in this, that it
    sees the essence of God, and not in this, that it sees it with such a degree
    of clarity, or more or less. Consequently, the sight of the blessed is not
    distinguished from the sight of those in this life because the former see
    more perfectly and the latter less perfectly, but because the former see and
    the latter do not see. Therefore, since Adam was still on the way to
    beatitude, he did not see God through His essence.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. In a given sight a threefold medium can be discerned. One is the medium
    <i>under which</i> it is seen; the second that by <i>which</i> it is seen,
    and this is the intentional likeness of the thing seen; the third is that
    <i>from which</i> one obtains knowledge of the thing seen. Thus, for
    instance, in bodily sight the medium under which a thing is seen is light,
    by which the thing becomes actually visible and the power of sight is given
    the perfection of seeing. The medium by which a thing is seen is the
    sensible species itself of the thing existing in the eye, which, as the form
    of the one seeing in so far as he is seeing, is the principle of the
    activity of sight. And the medium from which one receives knowledge of a
    thing seen is like a mirror, from which the eye at times receives the
    species of some visible thing, for example, a stone, and not from the stone
    itself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We find these three in intellectual sight, too. Thus, the light of the agent
    intellect corresponds to physical light as the medium under which our
    understanding sees. The intelligible species, by which the possible
    intellect is made actually to understand, corresponds to the visible
    species. And, finally, the effects from which we come to a knowledge of a
    cause correspond to the medium from which knowledge of the thing seen is
    obtained, as from a mirror. For the likeness of the cause is not imprinted
    on our understanding directly by the cause, but by the effect, in which a
    likeness of the cause shines forth. Consequently, this type of knowledge is
    called “mirrored” knowledge because of the likeness which it has to sight
    which takes place through a mirror.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, to know God, man, as he is after the fall, needs a medium which
    is like a mirror, in which there arises a likeness of God himself. For we
    must reach “the invisible things of him... by the things that are made,”
    according to Romans (1:20). Man in the state of innocence, however, did not
    need this medium, but he did need a medium which is somewhat like the
    species of the thing seen, because he saw God through a spiritual light
    which was given to the human mind by God, and which was a kind of expressed
    likeness of the uncreated light.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But he will not need this medium in heaven, because he will see the essence
    of God in itself and not through any intelligible or sensible likeness of
    it, since no created likeness can so perfectly represent God that one who
    sees through it can know the essence of God. Yet, he will need the light of
    glory, which will be a kind of medium under which God is seen, according to
    Psalms (3 5:10): “In thy light we shall see light.” The reason for this is
    that this sight is not natural to any creature, but only to God. As a
    result, no creature can reach it by his own natural power, but to acquire it
    one must be enlightened by a divinely given light.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The second sight, through a medium which is an intentional likeness, is
    natural to the angels, but above human nature. Accordingly, for it man needs
    the light of grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The third Sight is proper to human nature; hence, it alone remains in man
    after the fall. Therefore, it is clear that the sight by which man in the
    state of innocence saw God was midway between the sight which we now have
    and the sight of the blessed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, it is clear that after the fall man needs a triple medium to
    see God: creatures themselves, from which he rises to knowledge of God; a
    likeness of God, which he gets from creatures; and a light from which he
    receives the perfection of being directed toward God. This light may be the
    light of nature, such as the light of the agent intellect, or the light of
    grace, such as that of faith and wisdom. In the state before the fall,
    however, he needed a double medium: one which is a likeness of God, and one
    which is a light elevating and directing his mind. The blessed, however,
    need only one medium, the light of glory which elevates the mind. And God
    sees Himself without any medium, for He Himself is the light by which He
    sees Himself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The Master does not reject the possibility of seeing God in the state of
    innocence through some likeness of a creature as a medium, but only the
    necessity of the medium of visible creation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In the state of innocence Adam did not perceive the joys of the heavenly
    court so that he understood what and how great they were, for this belongs
    only to the blessed. However, he did know that they existed, because he, had
    some participation of them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. In contemplation, God is seen through a medium which is the light of
    wisdom. This elevates the mind to the sight of things divine, not, however,
    to immediate vision of the divine essence itself. And it is in this way that
    God is seen through grace by the contemplatives after the fall, although He
    is seen more perfectly in the state of innocence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Man was made to see God, not in the beginning but in the last stage of
    his perfection. Therefore, that he did not see God through His essence at
    the beginning of his existence was not the result of being hindered by some
    obstacle, but only the result of his own imperfection, because he did not
    then have that perfection which is needed to see the divine essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. In the state of innocence Adam desired to see God through His essence,
    but that desire of his was well ordered. For he strove to see God when it
    would be time for him to do so. Hence, he did not suffer at all at not
    seeing God before the proper time.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Our mind is said to be formed immediately by the first truth itself, not
    because [there is question whether] it knows the first truth at times
    through the mediation of some habit, species, or creature, but because it is
    formed by it as a copy is formed to the likeness of its immediate exemplar.
    For some have held, as Dionysius points out, that among beings the higher
    are the models for the lower, and thus the soul of man proceeds from God
    through the mediation of angels, and is formed to the divine model through
    the mediation of an angelic model. The passage cited denies this, for the
    human mind is created immediately by God and formed immediately by Himself
    as its exemplar. For this reason, also, it achieves beatitude immediately in
    Him as its end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Although, intrinsically, God is completely intelligible, and was present
    to the mind of man in the state of innocence, He was not there as an
    intelligible form. For man’s understanding did not yet have the perfection
    needed for this.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. The object of higher reason according to its natural state is not the
    divine essence itself, but certain intelligible characters which flow into.
    the mind from God and are received from creatures. By these we are brought
    to the perfection of sight of eternal things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. The agent intellect is the immediate and proximate principle by which
    things which are potentially intelligible become actually intelligible. But
    the first principle by which all things become intelligible is uncreated
    light itself. Thus, the divine essence is compared to intelligible things as
    the substance of the sun is to visible bodies. However, it is not necessary
    for one who sees some color to see the substance of the sun, but only the
    light of the sun, in so far as it illumines color. Similarly, it is not
    necessary for one who knows some intelligible thing to see the divine
    essence, but only to perceive intelligible light, which originally derives
    from God, in so far as by it something is made actually intelligible.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. We should not take what Damascene says to mean that Adam was one of the
    blessed simply, but that he had the kind of beatitude which fitted his
    state. Similarly, in the state of affliction some are said to be blessed in
    some respect by reason of some perfection which exists in them, as in
    Matthew (5:3): “Blessed are the poor in spirit...”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Even the angels in the state of their original nature did not see God
    through His essence; this belonged to them only through glory. But in the
    state of innocence Adam had through grace the kind of sight which the angels
    had naturally, as has been said. Therefore, he is said to have seen as
    another angel.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. By a certain privilege of grace Moses and Paul saw God through His
    essence. Still, although simply they were in the state of wayfarers, in some
    respect, that is, in so far as they saw God through His essence, they were
    not in that state. Therefore in the state of innocence, in which he was
    still a wayfarer, Adam had no claim to vision of God through His essence.
    Yet, if by a rapture he was raised above the ordinary knowledge which
    belonged to him, and so saw God through His essence, it is not strange, for
    such a grace can be given just as well in the state of innocence as after
    the fall.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. If we maintain that Adam’s ecstasy was of the same nature as Paul’s
    rapture, then we will say that that vision surpassed the ordinary manner of
    sight which then belonged to him. But, since it does not explicitly say that
    in that sleep he saw God through His essence, we can say that in that
    ecstasy he was not elevated to a vision of the essence of God, but to a
    knowledge of certain more profound truths about the divine mysteries than
    was fitting for him to know at that time according to the common manner of
    human cognition.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. Spiritual paradise, in so far as it means perfect delight, which makes
    one blessed, consists in the sight of God. But, in so far as it means
    delight about God without qualification, it consists in any kind of
    contemplation which has God as its object.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. His will would not have been good and well ordered if he had desired to
    have at that time what did not then belong to him. For this reason, the
    conclusion does not follow.

        1. To know God through creatures is to know a cause through an effect.
        But this is knowledge which involves comparison and investigation, and,
        since this is feeble and imperfect, it did not befit man in the state of
        innocence. Therefore, in the state of innocence Adam did not see God
        through creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. When the cause is removed the effect is removed. But Isidore says
        that the cause why man sees God through creatures is that he turned from
        the Creator and toward creatures. This was not yet so at that time in
        the state of innocence. Therefore, at that time man did not see God
        through creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to Hugh of St. Victor, man in that state knew God,
        tcontemplating Him as present.” But He is seen in contemplation without
        the medium of creatures. Therefore, he did not see God through
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Isidore says that the angels, created before the rest of creation,
        did not know God through creatures. But, according to Damascene, man in
        the state of innocence saw God as another angel. Therefore, he did not
        know God from creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Darkness is not the reason for knowing light. But, compared to the
        Creator, every creature is darkness. Therefore, the Creator cannot be
        known through creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Augustine says: “I say that perhaps He spoke with them [our first
        parents] in this way, although not with the same degree of participation
        in the divine wisdom as the angels possess, yet, with whatever greater
        limitations imposed by human nature, within the same general category of
        vision and conversation. “ From this it seems that we can conclude that
        man in the state of innocence knew God with the same mode of knowledge
        with which the angels know him. But angels do not know God through
        creatures, as is clear in Augustine and Dionysius. Therefore, man in the
        state of innocence did not see God through creatures.

        7. The soul of man is more like God than is any sensible creature,
        Therefore, when the soul of man was in its purity, it did not seek
        knowledge of God through visible creation.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Less perfect knowledge is superfluous when more perfect is given.

        “as present in contemplation.” Therefore, he did not know God through
        creatures.

        Damascene says that Adam was established in a bodily paradise that there
        he might view his Creator through creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For a clear understanding of this question we must bear in mind that,
        according to Boethius, nature begins with perfect things. This can be
        seen in divine works, for in any work of God the things which are first
        are perfect. Hence, since in the state of innocence God made Adam the
        source of the whole human race, not only to transmit human nature to
        posterity but also to pass on original justice to others, man in the
        state of innocence must be considered as having had a twofold
        perfection. One of these is natural and the other is given freely by God
        over and above what is due from natural principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        According to natural perfection, however, man could fittingly know God
        only from creation. This is clear from the following. In any genus a
        passive power extends only to those things to which an active power
        extends. Therefore, the Commentator says” that there is no passive power
        in nature for which there is not a corresponding active power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In human nature, however, there is a double power for understanding: one
        passive, which is the possible intellect, and the other active, which is
        the agent intellect. Consequently, the possible intellect according to
        the natural process is in potency only to those forms which become
        actually intelligible through the agent intellect. But these are only
        the forms of sensible things which are abstracted from phantasms’ For
        immaterial substances are intelligible of themselves and not because we
        make them intelligible. Therefore, our possible intellect cannot reach
        any intelligible objects except through those forms which it abstracts
        from phantasms. Thus it is that by our natural power we can know God
        and’ other immaterial substances only through sensible things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, in the state of innocence, man, by reason of the perfection of
        grace, received a knowledge of God by means of an internal inspiration
        due to the irradiation of divine wisdom. In this way he did not know God
        from visible creation but from a spiritual likeness imprinted on his
        mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, there were thus in man two kinds of knowledge of God, one,
        by which he knew God as the angels do, through an internal inspiration;
        the other, by which he knew God as we do, through sensible creatures.
        However, this second knowledge of his differed from our knowledge as the
        investigation of one who has the habit of a science and proceeds from
        things he knows to a consideration of things which he had once known
        differs from the investigation of one who is learning and strives to
        proceed from what he knows to things which he does not know. However, we
        cannot have knowledge of God any other way except by coming to know Him
        from creatures. But Adam, who already knew God in a different way, that
        is, through an internal inspiration, also possessed a knowledge of Him
        from creatures.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That process of reasoning by which we reach the unknown from the
        known includes imperfection, since through it what is sought is unknown.
        But the process of reasoning which man in the state of innocence made
        use of was not of that sort. However, there is nothing to prevent us
        from saying that something [im]perfect belonged to man in that state,
        not indeed [im]perfect in that which was due to his nature, but by
        comparison with a higher nature. For, when human nature was created, it
        did not have as much perfection as an angelic nature or the divine
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. What Isidore says gives the reason why man had of necessity to get
        his knowledge of God, as an unknown, from creatures. Man in the state of
        innocence did not need this, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Besides the knowledge of contemplation, he had another knowledge of
        God by which he knew Him from creatures, as was said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Through grace, Adam was like an angel in the knowledg e of
        contemplation.,But besides this he had another knowledge belonging to
        his nature, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Creatures are darkness in so far as they are from nothing, but, in so
        far as they are from God, they participate in some likeness of Him and
        thus lead to His likeness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. There, Augustine is talking of that knowledge which is had through
        divine inspiration. This is clear from the fact that he mentions there
        the speech of God, and is not altogether silent about the other mode of
        knowledge, when he adds: “Perhaps, also, God spoke to him with that
        manner of speaking which takes place through creatures,” whether by
        images of bodies in ecstasy of spirit, or by some image presented to the
        senses of the body themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although the soul is more like God than any other creature is, it
        cannot reach a knowledge of His nature so that it can distinguish it
        from other things except through sensible creatures, from which our
        knowledge takes its origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Although Adam saw God through the light of contemplation, the
        knowledge by which he saw God by means of creatures was not superfluous,
        that is to say, it was not superfluous that he knew the same thing in
        several ways, and that he had not only gratuitous but also natural
        knowledge.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In his first state, Adam had faith. This becomes evident if we consider
        the object of faith. For the object of faith is the first truth itself,
        in so far as it is not evident. Moreover, I say not evident, either
        through an intentional likeness, as it appears to the blessed, or
        through natural reason, as some things about God are known to some
        philosophers, as that He is intelligible, incorporeal, and so on. Adam,
        however, knew not only what can be known about God by natural reason,
        but even more. However, he did not attain to vision of God through His
        essence. Consequently, it is clear that he had knowledge of God through
        faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But faith is twofold, according to a twofold hearing and a twofold
        speaking. For “faith cometh by hearing,” as is said in Romans (10:17).
        Now, there is an external speaking, by which God speaks to us through
        preachers, and an interior speaking, by which He speaks to us through an
        internal inspiration. This internal inspiration is called a kind of
        speaking in view of its likeness to external speaking. For, as in
        external speaking we present to the hearer not the thing itself which we
        want to make known but a sign of that thing, that is to say, a word
        which expresses some meaning; so in internal inspiration it is not His
        essence which God presents to view, but some sign of His essence, which
        is some spiritual likeness of His wisdom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Faith arises in the hearts of the faithful from both kinds of hearing.
        By interior hearing it arose in those who first received faith and
        taught it, as in the Apostles and Prophets. Hence, in Psalms (84:9) we
        read: “I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me.” But faith arises
        in the hearts of the rest of the faithful, who receive knowledge of the
        faith through other men, by the second kind of hearing. Adam, however,
        had faith, and as one who first learned it from God. Therefore, he
        should have had faith through interior speaking.

        1. He did not have knowledge so plain that it was enough to remove the
        obscurity of faith. This is removed only through the appearance of the
        first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Hugh denies to the first man the kind of knowledge of faith which
        belongs to us, who have knowledge of faith, not through a revelation
        made to us, but through adherence to revelations made to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That experience which man had was not the kind which those who see
        God through His essence have, as has been said earlier. Therefore, it is

        there were many things which were in the future. Therefore, he did not
        have knowledge of all creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As Avicenna says, the senses are necessary to the human soul so that
        through them it may get perfect knowledge of things. Therefore, if the
        soul of Adam had knowledge of all things from the beginning, his senses
        would have been given to him to no purpose. But this cannot be, since
        nothing is to no purpose in the works of God. Therefore, he did not have
        knowledge of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. As Boethius says: “Though the mind is born enfolded in the cloud of
        bodily members, it has not completely forgotten itself, and, while
        losing the particulars, it retains the sum.” Here it is shown that the
        soul, when first created, had confused knowledge, by which it knew
        things in general, but did not have distinct knowledge, by which it knew
        individual things in their proper natures. Therefore, if Adam had the
        kind of knowledge which it is fitting for the human soul to have when it
        is created, it seems that he did not have knowledge of creatures
        distinctly, but only in a confused way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Proper knowledge of a thing is had only through the existence of its
        proper species in the soul. But, as appears from the Philosopher, when
        the human soul is created, it is “like a tablet on which nothing is
        written.” Therefore, when Adam was first created, he could not have
        proper knowledge of created things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said that, although he did not have this in virtue of his
        nature, he had it by divine gift.—On the contrary, when first created,
        all men are equal with respect to merit, and specifically similar to
        each other. Therefore, if perfect knowledge of things was conferred on
        Adam by God when he was first created, it seems that with equal reason
        this is conferred on all other men when they are created. But we see
        that this is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Nothing which is moved toward the perfection of knowledge is at the
        term of its perfection. But Adam was moved toward the perfection of
        knowledge. Therefore, he was not at the term of knowledge, as one who
        had perfect knowledge of creatures. I prove the minor: According to the
        Philosopher, before the intellect understands, it is not anything of the
        things which exist. But, after it understands, it is actually something
        of those things. Thus, at some time it is actually something of things
        that exist, and sometimes it is not. But everything which has this kind
        of existence is on the way to perfect act. Therefore, when first
        created, the human understanding is on the way to perfect knowledge.
        Hence, when Adam’s understanding was first created, it was not at the
        term of perfect knowledge, but on the way to perfection.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. For angels to be infused with knowledge of all natural things as soon
        as they are created is part of the excellence of angelic nature,
        according to <i>The Causes:</i> “Every intelligence is full of forms.”
        But human nature does not rise to the excellence of angelic nature.
        Therefore, it was not fitting for the soul of the first man, when first
        created, to have knowledge of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. It is possible for the intellect to understand only when it actually
        becomes the intelligible thing. But the human understanding cannot
        actually become many intelligible things at once. Therefore, neither can
        it know many intelligible things at once; hence, the first man could not
        have knowledge of all things at once.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. For every subject of perfectibility there <i>is</i> one corresponding
        perfection, because one power cannot be perfected at one time except by
        one act of one kind. Thus, in first matter there can be only one
        substantial form, and in a body only one color. But the human
        understanding is a power which is perfected by the habits of the
        sciences. Therefore, it is impossible for many habits to be in the soul
        at the same time. Consequently, Adam’s soul could not have knowledge of
        all things, since different things are known through different habits.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. If Adam knew all creatures, he knew them either in the Word, or in
        their proper natures, or in his intelligence. But he did not know them
        in the Word, for that is the knowledge of the blessed, who see the Word.
        Nor did he see them in their proper natures, since all of them did not
        yet exist in their proper natures. Nor did he see them in his own
        intelligence, for it is not contrary to the perfection of the first
        state for a higher power to receive something from a lower power, as
        imagination from sense. Hence, it was appropriate for the human soul to
        have the intellect receive from sense. Consequently, since he did not
        perceive all creatures through sense, it was impossible for all things
        to be in his intelligence. Therefore, he did not in any way have
        knowledge of all creatures.

        11. Adam was created in a state in which he could with equal reason
        progress in understanding as well as in affection. But he who has
        knowledge of all things cannot make progress in that knowledge.
        Therefore, he did not have knowledge of all things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Augustine seems to say that Adam was placed in paradise to work, not
        from necessity but for the pleasure of tilling the soil. This comes from
        the fact that “human reason in a certain sense converses with physical
        reality, with the seeds which have been sown, with the shoots which have
        been planted, as if it asked them what the power of the root and the
        seed was, what it could do or could not do.” But to ask nature about the
        power of nature is nothing else but to learn the powers of nature from
        seeing the activities of nature. Therefore, Adam had to receive
        knowledge of things from things. Thus, he did not have knowledge of all
        creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. In the state of innocence Adam was not more perfect than the
        beatified angels. But they do not know everything. For this reason,
        Dionysius says that the lower angels are purified from ignorance by the
        higher angels. Therefore, neither did man in the state of innocence know
        all things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. As Augustine says, the demons can know the secrets of hearts only in
        so far as thtse become known from movements of the body. Therefore,,
        since the angelic understanding has clearer sight than the human
        understanding, it seems that even Adam in the state of innocence could
        not know the secrets of hearts. Thus, he did not have knowledge of all
        creatures.

        1. Augustine says” that in that state “nothing was missing which a good
        will could acquire.” But with a good will he could want to have

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Adam was an image [of God] more in his soul than in his body. But,
        when first created, Adam was perfect in body as regards age, stature,
        and all his members. Therefore, he was perfect also in soul as regards
        all knowledge.

        3. The perfection of nature when it was created is greater than the
        perfection of fallen nature. But knowledge of the future pertains to the
        state of fallen nature. Hence, after the fall some saints were raised to
        the perfection of knowing the future through the gift of prophecy.
        Therefore, with much greater reason Adam had knowledge of the future,
        and much more of the present.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Adam had a twofold knowledge: one natural and one due to grace. Natural
        human knowledge can extend to those things which we can know under the
        guidance of natural reason. And there is a beginning and a term of this
        natural knowledge. It has its beginning in a kind of confused knowledge
        of all things, in so far as man naturally has within him a knowledge of
        the general principles in which, as in seeds, there virtually pre-exist
        all the objects of knowledge which can be known by natural reason. This
        knowledge reaches its term when the things which are virtually in the
        principles are expressed in act, as animal generation is said to reach
        its term when the animal, with all its members perfect and distinct, is
        developed from the seed of the animal in which all its members
        pre-existed virtually.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Adam, however, when first created, had to have natural knowledge not
        only in its first stage but also in its term, because he was created as
        the father of the whole human race. For the sons should receive from
        their father not only existence through generation, but also instruction
        through teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One is not a principle in so far as he is in potency, but in so far as
        he is in act, and, for this reason, act is naturally prior to potency,
        and the activity of nature always begins from things which are perfect.
        Because of this, the first man had to be set at the term of perfection
        as soon as he was created, and this both in body, so that he would be a
        suitable principle of generation of the whole human race, and in mind,
        so that he would be an adequate principle of instruction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And, just as nothing in his body which pertained to bodily perfection
        was not actually developed, so, too, whatever there was seminally or
        virtually in the first principles of reason was developed in its
        entirety, in so far as the perfect knowledge of all those things to
        which the power of the first principles could extend was concerned,
        Consequently, we must say that whatever knowledge of things any man
        could ever acquire by his natural talents Adam had in its entirety by
        habitual natural knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There also are many things in creatures which cannot be known by natural
        knowledge, that is, those to which the power of first principles does
        not extend, such as future contingents, the secret thoughts of men, and
        the dispositions of creatures in so far as they are subject to divine
        providence. For he could not have a comprehensive grasp of divine
        providence, and so no comprehensive grasp of the order of creatures
        themselves in so far as they are subject to divine providence. For
        providence sometimes ordains creatures to many things beyond their
        natural capacity. But he was helped to know these things to some extent
        by the other knowledge, which is knowledge due to grace, through which
        God spoke internally to him, as Augustine says. But the first man was
        not given this knowledge as though he were placed at the term of its
        perfection, since one reaches the term of this freely conferred
        knowledge only in the vision of glory, to which he had not yet arrived.
        Therefore, he did not know all of these things, but only as much of them
        as God revealed to him. Accordingly, we have to answer both sets of
        difficulties.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. There are some futures which can be known naturally in their causes.
        Adam had knowledge of these. But he did not know all the others which
        cannot be known naturally, but only those which were revealed to him by
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Adam should’have had in its perfection everything which human nature
        requires. But, just as the power of growth is given to man so that he
        may reach perfect stature, so the senses are given to the human soul to
        attain the perfection of knowledge. Accordingly, just as Adam did not
        have the power of growth, in order through it to grow larger, but in
        order that he might lack nothing of what is needed for the perfection of
        his nature, so, too, he did not have senses to acquire knowledge through
        them, but to have a perfect human nature, and so that through the senses
        he might experience again what he knew habitually.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Adam, in so far as he was made the source of all human nature, had
        something more than is commonly due to all men. For, in so far as he was
        the teacher of the whole human race, it was incumbent on him not to have
        confused, but distinct, knowledge, so that with it he could teach. And
        for this reason it was also necessary that, when he was first created,
        his understanding should not be like a tablet on which nothing is
        written, but should have the fullness of knowledge by reason of God’s
        action. Nor was this necessary for other men, who were not made the
        source of the human race.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4.-6. The solution to the fourth, fifth, and sixth difficulties is clear
        from the third response.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The angels were created with full knowledge of physical reality
        because it is due to their nature, but this is not so with man, who
        obtained this knowledge by reason of God’s action. Therefore, human
        nature still remains lower than the angelic nature. Similarly, man’s
        body is naturally more imperfect than a heavenly body, even though, by
        the power of God, Adam’s body had its full stature when it was created.
        This belongs to heavenly bodies as due to their nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Adam’s understanding could not actually be many intelligible things,
        as actually informed by them; however, it could simultaneously be
        habitually informed by many intelligible things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. That argument is valid when the power is perfected completely by one
        perfection, as a substantial form perfects matter and color perfects the
        potency of a surface. But one habit of knowledge does not fully perfect
        the power of understanding with reference to all intelligible things.
        Therefore the case is not the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Adam had knowledge of all natures, not in the Word, but in their
        proper nature and in his intelligence. This twofold manner of knowing is
        not distinguished according to the species of things in so far as
        something is known by these species, but in so far as they are what is
        known. For, even when the understanding knows things in their proper
        nature, it knows them only through species which are present to it.
        Accordingly, when through species which are present to it the
        understanding is directed to things which are outside the soul, then it
        is said to know things in their proper nature. But, when the
        understanding stops at the species themselves, studying their nature and
        arrangement, then is it said to know things in its intelligence, as, for
        instance, when it understands that it understands and how it
        understands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, to say that all things did not yet exist in their proper
        nature, and so could not be known in their proper nature, does not
        follow. For to know a thing in its proper nature is used in two senses.
        In one, it is used by way of a statement, namely, when the thing itself
        is known to be in its own proper nature. And this can be done only when
        the thing exists in its proper nature. Adam did not know all things in
        their proper nature in this way, for all things did not yet exist in
        their proper nature, unless we were to say that they were not in their
        proper nature perfectly, but imperfectly. For all things which were
        produced later in the works of the six days [of creation] did pre-exist
        in some way, as is clear from Augustine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the other way, one is said to know a thing in its proper nature by
        way of a definition, that is to say, when one knows what the proper
        nature of a thing is. In this way, even things which do not exist can be
        known in their proper nature. Thus, I would be able to know what a lion
        is even if all lions were dead. In this way, Adam could know in their
        proper nature even things which did not then exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, there is nothing to prevent all creatures from being in his
        intelligence through their likenesses, although he did not perceive them
        all by his senses. For, although it is not contrary to the dignity of
        the first state for a higher power to receive something from a lower, to
        be created without the fullness of knowledge and to have to receive
        knowledge only from sense were contrary to the perfection which belonged
        to the first man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Adam could make progress in knowledge in two ways. One of these
        related to things which he did not know, that is, those to which natural
        reason could not reach. In these he could make progress partly by reason
        of divine revelation, as in knowledge of divine mysteries, and partly
        from sense experience, as in knowledge of futures, which, though
        previously unknown to him, would become known when they came to pass.
        The other way related to that which he knew, and thus he could later
        know also through sense experience that which he knew only through
        intellectual knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Those words of Augustine are not to be taken as though he meant that
        Adam had to, know the power of nature from the works of nature, but that
        he knew by experience that the nature, which he knew interiorly with his
        mind, acted according to that which pre-existed in his knowledge. And
        this he found delightful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The angels are purified from ignorance, not of natural things, but
        of divine mysteries. This ignorance existed in Adam, too, as has been
        said.And for this he himself needed an angelic illumination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The secret thoughts of men are among those things to which natural
        reason cannot extend its knowledge. Hence, our judgment about these is
        the same as that about the knowledge of future contingents.

        1. With a good will Adam was able to will only what he willed according
        to right order, that is, to seek to have what he wanted at its proper
        time, and not to want what did not befit him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Adam had natural perfection in his body, but not the supernatural
        perfection which is the perfection of glory. Consequently, it does not
        follow that he had in his soul any other than the perfection of natural
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Foreknowledge of futures is indeed a perfection of human nature,
        because it does have this perfection even after the fall; it is not a
        perfection, however, in such a way that it is natural to man. Hence,
        there was no need for Adam to have such a perfection. For it belongs to
        Christ alone to be given everything which the other saints had through
        grace, because He is the source of grace for us, as Adam is the source
        of nature. It was for this reason that the perfection of natural
        knowledge was due to Adam.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It was by reason of the state of innocence that Adam had all the
        virtues, for, if any were lacking in him, he would not have had original
        justice. But the state of innocence does not require the possession of
        all knowledge. Hence, the case is not the same.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We read that Adam gave names to the animals and knew their natures
        fully, and, consequently, knew the natures of all other natural things.
        But it does not follow from this that he knew things which surpass
        natural knowledge.

        1. Gregory says: “In paradise man was accustomed to enjoy the words of
        God and to share in purity of heart and loftiness of vision with the
        spirits of the beatified angels.” Therefore, through the loftiness of
        his vision he seems to have attained even to the vision of the angels.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. On the words of Genesis (2:2 1), “Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep
        upon Adam,” the Gloss reads: “The correct interpretation of this ecstasy
        is that it was given so that Adam’s mind, sharing the company of the
        heavenly court, might enter into the sanctuary of God and understand the
        last things.”But he could not share the company of the heavenly court
        unless he knew the angels. Therefore, he had knowledge of the angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The Master says: “Man had a knowledge of the things which were made
        for his sake.” But, along with other creatures, even the angels are made
        in some way for man’s sake, as the Master says. Therefore, he had
        knowledge of the angels.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It is more difficult to make something which is intelligible in
        potency become intelligible actually and to understand it than to
        understand that which is of itself actually intelligible. But Adam’s
        understanding could make species of material things, which of themselves
        are intelligible in potency, become actually intelligible, and in this
        way understand material things. Therefore, with much more reason he was
        able to understand the essences of the angels, which of themselves are
        actually intelligible, since they are free of matter.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That someone does not better understand things which are of
        themselves more intelligible is due to a defect of his understanding.
        But the essences of the angels are of themselves more intelligible than
        the essences of material things, and there was no defect in Adam’s
        understanding. Accordingly, since he knew material things through their
        essence, with much more reason he could know the angels through their
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The intellect can understand material things by abstracting the
        quiddity from the material supposite. And, if that quiddity is again a
        supposite having a quiddity, it can with equal reason abstract the
        quiddity from it. And, since this cannot go on to infinity, it will at
        last arrive at the understanding of some simple quiddity, which does not
        have [another] quiddity. But such a quiddity is the quiddity of a
        separate substance, that is to say, of an angel. Therefore, Adam’s
        intellect could know the essence of an angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. According to the Philosopher, since understanding is a power not
        joined to an organ, it is not destroyed by an excessively intelligible
        object. “For, after it has understood the highest intelligible, it does
        not understand the lowest intelligibles; less, but more,” contrary to
        what takes place in sense. But Adam’s understanding in the state of
        innocence was whole and complete. Therefore, the excellence of an
        intelligible object was not an impediment to his understanding of it.
        Consequently, he was able to know the angels through their essence,
        since the only impediment to this knowledge seems to be the excellence
        of the intelligible object.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. As was mentioned above, Adam, as soon as he was created, had all the
        knowledge to which a man can come naturally. But man can naturally come
        to a knowledge of the separated substances through their essence, as is
        clear from the statements of many philosophers, which the Commentator
        mentions. Therefore, Adam knew the angels through their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. It is evident that Adam knew his own soul through its essence. But
        the essence of the soul is free from matter, just as an angel’s essence.
        Therefore, he could also know the angels through their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Adam’s knowledge was intermediate between our knowledge and that of
        the blessed. But the blessed see and know the essence of God, and we
        know the essence of material things. But between God and material things
        are spiritual substances, that is, the angels. Therefore, Adam knew the
        angels through their essence.

        1. In its knowledge no power can reach beyond its object. But the
        objects of the intellective soul are phantasms, to which the
        intellective soul is related, as sense is to sensibles, as is said in
        <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, our soul can attain to knowledge only of
        those things which it can derive from phantasms. But the essence of the
        angels is beyond all phantasms. Therefore, by natural knowledge, the
        perfection of which we assign to Adam, man cannot reach a knowledge of
        the angels through their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that, although an angel cannot be perceived through
        phantasms, some effect of an angel can be grasped under the guise of a
        phantasm, and from such an effect the angel can be known.—On the
        contrary, no effect which is not equal to its cause is sufficient of
        itself to be a means to knowledge of the essence of its cause.
        Otherwise, those who know God from creatures would see the essence of
        God, which is false. But a physical effect, which alone can be grasped
        in a phantasm, is the kind of effect which is not equal to the power of
        the angels. Therefore, through this kind of effect one cannot know what
        an angel is, but only whether he exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was said that Adam was able to know the angels through some
        intelligible effect, according to the dictum of Avicenna that the
        presence of intelligences in us is nothing other than the presence of
        their imprints in us.—On the contrary, what is received in a thing is
        received there according to the mode of being of that in which it is
        received. flut the mode of being of the human soul is lower than that of
        the allgelic nature. Therefore, the imprint made on the human soul by an
        angel, or by the angelic light, with which it enlightens the mind, is in
        the human soul in a lower manner than in the angelic nature.
        Accordingly, since the soul knows a thing through the mode in which the
        thing known is within it, through this kind of imprint the soul does not
        reach knowledge of an angel as it is in its essence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is a twofold knowledge by which something can be known. One is
        that by which we know whether a thing exists, and according to this in
        the state of innocence Adam knew the angels both by natural knowledge
        and divine revelation far more fully and familiarly than we know them.
        The other is that by which we know what a thing is, and this is to know
        it through its essence. And, as I see it, Adam in the state of innocence
        did not know the angels in this way. The reason for this is that a
        twofold knowledge is ascribed to Adam: natural knowledge and knowledge
        due to grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That he did not know angels through their essence with natural knowledge
        can be seen with certainty from this. In no genus does a natural passive
        power extend farther than that to which the active power of the same
        genus extends, just as in nature there is a passive power only with
        reference to those things to which some natural active power can extend,
        as the Commentator says. In the understanding of the human soul,
        however, there is a twofold power: one passive, the possible intellect,
        and the other active, the agent intellect. Consequently, the possible
        intellect is naturally in potency to have produced in it only those
        things which the agent intellect is naturally constituted to pfoduce.
        However, this does not exclude the possibility of other things being
        produced in it by divine activity, as they are produced in physical
        nature through miraculous activity. But the action of the agent
        intellect does not make intelligible those things which are of
        themselves intelligible, such as the essences of the angels, but things
        which of themselves are potentially intelligible, such as the essence of
        material things, which are received through sense and imagination.
        Hence, in the possible intellect there are naturally produced only those
        intelligible species which are abstracted from phantasms. However, it is
        impossible to reach vision of the essence of separated substances
        through this type of species, since they have no proportion to separated
        substances and belong, as it were, to a different genus from spiritual
        essences. Therefore, by natural knowledge man cannot attain to knowledge
        of the angels through their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, Adam was not capable of this even through the knowledge due
        to grace. For knowledge due to grace is higher than knowledge due to
        nature, but this elevation can be taken with reference either to the
        intelligible object or to the manner of understanding. With reference to
        the intelligible object, man’s knowledge is indeed raised through grace
        even without a change of state, as when we are raised to a knowledge of
        things which are above reason through the grace of faith, and similarly
        through the grace of prophecy. But, in so far as its manner of knowing
        is concerned, human knowledge is not elevated without a change of man’s
        state. But the manner in which his understanding knows naturally is by
        receiving from phantasms, as has been said. Consequently, unless there
        is a change in man’s state, his understanding, even in the knowledge due
        to grace, which is through divine revelation, must always recur to
        phantasms. This is what Dionysius says: “It is impossible for the divine
        radiance to shine on us in any other way, except as shrouded in a
        variety of sacred veils.” But in the state of innocence Adam was in the
        state of a wayfarer. Hence, in all knowledge due to grace he had to look
        to phantasms. The essences of angels, however, cannot be seen with that
        mode of knowledge, as has been said. 13 Thus, Adam did not know the
        angels through their essence either through natural knowledge or through
        knowledge due to grace, unless, perhaps, we say that he was elevated to
        a higher state through grace, as Paul was in his rapture.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. All we can conclude from the authoritative citation from Gregory is
        that Adam knew the angels in some lofty vision, not, however, so lofty
        that it reached a knowledge of their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If we understand that Adam’s sleep was of the same nature as Paul’s
        rapture, there would be nothing to prevent us from saying that he saw
        the angels through their essence in that rapture. But this was above the
        common mode of knowing which then belonged to him. However, if we
        understand that his sleep was not of such a nature that in it Adam in
        some respect was elevated to the state of the blessed, but was like that
        in which it is customary for the minds of the prophets to be raised to
        vision of the divine mysteries, as the words of the Gloss seem to
        intend, then he is said to have shared the company of the heavenly court
        through a certain pre-eminence of knowledge, which still did not reach
        their essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Adam had knowledge of the angels in so far as they were made for his
        sake. For he knew that they would be companions of his beatitude and
        helpers for his salvation in this life, in so far as he knew the
        distinction of [angelic] orders and their duties much better than we
        know them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Difficulty in understanding arises in two ways. In one, the
        difficulty comes from the thing known; in the other, from the one
        knowing. On the part of the thing known, it is more difficult to make
        something intelligible and understand it than to understand that which
        of itself is intelligible. But, on the part of the one knowing, it can
        be more difficult to know that which is itself intelligible. And this is
        the case with the human understanding, since naturally to understand
        separated essences is out of proportion with its power, for the reason
        we have given.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Adam’s understanding did not suffer from the lack of any perfection
        which should have been in it at that time. However, it did have some
        natural deficiencies, among which one was that in knowing it had to look
        to phantasms. But this is a natural condition of human understanding by
        reason of its union with the body, and by reason of the fact that by its
        nature it is the lowest in the order of intellects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. By abstraction, understanding can reach a quiddity of a natural thing
        which does not have another quiddity, and which it can understand
        because it abstracts it from phantasms and makes it intelligible through
        the light of the agent intellect. From this it receives the possibility
        of being perfected by the quiddity as by a proper perfection. But it
        cannot rise from this quiddity to a knowledge of the essence of a
        separated substance, because the former quiddity is completely incapable
        of representing the latter, since quiddity does not exist in separated
        subsOnces and in material things in entirely the same manner, but, as it
        were, equivocally, as the Commentator says. And, granted that through
        this quiddity he could know in some general way that the quiddity of
        separated substance is of such a nature, he nevertheless would not see
        the essence of an angel in such a way that he could know the difference
        between any one separated essence and the others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although human understanding is not destroyed by an excessively
        intelligible object, it lacks the proportion needed to be able naturally
        to reach the highest intelligibles. Hence, we cannot conclude from what
        the Philosopher says that it understands the highest intelligibles; but
        only that, if it did understand them, it would not understand others
        less.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The Philosopher leaves this question unsolved when he inquires
        whether an intellect joined [to a body] can understand separated
        substances. Nor does he solve the question anywhere else in the works
        which have come down to us. And his followers have disagreed on this
        point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For some have said that our intellect cannot achieve an understanding of
        separated essences. Some, however, have held that it can. Some of these
        men have given insufficient reasons, as Avempace, who gave the argument
        about quiddity, and Themistius, who gave the argument about ease of
        understanding. Both of these arguments, the Commentator answered. Some,
        however, as Alexander and the Commentator himself, have taken
        non-Aristotelian positions, which are against the faith. For Alexander
        says that, since the possible intellect can be produced by generation
        and can perish, it can in his theory in no wise reach an understanding
        of the separated substances. But, at the term of its perfection, it does
        reach the point where the agent intellect, which Alexander makes one of
        the separated substances, is united to us as form. In that state we
        understand through the agent intellect, just as now we understand
        through the possible intellect. And it is because the agent intellect,
        as a separated substance, understands separated substances that we
        understand separated substances in that state. In his opinion it is in
        this that the final happiness of man will consist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, since it does not seem possible for something which is
        incorruptible and separated, as the agent intellect, to be united as the
        form for the possible intellect, which, for Alexander, is corruptible
        and material, it has seemed to others that the possible intellect itself
        is separated and incorruptible. Hence, Themistius says that the possible
        intellect, too, is separated, and that it is natural to it to understand
        not only material things but also separated substances. He adds that its
        intelligible objects are not temporal, but eternal, things, and that the
        speculative intellect, by which we understand, is made up of the agent
        and the possible intellects. But, if this is so, we can know separated
        substances from the beginning, since the possible intellect is united to
        us from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the Commentator takes a third way, between the opinion of
        Alexander and that of Themistius. For he says that the possible
        intellect is separated and eternal, in which he agrees with Themistius
        and differs from Alexander, and, nevertheless, that the objects of the
        speculative understanding are temporal things and produced through the
        activity of the agent intellect. In this he agrees with Alexander and
        differs from Themistius. He says that these objects have a double
        existence: one, by which they are based on phantasms, and in this sense
        they are in us; the other, by which they are in the possible intellect.
        Consequently, through the mediation of these intelligible objects the
        possible intellect is united to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, the agent intellect is related to these intelligible things as form
        to matter. For, since the possible intellect receives intelligibles of
        this type which are grounded in phantasms, and also receives the agent
        intellect, and since the agent intellect is more perfect, the proportion
        of the agent intellect to’intelligibles of this sort, which are in us,
        must be like the proportion of form to matter. This is like the
        reciprocal proportion between light and color which are received in the
        transparent, as also between all things, one of which is more perfect
        than the other, which are received in one thing. Therefore, when the
        production of such intelligibles takes place in us, then the agent
        intellect is united to us perfectly as a form. And in this way we will
        be able to know separated substances through the agent intellect, just
        as we are now able to know through the understanding which is in its
        habitual state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is evident from the statements of these philosophers that they could
        find no way for us to understand separated substances except by
        understanding through some separated substance. But it is not in harmony
        with the truths of the faith to say that the possible or the agent
        intellect is a separated substance. Neither does it agree with the
        opinion of the Philosopher, who holds that agent and possible intellects
        are part of the human soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, if we retain that position, it does not seem possible for
        man by his natural knowledge to achieve a knowledge of separated

        9. In the state of Innocence man knew his act of understanding perfectly
        because he understood some intelligible object perfectly. And, since the
        act of understanding is an effect proportionate to, and commensurate
        with, the power from which it proceeds, it follows that he understood
        the essence of his soul perfectly. But it does not follow from this that
        he understood the essence of the angels, since that act of understanding
        is not commensurate with the power of his understanding.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. As the angelic nature is intermediate between the divine and
        physical nature, so the knowledge by which an angelic essence is known
        is intermediate between the knowledge by which the divine essence is
        known and by which the essences of material things are known. But there
        can be many things intermediate between two extremes. And it is not
        necessary for anyone who exceeds one extreme to reach every intermediate
        level, but to reach some intermediate level. Accordingly, in the state
        of innocence man reached one intermediate level, namelythat of receiving
        knowledge of God not from sensible creatures but from internal
        revelation. However, he did not arrive at the level of knowing angelic
        essences. Nevertheless, when the angels were created and not yet
        beatified, they had arrived at this level.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Ambrose says, error is the source of every sin. But Adam could
        sin. Therefore, he could be mistaken.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The will concerns only that which is good or regarded as good. But,
        when the will deals with what is good, there is no sin. Therefore, there
        is never sin unless there is an antecedent evaluation in which something
        is regarded as good, but is not. But in every such evaluation there is
        deception of some sort. Therefore, before he sinned, Adam in the state
        of innocence was deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The Master says: “The woman was not frightened by the fact that the
        serpent talked because, since she knew it, was created, she considered
        that it had received even the power of speech from God.” But this was
        false. Therefore, the woman judged falsely before she sinned. Hence, she
        was deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the Master, and as Augustine also says: “The devil was
        allowed to come in that form in order that his malice could be easily
        detected.” But, if in the state of innocence man could not have been
        deceived, the devil could have been detected in any form in which he
        came. Therefore, man could be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When the woman heard what the serpent promised, she hoped to be able
        to obtain it; otherwise, her desire would have been stupid. I foxvever,
        there was no stupidity before the fall. But no one hopes for what he
        considers impossible. Therefore, since what the devil promised was
        impossible, it seems that in believing this the woman was deceived
        before the fall.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In the state of innocence man’s understanding argued to conclusions
        and needed deliberation. But it needed deliberation only to avoid error.
        Therefore, in the state of innocence it could err.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The understanding of demons, since it is not united to a body, seems
        to be much more discerning than the understanding of man in the state of
        innocence, which was joined to a body. But a demon can be deceived.
        Consequently, the saints say that, when the demons saw Christ suffering
        infirmities, they thought He was simply man, but, when they saw him
        working miracles, they thought He was God. Therefore, man in the state
        of innocence with much greater reason can be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. While man was committing the first sin, in that act itself he was not
        in the state of guilt. For, since the state of guilt is caused by sin,
        there would have been another sin before the first sin. But in the act
        by which man first sinned he was deceived. Therefore, he could be
        deceived before the state of guilt.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Damascene says: “This,” that is, fallacious knowledge, “existed in
        Adam when he was first created.” But whoever has fallacious knowledge is
        deceived. Therefore, Adam was deceived when he was first created.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Speculative knowledge is distinguished from the affections. But
        there can be sin in the affective part without deception in the
        speculative part. For, many times we have knowledge and act contrary to
        it. Therefore, in the first man, too, there could have been deception in
        the speculative part before there was sin in the affective part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. As the Gloss on the first Epistle to Timothy (2:14), “Adam was not
        seduced... “ reads: “Adam was not led astray in the way the woman was,
        that is, so that he thought that what the devil suggested was true.
        Still we can believe that he was led astray in this, that he thought
        that the sin committed was venial when it was mortal.” Therefore, before
        the fall Adam could be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. No one is freed from deception except through knowledge of the
        truth. But Adam did not know all things. Therefore, he could not have
        been free from deception in all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13 It was said that through divine providence he was saved from
        deception.—On the contrary, divine providence brings assistance
        especially in necessary matters. But in his greatest need, when it would
        have been most useful for him to be freed from being led astray, divine
        providence did not protect him from being misled. Therefore, with much
        less reason would divine providence have freed him from being led astray
        in other matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. In the state of innocence man would have slept, and likewise would
        have dreamed, as Boethius says. But every man is deceived in dreams,
        since to some extent he considers the likenesses of things as if they
        were the things themselves. Therefore, in the state of innocence Adam
        could be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Adam would have used his bodily senses. But there is frequent
        deception in sense knowledge, as when one thing seems to be two, and
        when something which is seen from a distance seems small. Therefore, in
        the state of innocence Adam would not have been altogether free from
        deception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says: “To accept as true things that are false is not
        natural for man as he was created, but a punishment for the condemned.”“
        Therefore, in the state of innocence he could not be deceived, which is
        to accept as true things which are false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The soul is more noble than the body. But in the state of innocence
        man could suffer no bodily defect. Therefore, much less could he suffer
        deception, which is a defect of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the state of innocence there could be nothing contrary to man’s
        will, since pain thus would have been able to exist in him. But in man,
        to be deceived is contrary to his will, according to Augustine, even in
        those who want to deceive. Therefore, in the state of innocence man
        could not be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Every error is due either to guilt or to punishment, neither of which
        could exist in the state of innocence. Therefore, error could not exist
        there either.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When that which is higher in the soul directs what is lower, there
        cannot be any error, because the whole of man’s knowledge is corrected
        by that which is higher in the soul, that is to say, by synderesis and
        the understanding of principles. But in the state of innocence that
        which is lower in man was subject to higher reason. Therefore, there
        could not then be deception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. According to Augustine: “The capacity to believe is in man’s nature,
        but actual belief is a gift of grace to the faithful.” Therefore, by the
        same token, the capacity to be deceived is due to nature, but to be
        deceived is a defect. But in the state of innocence there were no
        defects. Therefore, neither could there be deception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Damascene says that in the state of innocence man “delighted in the
        sweetest fruit of contemplation, being nourished by this [contemplation
        <i>1.”“</i> But, when man is turned toward the things of God, he is not
        deceived. Therefore, in that state Adam could not be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Jerome says: “Whatever evil we suffer, our sins have merited.” But
        deception is evil. Therefore, it could not exist before sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are two opinions on this question. For some” say that, since Adam
        did not have full knowledge of everything, but knew some things and was
        ignorant of others, in the things which he knew he could not be
        deceived, that is, in those which he knew naturally and those which were
        divinely revealed to him. But in other things, which he did not know,
        such as men’s secret thoughts, future contingents, and individual things
        absent from his senses, he could indeed judge falsely, if without
        serious consideration he formed some false opinion about these things,
        not, however, in such a way that he gave unqualified assent.
        Accordingly, they say that error could have no place in him, nor could
        he accept something false as true, because in these things there is
        question of unqualified assent to that which is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But others attempt to reject this declaration because Augustine calls
        every false judgment error and also says that every error is evil, great
        in important matters, and small in small matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But we should not insist too much on this, because we should pass over
        the question of names when we are treating of things. Hence, I say that
        in the state of innocence there could be not only no error but not even
        false opinion of any sort. This is evident from the following.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Although in the state of innocence some good could be absent, in no
        sense could there be any corruption of a good. However, the good of our
        understanding is the knowledge of truth. Accordingly, those habits by
        which the understanding is perfected for knowledge of the truth are
        called virtues, as is said in the <i>Ethics</i>, because they make the
        act of the understanding good. Falsity, on the other hand, is not only
        lack of truth but also a corruption of it. For one who has no knowledge
        of truth at all, who lacks the truth, yet has no contrary opinion, does
        not have the same relation to truth as one who holds some false opinion
        and whose judgment is vitiated by falsity. Consequently, just as truth
        is the good of the understanding, so that which is false is its evil.
        For this reason, the habit of opinion is not an intellectual virtue,
        since by it one says what is false, as we see in the <i>Ethics</i>. But
        no act of virtue can be evil, as if the false opinion itself would be an
        evil act of [the virtue of ] understanding. Consequently, since in the
        state of innocence there was not any corruption or any evil, there could
        not be any false opinion in that state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Commentator also says that a false opinion has the same place in
        matters of knowledge as a monstrosity has in physical nature. For a
        false opinion is one which originates without being intended by first
        principles, which are the seminal powers, as it were, of knowledge, just
        as monstrosities originate without being intended by the natural power
        which is at work. This is because all evil is “unintended,” as Dionysius
        says. Hence, just as in the state of innocence there would be no
        monstrosities in the conception of the human body, so in understanding
        there could be no falsity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This is likewise clear from the fact that disorder always arises when a
        thing is moved by something which is not its proper mover, as would
        happen if the will should be moved by what gives pleasure to sense,
        since it should be moved only by what is noble. The proper mover of the
        understanding, however, is that which contains infallible truth.
        Consequently, whenever the understanding is moved by some fallible sign,
        there is some disorder in it, whether the movement is complete or
        incomplete. As a result, since in the state of innocence there could be
        no disorder in man’s understanding, it would never have been inclined
        more to one part than to the other except by an infallible motive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is clear that not only was there no false opinion in man’s
        understanding, there was no opinion there at all. And whatever he knew,
        he knew with certainty.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That error from which all sin proceeds is an error of choice, in so
        far as one chooses what should not be chosen. According to this, the
        Philosopher says20 that everyone who is evil lacks knowledge. But this
        error presupposes disorder in the appetitive part. For it is due to the
        fact that sensible appetite is drawn toward that which delights it and
        the higher appetite does not resist it, that reason is hindered from
        choosing that which it has habitually. Consequently, it is evident that
        this error does not entirely precede sin, but follows it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That which is perceived as an apparent good cannot lack all goodness
        whatsoever. Rather, it is good to some extent, and in this respect it is
        perceived as good from the beginning. This is the case Mien some
        forbidden food is perceived as agreeable to see and pleasAnt to taste,
        and when the sensible appetite is attracted to such a good as to its
        proper object. But when the higher appetite follows the lower, it
        follows that which is good in some respect, as though it were good for
        it without qualification. Therefore, error of choice follows afterward
        from disorder of appetite, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If we understand that the woman believed that the serpent had
        received the use of speech as part of its nature, this argument seems to
        be contrary to both opinions. For those who believe that in the state of
        innocence man could be deceived do not at all believe that he could be
        deceived when judging about the natures of things, since he had full
        knowledge of natural things. However, it is contrary to the serpent’s
        nature to have the use of speech naturally, since this belongs only to
        rational animals. Therefore, we have to say that the woman did not
        believe that the serpent had the use of speech by its nature, but by
        reason of some power acting inside it in a hidden way. She did not
        consider whether it was from God or from the demon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. That reason why he appeared in the form of a serpent should not be
        taken to mean that he could not be detected under whatever form he
        appeared, but that he could be more easily detected under such a form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The woman hoped that in some way she would be able to get what the
        serpent promised, and she believed that this was in some way possible.
        In this she was led astray, as the Apostle says (1 Tim. 2:14). But a
        certain elation of mind preceded that leading astray, and because of it
        she inordinately desired her own excellence, which she realized as soon
        as the serpent spoke, as men frequently are lifted above themselves when
        they hear words of flatterers. And this exaltation which preceded
        concerned her own proper excellence in general and is the first sin.
        There followed this the seduction by which she believed that what the
        serpent was saying was true. Thus, there resulted the exaltation with
        which she definitely desired this excellence which the serpent promised.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In the state of innocence man’s understanding needed deliberation in
        order not to fall into error, just as he needed to eat in order that his
        body might not waste away. However, he was so gifted with correct
        deliberation that by deliberating he would be able to avoid every error,
        just as by eating he could avoid every bodily infirmity. Therefore, just
        as he would commit a sin of omission if he did not eat, so,, if he did
        not deliberate when the occasion was given, error and sin would follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. It was by his natural power that man in the state of innocence was
        protected from internal bodily suffering, as that of fever and the like,
        but it was not by any internal power that he was protected from external
        suffering, as blows or wounds, since he did not have the gift of
        impassibility. This was due rather to divine providence, which preserved
        him from all injury. Similarly, it was by the strength of his own reason
        that he was protected from the deception which comes from within, as
        when someone independently reasons incorrectly, but it was by the divine
        aid, which he had at that time for all necessary matters, that he was
        protected from deception from without. The demons, however, do not have
        this; hence, they can be deceived.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Instantaneous actions have their effect as soon as they begin, just
        as the eye sees in the same instant that the air is illuminated. Hence,
        since the movement of will, in which sin primarily consists, is
        instantaneous, one loses the state of innocence in the same instant in
        which he sins. Thus, he could be deceived in that instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Damascene is speaking of the fallacy of the first man by which he was
        deceived in the sin itself. And, indeed, he committed this sin shortly
        after he was created, for he did not long persevere in the state
        ofinnocence.
      </p>

        10. Since the soul of man in the state of innocence was united to the
        highest good, there could be no defect in man as long as this union
        lasted. But this union was brought about principally through the
        affections. Consequently, no deception could exist in the understanding
        nor any defect in the body before the affective part was corrupted,
        although, conversely, there could be defect in the affections without a
        pre-existing defect in speculative understanding, since the union with
        God is not completed in the understanding but in the affections.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. In Adam the elation of spirit preceded the false opinion by which he
        believed that what was mortally sinful was only venially so, just as
        happened with the woman, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. In those things which he did not know he was able to be protected
        from deception partly from within, since his understanding would not be
        inclined to one part except for a sufficient motive, and partly, and
        more especially, by divine providence, which preserved him from
        deception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. In the state in which he sinned had he turned to God, he would have
        had divine help to keep him from being led astray. But, since he did not
        do this, he fell into sin and was led astray. Yet, his being led astray
        followed the sin, as is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Some say that in the state of innocence Adam did not dream. But this
        is not necessary, for the vision of dreams is not in the intellective,
        but in the sensitive, part. Hence, the deception would not have been in
        the understanding, which does not have free exercise in sleep, but in
        the sensitive part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. When sense represents what it receives, there is no falsity in
        sense, as Augustine says, but falsity is in the understanding, which
        judges that things exist in reality in the way in which sense portrays
        them. However, this never happened in Adam, since his understanding
        would either have refrained from judgment, as in dreams, or, when
        judging about sensible objects when awake, would have had a true
        judgment.

        It seems that they would, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. According to Anselm, Adam would have begotten sons such as he himself
        was. But Adam had full knowledge of all natural things, as has been
        said. Therefore, his sons, too, would have had that knowledge
        immediately at birth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As the affections are perfected by virtue, so the understanding is
        perfected by knowledge. But the sons born of Adam, in the state of
        innocence, would have had the fullness of all the virtues immediately at
        birth. For he would have passed original justice on to them, as Anselm
        says. Therefore, they would likewise have had all knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to Bede, weakness, concupiscence, ignorance, and malice
        result from sin. But there would have been no wickedness, weakness, or
        concupiscence in those children immediately at birth. Therefore, there
        would not have been any ignorance either; hence, they would have had all
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It would have been more fitting for them to be born perfect in soul
        than in body. But they would have been born without any bodily defect.
        Therefore, there would likewise have been no ignorance in their souls.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. According to Damascene, man in the state of innocence was “as another
        angel.” But, immediately upon their creation, the angels had knowledge
        of all natural things. Therefore, for the same reason, men in the state
        of innocence had it, also.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Adam’s soul and the souls of his sons had the same nature. But in its
        very beginning Adam’s soul was created full of all natural knowledge, as
        has been said. Therefore, the souls of his sons would have been created
        with the same fullness of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Greater perfection of knowledge belongs to man than to the other
        animals. But, immediately at birth, the other animals have natural
        [instinctive] judgment of what is helpful and what is harmful. Thus, a
        newborn lamb flees from the wolf and follows its mother. Therefore,
        children in the state of innocence with much greater reason would have
        had perfect knowledge.
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Hugh of St. Victor says that they would not have been born with
        perfect knowledge, but would have reached it in the course of time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2.. Since the soul is the perfection of the body, its development must
        be proportionate to that of the body. But in the state of innocence
        Adam’s children would not have had full bodily stature as Adam did when
        he was first created. Therefore, for the same reason they would not have
        had the fullness of knowledge as Adam had.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Sons receive existence, nature, and instruction from their father.
        But, if Adam’s sons had had full knowledge as soon as they were born,
        they would not have been able to receive instruction from him.
        Therefore, the full relationship of paternity would have not been
        preserved between them and the first parent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On this question there have been two opinions. For some have said that
        children in the state of innocence would have been perfect, just as
        Adam, with reference to everything belonging to the soul, that is, as
        regards both virtues and knowledge. They would not, however, have been
        perfect as regards the body. This was due to the exigencies of their
        mother’s womb, for they had to be born.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others, however, following Hugh, say that, just as they would not
        immediately have received perfect stature of body, but in time would
        have reached it, so, too, they would in time have reached perfect
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, in order to know which of these opinions contains more truth,
        we must remember that the same reasons do not hold for Adam and for his
        sons immediately upon birth. For, since Adam was ordained to be the
        source of the whole human race, as soon as he was created he had to have
        not only what belonged to the beginning of natural perfection but also
        that which belonged to its term. But his sons, who were not constituted
        the source of the human race, but as having existence from its source,
        did not have to be set at the term of natural perfection. It was enough
        for them to have at birth only as much as the initial state of natural
        perfection demands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, according to two opinions, the initial stage of the natural
        perfection of knowledge is placed at different levels. For some, as the
        Platonists, have held that the soul comes to the body filled with all
        the sciences, but it is clouded over by the body and thus its capacity
        for free use of the knowledge which it has is inhibited except with
        reference to some universals. But afterwards, through the exercise of
        study and of the senses, these obstacles are removed, so that it can use
        its knowledge freely. Thus, they say that learning is the same as
        remembering. But, if this opinion were true, we would have to say that
        in the state of innocence, as soon as children were born, they would
        have had knowledge of all things because the body in that state of
        innocence was altogether subject to the soul, and, so, the weight of the
        body would not have been able so to oppress the soul that it would lose
        its perfection in any way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this opinion seems to proceed from the position that the nature of
        the angels and of the soul is the same, so that the soul would have full
        knowledge as soon as it is created, just as an intelligence is said to
        be created full of forms. For this reason, the Platonists said that
        souls existed before being united to bodies and, after leaving bodies,
        return as intelligences to stars of rank equal to theirs. But this
        opinion is out of harmony with Catholic truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, others according to the opinion of Aristotle say that human
        understanding is last in the order of intelligible things, just as first
        matter is last in the order of sensible things. And as matter,
        considered in its essence, has no form, so the human understanding, in
        the beginning, is “like a tablet, on which nothing is written,” but,
        later, acquires knowledge through the senses by virtue of the agent
        intellect. Thus, the beginning of natural human knowledge is, indeed, to
        be in potency to all things knowable, but to know from the beginning
        only those things which are known immediately through the light of the
        agent intellect, that is to say, universal first principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, it was not necessary for Adam’s sons to have knowledge of all
        things immediately at birth, but they would have reached it as they
        advanced in age. Nevertheless, it is necessary to ascribe to them some
        perfect knowledge, namely, the knowledge of things which must be chosen
        or avoided, a knowledge which pertains to prudence. For, as is proved in
        the <i>Ethics,</i> without prudence the other virtues cannot exist. And
        Adam’s children must have had these virtues because of original justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To me this opinion seems to contain more truth, if we look to what was
        required by the integrity of nature. But, if by divine grace anything
        else had been given them beyond that which integrity of nature required,
        this could not be asserted, since there is no express authority for it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Adam would have begotten sons like himself in those things which were
        due to him by his specific nature. But it was not necessary for his sons
        to be born like him in those things which were due to him as the source
        of the whole human race.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. For the perfect union with God, which the state of innocence demands,
        all the virtues are needed, but not all the sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although the children would not have all knowledge as soon as they
        were born, they would not have had the ignorance which follows from sin,
        which is a lack of knowledge of things which ought to be known. For they
        would have been ignorant of those things which their state did not
        require them to know.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In the bodies of these children there would have been no defect by
        which they would be deprived of a good which then was their due.
        Nevertheless, their bodies did lack a good which would accrue to them
        later, such as fullness of stature and the gifts of glory. The same must
        be said of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Angels are on a higher level of nature than souls, although souls can
        be equal to them in the gifts of grace. Consequently, it is not
        necessary to concede to the soul as something natural that which is
        naturally due to angels. However, in the state of innocence, man is said
        to be as another angel because of the fullness of grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although the soul of Adam and the souls of his sons had the same
        nature, they did not have the same office. For Adam’s soul was made a
        source from which all teaching would come to posterity. Therefore, it
        had to be perfect immediately, which was not necessary for the souls of
        his children.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. At the beginning, brute animals receive natural [instinctive]
        judgment in order to know what is harmful and what is helpful, because
        they cannot reach this through their own investigation. Man, however,
        can reach this and many other things through the investigation of
        reason. He nce, it is not necessary for all knowledge to exist in him
        naturally. Nevertheless, the knowledge of practical matters, which
        pertains to prudence, is more natural to man than the knowledge of
        speculative matters. For this reason we find that some are naturally
        prudent but do not naturally possess learning, as is said in the
        <i>Ethics.</i> For this reason men do not forget prudence as easily as
        they forget science. Therefore, at that time the children would have
        been more perfect in the matters which pertain to prudence than in those
        which pertain to speculative science, as has been said.

        It seems that they would, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. If they were restricted in its use, this would have resulted only
        from some bodily defect. But in that state there was nothing in which
        the body resisted the soul. Therefore the use of reason could not be
        restricted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A virtue or power which does not use an organ is not restricted in
        its activity because of a defect of an organ. But the understanding is a
        power which does not use an organ as is said in
        <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, the act of the understanding could not then
        be impeded because of the defect of a bodily organ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If it be said that the act of understanding was restricted because of
        a defect of body in so far as the understanding received something from
        the senses, the answer is that the understanding is higher than any
        sense power. But it seems to be out of order for the higher to receive
        from the lower. Therefore, since there was nothing out of order in man’s
        nature in that state, it seems that it would not have been necessary for
        the understanding to receive from the senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The understanding needs the senses to acquire knowledge through them.
        But, once it has acquired knowledge, it does not need them, just as a
        man does not need a horse once he has finished his journey, as Avicenna
        says. But, according to one opinion, children in the state of innocence
        had the fullness of all knowledge. Therefore, they could not be kept
        from using the knowledge they had because of imperfection in the sense
        organs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Defect of bodily organs hinders sense more than understanding. But
        children do not suffer so great a bodily defect that they cannot see and
        hear. Therefore, neither is their understanding hindered because of
        bodily defect, but seemingly because of the punishment for the first
        sin. But this would not have existed before the fall. Therefore,
        children at that time would have had the full use of understanding as
        soon as they were born.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Man’s relation to the knowledge which he has naturally is the same as
        that which brute animals have to natural [instinctive] judgment. But
        brute animals can make use of this natural judgment immediately at
        birth. Therefore, in the state of innocence children were able to make
        use of natural knowledge, at least of first principles, immediately at
        birth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Wisdom (9:15) says: “For the corruptible body is a load upon the
        soul...” But in the state of innocence the body was not corruptible.
        Therefore, the soul was not weighed down by it, and so kept from having
        free use of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Every activity which is common to soul and body is hindered because
        of a defect of the body. But understanding is an activity common to soul
        and body, as is clear from <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, the use of reason
        could be hindered by a bodily defect or imperfection which t lie
        children suffered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to the Philosopher: “The soul in no way understands without
        a phantasm.” But the use of the imagination can be hindered by a defect
        of a bodily organ. Therefore, so can the use of understanding. We
        conclude as before.

        There are two opinions on this question. For some6 say that children in
        the state of innocence would have had the full use of all their bodily
        members and that the clumsiness which we now see in children, that they
        are not able to use their feet to walk, their hands to carve, and so on,
        comes entirely from the first sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others,.thinking that this type of clumsiness has its cause in natural
        principles, as moistness, which must abound in children, say that in the
        state of innocence the members of children would not have been
        altogether suitable for their acts, although they would not be so com
        pletely deficient as they now are, since now what is due to corruption
        has been added to that which is due to nature. And this opinion seems
        more probable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, since it is necessary that moistness, especially in the brain,
        abound in children, and it is the brain in which imagination, natural
        judgment, memory, and common sense have their organs, the acts of these
        powers must be particularly hindered, and, consequently, understanding,
        which receives something immediately from these powers, and turns to
        them whenever it is in act, must be hindered, too. Nevertheless, the use
        of understanding was not fettered in children to the extent that it is
        now. However, if the other opinion were true, the use of understanding
        in children at that time would not have been fettered in any way.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The soul can be restricted by the body in two ways. One is by way of
        opposition, as happens when the body resists the soul and obscures it.
        This, however, would not have happened in the state of innocence. The
        other is by way of incapacity and defect, namely, in so far as the body
        is unable to execute all that the soul would be capable of considered in
        itself. And there was nothing to keep the soul from being restricted by
        the body in this way in the state of innocence. For it is thus evident
        that by reason of the body the soul is hindered from passing through
        things thrust in its path and from changing its location with as much
        ease as it does when separated from the body. In this way, also, it is
        kept from being able to have perfect use of its powers. Still, there
        would have been no pain in this, since the soul, by reason of its
        orderly disposition, would have given only those commands which the body
        could carry out.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although the understanding does not use an organ, nevertheless, it
        receives something from faculties which use an organ. Therefore, its act
        can be restricted because of an impediment or defect of the bodily
        organs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The intelligible species has that which is formal in it, through
        which it is actually intelligible, from the agent intellect, which is a
        higher power than the possible intellect, although that which is
        material in it is abstracted from phantasms. Therefore, more properly,
        the possible intellect receives from what is higher than from what is
        lower, since that which is from the lower can be received by the
        possible intellect only in so far as it receives the form of
        intelligibility from the agent intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Or we should say that the lower powers are higher in some respect,
        especially in the ability to act and to cause. This is due to their
        greater proximity to external things, which are the cause and measure of
        our knowledge. It is for this reason that the sense serves imagination,
        not of itself, but in so far as it is informed by the species of a
        sensible thing, and so for the rest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the Philosopher, the intellective soul is related to
        phantasms as to its objects. Consequently, our understanding needs
        conversion to phantasms not only in acquiring knowledge but also in
        using knowledge once it is acquired. This is evident from the fact that,
        as long as the soul is in the body, a man cannot use even previously
        acquired knowledge if the organ of the power of imagination is injured,
        as happens in the insane. What Avicenna says should be taken of the soul
        separated from the body, which has a different mode of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The organ of the power of imagination, of memory, and of the
        cogitative sense is in the brain itself, which is the place of greatest
        moistness in the human body. Therefore, because of the large measure of
        moistness which is in children, the acts of these powers are hindered
        more than the acts of the external senses. But understanding receives
        immediately from the interior and not the exterior senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Some other animals naturally have a dry disposition; hence, at their
        birth there is not so great a profusion of moistness which greatly
        impedes the acts of the interior senses. But man naturally has a
        moderate disposition, and therefore he must have a high degree of warmth
        and moistness. So, at the beginning of his existence there has to be
        proportionately more moistness in him. For all animal and plant
        generations begin from moistness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The body which corrupts weighs down the soul not only because it is
        powerless but also because it resists and obscures the soul. However,
        the human body in the state of innocence hindered the acts of the soul
        only because of the imperfection of a power or disposition.
