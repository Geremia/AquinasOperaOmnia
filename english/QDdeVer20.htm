  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that there we should not, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Knowledge is a perfection of the one who knows. But every perfection is
    more noble than the subject of perfectibility. Therefore, if Christ knows by
    reason of some created knowledge, something created will be more noble than
    the soul of Christ. But this seems unfitting.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Activity is not attributed to the nature, but to the substantial subject.
    For activities belong to substantial subjects and individuals. But, for the
    person of Christ to understand, uncreated knowledge is sufficient.
    Therefore, it is superfluous to ascribe created knowledge to Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. The more noble a thing is, the more it is like God. But the soul of
    Christ is more noble than physical heat. Therefore, since physical heat acts
    without a medium, and in this is like God, who acts without a medium, it
    seems that, with much greater reason, the soul of Christ should understand
    without the mediation of any created knowledge. It was said that the
    activity of heat proceeds from within, but the activity of knowledge, from
    without, since it is according to the movement from things to the soul.
    Hence, they are not alike.—On the contrary, in the activity of knowing there
    is not only reception, but also judgment about the things received. And,
    although reception is from without, judgment proceeds from within.
    Therefore, the activity of knowledge is not entirely from without.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Christ, the Son of God, did not assume any imperfection unless it aided
    our redemption. But imperfection of knowledge does not aid our redemption.
    Therefore, He did not assume imperfection of knowledge. But all created
    knowledge is imperfect in some degree by the very fact that it is created.
    Therefore, He did not assume created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Anyone who is always engaged in the act of thinking according to the most
    perfect knowledge does not need any less perfect knowledge, because he would
    never use it, and so would have it to no purpose. But Christ is always
    engaged in the act of thinking according to the most perfect knowledge,
    namely, uncreated knowledge. Therefore, we should not ascribe another, that
    is, created knowledge to Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Nature does not do with two things that which it can do with one; much
    less does God, who acts in a more orderly way than nature. But Christ could
    become wise if He had only uncreated knowledge. Therefore, He did not become
    wise by means of created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. According to the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:10): “When that
    which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be put away.” But
    created knowledge, in comparison with uncreated knowledge, is more imperfect
    than vision in the mirror [of creatures], in comparison with vision of
    [God’s] essence. Therefore, if the vision of faith is removed because of its
    imperfection when vision of [God’s] essence arrives, with much greater
    reason created knowledge will be excluded from Christ in whom there was
    uncreated knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. The Word united to His soul is much more intimate to it than our
    understanding is to our soul, since the Word is united to it not only
    through its essence, presence, and power, as in other souls, and through
    grace, as in the just, but also in unity of person. But our soul understands
    through its intellective power. Therefore, Christ’s soul could be wise with
    the wisdom of the Word, and so it did not need created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. If Christ had created knowledge, it was not given to Him except for His
    perfection. But the soul of Christ, united to the Word and having created
    knowledge, is not more noble that if it were united to the Word alone
    without created knowledge. For something created added to God does not
    increase His goodness, just as a point added to a fine does not make it
    longer. Therefore, we should not ascribe created knowledge to Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. In Luke (2:52) we read: “And Jesus advanced in wisdom...”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But it is clear that he could not advance in uncreated wisdom, since that
    neither grows nor declines. Therefore, we should say that there is created
    knowledge in Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. According to Damascene: “The Word of God assumed everything which God
    implanted in our nature.” But He implanted created knowledge in our nature.
    Therefore, He assumed created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Just as divine knowledge is above created intellective knowledge, so
    created intellective knowledge is above sensitive knowledge. But one who has
    created intellective knowledge does not lose sensitive knowledge, as is
    evident in men. Therefore, created intellective knowledge can remain after
    the advent of uncreated intellective knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Just as we say that there are two natures in Christ, so, also, we say that
    there are two kinds of knowledge: created and uncreated. But some heretics
    have said that there is only uncreated knowledge in Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    To see the source of this error we must bear in mind that some3 have
    understood that the union of the divine and human natures takes place in the
    way in which the soul is united to the body. Thus, as the soul is the form
    of the body, so in Christ the divinity would be the form of the humanity.
    Therefore, some have thought that if the Word were united to Christ’s body
    as the soul is to our body, it could give life to Him just as our soul gives
    life to our body. Hence, they said that there were only two substances in
    Christ, body and divinity, and the latter in place of the soul gave life to
    the body. This was the error of Eunomius and his followers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, some, perceiving that it would be unworthy for the divinity to be
    united to the body as that which gives it life, said that Christ had a soul
    which gives life and sensation, that is to say, a vegetative and a sensitive
    soul, but did not have an intellectual soul. They said that in Christ the
    Word Himself took the place of the intellectual soul. This was the error of
    Apollinaris and his followers. And, granted this error, it is plain that
    there is only uncreated knowledge in Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But this manner of understanding the union in Christ leads one to believe
    that the divine and human natures are combined into a single nature, just as
    the union of body and soul results in not only one substantial subject but
    also one nature. Furthermore, it follows from this that the true reality of
    each nature is destroyed. For, since it is essential to the divine nature to
    have its being separate from all things, if we make it the act of any body,
    it loses its proper nature. In the same way, if the soul or the
    understanding or anything integral to human nature is taken away from it,
    there will no longer remain the true reality of the specific nature, since,
    as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the specific natures are similar to
    numbers, in which the species of the number is changed when unity is added
    or subtracted. Therefore, according to the foregoing error, Christ was
    neither true God nor true man.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, for Christ to be true God and true man, He must have within him
    all that pertains to the divine nature, and, also, as a distinct nature in
    the same person, all that constitutes the specific nature of man. And for
    him to be not only a true man, but a perfect man, he must have everything
    which we need to be perfect, such as habits of the sciences and of the
    virtues. However, just as divinity cannot be an act of a body, in such a way
    that by it the body formally has life, or becomes a rational creature, so
    also it cannot be the act of the rational soul, so that by it the soul
    formally has knowledge or virtue in the way in which we have them through a
    habit of virtue or knowledge. Therefore, we must hold that there is created
    knowledge and virtue in Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Created knowledge is, indeed, more noble than Christ’s soul in some
    respect, in so far as it is an act of His soul. In this sense, His color is
    more noble than His body, and any accident is more noble than its subject,
    in so far as it is related to it as act to potency. Simply, however, the
    subject is more noble than an accident, and, thus, Christ’s soul is more
    noble than its knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Although activity is ascribed to the substantial subject as agent, it is
    ascribed to the nature as the source of activity. And activity does not
    receive its specification from the agent but from the source of the
    activity. Hence, there can be specifically different activities in one agent
    because of the diversity of the principles of operation, as sight and
    hearing in man. Therefore, although in Christ there is only one substantial
    subject, in Him there are two natures and, so, two activities. Furthermore,
    Christ must have the perfection of both activities. Thus, He has not only
    uncreated knowledge, which is sufficient for the activity of the uncreated
    nature, but also created knowledge, which is needed for the perfect activity
    of the created nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Properly speaking, heat does not act; rather, it is the medium through
    which fire acts. For this reason, it is related to the activity of heating
    in the way in which created knowledge is related to the act of considering.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Although there is something from within in the deliberation of science,
    such activity is completed only when there is something from without. Here
    we see the dissimilarity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Although created existence is imperfect in comparison with the eminence
    of the divine perfection, each thing is perfect in its own order and demands
    some perfection of its own order. Thus, even in Christ the created nature
    had some created perfection, namely, created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Christ is always engaged in the act of thinking according to His
    uncreated knowledge. But, since the two activities belong to Him by reason
    of two natures, this actual consciousness does not therefore exclude the
    added consciousness of created knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. If Christ had only uncreated knowledge, He would indeed be wise as God,
    but He would not, so to speak, be wise as man. Hence, He had to have created
    knowledge to be wise in His humanity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. What the Apostle says should be taken of the perfection which is opposed
    to imperfection, for thus the imperfect is removed when the perfect arrives.
    But the perfection of divine knowledge is not opposed to the imperfection of
    created knowledge, since their objects are different. Hence, the conclusion
    does not follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Although the Word is more deeply within the soul than any of its powers,
    inasmuch as it supports and conserves the soul in existence, the
    understanding or any other power is more at one with the soul because it is
    united not only in person but also in nature, inasmuch as a power is a
    perfection of the soul itself, whereas the Word is not. Consequently,
    formally speaking, the soul of Christ cannot understand through the Word as
    though through its intellect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Although the Word plus created knowledge is not better than the Word
    alone, the soul united to the Word and having the perfection of created
    knowledge is better than if it were united to the Word without having
    created knowledge. For created knowledge has a relation to the soul in a
    manner in which the Word does not. Therefore, the conclusion does not
    follow.

        It seems that it did not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. To see through a habit is to see through a medium. But the soul of
        Christ sees the Word without a medium. Therefore, it does not see it
        through a habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The soul of Christ is beatified because it sees the Word. But
        beatitude, or happiness, consists not in habit but in act, according to
        the Philosopher. Therefore, the soul of Christ does not see the Word
        through a habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The more simple a thing is, the closer it is to God. And the closer
        it is to God, the more noble it is. Therefore, since the soul of Christ
        has nobility especially because it sees God perfectly, it seems that it
        gets no composition in that vision, as it would if it understood the
        Word through a habit conjoined to the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The soul of Christ is more noble than the angels, especially with
        reference to what belongs to vision of the Word. But the angels do not
        see the Word through habits, since, as Maximus says: “It is not fitting
        to think that the great Dionysius said that attributes [
        <i>habitudines</i> ] exist in divine intellects in the manner of
        accidents, as they do in us, and that they exist differently in
        different subjects, as if they were made into qualities. For every
        accident is excluded from those divine intellects.” Therefore, neither
        did the soul of Christ see the Word through a habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The soul of Christ can be considered only as united to the Word, or
        according to its own nature. But, in so far as it is united to the Word,
        it does not befit it to see the Word through the medium of a habit,
        since it is not united to the Word through the medium of a habit.
        Likewise, this does not befit it by reason of its proper nature, for,
        just as every whole is greater than the part, so every whole is better
        and more perfect than any of its parts. But a part of the soul, the
        agent intellect, carries on its activity without the mediation of a
        habit, and this seems to pertain to the nobility of the agent intellect.
        So, with much greater reason, the whole soul engages in activity without
        the mediation of a habit. Therefore, the soul of Christ does not in any
        way see the Word through a habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As the Gloss says: “After God there is nothing better than the nature
        of the human mind such as Christ assumed.” But some creatures even
        without sense perform their activities without the mediation of a habit.
        And this seems to pertain to their nobility, since in this they are like
        God. Therefore, the soul of Christ with much greater reason performs its
        activity without any habit. Thus, we conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No passive power can perform its activity unless it is perfected by
        the form of its corresponding active agent, since a thing operates only
        in so far as it is in, act. But the possible intellect, by which the
        soul of Christ understood, was a passive power. Therefore, it could not
        understand unless it was perfected through the form of its corresponding
        active principle, that is to say, unless it was perfected by something
        intelligible. But a habit in the understanding seems to be nothing other
        than the species of intelligible things in the understanding. Therefore,
        the soul of Christ saw God and understood through the mediation of a
        habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It did not befit the Son of God to assume anything but a perfect
        intellective power. But the active power is made perfect through the
        habit of knowledge. Therefore, He assumed habitual knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For a clear understanding of this question we must know what a habit is,
        and why We need habits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        At first sight, habit seems to mean something added to a power, by which
        power receives the perfection needed for its activity. A power, however,
        needs some addition for two reasons: because of the state of its nature,
        and because of the nature of the power of itself. Nor is this without
        reason, since the activity, which proceeds from a power, depends on the
        nature which is the source of the power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A power needs something for its activity because of its nature, for
        example, when the activity is such that it is beyond the capacity and
        condition of the nature. In this way, to love God with the love of
        fellowship, as a sharer in His inheritance, is beyond the condition of
        human nature. Hence, our affective power needs the habit of charity for
        this activity. A power needs something by reason of the power itself,
        however, when it is ordained to objects of such a nature that it can in
        no wise of itself perfectly possess their act. Thus, the power of sight
        is ordained to knowledge of all colors, but it was not possible for all
        colors actually to exist in the organ of sight. Therefore, things were
        ordained differently, namely, that the power of sight could be given the
        likeness of any color and so proceed to the act of sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Still, we must bear in mind that that which is added to a power is
        sometimes received in it as a habit, and sometimes after the manner of a
        transient impression.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This latter is the case when that which is received does not remain
        within the recipient, and does not become a quality of the recipient,
        but is impressed on it by a kind of contact from some agent, and quickly
        passes on. Thus, the Philosopher says that, when one suddenly blushes
        because of shame, the redness is “a transient impression” and not an
        affective “quality.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But that which is received is retained as a habit when it becomes in a
        sense connatural to the receiver. For this reason, the Philosopher says
        that a habit is a quality which is hard to change. Hence it is, also,
        that activities which proceed from a habit are pleasurable, readily
        undertaken, and easily performed, since they have, in a sense, become
        connatural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, what is supplementary in the sense powers is not given as a
        habit, but as a transient impression. But in the intellective powers of
        the soul the supplement is given as a habit. For the sensitive part is
        led by natural instinct rather than taking the lead itself, whereas the
        intellective part has the direction of its acts. Therefore, it should
        have a readiness to act, so that it can engage in activity when it
        pleases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From what has been said, it is evident that a power is more perfect when
        it receives something as a habit than if it receives it only as a
        transient impression. Therefore, we must say that anything supplementary
        to the soul of Christ is there as a habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For both of the reasons we have given we must say that there is some
        addition to the soul of Christ. By reason of the nature, for vision of
        the divine essence is above the state of any created nature.
        Consequently, no creature can reach this unless it is elevated to that
        blessed vision by some light. In some, for example those enraptured,
        this light is received as a temporary impression and transiently. But in
        Christ it was there as a habit, making the soul of Christ beatified from
        the beginning of its existence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        By reason of the power, however, the intellect of the human soul is in
        potency to all things. However, it is impossible for any created being
        to be perfectly the act and likeness of all beings, for, thus, it would
        possess the nature of being in an infinite manner. Hence, only God can
        understand all things by Himself and without any addition. But every
        created intellect understands through some species given it, either
        acquired by it, as happens with us, or given in creation or infused, as
        in the angels. And what belongs to angels by reason of the state of
        their nature, that is to say, to have the species of all things infused
        in them from their creation, was conferred on the soul of Christ in a
        much more excellent way by reason of the fullness of grace. But through
        the mediation of these species it did not know the Word, but only
        created things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, it must be said that in the knowledge with which the soul of
        Christ saw the Word it needed the habit which is light, not as that
        through which something would become actually intelligible, as happens
        in us with the light of the agent intellect, but as that through which
        the created understanding would be elevated to that which is above it.
        But, for knowledge of other creatures, it had the habit which is the
        aggregate of the species ordained to knowledge.

        1. The soul of Christ sees the Word without that medium which consists
        in a likeness of the thing seen, as the species in the eye is a likeness
        of the visible thing, or a mirror is a likeness of the thing reflected.
        But it does not see the Word without that medium which is a disposition
        of the one seeing. Thus, the argument is not valid.

        2. When one says that happiness is not habitual, this should be
        understood of the habit from which an act does not proceed. For one who
        has something habitually and not actually is like one who is asleep.
        But, according to the opinion of the Philosopher, the act in which
        happiness consists must proceed from some habit. Otherwise, the activity
        would not be pleasurable and perfect.

        3. According to Dionysius, the situation is not the same in
        participations and participants, for, the more simple participations
        are, the more noble they are, as to exist than to live, and to live than
        to understand, if by our understanding we separate existence and life in
        order to compare them. But, among participants, the more composed a
        thing is (not, of course, with material composition, but by reason of
        reception of more participations), the more noble it is, because it is
        like God in so many more things. This kind of assimilation can come only
        from something received from God. Hence, also, the soul which besides
        its nature has habits perfecting it is more noble.

        4. The words of Maximus should be taken of separable accidents and those
        belonging to [physical] nature, for, if they had accidents of this sort,
        they would be subject to change, and not immaterial and subsistent
        essences. Consequently, he adds: “For if it were this, their essence
        would certainly not remain within itself.” And he concludes: “Therefore,
        their attributes [ <i>habitudines</i> ] and powers are essential to them
        because of their immateriality.” And he calls essential that which never
        leaves the essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The union in Christ does not terminate in activity but in existence.
        Therefore, in so far as the soul is united to the Word, speaking of what
        is immediate, it is not entitled to sight of the Word or any other
        activity, but to this only, namely, existence in the person of the Word.
        However, its activities belong to it by reason of its powers and its
        nature. And, although the whole soul is more perfect than the agent
        intellect, no other power of the soul is more noble than the agent
        intellect. Hence, the fact that the agent intellect does not need a
        habit does not mean that the possible intellect must not need one. For
        the agent intellect needs no habit for its activity, because it does not
        receive anything from intelligible things, but gives its own form to
        them by making them actually intelligible. The possible intellect,
        however, has just the opposite relation to intelligible things.

        6. Natural powers are limited to one thing, so they reach their objects
        of themselves and do not need anything supplementary in order to act.
        But rational powers are ordained to many things, and this is an
        indication of their nobility. Therefore, the case is not the same.

        1. As is said in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:10): “But when
        that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be put away.”
        But the knowledge by which we now know things in themselves is in part,
        as we read in that same passage. Therefore, when the perfect knowledge
        of glory comes, our present knowledge will be put away, as the Apostle
        expressly seems to mean. But, in Christ, from the first moment of His
        conception there was the knowledge of glory, that is to say, that
        knowledge by which He knew things in the Word. Therefore, He had no
        other knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that, when glory comes, knowledge will be put away, not
        in its essence but in the mode in which the understanding now sees by
        inquiry and dependence on phantasms.—On the contrary, this mode is of
        the essence of knowledge. And, if something essential is taken away, the
        substance, of the thing cannot remain. Therefore, if that mode leaves,
        the knowledge cannot remain in its substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to the Philosopher, all habits which are acquired from acts
        are the source of acts like those from which they are acquired. But the
        knowledge which we now have was acquired from the kind of consideration
        in which we turn to phantasms and proceed by making comparisons.
        Therefore, knowledge like this can produce only acts of this nature. So,
        the knowledge would remain useless if such a mode of knowledge were
        discontinued.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 It is impossible to have two forms of the same species in one and the
        same subject. But, when the soul of Christ sees things in the Word, it
        has likenesses of the things it sees, since a thing is seen only through
        its likeness. Therefore, it is impossible for it to have other
        likenesses of the same things. So, there cannot be another knowledge in
        Christ except that by which He knows things in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Knowledge is ascribed to the soul of Christ because of its
        perfection. But, since the soul of Christ sees things in the Word and
        sees the Word itself, it is not more or less perfect whether it has
        other knowledge or not. Therefore, we should not ascribe any other
        knowledge to Him. I prove the minor premise from Augustine, who says:
        “Unhappy the man who knows all those things [creatures], and does not
        know You. Blessed the man who knows You, even if he does not know those
        things. However, one who knows both You and them is not more blessed
        because of them, but only blessed because of You.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Christ was more perfect than the angels, as the Apostle proves (Heb.
        1:4 ff.). But, besides knowledge of things which they have in the Word,
        angels have knowledge of things in their own nature, as is clear from
        Augustine. Therefore, with much greater reason the soul of Christ knew
        things in their own nature besides knowing them in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is not fitting that any of the natural perfections should be
        lacking in Christ. But it is a natural perfection of the human soul to
        know things in their own nature. Therefore, Christ had this kind of
        knowledge of things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As we said before, the perfection which belongs to Christ supernaturally
        does not exclude His natural perfection, just as uncreated life does not
        exclude a soul which gives life. But the knowledge by which the soul of
        Christ knows the Word and things in the Word is supernatural, as has
        been said. Hence, this does not prevent the soul of Christ from having
        every natural perfection. However, to be reduced to act is the natural
        perfection of anything which is existing in potency. But the possible
        intellect is naturally in potency to intelligible things. Consequently,
        before it is reduced to act, it is imperfect, and it is made perfect
        when it is reduced to act and so has knowledge of things. Therefore,
        some philosophers,” looking at man’s natural perfection, have said that
        the ultimate happiness of man consists in the delineation of the order
        of the whole universe in the soul of man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, Christ had this perfection of knowing things in their own
        nature through the infused knowledge given Him by God, much more than
        man in the state of innocence or angels by reason of their natural
        knowledge.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. There are two opinions about knowledge. One says that science
        acquired here remains as far as the essence of the habit is concerned,
        but the mode in which we use science in this life is taken away. The
        subsumption in the [second] difficulty proceeds according to this
        opinion. Nevertheless, we must add that, since Christ was a wayfarer and
        a possessor of the term, He had both modes of thinking, one in which He
        was like the angels, in that He knew things without discursive thought,
        and the other through which He knew by turning to phantasms. And it is
        proper to Christ to have both modes of knowledge, for it belongs to Him
        simultaneously to be a wayfarer and possessor of the term.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The other opinion, however, holds that knowledge acquired here will be
        taken away in so far as the essence of the habit is concerned. According
        to this (although I do not believe it is true), one could answer that
        the soul of Christ did not have knowledge acquired from the senses but
        infused knowledge such as the angels have through species created with
        them. It is clear that such knowledge remains in angels along with the
        vision of glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. This mode of knowing is not essential because of itself, but by
        reason of its subject, for which this is the normal mode of
        understanding according to the state of this life. But all that is
        essential to knowledge in itself is that through it things which can be
        known are known. Therefore, when the condition of the subject is
        changed, the mode of knowing is changed, although the habit of knowledge
        is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. An act can be like another act in two ways. In one way, they are
        alike in the species of the act which it derives from the matter it
        concerns. According to this, an acquired habit always produces an act
        similar to the act by which it was generated. Thus, one becomes brave by
        doing brave deeds, and, when he has become brave, does brave deeds. In
        the other way, they are alike according to the mode which follows the
        disposition of the subject. And, according to this, it is not necessary
        for the acts in question to be alike. For it is clear that the acts by
        which we acquire political bravery are performed with sadness and
        without pleasure. But acts which follow a habit are rather easy and are
        accompanied by pleasure, or at least are without sadness. Hence, in
        knowledge we see that man acquires knowledge of things by considering
        some things, and can consider these same things once he knows them.
        Nevertheless, he does this in a different way than he did before, for he
        no longer investigates but looks at what he has investigated. Thus,
        there is nothing to prevent acts which are produced by habits in the
        state of glory from having a different mode.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As far as it is said to know in the Word, the soul of Christ and any
        other soul has no other likenesses than the Word itself for the things
        which it knows in the Word. However, from the fact that it sees in the
        Word, it can form for itself likenesses of the things it sees, as one
        who sees something in a mirror sees the thing through the form of the
        mirror. We have discussed this more fully in our treatment of the
        angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Man’s beatitude consists in the knowledge of God and not in the
        knowledge of creatures. Hence, one is more blessed not because of
        knowledge of creatures but only because of the knowledge of God.
        Nevertheless, it is still true that knowledge of creatures belongs to
        the natural perfection of the soul, as has been said.

        1. God knows an infinite multitude of things, as Augustine says. But,
        since the soul of Christ is finite, it cannot know an infinite multitude
        of things. Therefore, in the Word the soul of Christ cannot know all
        that God knows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that by its union with the Word the soul of Christ is
        strengthened, and thus can know an infinite multitude of things.—On the
        contrary, the activity of the soul of Christ proceeds from it through
        the mediation not of the Word but of its own power. But its power is not
        infinite, since its essence is finite. Therefore, neither can its
        operation extend to the knowledge of an infinite multitude of things,
        although the Word to whom it is united is infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the union of the human and the divine nature, as Damascene says,
        “the uncreated remains uncreated, and the created remains created.” But
        the capacity and activity of any created thing is finite. Therefore,
        from its union with the Word, the soul of Christ did not receive the
        ability to know an infinite multitude of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Since the Word is infinite, it is fitting that He not only know an
        infinite multitude of things but also comprehend the infinite, that is
        to say, God. Therefore, if from its union with the Word the soul of
        Christ received knowledge of an infinite multitude of things, with equal
        reason, from the same union, it should have received comprehension of
        God. But this is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The activity by which the soul of Christ knew an infinite multitude
        of things was either the Creator or a creature. If it was the creator,
        it proceeded from the soul of Christ, which is a creature. Therefore,
        the Creator proceeded from a creature, which is impossible. If it is a
        creature—and every creature is finite—then that activity is finite. So,
        an infinite multitude of things are not known through it.

        6. It was said that, although the activity is finite, it has an
        ordination to an infinite multitude of things.—On the contrary, that
        relation by which it is ordained to what is infinite is either the
        Creator or a creature. And we can proceed in the same way as before.

        7. Since everything known is known through some species, if the soul of
        Christ knows an infinite multitude of things, it will know them through
        a finite or an infinite species. But it does not know them through an
        infinite species, since no created species is infinite. But, if it knows
        them through a finite species—and such a species does not represent an
        infinite multitude of things—then it is impossible for the soul of
        Christ to know an infinite multitude of things.

        8. It was said that, although the species by which the soul of Christ
        knows is created, still, from its union with the Word of God, it becomes
        a representation for knowing an infinite multitude of things. —On the
        contrary, union with the Word does not elevate a creature beyond the
        limits of creaturehood. For what is created can in no way become
        uncreated. But it is beyond the limits of creaturehood to be a
        representation of an infinite multitude of things. Therefore, no created
        species is elevated to this by union [with the Word].

        several dimensions, so knowledge is called great for different reasons,
        both because of the number of things known and because of the clarity of
        the cognition. Accordingly, if the knowledge of the soul of Christ is
        made equal to the knowledge of God in the number of things known,
        although not in clearness and distinctness of the cognition, it can be
        said that the knowledge of the soul of Christ is in some way,equal to
        the divine knowledge. But it seems absurd to make a creature equal to
        the Creator in anything.

        11. Along with our nature, Christ took on those defects which did not
        hinder the purpose for which He assumed it, namely, our redemption. But
        a lack of knowledge of many things would never have hindered our
        redemption, as, for example, if Christ would not have known the number
        of pebbles in the bed of some river. Therefore, we should not say that
        Christ knew everything.

        to the perfection of the soul in the way hunger and thirst are opposed
        to the perfection of the body. But Christ took on hunger and thirst
        because they were not obstacles to our redemption. Therefore, with equal
        reason He should have assumed ignorance of many things.

        in intensity in as far as one knows with infinite clearness. But
        Christ’s knowledge was not infinite in intensity, since, if it were, it
        would be equal to God’s knowledge in clearness. Therefore, it was not
        infinite in extension, either. Hence He did not know an infinite number
        of things, or all that God knows.

        For a clear understanding of this question we must grasp what it means
        to see something in the Word. Therefore, we must remember that a thing
        can be seen in something only in the way in which it exists in that
        thing. However, there are two ways in which a number of things can come
        to exist in one thing. In one way, they exist there in separation and
        multiplicity, as for instance, with many forms, each is reflected
        separately in a mirror, and as many men are in one house. In the other
        way, they are there according to one simple form, as many effects exist
        virtually in a cause, as conclusions in a principle, and as bodily
        members in seed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, whoever sees anything must, as a consequence, also see
        those things which exist in it in multiplicity and division. For each
        one of them presents itself to him in the same way as that single thing
        in which they are contained presents itself. To this extent, one who
        sees a mirror sees the forms reflected by the mirror). But one who sees
        some one thing does not have to see all the things which exist in it as
        united in one form, except when he comprehends the total power of that
        one thing. Thus, one who sees some principle does not have to see all
        the conclusions which exist virtually in it, unless he comprehends the
        principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But created things are not in God in multiplicity, but in unity, as
        Dionysius says. Hence, when we say that a thing is in God, this is more
        like the manner in which effects are in a cause and conclusions in a
        principle, than like the manner in which forms are in a mirror.
        Therefore, one who sees the Word does not have to see everything which
        the Word sees in Himself, as some9 have said, using the example of forms
        which are seen in a mirror when one sees the mirror. For the Word has
        comprehensive knowledge of Himself, so that, seeing Himself, He knows
        allthe things which are in Him virtually and in unity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But created intellects, which do not have a comprehensive grasp of the
        Word, do not necessarily see all that is in the Word when they see the
        Word. But, even in this, the soul of Christ enjoyed a greater privilege
        than any [other] created intellect. For in the Word it sees all things,
        present, past, and future.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason for this is that there is a double relation of God to
        creatures, since He is the principle and end of all things. We have one
        of these in so far as all things proceed from God into being, and the
        other in so far as they are ordained to God as to their end. Some, as
        the irrational creatures, are thus ordained only by assimilation;
        others, however, are thus ordained both by assimilation and also by
        attaining the divine essence itself. For it is innate in every creature
        proceeding from God to strive for the good by its activity. But a
        creature is assimilated to God in attaining any good whatsoever. But,
        beyond this, rational creatures by their activity can attain to
        knowledge and love of God. Consequently, they, beyond other creatures,
        have a capacity for beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Creator, however, surpasses creatures in both of these relations. In
        the first, because over and above everything which God has made He can
        still make other different things, new species, new genera, and other
        worlds. And that which has been made can never exhaust the power of the
        Maker. And He surpasses creatures in the second relation because, no
        matter how much a creature shares the good, it can never reach the point
        where it is equal to God’s goodness. Also, no matter how much a rational
        creature knows and loves God, it can never know and love Him as
        perfectly as He can be known and loved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And, just as creatures would be imperfect if they proceeded from God and
        were not ordained to return to God, so, too, their procession from God
        would be imperfect unless the return to God were equal to the
        procession. Therefore, every creature participates in goodness to the
        extent to which it participates in being. Thus, it is necessary for the
        most excellent created intellects to know God, so that their knowledge
        be equal to the procession of creatures from God. But things proceed
        from God naturally and according to the order of grace. Hence, the
        created intellects, that is, the angels, who in the natural order are
        set at the peak of creation, receive knowledge of all natural things in
        God and from God. But Christ stands above every creature also according
        to the gifts of grace, since “of his fullness we all have received, and
        grace for grace” (John 1:16). Therefore, He received in God knowledge of
        all things which proceed from God at any time, not only according to the
        order of nature, but 41so according to the order of grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the soul of Christ knows all creatures not only according to
        their natural properties, as the angels also do, but even in so far as
        they are subject to divine providence and are ordered to the end of
        human salvation and the gifts of grace. Therefore, He knows all
        individual things and every single act of all things, even the secret
        thoughts of men’s hearts. This can be said of no other creature.
        Nevertheless, because this does not reach the point where it includes
        comprehensive grasp of God’s infinity, God still has the power to do
        many other things than those which the soul of Christ knows.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The common answer to this objection is that God knows some things
        with the knowledge of vision, namely, present, past, and future things.
        And granted that the world has a beginning and an end, these are not
        infinite. We say that God sees only these because vision concerns things
        which exist in themselves outside the understanding of the one who sees
        them. However, He knows some things with the knowledge of simple
        intelligence, namely, those which He can make, but which will never
        exist. These things are infinite. And we say that God understands these
        things by means of the representation which His understanding can use to
        form quiddities of things which do not exist outside of Him.
        Accordingly, the soul of Christ sees all things, present, past, and
        future, in the Word; nevertheless, it does not see everything which God
        can make, and thus it does not follow that it knows an infinite
        multitude of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But that answer does not meet the force of the difficulty. For, if we
        grant that generation might continue to infinity in the future, as God
        could so make it, it is evident that there would be an infinite
        multitude of men, and God would know them all by knowledge of vision.
        Hence, if the soul of Christ knew everything that God knows with the
        knowledge of vision, it would follow that it would know an infinite
        multitude of things, although it would not know everything which God can
        do. For, besides an infinite multitude of individuals of these finite
        species, God can make an infinite multitude of different species and an
        infinite multitude of individuals in each species, as is clear
        especially in the ratios of numbers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For, if we take the individuals in one species of ratio, they will be
        multiplied to infinity. Thus, in the species of doubling there is the
        ratio of two to one, four to two, six to three, and so on to infinity.
        And again, besides the ratio of doubling, there is another species, that
        of triple, and also of quadruple, and quintuple, and so on to infinity.
        Yet each of these contains potentially an infinite multitude of
        individuals. Consequently, if generation were to continue to infinity
        according to these species which are now finite, God could still make
        more, because He could make new species, and this to infinity. It is
        clear from this that it does not mean the same thing to say that the
        soul of Christ knows an infinite multitude of things and that it knows
        all that God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Furthermore, in knowing all creatures with the knowledge of vision, God
        has a comprehensive grasp of them, so He knows whatever is in the
        potency of creatures. But there is an infinity in the potency of
        creatures, as is evident in the division of the continuum and in the
        addition of numbers. Hence, since the soul of Christ has comprehensive
        knowledge of creatures, it knows the infinite number of things which are
        in creatures potentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Besides, if the souls of the damned exist forever, and their thoughts,
        all of which God knows, will be changing, God now knows an infinite
        multitude of future things with the knowledge of vision. Hence, if the
        soul of Christ knows everything that God knows with the knowledge of the
        vision, we must say that it knows an infinite multitude of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, we have to give a different answer, and say that in reality we
        find something which is simply and in every way infinite, namely, God.
        And there is something finite in every way, namely, material things.
        Moreover, there is something which is finite in some sense and infinite
        in some sense, for any immaterial substance is finite in so far as it
        has existence limited to its own nature, since no created substance,
        although immaterial, is its own existence, but participates in
        existence. Nevertheless, it is infinite by reason of the removal of that
        limitation by which a form is limited by the very fact of its reception
        into matter. For everything received exists in the recipient according
        to the mode of the recipient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, in so far as a thing is infinite, it is related to the
        infinite by its activity. For that which is infinite both because of its
        existence and its immateriality, namely God, is related to infinity
        through its operation by reason both of its matter, or quantity, and of
        its specific or generic nature. Consequently, God can know an infinite
        multitude of individuals and an infinite multitude of species because He
        knows all that He can do, and He can make new species to infinity.
        Besides this, since a thing acts in so far as it is in act, just as
        God’s being is infinite, so also His activity is infinitely efficacious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But a material thing is not related to an infinite multitude of things
        either as infinite according to quantity or matter, or as infinite
        according to species. This is evident in sight, which is a material
        power and, accordingly, cannot know any species whatever, but a
        determined species, color. Nor can it know an infinite number of things
        except successively. For, since it is material, its activity is
        material, and attains to things which are numerically infinite according
        to continuous or discrete quantity, and this is material infinity. It
        does this in the way in which they are infinite, that is to say,
        materially, numbering part after part. Therefore, it can never arrive at
        knowledge of an infinite number of individuals. And since our
        understanding in the present state receives from sense, neither can it
        know an infinite number of things in this way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But immaterial substances, which are in some sense infinite and in some
        sense finite, have limited existence, and because of this their activity
        has finite efficacy and is ordained to finite natures. But, because they
        are immaterial, their activity extends to things materially infinite.
        Hence, as the Commentator says, our understanding appears to be infinite
        in some respect, in so far as it knows the universal, in which an
        infinite number of singulars are known. But it is deficient in this,
        that the universal species which understanding perceives, that of man,
        for example, is not a perfect representation for knowledge of any
        individual in its individuality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, if that were the case, then our understanding, granted that
        there were an infinite number of men, would still know these materially
        infinite things through one finite nature, human nature. For, although
        in an infinite multitude of men human nature would be infinite
        quantitatively or materially, it would not be infinite specifically.
        This is clear from the fact that there can be other species outside of
        the infinite multitude of men. And the proper object of understanding
        is. the specific nature, not matter. The case would be similar with one
        who, by means of the nature of animal, would know all species of animals
        in their specific qualities. For if there were an actually infinite
        number of species of animals, he would indeed know an infinite species
        but only a finite nature, since, besides the nature of animal, there is
        still the nature of stone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, since the soul of Christ knows the Word, which is a
        sufficient representation for knowledge of all individuals in their
        individuality, and all species in their specific qualities, nothing
        prevents the soul of Christ from knowing an infinite multitude of
        things, even though its being is finite. Nevertheless, it cannot have a
        comprehensive grasp of infinite nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The soul of Christ is not elevated above the limits of creaturehood
        by its union with the Word. Therefore, it does not become infinite, does
        not have infinite power, and its activity is not intrinsically infinite,
        although it does know an infinite multitude of things. For it knows an
        infinite multitude of things with a finite power. As a result, it
        remains infinite only materially.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 Comprehensive grasp of the infinite can come only through an activity
        which has infinite efficacy. For God Himself is known comprehensively by
        an intellect when it has as much efficacy to understand as God has to be
        understood. Consequently, He can be known comprehensively only by an
        uncreated intellect. But knowledge of an infinite multitude of things
        does not demand infinite efficacy in intellectual activity, as is clear
        from what has been said. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.

        7. The soul of Christ knows an infinite multitude of things through an
        uncreated species in the way we have described, that is, through the
        divine essence itself. And, since this is infinite, nothing prevents it
        from containing the intelligibility of an infinite multitude of things.

        9. The man assumed [by the Word] was not made equal to the Word in the
        number of things known, although he knew an infinite multitude of
        things. For it still does not follow that he knows everything which God
        can make as is clear from what has been said. And, granting that he knew
        all that the Word knows, even though the number were equal in both, he
        is not made equal in the number of things known with reference to the
        manner of knowing.

        10. Essentially, any dimension belongs to measurable quantity.
        Therefore, one body can be said to be equal to another according to any
        dimension in which it is equal to the other. But quantity of knowledge,
        which is considered according to the number of things known, belongs to
        it accidentally and materially, especially when in the many objects of
        knowledge there is a single intelligible aspect by which they are known.
        It would be different if they were known according to different
        intelligible aspects. But the quantity which comes from efficacy of
        knowledge belongs essentially to knowledge, since such quantity is
        considered according to the procession of intellectual activity from the
        intellectual power. Therefore, the situation is not the same.

        11. The Son of God did not assume all the defects which could have
        existed in Him without interfering with the redemption of men. But it is
        true that He assumed those whose assumption aided in the redemption of
        the human race. Nevertheless, any lack of knowledge whatever would have
        been a defect which hindered the redemption of the human race. For the
        Redeemer, through whom grace and truth were to be diffused throughout
        the whole human race, needed the fullness of grace and truth. And any
        defect of knowledge could have been prejudicial to this.

        12. Through His bodily weakness Christ came to heal the weakness of soul
        which consists in a lack of grace and knowledge. Therefore, although He
        did assume bodily defects, He should not in any way have assumed any
        defect of knowledge or grace.

        14. Extensive quantity, as is clear from what has been said, is
        accidental to knowledge. But intensive quantity is essential to it, as
        is also clear from our explanation. Therefore, the situation is not the
        same.

        1. Whoever knows the greater can know the less. But God is greater than
        anything which He can make, for whatever He can make is created.
        Therefore, since the soul of Christ knows God, it can with much greater
        reason know whatever God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said that, although God is greater, the soul of Christ has an
        ordination to the knowledge of God but not to the knowledge of
        everything which God can make.—On the contrary, although God in Himself
        is more knowable than any creature, yet, for us, creatures are more
        knowable than God. But whatever God can make is a creature. Therefore,
        it is more natural for the soul to know anything God can make than to
        know God Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. just as the soul of Christ sees the divine essence, so, also, it sees
        the divine power. However, it is said to see the whole divine essence,
        but does not see it totally. Therefore it sees the whole divine power,
        although it does not see it totally. But the whole power cannot be seen
        unless whatever it can extend to is seen. Therefore, the soul of Christ
        knew everything which God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whatever God can make He can disclose. But whatever can be disclosed
        to any creature was disclosed to Christ. Therefore, whatever God can
        make was disclosed to Christ.

        5. That which does not entail defect in the one communicating nor in the
        one to whom it is communicated can be communicated. But to give the soul
        of Christ the knowledge of everything which God can make does not entail
        any defect in God, since this would seem to pertain to His supreme
        liberality, nor in the soul of Christ, since it belongs to its supreme
        perfection. Therefore, this could be communicated to the soul of Christ;
        so, it was communicated to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If the soul of Christ does not know all that God can do, granted that
        God did something, the soul of Christ would not know it, unless it
        learned it anew. But it is unfitting to say that the soul of Christ is
        ignorant of any existing thing, or that it learns anything new.
        Therefore, the soul of Christ knows all that God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. If the soul of Christ knows whatever God can make, everything that
        God can make is enclosed in the soul of Christ. But the soul of Christ
        is finite. Therefore, since God can make an infinite multitude of
        things, it follows that the infinite would be enclosed in the finite.
        But this is impossible. Therefore the first, that the soul of Christ is
        able to know whatever God can make, is impossible too.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The divine power is infinite, just as the divine essence is. But the
        soul of Christ cannot have a comprehensive grasp of the divine essence
        because of its infinity. Therefore, neither can it have a comprehensive
        grasp of the divine power. Thus, it cannot know whatever God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The more perfectly a thing is known by someone, the more things are
        known in it. But God knows Himself more perfectly than the soul of
        Christ does. Therefore, He knows more things in Himself than the soul of
        Christ knows in the Word. But God knows nothing in Himself but what is,
        or was, or will be, or can be, could have been, or could be [in the
        future]. Therefore, the soul of Christ does not know all these things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There have been different opinions on this matter. For some have said
        that not only the soul of Christ, but every soul, sees in the Word
        whatever can be seen there. This includes not only what is, will be, or
        has been, but whatever God can make. But these people were mistaken in
        this because they thought the mode of seeing things in the Word was like
        the mode of seeing things in a material mirror, in which images of
        things are reflected as many and diverse. But the natures of things
        exist in God in unity and simplicity, as Dionysius says. However, if
        they existed there as many and diverse, then everything that could be
        known in God would be known once He was seen. Thus, all who saw God
        through His essence would see everything that God can make, since all
        these things could be known in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, since we are told expressly that some who see God through His
        essence are ignorant of some things, as is evident of the angels, who
        are illumined by one another, as Dionysius says, some ascribe this
        perfection of knowledge only to the soul of Christ, and not to all who
        see God, so that, besides God only the soul of Christ knows all that God
        can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, since it does not seem fitting to ascribe an infinite activity to a
        finite creature, and since to see all that God can make requires an
        infinite activity, others have said that the soul of Christ does not see
        all the things which God can make in actual knowledge, but still does
        see them in habitual knowledge. For it knows the Word so perfectly that
        by turning to the Word it receives in the Word knowledge of whatever it
        wants to know, although it does not always actually consider everything
        that it can know in the Word. But this does not seem to be true. For the
        soul of Christ, and any of the blessed, in so far as they have the
        beatific vision, by which they see the Word and things in the Word, do
        not have succession in their acts of understanding. For, according to
        Augustine: “Thoughts will not come and go in heaven.” Hence, we must say
        that in the Word the soul of Christ sees in actual knowledge all that it
        sees there in habitual knowledge. This agrees with what the Philosopher
        says, when he says that happiness is had according to act, and not only
        according to habit. Furthermore, as it is not fitting to say that there
        is a created activity which extends to all that God can make, so it is
        also not fitting to say that there is a created habit with an ordination
        to these same things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, we must say with others that the soul of Christ does not know
        all that God can make. The reason for this is that two elements must be
        considered in knowledge: that which is known and the manner in which it
        is known. It sometimes happens that some agree in one of these who
        differ in the other, as when one and the same thing is known by
        different subjects, less by one and more by the other. That which in
        itself is presented to be known pertains to that which is known; that,
        however, which is known in something else pertains to the manner of
        knowing of that in which it is known. Thus, if one knows some principle
        and in it acquires knowledge of some conclusions, the knowledge of those
        conclusions depends on the manner of knowing the principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For, the more perfectly one knows a principle, the more conclusions he
        sees in it, but, however weak his knowledge of the principle is, the
        substance of that principle always remains known to him. Therefore, his
        knowledge of it does not involve any determinate way of knowing, as the
        knowledge of conclusions which are known in the principle involves a
        determinate way of knowing. Hence it is that all who are presented with
        one principle know the substance of the principle but do not know the
        same conclusions or an equal number of conclusions. They differ in this,
        as they do in the manner of knowing the principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        All who see God through His essence are said to see the whole essence of
        God. For there is nothing of the essence which any of them does not see,
        since the divine essence has no parts. Nevertheless, all do not see it
        totally, but only God sees Himself totally, in this sense, that the mode
        of the knower is equal to the mode of the thing known. For the efficacy
        of the divine intellect in knowing is as great as the knowability of the
        divine essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this cannot be said of any created intellect; hence, no created
        intellect reaches the point where it sees the divine essence as
        perfectly as it can be seen. For this reason, no created intellect can
        have comprehensive knowledge of it, but one created intellect sees the
        divine essence more perfectly than another. Therefore, it is evident
        that knowledge of something in the Word depends on the mode of knowing
        the Word. Thus, as it is impossible for a created intellect to arrive at
        the perfect mode of knowing the Word as it can be known, so, too, it is
        impossible for a created intellect to know everything which can be known
        in the Word, that is to say, everything which God can make.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, it is impossible for the soul of Christ to know everything
        which God can make, just as it is impossible for it to have
        comprehensive knowledge of the divine power. For each thing is known
        comprehensively when its definition is known. For the definition is the
        power comprehending the thing. But the definition of any power is taken
        from the things to which the power of God extends. Hence, if the soul of
        Christ knew everything to which the power of God extended, it would
        completely comprehend the power of God. But this is altogether
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Whatever God can do is less than God Himself. And it could be known
        more easily by the soul of Christ if whatever God can make were in
        itself presented to the soul of Christ, as God Himself is thus presented
        to it. But, in the present state of things, what God can do, or what He
        did, are not presented to the soul of Christ in themselves, but in the
        Word. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That through which another thing is known is always more evident.
        Therefore, although according to a certain mode of knowing creatures are
        more evident to us than God, still, in the mode of knowledge in which
        things are seen in the Word, the Word itself is more evident than the
        things seen in the Word. Hence, the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Power can be considered in two ways, either according to its
        substance, and thus the soul of Christ sees the whole divine power, as
        it sees the whole essence, or according to the things to which the power
        extends, and it is from these that the quantity of power is calculated.
        In this way, the soul of Christ does not see the whole power, because
        this would be completely to grasp the power, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It is impossible that God has made everything which He can make, for
        thus God would have made so many things that He could not make any more,
        and thus His power would be limited to the creatures actually in
        existence. Similarly, it is impossible to hold that whatever God can
        disclose has been disclosed to any creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. To hold that the soul of Christ knows everything which God can make
        implies a defect in God Himself. For God would be grasped completely by
        the soul of Christ, and this would derogate from His infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. We have to answer this difficulty in the way in which we answered the
        difficulties about predestination. For, although it is possible for one
        who is predestined to be damned, still, as soon as we say he is damned,
        we say that he was not predestined, since these two, to be predestined
        and to be damned, cannot stand together. Similarly, I say that when the
        soul of Christ knows everything which God foresees that He will do, as
        soon as it is true that God does something else, it is true that God
        foresaw that He would do it, and the soul of Christ knew it. Thus, it is
        not necessary to say that there is ignorance of anything in the soul of
        Christ, or that He learned anything anew.

        1. The capacity of the soul is not limited to a certain number of
        objects of knowledge. Accordingly, if the capacity of Christ’s soul is
        adequately filled with the knowledge of things in their proper genus, we
        must say that it knows all things according to this knowledge.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Everything which is in potency is imperfect before it is reduced to
        act. But the possible intellect, which was not missing from the soul of
        Christ, is “that by which one becomes all things,” as is said in
        <i>The Soul</i>. Therefore, since Christ’s understanding was not

        advance in the habit of science. Therefore, it knew all things according
        to the knowledge with which it knew things in their proper genus.

        We ascribe that scientific knowledge of things in their proper genus to
        the soul of Christ so that no natural perfection may be lacking to it,
        as is clear from what has been said.Therefore, through this knowledge He
        knew as much as the natural knowledge of the soul can reach, not only in
        this life, but after death. This is so because in His soul Christ was at
        once a wayfarer and one who possessed the term.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But there are some things which natural knowledge can in no way reach.
        Such are the divine essence, future contingents, the secret thoughts of
        men’s hearts, and other things of this sort. And the soul of Christ did
        not have knowledge of these things through that mode of knowledge, but
        knew them in the Word. It did not know them by the knowledge of
        prophecy, since prophecy is an imperfect participation of that sight by
        which things are seen in the Word. And, since this knowledge was perfect
        in Christ, the imperfection of prophecy had no place there.

        It is also clear that Christ had this knowledge more fully than Adam,
        since through this knowledge Adam did not know created separated
        substances, and the soul of Christ did. For the natural knowledge of the
        separated soul extends to this, although the knowledge of the soul
        joined to a corruptible body does not.

        1. The capacity of the human soul extends to a determined class of
        knowable things, but not to a definite number in that class.

        2. The possible intellect is in potency to receive all intelligible
        things which can become such through the agent intellect. Of this the
        Philosopher says that the agent intellect is that “by which one makes
        all things [intelligible].” But these are the things which are
        abstracted from phantasms and which we can come to know through
        naturally known principles. Therefore, the possible intellect is in
        natural potency only to these things. But Christ knew all these through
        this knowledge. Hence, there was no imperfection in His understanding.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. For that matter, even in this knowledge Christ could not advance in
        so far as the habit is concerned, since such knowledge by the nature of
        its genus cannot extend to more things than Christ knew through it. But
        in the Gospel it is said that He “advanced in wisdom” with reference to
        experience of those things which He knew in the habit.
