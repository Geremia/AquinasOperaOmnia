          >1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus
          was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 There they made him a
          supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with
          him. 3 Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed
          the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was
          filled with the fragrance of the ointment. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one
          of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, 5 "Why was this
          ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" 6
          This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a
          thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into
          it.

    <p>
      1589 So far the Evangelist has been showing the power of Christ's divinity
      by what he did and taught during his public life. Now he begins to show
      the power of his divinity as manifested in his passion and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he treats of Christ's passion and death; secondly, of his
      resurrection (c 20). The first is divided into three parts: in the first
      he states what caused or occasioned Christ's passion and death; in the
      second, how Christ prepared his disciples, since his death involved his
      physical separation from them (c 13); in the third, he describes his
      passion and death (c 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there were two things which caused or occasioned the passion of
      Christ: the glory of Christ, which aroused the envy of the Jews, and their
      disbelief, which blinded them. So first, he treats of the glory Christ
      received; secondly, of the unbelief of the Jews (v 37). In regard to the
      first he does two things: first, he shows how Christ received glory from
      other people; secondly, how he received glory from God (v 27). Concerning
      the first he does three things: first, he shows how Christ received glory
      from his intimate friends; secondly, from the crowd of the Jewish people
      (v 9): thirdly, from the Gentiles (v 20). Concerning the first he does two
      things: first, he shows the glory Christ received by being ministered to
      by his friends; secondly, how this kindled the indignation of the one who
      was to betray him (v 4). In regard to the first he does three things:
      first, he describes the time; secondly, the place (v 1); and thirdly, the
      kindness shown to Christ (v 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      1590 He says first, what we have already stated: that before the Passover
      Christ went into a region near the wilderness, and since the feast was
      drawing near, the Jews began to look for him. Thus, when the paschal
      season was at hand, during which the symbolic lamb was immolated, he, as
      the true lamb, came to the place where he would suffer and of his own free
      will be immolated for the salvation of the world: "He was offered because
      it was his own will," as we read in Isaiah [53:7].
    </p>
    <p>
      The Evangelist says Christ came there <b>six days before the Passover</b>,
      to inform us that by the day of the Passover he did not mean the
      fourteenth day of the first month (when according to the twelfth chapter
      of Exodus, the Passover lamb was slain in the evening), but the fifteenth
      day. This entire day was festive, and that year it fell on the Friday our
      Lord suffered. Thus the sixth day before the Passover was the first day of
      the week, i.e., the Palm Sunday on which our Lord entered Jerusalem.
      Consequently, Christ came to Bethany on the previous day, that is, on the
      Sabbath. This is what he means by the phrase,
      <b>six days before the Passover</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      1591 This number is very appropriate to the mystery to be enacted. First
      of all, because of the number itself, for six is a perfect number. For God
      completed the works of creation in six days. For this reason it was
      appropriate that it should take six days to accomplish the work of the
      passion, which would restore all things: "to reconcile all things, whether
      on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross" (Col 1:20);
      "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor 5:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, it is appropriate to the mystery, considering its foreshadowing.
      For Exodus (v 12) commanded that on the tenth day of the first month every
      man was to take a lamb for his household and keep it for the sacrifice.
      Thus it was also on the tenth day of the first month, i.e., on the sixth
      day before the fifteenth day, that our Lord decided to enter Jerusalem,
      drawing near to the place where he would be sacrificed. This is clear from
      what follows: "The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard
      that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees
      and went out to meet him" (12:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      1592 Then when he says, <b>Jesus came to Bethany</b>, the place is
      mentioned. Bethany was a village near Jerusalem, and it means the "house
      of obedience." This also is appropriate to the mystery. First, as regards
      a reason for the passion: "He became obedient unto death" (Phil 2:8).
      Secondly, with respect to the fruit of the passion, which is obtained only
      by those who obey Christ: "He became the source of eternal salvation to
      all who obey him" (Heb 5:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is significant that he added,
      <b>where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead</b>, because in
      the house of obedience those who are spiritually dead are raised to life
      by being restored to the way of righteousness: "By one man's obedience
      many will be made righteous" (Rom 5:19). According to the literal sense,
      however, this was written to show that Christ came to Bethany in order to
      revive the memory of the resurrection of Lazarus: "He has caused his
      wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and merciful" as we
      read in the Psalm (11:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      1593 Then when he says, <b>there they made him a supper</b>, he mentions
      the kindness shown to Christ by his friends: first, by his friends in
      general; secondly, in particular. <b>Martha served</b>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      1594 It was also appropriate to this mystery that they served him a supper
      there, at Bethany, because the Lord is spiritually refreshed in the house
      of obedience since our obedience pleases him, according to: "Behold, I
      stand at the door and knock; if any one hears my voice and opens the door,
      I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me" (Rev 3:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      1595 Next he mentions the three people who attended or sat with Jesus:
      Martha, Lazarus and Mary. Martha signifies the prelates who are appointed
      to serve in the churches: "This is how one should regard us, as servants
      of Christ and stewardess of the mysteries of God" (1 Cor 4:1). Thus we
      read that <b>Martha served</b>: "Martha was busy with much serving" [Lk
      10:40]. Lazarus, who had been raised to life, signifies those who have
      been brought from sin to the state of righteousness by the ministry or
      service of the prelates; and they, alone with the other righteous, feast
      spiritually with the Lord. Thus he says,
      <b>and Lazarus was one of those at table with him</b>: "Let the just feast
      and rejoice before God and be delighted with gladness" [Ps 67:4]. Mary
      signifies the contemplatives, for we read in Luke (10:39): "Mary sat at
      the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching."
    </p>
    <p>
      1596 Three things are mentioned about Mary's kindness: first, the ointment
      she used; secondly, the kindness she offered; thirdly, its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the ointment, three things are noted. First, the amount,
      and it was a large amount, <b>a pound</b> of ointment: "If you have many
      possessions, make your gift from them in proportion" (Tobit 4:8).
      Secondly, its matter, for it was made of <b>nard</b>: "While the king was
      on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance" (Song 1:11). Recall that
      nard is a short black aromatic herb; and the ointment which is made from
      it has a fragrance which has the power to give strength and comfort.
      Thirdly, its composition is noted, for the nard is described as
      <i>pisticus</i>. According to Augustine, the word <i>pisticus</i> is taken
      from the place where nard originates.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> However,
      it is better to interpret this word as meaning "true" or "pure," that is,
      as not adulterated: for <i>pistis</i> in Greek is the same as our
      <i>fides</i> [truthful, honest]. He adds that it was <b>costly</b>,
      because it was made from nard, which is used in costly ointments, and
      perhaps other expensive ingredients were added to it. This teaches us that
      we should offer to God those things we regard as most precious: "I will
      offer to thee burnt offerings of fatlings, with the smoke of the sacrifice
      of rams" (Ps 66:15); "Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and
      vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished" (Mal 1:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      See Mary's humility, for she fell down at the feet of Jesus
      <b>and anointed the feet of Jesus</b>, according to, "Let us worship at
      his footstool" (Ps 132:7). Secondly, see her devotion, for she
      <b>wiped his feet with her hair</b>, in this way making an offering of
      herself: "Yield your members to God as instruments of righteousness" (Rom
      6:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      He mentions the effect of her ministering when he says,
      <b>and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment</b>. This
      tells us of the goodness of this ointment, which filled the entire house:
      "We will run after thee to the odor of thy ointments" [Song 1:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      1597 The question is raised as to whether this woman is the same woman who
      anointed our Lord as mentioned in Luke (7:37), Matthew (26:7) and Mark
      (14:3). We learn from Jerome and Chrysostom that many think that the
      sinful woman mentioned by Luke is not the sister of Lazarus, Mary, who is
      said [in John] to have anointed the Lord.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Origen
      adds that [in John] she is also not the woman of whom Matthew and Mark
      speak, but they were speaking of some other woman.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> He gives
      three reasons for this opinion. The first is based on the time: for the
      woman in John anointed the Lord six days before the Passover, while the
      woman mentioned by Matthew and Mark did so some time during the two days
      preceding the Passover. For Matthew prefaces his account by stating that
      the Lord said: "You know that after two days the Passover is coming" (Matt
      26:2); and in Mark we read: "It was now two days before the Passover and
      the feast of the Unleavened Bread" (Mk 14:1). The second reason is based
      on the place: for in Matthew and Mark the woman is said to have anointed
      the Lord in the house of Simon the leper, but in John she seems to be in
      the house of Martha, for we read that Martha was serving the guests. And
      Augustine agrees with this. The third reason is from the action itself:
      for the woman in Matthew and Mark anointed the head of our Lord, while the
      one in John anointed his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Augustine and Gregory claim that the four Evangelists
      are speaking of one and the same woman, but that she anointed our Lord
      twice.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> The first
      time, mentioned by Luke, was at the beginning of her conversion, some time
      during the middle of Christ's public life. The second time, mentioned by
      the other three Evangelists, was a few days before Christ's passion. Thus
      the same act is mentioned here in John and in Matthew and Mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the discrepancy in the time, Augustine says that John preserved the
      historical order, while Matthew and Mark merely remembered that it took
      place just prior to Judas' betrayal, which was believed to have been
      occasioned by this event. As for the argument based on the difference of
      place, there is no reason why the house of Simon the leper could not be
      the house of Mary and Martha, since Simon might have been the head of the
      house. He is called a leper because at one time he was a leper, but was
      cured by Christ. As far as the act itself is concerned, Augustine says
      that the woman anointed both the head and feet of Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      1598 If the objection is raised that according to Mark she broke the
      alabaster jar and poured ointment on the head of Jesus, one might answer
      this in two ways. First, that it was broken in such a way that some
      remained for anointing his feet; secondly, she could have anointed his
      feet first, and then, breaking the jar, poured the rest on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      1599 Mystically, the pound Mary used denotes the work of justice, for it
      belongs to justice to weigh things and give pound for pound: "Their weight
      shall be equal" [Ezek 45:11]. Now four other virtues must be added if the
      work of justice is to be perfect. First, compassion: and so he says,
      <b>ointment</b>, which, because it is soothing, represents mercy: "For
      judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy" (James 2:12).
      Secondly, humility is needed: so he says, <b>nard</b>, which, since it is
      a small herb, signifies humility: "The greater you are, the more you must
      humble yourself" (Si 3:18). Thirdly, faith is needed: thus he says,
      <b>pure</b> (<i>pisticus</i>), that is believing (<i>fidelis</i>): "The
      righteous shall live by his faith" (Hab 2:4). Fourthly, charity must be
      present: so he says, <b>costly</b>, for charity alone pays the price for
      eternal life: "If I give away all I havebut have not love, I gain nothing"
      (1 Cor 13:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The works of justice anoint both the feet and head of Jesus. By his feet
      we understand the mystery of his humanity; and by his head, his divinity,
      according to: "The head of Christ is God" (1 Cor 11:3). Thus one who
      venerates the divinity and humanity of Christ is said to anoint his head
      and feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, we can take the head as indicating the very person of Christ,
      according to: "He has made him the head over all things for the church"
      (Eph 1:22). Then the feet are Christ's faithful, of whom we read: "As you
      did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me" (Matt
      25:40); "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings
      good tidings, who publishes peace" (Is 52:7). Thus, one who honors Christ
      himself, anoints the head of Christ; and one who serves his faithful
      anoints our Lord's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, because the hair is produced from what is superfluous in the body,
      one dries the Lord's feet with his hair when he takes what he has in
      surplus and relieves the needs of his neighbor: "Give that which remains
      as alms" [Lk 11:41]. Thus Augustine says: "If you have a surplus of
      anything, give it to the poor and you have dried the feet of the Lord."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment
      signifies that because of the works of justice, the Church enjoys and is
      filled with a good name: "We are the aroma of Christ" (2 Cor 2:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      1600 Next (v 40), the Evangelist describes the traitor's indignation at
      this. He does two things concerning it: first, he shows his indignation;
      secondly, how it was curbed (v 7). Concerning the first he does three
      things: first, he describes the traitor; secondly, he mentions what he
      said; and thirdly, he states that his intention was evil (v 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      1601 The traitor is portrayed in three ways. First, his dignity is given
      when he says, <b>one of his disciples</b>. This teaches us that no one
      should presume on himself no matter to what dignity he has been raised:
      "His angels he charges with wickedness" [Job 4:18]. Secondly, his name,
      <b>Judas Iscariot</b>. The name "Judas" means "professing," to indicate to
      us that in addition to a way of professing that is virtuous - "Man
      professes with his lips and so is saved" [Rom 10:10] - there is a way of
      professing that is blameworthy and mercenary - "He will profess you,"
      [that is, profess your praises] "when you have done good to him" [Ps
      49:18]. Thirdly, his crime is mentioned, <b>he who was to betray him</b>:
      "Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted
      his heel against me" (Ps 41:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      1602 Then he gives the traitor's words, from which we see that he had died
      spiritually from the aroma of the ointment, according to: "For we are the
      aroma of Christto one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a
      fragrance from life to life" (2 Cor 2:15). Judas was displeased because
      the ointment was not sold but poured out as an act of homage to Christ.
      Thus Judas says,
      <b>Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii?</b> But as we
      read in 2 Corinthians (11:14), the ministers of Satan disguise themselves
      as angels of righteousness. Thus Judas hid his evil under the cloak of
      piety, saying, <b>and given to the poor</b>: "His heart will work iniquity
      to practice hypocrisy and speak to the Lord deceitfully" [Is 32:6].
    </p>
    <p>
      1603 The Evangelist unmasks the deceit when he adds,
      <b
        >This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a
        thief</b
      >. For he was not interested in helping the poor - "The hearts of the
      wicked are cruel" [Prv 12:10] - <b>but because he was a thief</b>, and
      accustomed to stealing, he was pained that the use of the ointment had
      deprived him of an opportunity to steal, and it was this avarice that led
      to the betrayal, for we read: "Nothing is more wicked than the covetous
      man" [Sir 10:9]; and "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy"
      (10:10). He had the opportunity to steal for <b>he had the money box</b>,
      that is, he was in charge of our Lord's purse, and
      <b>he used to take what was put into it</b>, i.e., whatever was donated by
      the faithful for Christ's use and for the poor he carried as a duty, but
      carried off as a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      1604 Two things can be noted here. First, that Christ lived on alms as a
      poor person: "As for me, I am poor and needy" (Ps 40:17). Secondly, it is
      not opposed to perfection to keep alms in a money box. Thus what we read
      in Matthew (6:34), "Do not be anxious about tomorrow," does not forbid one
      from saving for tomorrow, since our Lord did this very thing, and he is
      the supreme model of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      1605 One might ask why our Lord, since he knew that Judas was a thief,
      entrusted him with the money box? This can be answered in three ways.
      First, according to Augustine, Christ did this so that his Church would be
      patient when it was robbed; for one is not good if he cannot endure those
      who are evil.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Thus we
      read: "As a lily among brambles, so is my love among maidens" (Song 2:2).
      Secondly, our Lord entrusted him with the money box to lessen his danger
      of final damnation, because he could then satisfy his greed from the money
      box. But as it is said: "He who loves money will not be satisfied with
      money" (Eccl 5:10). Thirdly, according to others, he did this in order to
      teach us that spiritual things should be entrusted to those who are more
      worthy, and temporal things should be entrusted to the less worthy. Thus
      the Apostles said: "It is not right that we should give up preaching the
      word of God to serve tables" (Acts 6:2), and they entrusted this work to
      one of the deacons.
    </p>
    <p>
      1606 But why does it say here that only Judas said this when the ointment
      was poured out, while Matthew says that the disciples said this? One reply
      is that Matthew uses the plural for the singular, as he also did in "Those
      who sought the child's life are dead" (2:20). Or, one might answer that
      Judas was the first to grumble and that this incited the others to say the
      same, although not from the same motive.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p align="center"><b>LECTURE 2</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b
          >7 Jesus said, "Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my
          burial. 8 The poor you always have with you, but you do not always
          have me." 9 When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was
          there, they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see
          Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 10 So the chief priests
          planned to put Lazarus also to death, 11 because on account of him
          many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</b
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      1607 Having narrated the traitor's indignation at the kindness shown by
      the woman, the Evangelist now shows how our Lord put a stop to it. First,
      our Lord answers the unjust criticism Judas spoke against the woman;
      secondly, he rejects the spiritual reason Judas pretended to have (v 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      1608 He says, <b>Let her alone</b>, i.e., do not stop her. For it is well
      known that many good works are done which if our advice had been sought
      before they were done, we would not have advised that they be done,
      because something better could possibly have been done. Yet after they are
      begun, so long as they are good, they should not be stopped. Thus, as
      Chrysostom says, before the woman had poured out the ointment, Jesus would
      perhaps have preferred that it be given to the poor, but now that it was
      done, he held back those who were trying to stop her, saying,
      <b>Let her alone</b>: "Do not prevent one who is able from doing good. If
      you are able, you also do good," as we read in Proverbs [3:27].
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      He adds, <b>let her keep it for the day of my burial</b>, foretelling both
      his approaching death and the kindness this woman was ready to do for him
      in his tomb if he had not precluded it by rising so soon, for as we read
      in Mark's Gospel (16:1): "Mary Magdalene," along with other women, "bought
      spices, so that they might go and anoint him." This is why he said,
      <b>let her keep it for the day of my burial</b>, not the identical
      ointment she used, but ointment of the same kind, in general or
      particular, or even a similar service. It is as though he were saying: Do
      not stop her from doing for me while I am alive what she will be unable to
      do for me when I am dead. For, as I said, she was prevented by the
      resurrection of Christ occurring so quickly. This is expressed in a
      clearer way in Mark (14:8): "She has anointed my body beforehand for
      burying."
    </p>
    <p>
      1609 But did she have foreknowledge of Christ's death? Not at all: for she
      did not understand what she was doing. Rather, she was moved to do it by a
      certain inner urge. It often happens that people are moved to do things
      that they do not understand, as in the case of Caiaphas, the high priest,
      who said, "You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is
      expedient for you that one man should die for the people" (11:49). Things
      of this sort are called presages, because they take place before the
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      1610 Then when he says, <b>the poor you always have with you</b>, he
      rejects the spiritual reason which Judas feigned when he said: "Why was
      this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor."
      Our Lord answered, <b>the poor you always have with you</b>. Here it might
      be remarked that sometimes one should do what is less needful if the
      opportunity remains for doing what is more needful. Thus, although it was
      more needful that this ointment be given to the poor rather than having it
      used to anoint the Lord's feet, nevertheless, because there was still
      opportunity to do the former, since we always have the poor with us, our
      Lord allowed what was less needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the statement that <b>the poor you always have with you</b>, we are led
      to understand the fellowship the rich should have toward the poor: "Make
      yourself companionable to the poor" [Si 4:7].
    </p>
    <p>
      1611 <b>But you do not always have me</b>. Yet we read in Matthew (28:20):
      "I am with you always, to the close of the age." Augustine gives this
      reply. When our Lord said, <b>but you do not always have me</b>, he was
      speaking of his bodily presence, that is, as he appeared and in the form
      in which he would ascend into heaven: "Again, I am leaving the world"
      (16:28).
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> But he is
      always with us as present in his divinity; and he is also present
      sacramentally in the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another explanation would be this. When our Lord said this he was thinking
      of the presence of his divinity. Now some seem to possess Christ
      spiritually, either in the sacrament or in professing the faith; yet they
      will not always possess him because they belong to the Church only
      nominally, and not by merit. These are the servants. But the children will
      always possess him because "the son continues for ever" (8:35). Thus he
      said to Judas, <b>but you do not always have me</b>, because you have made
      yourself unworthy of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Chrysostom says, our Lord was rebuking Judas when he said this: for by
      being annoyed that this respect was shown to Christ, he seemed to consider
      Christ's presence as a burden.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> So
      Christ said, <b>you do not always have me</b>. This was like saying: I am
      a burden to you; but wait awhile, and I will be leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      1612 Next (v 9), the Evangelist shows how Jesus was honored by many of the
      Jews; first, by the crowd that went to see him there; secondly, by the
      crowd which meet him on his way to Jerusalem (v 12). In regard to the
      first he does two things: first, he shows the eagerness of those who came
      to see him; secondly, he shows the vehemence of the Pharisees aroused by
      their envy (v 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      1613 The first part is divided into two parts: first, he states that a
      crowd came to him; secondly, he gives the reason why they came. As to the
      first, he says,
      <b
        >When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they
        came</b
      >, to Bethany. This was in keeping with our Lord's invitation: "Come to
      me, all who labor and are heaven laden, and I will give you rest" (Matt
      11:28). And so, when we know where Jesus is, we should go to him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there were two reasons why they came. The first was to enjoy the sight
      and teaching of Christ. Secondly, they came <b>to see Lazarus</b>. And
      they came to see Lazarus for two reasons. First, because of the
      extraordinary miracle accomplished on Lazarus, that is, his being raised
      back to the living after four days in the tomb; and the people desired to
      see this: "Your works are wonderful, and my soul knows them well," that
      is, it attempts to understand them [Ps 138:14]. Secondly, they came
      because they hoped they would learn something about the other life from
      Lazarus, for man has an inborn desire for knowledge of this kind, in spite
      of what the foolish say: "For they reasoned unsoundly, saying to
      themselves, 'Short and sorrowful is our life, and there is no remedy when
      a man comes to his end, and no one has been known to return from Hades'"
      (Wis 2:1). But here he is! Lazarus, whom he raised from the dead, has
      resumed from the lower world.
    </p>
    <p>
      1614 Then the Evangelist describes the vehemence of the Pharisees in their
      envy, when he says,
      <b>So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death</b>. In this
      they were opposing God: for God had raised him to life, and they wanted to
      kill him: "Running stubbornly against him" (Job 15:26). Then the reason
      for their vehemence is stated, because on account of him many of the Jews
      were going away and believing in Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      1615 But since Christ had cured many people, such as the paralytic and the
      man born blind, why did they want to kill only Lazarus? Chrysostom gives
      four reasons.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
      First, because this miracle was more evident, it was performed before many
      people, and it was absolutely astounding to see a man dead for four days
      walking and speaking. The second reason was that Lazarus was a well-known
      person, while the blind man was unimportant, so much so that they even
      expelled him from the temple. The third reason was because this miracle
      was accomplished near the time of a great feast, and all the Jewish people
      who had come for the feast disregarded the solemnities and went to
      Bethany. The fourth reason was that in the other miracles they could
      accuse Christ of breaking the Sabbath, and in this way alienate the people
      from him; but this time that way was closed. And so because they could
      find no reason to attack Jesus, they attacked Lazarus as the best way to
      conceal the miracle: "Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed
      blood" (Prv 1:16).<br />

    <p align="center"><b>LECTURE 3</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b
          >12 The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard that
          Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 So they took branches of palm trees
          and went out to meet him, crying, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
          the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!" 14 And Jesus found a
          young ass and sat upon it; as it is written, 15 "Fear not, daughter of
          Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on an ass's colt!" 16 His
          disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was
          glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of him and
          had been done to him. 17 The crowd that had been with him when he
          called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore
          witness. 18 The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they
          heard he had done this sign. 19 The Pharisees then said to one
          another, "You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone
          after him.
          <a href="John12.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12"
            >[12]</a
          ></b
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      1616 Here we see the fervor of the crowd which went to meet Christ. First,
      they go to meet Christ; secondly, we have the reaction of the Pharisees (v
      19). Concerning the first the Evangelist does three things: first, he
      mentions their going out; secondly, he tells of our Lord's entrance (v
      14); and thirdly, he states why the crowd went out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      1617 He mentions four things concerning the crowd which went out to the
      Lord. First, the time they went out, <b>the next day</b>, that is, the day
      following the one he meant when he said, "six days before the Passover";
      in other words, the tenth day of the month. This is in keeping with the
      figure in Exodus (12:3), where we read that the Paschal lamb which was to
      be immolated on the fourteenth day in the evening should be procured on
      the tenth day of the month.
    </p>
    <p>
      1618 Secondly, the ones who went out are described,
      <b>a great crowd who had come to the feast</b>. They signify the
      multitudes of the people who would be converted to Christ: "Let the
      assembly of the people be gathered about thee" (Ps 7:7). He says
      <b>to the feast</b>, because believers are converted to Christ so that
      they may come to the feast day of the heavenly Jerusalem: "Many will come
      from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
      kingdom of heaven" (Matt 8:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      1619 Thirdly, the Evangelist mentions their motive for going out, which
      was that they heard that Jesus was coming: he says that they
      <b>heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem</b>. For all the faithful are
      converted to Christ through what they hear about the faith: "Faith comes
      from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ"
      (Rom 10:17); "and the children of Israel heard that the Lord had visited
      the children of Israel; and the peoples believed," as we read in Exodus
      [4:31].
    </p>
    <p>
      1620 Fourthly, he mentions how they conducted themselves. And first of
      all, what they did: <b>they took branches of palm trees</b>. Now the palm,
      since it retains its freshness, signifies victory. Thus in antiquity it
      was conferred upon conquerors as a symbol of their victory. Again, we read
      in Revelation (7:9) of the conquering martyrs that they held "palm
      branches in their hands." And so the branches of palm trees were given as
      praise, signifying victory, because our Lord was to conquer death by dying
      and to triumph over Satan, the prince of death, by the victory of the
      cross. <b>And went out to meet him</b>: "Prepare to meet your God, O
      Israel!" (Amos 4:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      1621 Secondly, the Evangelist mentions what they said:
      <b
        >they shouted out Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
        Lord, the King of Israel!</b
      >
      Here they combine both petition and praise. There is petition when they
      say, <b>Hosanna</b>, that is "Save us, I implore you." It is like saying:
      <i>hosy</i>, which means "save," and <i>anna</i>, which means "implore."
      According to Augustine, this is not a word, but rather an exclamation of
      one praying.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> And
      it is quite proper that they should ask the Lord Jesus for salvation,
      because we read in Isaiah (35:4): "Behold your GodHe will come and save
      you"; "Stir up thy might, and come to save us!" (Ps 80:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      1622 They praise him for two things: for his coming and for the power of
      his reign or kingdom. They praise his coming when they say,
      <b>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord</b>. Note that to bless
      is to speak good things. Now God blesses us in one way, and we bless God
      in another way. For when God blesses us he makes us good, since for God to
      speak is to do: "For he commanded [that is, spoke], and they were created"
      (Ps 148:5). But when we bless God, we profess his goodness: "We bless you
      from the house of the Lord" (Ps 118:26); "Blessed be every one who blesses
      you!" (Gen 27:29). Therefore,
      <b>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord</b>, for Christ worked
      in the name of God, because every thing he did he directed to the glory of
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now because both the Father and the Son are the Lord, the phrase,
      <b>in the name of the Lord</b>, can be understood in two ways. In one way,
      <b>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord</b>, means blessed is
      he who comes in his own name, as Lord: "The Lord is our ruler" (Is 33:22).
      Moses did not come in the name of the Lord in this way, because he came as
      a servant: "Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to
      testify to the things that were to be spoken later" (Heb 3:5). According
      to Augustine, the better interpretation would be to say that
      <b>in the name of the Lord</b> means in the name of the Father.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="" id="_ftnref14"
        >[14]</a
      >
      For Christ's words direct our minds to this: "I have come in my Father's
      name" (5:45). Further, there are two ways in which Christ is said to have
      come in the name of the Father. First, he came as the Son, which implies
      the Father; secondly, he came to manifest the Father: "I have manifested
      thy name to the men whom thou gave me" (17:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      1623 The people praise the power of his reign when they say,
      <b>the King of Israel!</b> Literally, the Jews believed that he had come
      to reign over them temporally, and ransom them from subjection to the
      Romans. That is why they hailed him as a king: "He shall reign as king and
      deal wisely" (Jer 23:5); "Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and
      princes will rule in justice" (Is 32:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      1624 We should note that the above words can be gathered from the Psalms.
      For when the Psalm says, "The stone which the builders rejected" (Ps
      118:22), it then continues on, "Save us, we beseech thee, O Lord!Blessed
      is he who enters in the name of the Lord!" (v 25-26). And there Jerome,
      according to the meaning of the Hebrew, translated hosanna as "blessed."
      But what the people added, <b>the King of Israel</b>, is not in the
      psalms. Instead, the Psalm says: "The Lord is God, and he has given us
      light" (v 27). In saying this, the people, due to their blindness, have
      lessened his praise: for the Psalm praises our Lord as God, but they
      praised him as a temporal king.
    </p>
    <p>
      1625 When the Evangelist says,
      <b>and Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it</b>, he describes our
      Lord's coming: first, he tells how he came; secondly, he mentions a
      prophecy (v 15); and thirdly, he describes the state of mind of the
      disciples in regard to this event (v 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      1626 It should be noted in regard to the first point, that John the
      Evangelist wrote his Gospel after all the others. And so, after carefully
      noting what these had written, he merely summarized what they had already
      mentioned, but filled in what they had omitted. Therefore, since the other
      Evangelists had already told how the Lord sent two of his disciples to
      bring the ass, John contents himself with mentioning briefly that
      <b>Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it should be pointed out that Christ's actions are in a way midway
      between the events of the Old Testament and of the New Testament. Thus the
      crowds praised him, both the one which went before him, and the one which
      followed him, because Christ's actions are the rule and exemplar of the
      things that are done in the New Testament, and they were prefigured by the
      fathers of the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ass is an awkward animal, and signifies the Gentiles. Christ sat
      upon it to signify that he would redeem the Gentiles: "I will give you as
      a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the
      earth" (Is 49:6); "Happy are you who sow beside all waters, who let the
      feet of the ox and the ass range free," that is, thus uniting the Jews and
      the Gentiles in one faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Matthew wrote his Gospel for the Jews, and so he made mention of a
      she-ass. This she-ass signifies the synagogue of the Jews, which was like
      a mother to the Gentiles in spiritual matters, because "out of Zion shall
      go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Is 2:3). The
      other Evangelists, however, wrote their Gospels for the Gentiles, and so
      they mention the young colt of the she-ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      1627 When the Evangelist says,
      <b>as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion!</b> he cites the prophesy
      which was written in Zechariah (9:9). First, he reassures them; secondly,
      he promises a kingly majesty; and thirdly, he adds the benefit which the
      king will bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reassures them when he says, <b>Fear not, daughter of Zion</b>. Zion
      was the fortress in Jerusalem where the king lived. The daughter of Zion,
      therefore, would be the people of Jerusalem and of Judea who were subject
      to the king of Jerusalem. Thus the Jews are being told, <b>Fear not</b>,
      because the Lord is your defender: "Who are you that you are afraid of man
      who dies, of the son of man who is made like grass?" (Is 51:12); "The Lord
      is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" [Ps 27:1]. Here
      the Evangelist is driving out their worldly and servile fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promises them a kingly majesty, saying,
      <b>behold, your king is coming</b>: "For to us a son is given" (Is 9:6);
      "Upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom" (9:7). He says,
      <b>your king</b>, that means, taking flesh from you, for "It is not with
      angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants of Abraham" (Heb
      2:16). Again, <b>your king</b>, that is, for your benefit. Thus he adds,
      <b>is coming</b>, to you: "Would that even today you knew the things that
      make for peace! But now they are hid from your eyes" (Lk 19:42). But when
      they resisted, they hindered their own good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king comes to you, I say, not to harm you, but to set you free; thus
      he adds, <b>sitting on an ass's colt!</b> This signifies the mercy of the
      king, which is most welcome to his subjects: "His throne is upheld by
      mercy" [Prv 20:28]. This is just the opposite to "A king's wrath is like
      the growling of a lion" (Prv 19:12). He is saying in effect: He is not
      coming as a haughty king - Which would make him hateful - but with
      gentleness: "If they make you master of the feast, do not exalt yourself"
      (Sir 32:1). Therefore, have no fear that the king will oppress you. Now
      the Old Law was given in fear, because the Law produced slaves. This
      phrase also signifies the power of the king, because by coming with
      humility and in weakness he attracted the entire world: "The weakness of
      God is stronger than men" (1 Cor 1:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      1628 Then when he says,
      <b>his disciples did not understand this at first</b>, he describes the
      state of mind of the disciples regarding this prophecy. And he admits his
      own ignorance and that of the disciples, for as we read: "The just person
      is the first to accuse himself" [Prv 18:17]. So he says,
      <b>his disciples did not understand this</b>, what was predicted,
      <b>at first</b>, that is, before the passion.
      <b>But when Jesus was glorified</b>, i.e., when he showed the power of his
      resurrection,
      <b
        >then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been
        done to him</b
      >. The reason they knew only after he had been glorified was because it
      was then that they received the power of the Holy Spirit, which made them
      wiser than all the wise: "The breath of the Almighty makes a man
      understand" (Job 32:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      1629 Then he mentions why the crowd went to meet Jesus, which was to bear
      witness. This was done by <b>the crowd that had been with him</b>, at the
      resurrection of Lazarus,
      <b
        >when he called Lazarus out of the tomb The reason why the crowd went to
        meet him was that they heard he had done this sign</b
      >. "For Jews demand signs" (1 Cor 1:22). Now this was a clearer and more
      marvelous sign than the others; thus Christ made it the last in order to
      impress it more forcefully on their memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      1630 Then when the Evangelist says,
      <b>The Pharisees then said to one another</b>, he describes the reaction
      of the Pharisees, who were enraged because their plans had been
      frustrated. Thus they say, <b>You see that you can do nothing</b>. The
      Pharisees said this out of envy, as if to say: "We are not having any
      effect, that is, in our evil intentions; we have failed to check him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why were they maddened at the blind crowd? Because
      <b>the world has gone after him</b> through whom the world was made. This
      was a sign that the whole world would follow him: "We shall live in his
      sight. We shall know and we shall follow the Lord" [Hos 6:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysostom, however, thinks that these words were said by the Pharisees
      who believed, but they were spoken privately for fear of the Jews.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> And
      they said this to stop the persecution of Christ. It is as though they
      were saying: No matter what snares you lay, he will grow in stature and
      his glory will increase. Why then not stop your plotting? This is
      practically the same as the advice of Gamaliel in the Acts (5:34).<br />

    <p>
      1631 Having described the glory Christ received from the helpfulness of
      his friends and from the devotion of the crowd, the Evangelist now
      describes the glory Christ received from the devotion of the Gentiles.
      First, the devotion of the Gentiles is mentioned; secondly, this devotion
      is reported (v 22); and thirdly, we see the prediction of Christ's passion
      (v 23). Concerning the devotion of the Gentiles, two things are set forth:
      first, their devotion to the sacraments of the Old Law; secondly, their
      devotion to Christ (v 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      1632 The devotion of the Gentiles to the sacraments of the Old Testament
      is shown by the fact that they visited the temple. Thus he says,
      <b>Now among those who went up</b>, to Jerusalem,
      <b>to worship at the feast were some Gentiles</b>. He is saying in effect:
      Not just the Jews, but the Gentiles, also, honored Christ. According to a
      Gloss, the reason why they went up to Jerusalem was because they were
      proselytes, who had been converted to the Jewish rite by the preaching of
      those Jews who were scattered throughout the world, and who strove to
      convert whomever they could: "You traverse sea and land to make a single
      proselyte" (Mt 23:15).
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="" id="_ftnref17"
        >[17]</a
      >
      And so, in keeping with the Jewish rite, they went up with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a better reason is given by Chrysostom, namely, that as we read in
      Maccabees (3:2), the temple of God in Jerusalem was held in such esteem by
      all the people and rulers throughout the world that they considered it an
      honor to glorify the temple with the finest gifts.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> And
      so it happened that on the feast days even many Gentiles would go up to
      Jerusalem. An example of this is mentioned in the Acts (8:27), where it
      tells of a eunuch, a minister to Queen Candace of Ethiopia, who had come
      to Jerusalem to worship. Thus Isaiah says: "My house shall be called a
      house of prayer for all peoples" (Is 56:7). The fact that these Gentiles
      came to the temple out of devotion prefigured the conversion of the
      Gentiles to the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      1633 The devotion of the Gentiles to Christ is shown by their desire to
      see him; for the Evangelist says, <b>So these</b>, that is, the Gentiles,
      <b>came to Phillip</b>. Here we should note that Christ personally
      preached only to the Jews: "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to
      the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the
      promises given to the patriarchs" (Rom 15:8); but he preached to the
      Gentiles through the apostles. "And I shall send of them that shall be
      saved to the Gentiles, and they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles"
      [Is 66:19]; "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations" (Mt 28:19).
      This was now being indicated beforehand inasmuch as the Gentiles who
      wanted to see Christ did not come to him first, but to one of his
      disciples, to Philip. And this was fitting, because Philip was the first
      to preach to those who were not of the Jewish rite, namely, to the
      Samaritans, as we see from the Acts (8:5): "Philip went down to the city
      of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was also fitting because of his name: for "Philip" means the "mouth
      of the lantern."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Now
      preachers are the mouth of Christ: "If you utter what is precious, and not
      what is worthless, you shall be as your mouth" (Jer 15:19); and Christ too
      is the lantern: "I have given you as a light to the nations" (Is 42:6). It
      was also appropriate to him because of his home: for Philip
      <b>was from Bethsaida</b>, which means "hunting," and preachers hunt for
      those whom they convert to Christ: "I will send for many hunters, and they
      shall hunt them" (Jer 16:16). Again, it was appropriate because Bethsaida
      was <b>in Galilee</b>, which means "transmigration," and the Gentiles, by
      the preaching of the apostles, were transmigrated from the gods of
      paganism to the state of believers: "Therefore, son of man, prepare for
      yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight," as
      we read in Ezekiel (12:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      These Gentiles approached Philip and expressed their desires, saying,
      <b>we wish to see Jesus</b>. This signifies that those Gentiles who had
      not seen Christ in the flesh but who had been converted to the faith by
      the ministry of the apostles, desired to see him glorified in heaven: "All
      the earth desired to see the face of Solomon" [1 Kgs 10:24].
    </p>
    <p>
      1634 Then when he says,
      <b
        >Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told
        Jesus</b
      >, the news of the Gentiles' devotion is carried to Christ. In this action
      a definite order is being followed, because "the things that are from God
      are set in order" [Rom 13:1]. Now it belongs to the divine order that
      lower things be led back to God through those that are higher, and since
      Andrew outranked Philip among the apostles, because he was converted
      before him, Philip did not wish to bring these Gentiles to Christ by
      himself, but through Andrew, perhaps remembering that the Lord had said:
      "Go nowhere among the Gentiles" (Mt 10:5). And this is what he says,
      <b
        >Phillip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told
        Jesus</b
      >. This teaches us that all things should be done with the advice of those
      in authority. Thus, even Paul went up to Jerusalem and conferred with the
      apostles about the Gospel which he was preaching among the Gentiles (Gal
      2:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, from their names we can gather two things which are necessary
      for preachers if they are to lead others to Christ. The first is clear,
      orderly speech; and this is indicated by Philip's name, which means the
      "mouth of the lantern." The second is virtue, manifested in good actions;
      and this is indicated by Andrew's name, which has the meaning of
      "strength." By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their
      strength by the breath of his mouth" [Ps 33:6].
    </p>
    <p>
      1635 Then, the passion of Christ is foretold: first, Christ foretells that
      the time of his passion is near; secondly, he intimates that his passion
      is necessary (v 24); and thirdly, he mentions the necessity for others to
      suffer (v 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      1636 He says, <b>The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified</b>.
      Here it should be noted that our Lord, seeing these Gentiles hastening to
      see him, and understanding that in them the conversion of the Gentiles was
      somehow beginning, foretold the imminence of his passion, somewhat like a
      person who sees a wheat field growing white says that the hour has come to
      use the sickle for the harvest" (4:35). This is the way the Lord speaks
      here. Since the Gentiles want to see me, he says,
      <b>The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      1637 Now there were three events where he was glorified. First, in his
      passion: "Christ did not exalt [glorify] himself to be made a high
      priest," on the altar of the cross, "but was appointed by him who said to
      him, 'Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee,'" as we read in Hebrews
      (5:5). In reference to this he says,
      <b>The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified</b>, that is, to
      suffer, because the Gentiles will not be converted to him before his
      passion. Indeed, in his passion he was glorified both with visible signs,
      such as the sun becoming dark, the rendering of the temple curtain and so
      forth, and with invisible signs, such as the victory by which in himself
      he overcame the powers of darkness, as stated in Colossians (2:15).
      Earlier he had said, "My hour has not yet come" (2:4), because the
      devotion of the Gentiles had not been as keen as it was now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, he was glorified in his resurrection and ascension. For it was
      necessary for Christ to first rise and ascend into heaven, and thus
      glorified, to send the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, through whom the
      Gentiles were to be converted: "For as yet the Spirit had not been given,
      because Jesus was not yet glorified" (7:39); Christ "ascended to the
      heights: he captured his spoil" [Ps 69:19].
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he was glorified by the conversion of the Gentiles: in
      Philippians [2:11] we read, "Every tongue will confess that the Lord Jesus
      Christ is in the glory of God the Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      1638 Then when he says, <b>I say to you</b>, he intimates the necessity of
      his passion: first, he suggests its necessity; secondly the benefit it
      brings (v 24b).
    </p>
    <p>
      1639 The necessity for Christ's passion is caused by the conversion of the
      Gentiles, which cannot take place unless the Son of man is glorified
      through his passion and resurrection. And this is what he asserts,
      <b
        >Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the
        earth and dies, it remains alone</b
      >. In regard to the literal sense of this text, it should be noted that we
      use a grain of wheat either for bread or as a seed. In this text, we
      should understand that the wheat is taken as a seed, and not as the wheat
      used for bread, for in the latter case it would never grow and bear fruit.
      He says, <b>dies</b>, not because it loses its strength, but because it is
      then changed into something else: "What you sow does not come to life
      unless it dies" (1 Cor 15:36). Now just as the word of God, so far as it
      is clothed in a sound that can be heard, is a seed planted in a person's
      soul to produce the fruit of good works - "The seed is the word of God"
      (Lk 8:11) - so the Word of God, clothed in flesh, is a seed sent into the
      world to bring forth a great harvest; thus it is also compared to a grain
      of mustard seed, in Matthew (13:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      So Christ is saying: I have come as a seed, to bear fruit; and so I truly
      say to you,
      <b
        >unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains
        alone</b
      >, that is, unless I die, the fruit of the conversion of the Gentiles will
      not follow. He compares himself to a grain of wheat because the reason he
      came was to refresh and nourish our spirits, which is principally done by
      bread made from wheat: "bread to strengthen man's heart" (Ps 104:15); "The
      bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh" (6:51).
    </p>
    <p>
      1640 But were the Gentiles to be converted only through the death of
      Christ? Considering God's power, they could have been converted without
      it; but according to God's decree they were to be converted through the
      death of Christ as the more fitting way: "Without the shedding of blood
      there is no forgiveness of sins," as is said in Hebrews (9:22); "if I do
      not go away, the Counselor will not come to you" (16:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      1641 The benefit produced by Christ's passion is given when he says,
      <b>but if it dies, it bears much fruit</b>. He is saying in effect: Unless
      this seed falls into the earth by the humiliation of the passion - "He
      humbled himself and became obedient unto death" (Phil 2:8) - there is no
      benefit, because <b>it remains alone. But if it dies</b>, that is, is put
      to death and slain by the Jews, <b>it bears much fruit</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these fruits is the remission of sin: "This is all the fruit,
      that sin is taken away" [Is 27:9]. Truly, this fruit was brought forth by
      the passion of Christ: "For Christ also died for sins once for all, the
      righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God" (1 Pet
      3:18). The second of these fruits is the conversion of the Gentiles to
      God: "I appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your
      fruit should abide" (15:16). This fruit, too, was brought forth by the
      passion of Christ: "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw
      all men to myself" (12:32). A third fruit is the fruit of glory: "The
      fruit of good labors is renowned [i.e., glorious]" (Wis 3:15); "He who
      reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life" (4:36). And
      again, the passion of Christ produced this fruit: "We have confidence to
      enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way which
      he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh" (Heb
      10:19-20).
    </p>
    <p>
      1642 Then he mentions the necessity for others to die, those who expose
      themselves to suffering for the love of Christ. First, he states the
      necessity for their death; secondly, he encourages us to do this (v 26).
      Concerning the first he does two things: first, he states the necessity of
      dying for the sake of Christ; secondly, he mentions the benefit this death
      brings (v 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      1643 Now every one, as a matter of fact, loves his own life, but some love
      it absolutely, without qualification, and others love it partially, in a
      qualified way. To love someone is to will good to that person; so, to love
      one's own life is to will good to it. Therefore, one who wills what is
      good without qualification to his own life, loves it unqualifiedly; while
      one who wills his life some partial good loves it in a qualified way. Now
      the unqualified goods of life are those which make a life good, namely,
      the highest good, which is God. Thus, one who wills the divine and
      spiritual good to his life, loves it unqualifiedly; while one who wills it
      earthly goods, such as riches, honors and pleasures, and things of that
      sort, loves it in a qualified way. "He who loves sin hates his own life"
      [Ps 10:5]; "If you allow your soul to take pleasure in base desire, it
      will make you the laughingstock of your enemies" (Sir 18:31).
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1644 This passage, therefore, can be understood in two ways. In one way,
      as saying, <b>he who loves his life</b>, unqualifiedly, that is, in regard
      to eternal goods, <b>loses it</b>, that is, exposes it to death for
      Christ. But this is not the true sense. Accordingly it means,
      <b>he who loves his life</b>, in a qualified way, that is, in regard to
      temporal goods, <b>loses it</b>, unqualifiedly: "For what will it profit a
      man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?" (Mt 16:26). That
      this is the true meaning is shown from the statement which follows:
      <b>he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life</b>.
      Therefore, <b>he who loves his life</b>, in this world, that is, as to
      worldly goods, <b>loses it</b> as to eternal goods: "Woe to you that laugh
      now, for you shall mourn and weep," as we read in Luke (6:25); "Son,
      remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus
      in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in
      anguish" (Lk 16:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      1645 The benefit produced by this death is asserted when he says,
      <b>and he who hates his life in this world</b>, that is, he who denies his
      own life's present goods, and endures, for God, things that seem evil in
      this world, <b>will keep it for eternal life</b>: "Blessed are those who
      are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
      heaven" (Mt 5:10); "If any one comes to me and does not hate his own
      father and motheryes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple," as
      we read in Luke (14:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that what was said above about the grain of wheat is in keeping with
      this teaching. For just as Christ was sent into the world as a seed that
      was to bear fruit, so whatever temporal goods are given to us in this life
      by God are not given to us as fruit, but rather that by their means we may
      obtain the fruit of an eternal reward. Indeed, our very life is a temporal
      gift from God to us. Therefore, anyone who exposes it for Christ bears
      much fruit. Such a one, therefore, hates his own life, that is, he exposes
      his own life, and sows, for the sake of Christ, to gain life everlasting:
      "He that goes forth weeping, bearing seed for sowing, shall come home with
      shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him" (Ps 126:6). And the same is
      true of those who risk their wealth and other goods for the sake of
      Christ, and share them with others, to obtain life everlasting: "He who
      sows bountifully will also reap bountifully" (2 Cor 9:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      1646 Now because it seems difficult for one to hate his own life, our Lord
      encourages us to do this, saying,
      <b>If any one serves me, he must follow me</b>. First, his encouragement
      is given; secondly, the reason for this encouragement (v 26b).
    </p>
    <p>
      1647 In regard to the first he does three things. First, he describes his
      faithful; secondly, he urges them to imitate him; thirdly, he indicates
      the reward of those who imitate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe, in regard to the first, the dignity of Christ's faithful, for
      they are the ministers or servants of Christ: "Are they ministers of
      Christ? So am I" [2 Cor 11:23]. Thus, those serve Christ who seek the
      things of Christ; but those who seek their own advantage are not servants
      of Christ, but servants of themselves: "They all seek after their own
      interests, not those of Jesus Christ" (Phil 2:21). Priests are servants
      inasmuch as they administer the sacraments to the faithful: "This is how
      one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries
      of God" (1 Cor 4:1). Again, every one of the faithful who keeps the
      commandments of Christ is his servant: "Let us act in all circumstances as
      God's ministers" [2 Cor 6:4].
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the second, observe the glory and grandeur of the faithful of
      Christ, for he says, <b>he must follow me</b>. This is like saying: We
      follow our masters, whom we serve. Therefore,
      <b>If anyone serves me, he must follow me</b>, so that just as I undergo
      death so that I might bear much fruit, so also my servant. Now to follow
      Christ is a great glory: "It is a great glory to follow the Lord" [Sir
      23:38]; "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me"
      (10:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the third, note the beatitude of the faithful, for
      <b>where I am</b>, not only in the place, but also as regards the sharing
      of glory, <b>there shall my servant be also</b>: "Wherever the body is,
      there the eagles will be gathered together" (Mt 24:28); "He who conquers,
      I will grant him to sit with me on my throne" (Rev 3:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      1648 The reason for this encouragement is given when he says,
      <b>if any one serves me, the Father will honor him</b>, for the Father
      honors anyone who serves Christ. Now above we have read: "that all may
      honor the Son, even as they honor the Father" (5:23). Thus, it is the same
      to honor the Son and to honor the Father. But the Father says, "Those who
      honor me, I will honor" (1 Sam 2:31). Thus, the Father of Jesus will honor
      one who ministers to Jesus, not seeking his own, but the things of Jesus
      Christ. Jesus did not say, "I will honor him," but
      <b>the Father will honor him</b>, because these people did not think at
      this time that he was equal to the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, it might be said that Jesus said this to show how intimately his
      servants are related to him, inasmuch as they will be honored by the same
      one who honors the Son. For the honor the Son has by his nature, they will
      have by grace. So Augustine says: "An adopted son can receive no greater
      honor than to be where the only Son is."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a> "For
      those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of
      his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren"
      (Rom 8:29).<br />

          heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has

          ruler of this world be cast out; 32 and I, when I am lifted up from

          what death he was to die.

      1649 Above, we saw the glory shown to Christ by various types of people;
      here the Evangelist considers the glory shown to Christ by God. First, he
      mentions that Christ asked for glory; secondly, the promise of glory is
      made (v 28b). Concerning the first he does two things. First, the interior
      state of Christ is given; secondly, he mentions the request made by
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      1650 Note, in regard to the first, that it seems incongruous for Christ to
      be saying, <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>, for he had urged his faithful
      to hate their own lives in this world; but with his own death near at
      hand, we hear the Lord himself saying, <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>.
      This leads Augustine to say: "O Lord, You command my soul to follow. But I
      see your own soul troubled. What support shall I seek, if the rock
      crumbles?"
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a> Thus
      we must first examine this troubled state of Christ, and secondly, why he
      willed to undergo it.
    </p>
    <p>
      1651 As to the first, we should note that, properly speaking, a thing is
      said to be troubled when it is greatly agitated. Hence when the sea is
      very agitated it is said to be troubled. And so whenever a thing oversteps
      the bounds of its repose and tranquility, it is said to be troubled. Now
      in the human soul there is a sentient area and a rational area. The
      sensitive area of the soul is troubled when it becomes strongly affected
      by certain movements. For example, when it is contracted by fear, raised
      up by hope, dilated by joy, or otherwise affected by one or other of the
      emotions. Sometimes this perturbation remains within the bounds of reason,
      and sometimes it exceeds the bounds or reason, namely, when the reason
      itself is troubled. And although this latter condition quite often occurs
      in us, it is not found in Christ, since he is the Wisdom of the Father.
      Indeed, it is not found in any wise person; thus the Stoic tenet that one
      who is wise is not troubled, that is, in his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the meaning of <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>, is this: My
      soul is affected by the emotions of fear and sadness in its sentient part;
      but these emotions do not trouble my reason, and it does not abandon its
      own order. "He began to be greatly distressed and troubled" (Mk 14:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      Such emotions, however, exist in us otherwise than in Christ. In us, they
      arise from necessity, insofar as we are moved and affected from without,
      as it were. But in Christ, they are not from necessity, but from the
      command of reason, since there was never any emotion in him except that
      which he himself aroused. For in Christ the lower powers were subject to
      his reason so perfectly that they could not act or undergo anything except
      what reason appointed for them. Thus as was said above [11:33]: "he was
      deeply moved in spirit and troubled himself"; "You have moved the earth,"
      that is, human nature, "and troubled it" [Ps 59:4]. And so the soul of
      Christ was troubled in such a way that its perturbation was not opposed to
      reason, but according to the order of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      1652 In regard to the second point, note that Christ willed to be troubled
      for two reasons. First, to show us a doctrine of the faith, that is, the
      truth of his human nature. Accordingly, as his passion was drawing near,
      he did everything in a human way. Secondly, he wanted to be an example for
      us. For if he had remained unmoved and had felt no emotions in his soul,
      he would not have been a satisfactory example of how we should face death.
      And so he willed to be troubled in order that when we are troubled at the
      prospect of death, we will not refuse to endure it, we will not run away:
      "For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our
      weakness, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet
      without sinning" (Heb 4:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      1653 The relationship of this with what came before is clear. He
      encouraged his disciples to suffer when he said: "He who hates his life in
      this world will keep it for eternal life." But some might say to him:
      "Lord, you can calmly discuss and philosophize about death because you are
      above human sorrows, and death does not trouble you." It was to counter
      this that he willed to be troubled. This disturbance in Christ was
      natural: for just as the soul naturally loves union with its body, so it
      naturally shrinks separation from it, especially since the reason of
      Christ allowed his soul and its inferior powers to act in their own proper
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      1654 Again, when he said, <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>, he refuted the
      error of Arius and Apollinaris. For they said that Christ did not have a
      soul, and in place of his soul they substituted the Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      1655 Then our Lord makes his petition for glory, saying,
      <b>And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour</b> [understood
      here not as a question, but as a petition]. Here our Lord takes upon
      himself the emotions of one who is troubled. And acting as one troubled,
      he does four things in his petition. First, he poses a question, as one
      does when deliberating about what is to be done; secondly, he makes a
      request which arises from a certain inclination; thirdly, he rejects this
      inclination for a particular reason; and fourthly, he makes another
      request that arises from a different inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      1656 He poses this question as one does when in doubt, because it is
      natural to deliberate about what to do when one is perplexed. So the
      Philosopher says in his <i>Rhetoric</i> that fear makes a person take
      counsel.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> Thus,
      after mentioning that he is troubled, Christ at once adds,
      <b>And what shall I say?</b> It is the same as saying: "What shall I do in
      my trouble." Something like this is met in Psalm 55 (v 5): "Fear and
      trembling came upon me," and then follows, "O that I had wings like a
      dove! I would fly away and be at rest." For both the perplexed and the
      emotionally disturbed are weighed down and look for help to relieve
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      1657 He makes his petition, arising from a certain inclination, because
      when one is hesitant about what he should do, he ought to turn to God: "We
      do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee" (2 Chron 20:12); "I
      have lifted up my eyes to the mountains from whence help will come to me"
      [Ps 120:1]. And so, turning to the Father, he says, <b>Father save me</b>,
      that is, from the sufferings which await me at the hour of my passion:
      "Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck" (Ps 69:1).
      According to Augustine, what our Lord says here -
      <b>Now is my soul troubled</b> and <b>Father, save me</b> - is the same as
      what he says in Matthew (26:38): "My soul is very sorrowful, even to
      death."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1658 Note that this petition is not made as though it arose from the
      inclination of reason; rather, reason is speaking as an advocate of the
      natural inclination not to die. And so in this petition reason is pointing
      out the impulse of a natural inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explanation solves a question which is frequently raised. For we
      read: "In all things he was heard for his reverence" [Heb 5:7]; and yet in
      this case, Christ was not heard. The answer to this is that Christ was
      heard in those matters in which his petition came from reason itself and
      which he intended to be granted. But the petition he made here did not
      come from reason, nor was it intended to be granted, rather, it expressed
      a natural inclination. Thus Chrysostom reads it as a question, that is,
      as: <b>And what shall I say?</b> Shall I say,
      <b>Father, save me from this hour?</b> It is the same as saying: "No! I
      will not say this."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1659 Yet Christ rejects this petition, which arose from an inclination of
      the natural appetite, when he says,
      <b>No, for this purpose I have come to this hour</b>. It is the same as
      saying: It is not right that I be freed from this time of suffering,
      because I came to suffer; and not as compelled by the necessity of fate or
      forced by the violence of me, but by willingly offering myself: "He was
      offered because it was his own will" [Is 53:7]; "No ones take it," my
      life, "from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (10:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      1660 Now his reason proposes its own petition when he says,
      <b>Father, glorify thy name. Thy name</b> can be understood in two ways.
      First, it can mean the Son himself. For a name (<i>nomen</i>) - which
      comes from the word for knowledge or being known (<i>notitia</i>) - is
      like a sign (<i>notamen</i>). Thus a name is what manifests a thing. Now
      the Son manifests the Father: "FatherI have manifested thy name" (17:6).
      We read of this name: "Behold, the name of the Lord comes from far" (Is
      30:27). So the meaning in this: <b>Father, glorify thy name</b>, that is,
      your Son: "And now, Father, glorify thou me in thy own presence with the
      glory which I had with thee before the world was made" (17:5). Or, the
      name of the Lord indicates the knowledge which men have of the Father,
      then the meaning is, <b>Father, glorify thy name</b>, that is, do what is
      for the glory of your name. Yet it comes to the same thing, because when
      the Son is glorified the name of the Father is glorified. He says this
      because the Son was going to be glorified by his passion: "He became
      obedient," to the Father, "unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore,
      God has highly exalted him" (Phil 2:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      He is saying here in effect: By the desire of nature I ask to be saved,
      but my reason asks that your name be glorified, that is, that the Son
      suffer, because it was by the passion of Christ that men were to receive
      their knowledge of God and glorify him. For before the passion God was
      known only in Judea, and his name was great in Israel; but after the
      passion, God's name was glorified even among the Gentiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      1661 Then when the Evangelist says, <b>Then a voice came from heaven</b>,
      the promise of glory is given. First, the voice promising glory is heard;
      secondly, the crowd expresses its opinion (v 29); lastly, the meaning of
      the voice is explained (v 30).
    </p>
    <p>
      1662 With regard to the first, he says,
      <b>Then a voice came from heaven</b>. This is the voice of God the Father.
      It was the same voice that was heard when Christ was baptized, "This is my
      beloved Son" (Mt 3:17), and at his transfiguration (Mt 17:5). Although
      every voice of this kind was formed by the power of the entire Trinity,
      this was specifically formed to represent the person of the Father; thus
      it is referred to as the voice of the Father. In a similar manner the dove
      was formed by the entire Trinity to signify the person of the Holy Spirit.
      And again, the body of Christ was formed by the entire Trinity, but
      specifically assumed by the person of the Word because it had been formed
      to be united to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This voice, then, does two things. First, it reveals the past, when
      saying, <b>I have glorified it</b>, that is, I have begotten you as
      glorious from all eternity, because the Son is a certain glory and
      splendor of the Father: "For she [Wisdom] is a reflection of eternal
      light, a spotless mirror of the working of God" (Wis 7:26); "He reflects
      the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature" (Heb 1:3). Or,
      <b>I have glorified it</b> at your birth, when the angels sang: "Glory to
      God in the highest" (Lk 2:14) and in the miracles the Father performed
      through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, the voice foretells what is to come:
      <b>and I will glorify it again</b>, in the passion, in which Christ
      triumphed over the devil, and in the resurrection and the ascension, and
      in the conversion of all the world: "The God of Abraham and of Isaac and
      of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his Son Jesus" [Acts 3:13].
    </p>
    <p>
      1663 Next we see the opinion of the crowd, which was wondering about the
      voice, <b>The crowd standing by heard it and said</b>. In this crowd, as
      in every other, some were dull and slow to understand, and others were
      more perceptive; yet all of them failed to identify the voice. Those who
      were slow and carnal only heard it as a sound; so they said
      <b>that it had thundered</b>. Still, they were not entirely mistaken, for
      the Lord's voice was thunder, both because it had an extraordinary
      meaning, and because it contained very great things: "How small a whisper
      do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?" (Job
      26:14); "The voice of your thunder" [Ps 76:19].
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who were keener discerned that the sound was a voice, pronouncing
      words and having a meaning; so they said someone was speaking. But because
      they thought that Christ was merely human they erred, attributing these
      words to an angel. So they said that, <b>An angel has spoken to him</b>.
      They were under the same error as the devil, who thought that Christ
      needed the help of the angels: thus he said: "He will give his angels
      charge of you" (Mt 4:6). But he did not need to be guarded and helped by
      angels; rather, he is the one who glorifies and guards the angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      1664 The voice is explained when he says, <b>Jesus answered</b>. First, he
      explains the voice; secondly, he mentions the answer given by the people
      (v 34); and thirdly, our Lord's answer (v 35). He does two things about
      the first: first he mentions the reason for the voice; and secondly, he
      adds its meaning (v 31).
    </p>
    <p>
      1665 It should be noted in regard to the first that they had said,
      <b>An angel has spoken to him</b>. Now an angel speaks by revealing
      something that will profit the one to whom he speaks, as is clear in
      Revelation (ch 1) and in Ezekiel (ch 1). And so to show that he did not
      need this voice or any revelation from an angel, our Lord says,
      <b>This voice has come for your sake, not for mine</b>, that is, it has
      not come to instruct me. For this voice mentioned nothing he did no know
      before, because "in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of
      knowledge" (Col 2:2), so that he knew all that the Father knew. But
      <b>it has come for your sake</b>, that is, for your instruction. From this
      we can understand that many things relating to Christ were, in God's plan,
      allowed to take place not because Christ needed them, but for our sakes:
      "For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction"
      (Rom 15:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      1666 He says, <b>Now is the judgment of this world</b>, he states the
      meaning of this voice. First, he mentions the judgment by which he would
      be glorified; secondly, the effect of this judgment (v 31b); and thirdly,
      the way he will be glorified (v 32).
    </p>
    <p>
      1667 He says, <b>Now is the judgment of this world</b>. But if this is
      true, why do we expect that our Lord will come again to judge? The answer
      is that now he comes to judge with a judgment of distinction or
      discernment, by which he discerns his own from those who are not his: "For
      judgment I came into this world" (9:39). This is what he is speaking of
      when he says, <b>Now is the judgment of this world</b>. But he will come
      again to judge with the judgment of condemnation, for which he did not
      come the first time: "For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn
      the world, but that the world might be saved through him" (3:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, we might say that there are two kinds of judgment. One is that which
      condemns the world; and this is not referred to here. The other is the
      judgment which will be in favor of the world, insofar as the world is set
      free from servitude to the devil. This is the way the Psalm is understood:
      "O Lord! Judge those who wrong me; overthrow those who fight against me"
      [Ps 34:1]. But this judgment and the judgment of distinction are the same,
      because by the very fact that the judgment is in favor of the world by
      casting out the devil, the good are distinguished from the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      1668 The effect of this judgment is the casting out of the devil. So he
      says, <b>now shall the ruler of this world be cast out</b>, by the power
      of the passion of Christ. Thus the passion of Christ is his glorification;
      and this explains what he had said,
      <b
        >I will glorify it, insofar as the ruler of this world shall be cast
        out</b
      >, since Christ has the victory over the devil by his passion. "The reason
      the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil" (1 Jn 3:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      1669 A difficulty arises here on three points. First, because he says that
      the devil is the ruler or prince of this world. It was this that led the
      Manicheans to call him the creator and lord of everything that was
      visible. The answer is that the devil is called the ruler of this world
      not by a natural right, but by usurpation, insofar as worldly people,
      rejecting the true Lord, subject themselves to him: "The god of this world
      has blinded the minds of the unbelievers" (2 Cor 4:4). Thus, he is the
      ruler of this world insofar as he rules those who are worldly, as St.
      Augustine says, and these are spread throughout the entire world.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a> For
      the word "world" is sometimes taken in a pejorative sense to mean those
      who love the world: "The world knew him not" (1:10). Yet sometimes it is
      taken in a good sense to indicate those who are good and live in the world
      in such a way that they are citizens of heaven: "God was in Christ
      reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor 5:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      1670 The second difficulty concerns the fact that the ruler of this world
      is said to be cast out. For if he had truly been cast out, he would not
      longer tempt us now as he did before; yet he continues to tempt us.
      Therefore, he was not cast out. Augustine answers this by saying that
      although the devil may tempt those who have ceased to be of the world, he
      does not tempt them in the same way as he did before. For before he
      tempted and ruled them from within, but now he does so only from without.
      For as long as men are in sin, he rules and tempts them from within: "Let
      not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their
      passions" (Rom 6:12). And so he was cast out because the effect of sin in
      man is not [now] from within but from without.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1671 Thirdly, there is a difficulty from the fact that he says,
      <b>now shall the ruler of this world be cast out</b>. For it seems to
      follow from this that he had not been cast out before the passion of
      Christ, and consequently, if he is cast out only when men are set free
      from sin, it seems that Abraham, Isaac and the other men of the Old
      Testament were not set free from sin. The answer, according to Augustine,
      is that before the passion of Christ he had been cast out of individual
      persons, but not from the world, as he was to be later.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a> For
      what formerly took place in only a few men, but now happens in many Jews
      and Gentiles who have converted to Christ, is recognized to have been
      accomplished by the passion of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, it might be said that the devil is cast out by the fact that men are
      set free from sin; but before the passion of Christ all the just had been
      set free from sin, although not entirely, because they were still kept
      from entering the kingdom. In this respect, therefore, the devil had some
      right over them which was entirely taken away by the passion of Christ,
      when the fiery sword was removed, when Christ said to the man: "Today you
      will be with me in Paradise" (23:43).
    </p>
    <p>
      1672 The form or manner of this passion would be by being lifted up; thus
      he says,
      <b
        >and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men [all
        things] to myself</b
      >. In regard to this, Chrysostom has the following example: If a tyrant,
      accustomed to oppress and rage against his subjects and cast them into
      chains, were in his madness to treat in the same way some one who was not
      subject to him and cast him into the same prison, then he would deserve
      that even his dominion over the others be taken from him.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> This
      is what Christ did against the devil. For the devil had some right over
      men because of the sin of the first parent; and so in some sense he could
      justly rage against them. But since he dared to try the same things with
      Christ, over whom he had no right, assailing him in whom he had no part,
      as the tempter, it was fitting that he be deprived of his dominion by the
      death of Christ.
      <b
        >And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to
        myself</b
      >. First, he describes the manner of his death; secondly, the Evangelist
      explains it, saying,
      <b>he said this to show by what death he was to die</b>, for he would die
      by being lifted up on the wood of the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      1673 Here we should note that there are two reasons why the Lord willed to
      die the death of the cross. First, because it is a shameful death: "Let us
      condemn him to a shameful death" (Wis 2:20). So Augustine says: "The Lord
      willed to die in this way so that not even a shameful death would keep a
      person from the perfection of righteousness."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, because such a death involves a lifting up; so our Lord says,
      <b>when I am lifted up</b>. Such a manner of death was in harmony with the
      fruit, the reason and the symbol of the passion. It was in harmony with
      its fruit, because it was by the passion that Christ was to be lifted up,
      exalted: "He became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore
      God has highly exalted him" (Phil 2:8). Thus the Psalmist said: "Be
      exalted, O Lord, in thy strength!" (Ps 2:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      It harmonized with the reason for the passion, and in two ways: both with
      respect to men and with respect to the devil. With respect to me, because
      he died for their salvation. For they had perished, because they were cast
      down and sunk in earthly things: "they have set their eyes bowing down to
      the earth" [Ps 16:11]. Thus he willed to die raised up in order to lift
      our hearts up to heavenly things. For in this way he is our way into
      heaven. With respect to the devils, it was fitting in the sense that those
      who exercised their principality and power in the air were trod under foot
      by him while he was raised in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it harmonized with the symbol, because the Lord commanded that a
      bronze serpent be fashioned in the desert, as recorded in Numbers (21:9),
      and above: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must
      the Son of man be lifted up" (3:14). And so thus lifted up
      <b>I will draw all things to myself</b>, through love "I have loved you
      with an everlasting love, therefore have I drawn you, taking pity on you"
      [Jer 31:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the love of God for men appears most clearly in the fact that
      he condescended to die for them: "God shows his love for us in that while
      we were yet sinners Christ died for us," as we read in Romans (5:8). By
      doing this he fulfilled the request of the bride: "Draw me after you, and
      we will run to the aroma of your perfume" [Song 1:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      1674 Here we may note that the Father draws and the Son also draws: "No
      one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (6:44). He
      says here, <b>I will draw all things</b>, in order to show that the same
      action belongs to both of them. And he says, <b>all things</b>, and not
      "all men," because not all men are drawn to the Son.
      <b>I will draw all things</b>, that is, the body and the soul; or all
      types of men, such as Gentiles and Jews, servants and freemen, male and
      female; or, all who are predestined to salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we should note that to draw all things to himself is for Christ
      to cast out the prince of this world, for Christ has no fellowship with
      Belial, nor light with darkness (2 Cor 6:15).<br />

    <p>
      1675 Having mentioned the promised glorification of the Lord and
      explaining the voice, the Evangelist now describes the doubt which
      prevailed among the crowd. First, they introduce the authority of the Law;
      and secondly, they raise a problem based on it (v 34).
    </p>
    <p>
      1676 In regard to the first the Evangelist says,
      <b>The crowd answered him</b>, that is, the Lord, who was speaking of his
      death, <b>We have heard from the law</b>, and law is taken here for the
      entire Old Testament <b>that the Christ remains for ever</b>. This can be
      gathered from many passages of the Old Testament, especially from Isaiah
      (9:7): "Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no
      end"; and in Daniel (7:14): "His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
      which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be
      destroyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      1677 Basing themselves on this authority, they formulate two doubts: one
      concerns a fact, and the other the person. As concerns the fact, they say,
      <b>How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up?</b> But since
      Christ did not say that "the Son of man must be lifted up," but "and I,
      when I am lifted up," why do the Jews say that "the Son of man" must be
      lifted up? The answer to this is that the Jews were now accustomed to our
      Lord's words; thus they remembered that he called himself the Son of man.
      And so when he said, "And I, when I am lifted up," they took it to mean,
      "If the Son of man is lifted up," as Augustine says.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Or,
      one might answer that although Christ did not here mention the Son of man,
      yet earlier he had said: "The Son of man must be lifted up" (3:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      1678 Yet it seems that their statement,
      <b>The Son of man must be lifted up</b>, is in no way opposed to the
      statement that <b>the Christ remains for ever</b>. The answer is that
      since our Lord was accustomed to speak to them in figurative language,
      they understood much of what was said in that way. And so they also
      suspected that when our Lord spoke of being lifted up, he was referring to
      death on the cross: "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will
      know," as we read above (8:28). Or, it could be said that they understood
      it in this sense because they had already thought of doing that very
      thing. Thus it was not the sharpness of their understanding that gave them
      this interpretation of these words, but an awareness of their own
      wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      1679 Note their wickedness, for they do not say: "We have heard from the
      law that the Christ does not suffer," because in many places of the law
      reference is made to his passion and resurrection: as "Like a lamb that is
      led to the slaughter" (Is 53:7); "I have slept and taken my rest: and I
      have risen up" [Ps 3:7]. Rather, they say,
      <b>the Christ remains for ever</b>. The reason for this is that the former
      would not have involved any opposition, since no obstacle to Christ's
      immortality arises from the mere fact of his suffering. In other words, as
      Chrysostom says, they wished to show that he was not the Christ for the
      reason that <b>the Christ remains for ever</b>.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1680 They raise a question concerning his person when they say,
      <b>Who is this Son of man?</b> They ask this because it says in Daniel
      (7:13): "And behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son
      of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days"; and by that Son of man they
      understood the Christ. It is as though they were saying: "You say the Son
      of man must be lifted up; yet the Son of man, whom we take to be the
      Christ, remains forever. So <b>Who is this Son of man?</b> If he does not
      remain for ever, neither is he the Christ." In this they deserve to be
      reprimanded for their dullness, because even though they had seen and
      heard so many great things, they still had doubts about his being the
      Christ: "He who tells a story to a fool tells it to a drowsy man" (Sir
      22:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      1681 Then when he says, <b>Jesus said to them</b>, our Lord somewhat
      settles their doubt. First, he commends the good they had; and secondly,
      he encourages them to make progress (35b); thirdly, he explains his
      admonition (v 36).
    </p>
    <p>
      1682 Jesus said to them, <i>Adhuc modicum lumen in vobis est</i>. This can
      be understood in two ways. In one way, according to Augustine, so that
      "little" modifies "light."
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a> As if
      to say: "A little light is in you," insofar as it sees that the Christ
      remains for ever. For this is a truth, and every manifestation of the
      truth is a light infused by God. Yet this light which is in you is
      "little," because even though you recognize the eternity of the Christ,
      you do not believe in his death and resurrection. This shows that you do
      not have perfect faith. Thus, what was said to Peter applies also to them:
      "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?" (Mt 14:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is understood in another way by Chrysostom, as meaning that
      <b>the light is with you for a little longer</b> time, that is, I, who am
      the light.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a> It is
      the same as saying: I, the light, am among you for a brief time: "A little
      while, and you will see me no more" (16:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      1683 And so he exhorts them to make progress in good. First, he gives his
      exhortation; secondly, he shows the danger threatening them unless they do
      make progress (v 35b).
    </p>
    <p>
      1684 He says: I say that you have a little light, but while you have it,
      <b>walk</b>, that is, move forward and make progress, so that you may
      understand that the Christ, in addition to his eternity, will also die and
      rise again. This is in keeping with the first explanation given above. Or,
      <b>Walk while you have the light</b>, that is, while I am among you, make
      progress and be concerned with possessing me in such a way as never to
      lose me: "Blessed are the peopleO Lord, who walk in the light of thy
      countenance" (Ps 89:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      And do this <b>lest the darkness</b> of unbelief, ignorance and eternal
      damnation <b>overtake you</b> and prevent you from going any further. For
      a person is overtaken by darkness when he is totally sunk in unbelief; and
      they would be this way if they believed in the eternity of the Christ in
      such a way as to deny the humiliation of his death: "A man whose way is
      hid" (Job 3:23); "We are wrapped up in darkness" (Job 37:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      1685 The danger threatening them unless they do progress is mentioned when
      he says, <b>he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes</b>.
      For light, whether exterior or interior, directs man. Exterior light
      directs him as to external bodily acts, while the interior light directs
      his will. One, therefore, who does not walk in the light, not perfectly
      believing in Christ,
      <b>but walks in the darkness, does not know where he goes</b>, that is, to
      what goal he is being led. As we read in the Psalm (82:5): "They have
      neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness." This is
      what happened to the Jews because they did not know what they were doing,
      but as people who were walking in the darkness they thought they were on
      the right road. And so they displeased God in the very things in which
      they believed they were pleasing him. Similarly, in the very things in
      which erring heretics believe they merit the light of truth and grace is
      the source of their being deprived of it: "There is a way which seems
      right to a man, but its end is the way to death" (Prv 14:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      1686 Then when he says,
      <b>While you have the light, believe in the light</b>, he explains what he
      said, namely, what it means to walk. This is explained in two ways,
      according to the two explanations given above. According to the first
      explanation: <b>While you have the light</b>, that is, while you have some
      knowledge and light of the truth, <b>believe in the light</b>, that is, in
      the complete truth, <b>that you may become sons of light</b>, that is,
      that you may be reborn in the truth: "We are not of the night or of
      darkness. So then let us not sleep" (1 Thess 5:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, according to the other explanation: <b>While you have the light</b>,
      that is, me who am the light - "He was the true light which enlightens
      every man who comes into the world" [1:9] - <b>believe in the light</b>,
      that is, in me. In other words, make progress in the knowledge of me,
      <b>that you may become sons of light</b>, because from the fact that you
      believe in me you will be the children of God: "But to all who receive
      him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God"
      (1:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      1687
      <b>When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them</b>.
      Here the Evangelist tells what Jesus did, that he hid himself. When we
      read above (8:59) that Christ did this very thing, the reason was obvious,
      for they were taking stones to cast at him. But here there is no reason
      for his hiding given, such as that they took up stones or that they
      blasphemed him. Why then did he hide? The answer is that our Lord, seeing
      into their hearts, knew their rage and the evil they had planned, i.e., to
      kill him. And so in his desire to stop them he did not wait for them to
      act, but hid himself so their anger and envy would abate. In doing this he
      is an example to us that when the evil purposes of others are clear to us,
      we should flee before they can accomplish them. In addition, our Lord was
      showing by his actions what he had said by his words. For he just said,
      <b>Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you</b>. And
      by hiding himself he indicated what sort of darkness he means: "I will
      wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob" (Is
      8:17).<br />

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      1688 Above, the Evangelist gave many examples of Christ's glory, because
      of which the Jews sought to kill him out of envy. Now he deals with
      another of the occasions surrounding his passion, that is, the unbelief of
      the Jews. First, their unbelief is discussed; in the second place, it is
      reproved by our Lord (v 44). Concerning the first he does two things:
      first, he reproves the unbelief of those who believed, but in secret (v
      42). As to the first, two things are done: first, he mentions the strange
      hardness of their unbelief; secondly, to show that it came about not
      without reason or by chance, he mentions a prophecy (v 38).
    </p>
    <p>
      1689 The Evangelist, as though at a loss to explain it, says that our Lord
      had done many miracles: such as changing water into wine, curing a
      paralytic, giving sight to a blind man, and raising a dead man to life:
      nevertheless,
      <b
        >though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe
        in him</b
      >. They usually said: "What sign do you do, that we may see, and believe
      you?" (6:30). But now! The Evangelist says:
      <b
        >though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe
        in him</b
      >. "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they
      would not have sin" (15:24). And so they could not say: "We do not see our
      signs" (Ps 74:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      1690 Then (v 38), the testimony of the prophet on this point is cited.
      First, the prophecies are mentioned; secondly, it is shown that they refer
      to Christ (v 41). He does two things about the first: he cites the
      prophecy foretelling their unbelief; secondly, he adds the prophecy
      foretelling the reason for their unbelief (v 39).
    </p>
    <p>
      1691 He says: I say that they did not believe in him
      <b>that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled</b>. Here
      we should note that in Sacred Scripture the word "that" sometimes
      indicates a cause, as in "I came that they may have light" (10:10). But at
      other times it just indicates a sequence of events, and signifies a future
      event; and that is how it is used here. These people did not believe, but
      it was not because Isaiah predicted this. Rather, Isaiah predicted this
      because they were not going to believe. And so this saying of Isaiah is
      fulfilled from the fact that they did not believe. "Everything written
      about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be
      fulfilled" (Lk 24:44); "Not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law
      until all is accomplished" (Matt 5:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      1692 But if it was necessary that the saying of Isaiah be fulfilled, it
      seems that the Jews should be excused for not believing, for they could
      not act contrary to the prophecy. I answer that the prophecy took account
      of their freedom. For God, knowing the future beforehand, foretold their
      unbelief in the prophecy, but he did not bring it about; for God does not
      force one to sin just because he already knows one's future sins. And so
      our Lord, from whom nothing is hidden, predicted that the Jews would
      commit the sin which they did commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      1693 Now the Evangelist states what the prophet said,
      <b
        >Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord
        been revealed?</b
      >
      Here we should note that belief comes in two ways. Sometimes by
      instruction from another; and this is the usual way: "So faith comes from
      what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ" (Rom
      10:17). Sometimes it come by a divine revelation; and this is the special
      way, spoken of by the Apostle: "For I did not receive it from man, nor was
      I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ" (Gal 1:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      1694 Isaiah foretold that there would be few believers. First, as to those
      who would believe in the usual way, by instruction, he says,
      <b>Lord, who has believed our report?</b> This can be understood in two
      ways. In one way, the meaning is: <b>who has believed our report?</b> That
      is, what you reported to us, what we have heard from you. "We have heard
      tidings from the Lord" (Obad 1:1); "Let us hear what the Lord will speak"
      (Ps 85:8). It is like they were saying: "Lord, we have heard these things
      from you. But who will believe us when we tell what we have heard from you
      about your birth and passion?" This entire chapter of Isaiah (ch. 53) is
      speaking of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prophets are said to hear in order to suggest the way in which the
      prophets are instructed. By sight, a person receives an immediate
      knowledge of the thing seen, but by hearing he does not have an immediate
      knowledge of what he sees, but he gains his knowledge from certain signs
      of the thing. And so because the prophets did not immediately see the
      divine essence, but only certain signs of divine realties, they are said
      to hear. "If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to
      him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream," by certain signs (Num
      12:6). The Son, however, eternally sees the divine essence itself: "No one
      has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has
      made him known," as was said above (1:18).
      <b>Who has believed our report?</b> That is, who has believed in the
      things we have heard and preached? "What I have heard from the Lord of
      hosts, the God of Israel, I announce to you" (Is 21:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second way of understanding <b>who has believed our report?</b> is to
      take it as meaning the things we report to them, what they have heard from
      us. "They hear what you say but they will not do it" as Ezekiel (33:31)
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      1695 As to the special way belief comes, by revelation, he says,
      <b>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</b> The "arm" refers
      to the Son, through whom the Father does all things, just as we accomplish
      things through our arm. And if we accomplished things only through an
      interior word, then this word would be called our arm. And so the Son is
      called the arm of God not because God the Father has a human shape and a
      physical arm, but because "all things were made through him," the Son
      (1:3). "Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like
      his?" (Job 40:9); "He has shown strength with his arm" (Lk 1:51).
    </p>
    <p>
      1696 Here we should note that Sabellius misunderstood this passage and
      said that the Father and the Son are the same person; and Arius also did
      when he said that the Son is inferior to the Father. The reasons for this
      were that a person and his arm do not form two persons, but only one, and
      an arm is not equal to the person. The answer to this is that in
      expressions of this kind the similarities are not really adequate, for
      what we find in creatures does not perfectly represent what is in God.
      Thus Dionysius says that symbolic theology is not argumentative. Thus the
      Son is not called an arm as though he is the same person as the Father or
      inferior to the Father, but because the Father does all things through
      him. When he says,
      <b>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</b> it is like
      saying, only to a few, that is, to the apostles: "God has revealed to us
      through the Spirit" (1 Cor 2:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      1697 When the Evangelist says, <b>therefore they could not believe</b>, he
      states the prophecy which foretold the reason for their unbelief. If we
      examine these words of the Evangelist they seem, if taken at their surface
      value, difficult to understand. First, because if it is said that
      <b>therefore they could not believe</b>, because Isaiah said this, the
      Jews seem to be excusable. For is it a sin for a person not to do what he
      cannot do? And what is more serious, the fault will be cast back on God,
      since he blinded their eyes. This could be accepted if it were said of the
      devil, as in 2 Corinthians (4:4): "The god of this world has blinded the
      minds of the unbelievers." But here it is said of our Lord, for Isaiah
      [6:1] says: "I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne," and
      follows with "Blind the heart of this people and make their ears heavy,
      and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their
      ears and understand with their heart and be converted and I heal them" [v
      10].
    </p>
    <p>
      1698 To clarify this let us first explain the statement,
      <b>therefore they could not believe</b>. Here we should note that
      something is said to be impossible or said to be necessary in two ways:
      absolutely, and granted a certain presupposition. For example, it is
      absolutely impossible for a human being to be an ass; but granting a
      certain presupposition, it is impossible for me to be outside my house,
      presupposing, that is, that I remain within it sitting down. With this in
      mind, we may say that a person is excused if he does not do things that
      are absolutely impossible for him. But he is not excused if he does not do
      things that are impossible for him granting some presupposition. So, if
      someone has the evil intention of always stealing, and says that it is
      impossible for him not to sin as long as he continues with that intention,
      he is not excused: for this impossibility is not absolute, but based on a
      certain presupposition, for he can abandon his evil intention. So he says,
      <b>therefore they could not believe</b>, that is, because they had a will
      clouded over by their wickedness: "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or
      the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do
      evil" (Jer 13:23); "How can you do good things when you are evil?" [Mt
      12:34]. It is like one saying: "I can in nowise love him, because I hate
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the second point, when we read that God blinds and hardens, we
      should not think that God puts malice into us or forces us to sin; but we
      should understand it as meaning that God does not infuse grace. Now he
      infuses grace because of his mercy, while the cause of his not infusing
      grace is due to us, insofar as there is something in us which opposes
      divine grace. As far as he is concerned: "He enlightens every man coming
      into this world" [1:9]; "He desires all men to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4). But
      because we leave God, he takes his grace from us: "Because you have
      rejected knowledge, I reject you" (Hos 4:6), "Your destruction, O Israel,
      is from yourself; your help is only in me" [Hos 13:9]. It is like a person
      who closes the shutters of his house, and someone says to him: "You cannot
      see because you lack the light of the sun." This would not be due to a
      failure of the sun, but because he shut out the light of the sun. In the
      same way we read here that they could not believe, because God blinded
      them, that is, they were the cause why they were deprived of sight as in
      "Their wickedness blinded them" (Wis 2:21).
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1699 With these distinctions in mind, let us consider the words of this
      prophecy. It is found in Isaiah (6:10), not in these exact words, but with
      the same meaning. Three things are mentioned here: first, the hardening
      and blinding of the Jews; secondly, the effect of each of these; thirdly,
      their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      1700 In regard to the first, note that our Lord brought people to the
      faith in two ways, by his miracles and his teaching. And so he rebukes
      them on both points: "If I had not done among them the works which no one
      else did, they would not have sin" (15:24); and again in (15:22): "If I
      had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they
      have no excuse for their sin." For they had derided both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insofar as they did not give due consideration to Christ's miracles, he
      says, <b>he has blinded their eyes</b>, that is, the eyes of their hearts,
      about which we read: "Having the eyes of your hearts enlightened" (Eph
      1:18). For they should have understood that such miracles could only be
      done by divine power: "You see many things, but do not observe them" (Is
      42:20); and again, "Who is blind but my servant? Or deaf, except he to
      whom I have sent my messengers?" [Is 42:19].
    </p>
    <p>
      Because they were not moved by the teaching of Christ, he adds,
      <b>and hardened their heart</b>. That is very hard which is not melted by
      intense heat nor broken by divine blows. Now the words of Christ are "like
      fireand like a hammer which breaks the rock in pieces" (Jer 23:29). Fire,
      indeed, because they inflame through love; and like a hammer because they
      terrify when they threaten, and break one by the revelation of the truth.
      And still the hearts of the Jews paid no attention to the words of Christ.
      Thus it is obvious that they were hardened: "His heart is hard as a stone"
      (Job 41:24); "He has mercy upon whomever he wills, and he hardens the
      heart of whomever he wills" (Rom 9:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      1701 The effect of their becoming blind is mentioned when he says,
      <b>lest they should see with their eyes</b>, that is, their spiritual
      eyes, and perceive the divinity of Christ: "They have eyes, but do not
      see" (Ps 115:5). In contrast, Luke says: "Blessed are the eyes which see
      what you see!" (Lk 10:23). The effect of their becoming hard of heart is
      mentioned when he says, <b>lest they should perceive</b>, understand,
      <b>with their heart</b>: "Because no one understands, they will perish
      forever" [Job 4:20]; "He would not understand so that he might act well"
      [Ps 35:4]. Here it should be noted that when he says, "lest they should
      see with their eyes and perceive with their heart," that is, "that they
      should not see with their eyes and perceive with their heart," the "that"
      does not indicate a cause, but merely the sequence of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      1702 The end of their becoming blind and hard in heart is given when he
      says, <b>and turn for me to heal them</b>. This can be understood in two
      ways, as Augustine says in his work, <i>On Gospel Questions</i>.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a> In
      one way, so that both parts are negative, and then the meaning would be:
      "and they do not turn to me and I do not heal them." For the way of
      salvation from sin is to turn to God: "Restore us to thyself, O Lord, that
      we may be restored! Renew our days of old!" (Lam 5:21). But to those who
      prove themselves unworthy to have their sins forgiven, God does not offer
      the gifts by which they might turn to him and be healed, as is obvious in
      the case of the non-chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other interpretation is to regard only the first part as negative and
      then the meaning would be: they were blinded and hardened so they should
      not see or understand for a time, and so not seeing or understanding, that
      is, not believing in Christ, they would put him to death, but afterwards
      they would repent and turn to God and be healed. For now and then God
      permits us to fall into sin so that being humbled we may arise firmer in
      holiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these interpretations is verified in the case of some of the Jews:
      the first one in those who persisted to the end in their unbelief, and the
      second one in those who turned to Christ after his passion, namely, those
      with remorse in their hearts at the words of Peter, and who said to the
      apostles: "Brethren, what shall we do?" as we read in the Acts (2:37).
    </p>
    <p>
      1703 Then (v 41), the Evangelist shows that these words of Isaiah apply
      here. He says, <b>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory</b>, the glory
      of God. For when he saw the glory of God he saw at the same time that the
      Jews would be blinded, as is clear from, "I saw the Lord seated on a high
      and lofty throne" [Is 6:1], followed by, "Blind the heart of his people
      and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their
      eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be
      converted, and I heal them" [v 10]. And because it is fitting that one
      should testify about what he has seen - as we read in 1 John (1:1) - he
      adds, <b>and spoke of him</b>, that is, of Christ, whose glory he saw: "To
      him all the prophet bear witness" (Acts 10:43); "Which he promised
      beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures, the gospel
      concerning his Son" (Rom 1:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      1704 We read that Isaiah saw and said these things. As to the first, we
      should avoid the error of the Arians, who say that the Father alone is
      invisible to every creature, but that the Son was seen in the visions of
      the Old Testament. But since it is stated that "He who has seen me has
      seen the Father" (14:9), it is obvious that the Father and the Son are
      visible in one and the same way. And so Isaiah, seeing the glory of the
      Son, also saw the glory of the Father, and indeed of the entire Trinity,
      which is one God, seated upon a high throne before whom the seraphim cry
      out: Holy, Holy, Holy! This does not mean that Isaiah saw the essence of
      the Trinity; rather in an imaginary vision, with understanding, he
      expressed certain signs of this majesty, according to the saying in
      Numbers (12:6): "If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself
      known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      1705 As to the second thing, that Isaiah <b>spoke of him</b>: this
      excludes the error of the Manicheans, who said that there were no
      prophecies about Christ in the Old Testament, as Augustine reports to us
      in his book <i>Against Faustus</i>; and it excludes the error of Theodore
      of Mopsuestia, who said that all the prophecies of the Old Testament bore
      on some current event, but the apostles and evangelists appropriated them
      to the life of Christ, like things said about one event can be
      appropriated to another event.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a> But
      all this is excluded by the statement, <b>and spoke of him</b>, just as
      Christ said of Moses that "he wrote of me" (5:46).<br />

    <p>
      1706 Above, the Evangelist described the failing of those who did not
      believe at all; here he explains the failing of those who believed in
      secret, because they were timid, faint-hearted. First, he mentions their
      dignity; secondly, their failing (v 42); and thirdly, he suggests the root
      of this failing (v 43).
    </p>
    <p>
      1707 The dignity of those who believed in secret was great, for they were
      the authorities, and on this point he says,
      <b>many even of the authorities believed in him</b>. He is saying in
      effect: I said that although Jesus had done so many signs, still they did
      not believe in him; and although this was true for the majority, yet there
      were some who did believe in him, because
      <b>many even of the authorities</b>, of the people,
      <b>believed in him</b>. One of these was Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by
      night, as was said (c 3). Thus the words of the Psalm (47:9) were
      fulfilled: "The princes of the peoples gather as their people of the God
      of Abraham"; and the statement of the Pharisees is proved false: "Have any
      of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?" (7:48).
    </p>
    <p>
      1708 The failing of these authorities is timidity, faint-heartedness; thus
      he says, <b>but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it</b>. For
      as stated above, the Pharisees "agreed that if any one should confess him
      to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue" (9:22). So, although
      they believed with their hearts, they did not profess him with their lips.
      Their faith, therefore, was insufficient, for as is said in Romans
      (10:10): "For a man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he
      confesses with his lips and so is saved." "Whoever is ashamed of me and my
      words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed" (Lk 9:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      1709 The root of their failing is vanity, vainglory; so he says,
      <b>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God</b>. By
      confessing Christ publicly they would have lost the glory of men, but won
      the glory of God. But they chose rather to be deprived of the glory of God
      than the glory of men: "How can you believe, who receive glory from one
      another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?" (5:44).
      "If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ" (Gal
      1:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      1710 Now he shows how Christ rebuked the Jews for their unbelief: first,
      he shows their duty to believe; secondly, he mentions the fruit of faith
      (v 46); thirdly, he warns the unbelievers about punishment (v 47). But
      because vision comes after faith, with regard to the first, he treats of
      faith; and secondly, of vision (v 45).
    </p>
    <p>
      1711 As to the first he says, <b>And Jesus cried out</b>, both because of
      the importance of what he intended to say and because of their free will,
      to charge them with their sins: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice
      like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression" (Is 58:1), and
      said,
      <b>He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me</b>.
      This seems to contain a contradiction, for he says,
      <b>he who believes in me believes not in me</b>. To understand this we
      should note first, according to Augustine, that our Lord said this to
      distinguish his divine and human nature.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" id="_ftnref41">[41]</a> For
      since the proper object of faith is God, we can indeed believe that a
      creature exists, but we should not believe in a creature (<i
        >in creaturam</i
      >) but in God alone (<i>in Deum</i>) [See Part I, commentary on 6:29]. Now
      in Christ there is a created nature and the uncreated nature. Therefore,
      the truth of faith requires that our faith be in Christ as having an
      uncreated nature. And so he says, <b>he who believes in me</b>, that is,
      in my person, <b>believes not in me</b>, as a human being,
      <b>but in him who sent me</b>, that is, he believes in me as sent from the
      Father: "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me" (7:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Chrysostom, however, our Lord says this to suggest his
      origin.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="" id="_ftnref42"
        >[42]</a
      >
      It is a way of speaking similar to a person drawing water from a stream
      and saying that this water is not from the stream but from the spring: for
      it does not originate from the stream. So our Lord says,
      <b>he who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me</b>,
      as though to say: I am not the source of myself, but my divinity is from
      another, that is, from my Father.
      <b>So, he who believes in me, believes not in me</b>, except insofar as I
      am from the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      1712 Then when he says, <b>and he who sees me sees him who sent me</b>, he
      treats of vision. In regard to this we should note that just as the Father
      sent the Son to convert the Jews, so Christ also sent his disciples: "As
      the Father has sent me, even so I send you" (20:21). But no one of the
      disciples dared to say, nor should he, that one should believe in him [the
      disciple], although he could say that one should believe him (<i
        >crederetur ei</i
      >). For this could not take place without detracting from the One who sent
      him, because if someone believed in the disciple, they would cease to
      believe in the master. So the Jews could say on the same basis that since
      you have been sent from the Father, anyone who believes in you ceases to
      believing in the Father. Therefore, our Lord shows against this that one
      who does not believe in him, does not believe in the Father. This is his
      meaning when he says, <b>he who sees me sees him who sent me</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeing which is referred to here is not a physical vision, but a
      consideration of the truth by the mind. And the reason why one who sees
      the Son also sees the Father is that the Father is in the Son by a unity
      of essence. For one thing is said to be seen in another either because
      they are the same, or they are entirely conformed. But the Father and the
      Son are the same in nature and entirely conformed: because the Son is the
      image of the Father and unlike in nothing, for "He is the image of the
      invisible God" (Col 1:15); "He reflects the glory of God and bears the
      very stamp of his nature" (Heb 1:3). And so, just as one believes in the
      Father, so also he believes in me: "He who has seen me has seen the
      FatherDo you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?"
      (14:9). It is as though he said: The reason why one who sees me sees the
      Father also, is that the Father is in me and I in the Father. Thus it is
      clear what faith should be: faith should be in Christ, as God, just as it
      is in the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      1713 Next he shows the fruit of faith. First, he shows his own worth and
      power when he says, <b>I have come as light into the world</b>. It has
      already been explained how Christ is a light: "He was the true light,
      which enlightens every man coming into this world" [1:9], and "I am the
      light of the world" (8:12). He also shows by this that he has the divine
      nature. For to be light is proper to God; others may give off light, that
      is participate in light, but God is light by essence: "God is light and in
      him is no darkness at all" (1 Jn 1:5). But because he "dwells in
      unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen" (1 Tim 6:16), we were
      unable to approach him. And so it was necessary that he come to us. This
      is what he says, <b>I have come as light into the world</b>, that is, I am
      the unapproachable light which rescues from error and disperses
      intellectual darkness: "I came from the Father and have come into the
      world" (16:28); "He came to his own" [1:11]. And although the apostles are
      called light - "You are the light of the world" (Mt 5:14) - they are not
      light in the same way as Christ. For they are a light whose light has been
      given to them, even though in some way they also give light, that is, in
      their ministry. Furthermore, none of the apostles could truly say,
      <b>I have come as light into the world</b>, because when they came into
      the world they were still darkness and not light, for in Job [37:19] it
      says: "We are wrapped in darkness."
    </p>
    <p>
      1714 Secondly, he continues,
      <b>that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness</b>. To become
      enlightened, therefore, is an effect of faith: "He who follows me will not
      walk in darkness" (8:12). <b>May not remain in darkness</b>: that is, the
      darkness of ignorance, of unbelief and eternal damnation. This shows that
      all are born in the darkness of sin: "For once you were darkness, but now
      you are light in the Lord," as we read in Ephesians (5:8). And in the
      darkness of ignorance: "A man whose way is hidden and God has surrounded
      him with darkness" [Job 3:23]. And in the end, unless they turn to Christ,
      they will be brought to the darkness of eternal damnation. And so, he who
      does not believe in me remains in darkness: "Whoever is unbelieving in the
      Son will not see life; rather, the anger of God rests on him" [3:36].
    </p>
    <p>
      1715 Then he discloses the punishment of unbelievers, which they will
      incur through their condemnation at the judgment. First, he states that
      the judgment will be delayed; secondly, that there will be a judgment in
      the future (v 48); and thirdly, he shows the cause of the judgment (v
      48b).
    </p>
    <p>
      1716 As to the first he says,
      <b
        >If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge
        him</b
      >. Note that the ones to be made happy, beatified, are those who hear the
      word of God and keep it, believing it within in their hearts, and doing it
      without in their actions. But they who hear it but take no care to keep
      it, become more guilty: "For it is not the hearers of the law who are
      righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified" (Rom
      2:13); "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only" (Jas 1:22). And
      so,
      <b
        >If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge
        him</b
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this seems to conflict with what was said above (5:22): "The Fatherhas
      given all judgment to the Son." Therefore, we should understand it as,
      <b>I do not judge him</b> at this time. It could be considered a weakness
      in him if he overlooked those who despised him. And so he says that such
      persons will be judged, although not now; for we read that "God will bring
      every deed into judgment" (Eccl 12:14), and "Flee from the face of
      iniquity, for the sword is the avenger of iniquity: and know that there is
      a judgment" [Job 19:29].
    </p>
    <p>
      1717 He continues with the reason for the delay, saying for
      <b>I did not come to judge the world but to save the world</b>. Now the
      Son of God comes two times: one time he comes as Savior, and the next as
      judge. But since all were in sin, if he had come the first time as judge,
      he would have saved no one, because all were the children of wrath. And so
      it was fitting that he come first to save believers, and later to judge
      both believers and sinners. This is what he is saying: I do not judge now,
      <b
        >for I did not come at this come to judge the world but to save the
        world</b
      >. "God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that
      the world might be saved through him" [3:17].
    </p>
    <p>
      1718 Then when he says,
      <b>he who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge</b>, he
      foretells the judgment to come. It is like saying: Although those who do
      not keep my word are not judged now, they will not go unpunished, whoever
      they are, because,
      <b>he who rejects me and does not receive my sayings</b> by believing them
      and acting according to them, <b>has a judge</b>. The reason for this is
      that if one does not receive the word of Christ, he scorns the word of
      God, whose Word is Christ, just like the one who does not obey the command
      of his master. "Flee from the face of iniquity; and know that there is a
      judgment" [Job 19:29]; "For God will bring every deed into judgment" (Eccl
      12:14); "Woe to you who scorn. Will not you yourselves also be scorned?"
      [Is 33:1]; "They who despise me will be despised" [1 Sam 2:30].
    </p>
    <p>
      1719 Then when he says,
      <b>the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day</b>, he
      assigns the cause of the judgment. And first, he mentions the cause of the
      judgment; secondly, the adequacy of this cause (v 49).
    </p>
    <p>
      1720 He says: I say that such a person has one that judges him. But who
      will that judge be? He says,
      <b>the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day</b>.
      According to Augustine, this is the same as saying: I will judge him on
      the last day.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="" id="_ftnref43"
        >[43]</a
      >
      For Christ revealed himself in his sayings, he announced himself. He,
      therefore, is the word that he spoke, for he spoke about himself: "Even if
      I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I
      have come and whither I am going" (8:14). It is like saying: What I have
      said to them and they have despised will judge them: "He is the one
      ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the
      prophets bear witness" (Acts 10:42).
    </p>
    <p>
      1721 Then he shows the sufficiency of this cause, saying,
      <b>for I have not spoken on my own authority</b> [ <b>of myself</b>,
      <i>ex meipso</i> ]. So first he shows this from the origin of his sayings;
      secondly, from their dignity or value (v 50). Concerning the first he does
      two things: first, he excludes a false notion: secondly, he states the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      1722 The false notion, of course, is that the Son works, or says, or is,
      merely of himself, and not from another: for this would be to say that the
      Son is not from the Father, which is what he does say: I say that the word
      which I have spoken will judge them,
      <b>for I have not spoken of myself</b>: "The Son cannot do anything of
      himself" [5:19]; "I do not speak of myself" [14:10].
      <b>Indeed, I have not spoken of myself</b>, is the same as "I was not born
      of myself but from the Father." He is saying in effect, I will judge him
      on the last day (appearing in the form of a servant): "He gave him the
      power to pass judgment, because he is the Son of man" [5:27]. Yet I will
      not judge from human authority, that is, because I am the Son of man, but
      from divine authority, because I am the Son of God. Therefore, I will not
      judge of myself, but from the Father from whom I have the authority to
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      1723 He establishes the truth when he says,
      <b
        >the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and
        what to speak</b
      >. Unless this is appropriately understood, it can be the source of two
      errors. The first is that since the one commanding is greater than the one
      commanded, the Father is greater than the Son. Secondly, since what is
      given to someone was not possessed by him before it was given, and so was
      not known by him, it seems that if the Father gave a commandment to the
      Son it follows that the Son at some time did not have it, and so did not
      know it. As a result, something has been added to the Son, and so the Son
      is not truly God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this we should note that all the divine commands are in the
      mind of the Father, since these commands are nothing other than the plans
      or patterns of things to be done. And so just as the patterns of all
      creatures produced by God are in the mind of the Father, and are called
      ideas, so the patterns of all things to be done by us are in his mind. And
      just as the patterns of all things pass from the Father to the Son, who is
      the Wisdom of the Father, so also the patterns of all things to be done.
      Therefore, the Son says,
      <b>the Father who sent me has himself given me</b>, as God,
      <b>commandment</b>, that is, by an eternal generation he has communicated
      to me <b>what to say</b> within <b>and what to speak</b> without, just as
      what we say (if we speak the truth) makes known what is in our minds.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" id="_ftnref44">[44]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      1724 Chrysostom explains all this differently, and more clearly.
      <a href="John12.htm#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" id="_ftnref45">[45]</a> First
      of all (v 47):
      <b
        >If any one hear my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge
        him</b
      >. Now one is said to be condemned in two ways: either by a judge or by
      the reason for the condemnation. For a murderer is condemned to be hanged
      both by the judge who passes sentence and by the murder he committed,
      which is the reason for his condemnation. He says,
      <b>I do not judge him</b>, that is, I am not the reason for his
      condemnation, but he himself is: "Your destruction, O Israel is from
      yourself; your help is only in me" [Hos 13:9]. And the reason is:
      <b>for I did not come to judge the world</b>, that is, I was not sent to
      condemn but to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      But will not such a person be judged? He certainly will, because
      <b>he who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge</b>. He
      shows what that judge is when he says, <b>the word that I have spoken</b>,
      and you have heard, will be his accuser and
      <b>will be his judge on the last day</b>. "If I had not come and spoken to
      them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin"
      (15:22). He shows that the word that he spoke will judge them by saying,
      <b>for I have not spoken of myself</b>. This is not said causally, but in
      a material sense, so that the meaning is: You say that your word will
      judge. But what is that word? It is the word that I have spoken,
      <b>for I have not spoken of myself</b>; that is, it is the word from the
      Father that I have spoken, and what he gave me to say and speak.
      Otherwise, if I had spoken something in opposition to the Father, or
      something I had not received from the Father, and they had believed me,
      they would have an excuse. But because I have spoken as I have, it is
      certain that they have rejected not only me, but also my Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      1725 According to this explanation, the statement,
      <b
        >the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and
        what to speak</b
      >, shows the sufficiency of the basis of the judgment because of the
      dignity or value of the word. First, its dignity is given; secondly, the
      fact that the word was spoken. Its dignity is stated when he says,
      <b>I know that his commandment is eternal life</b>. "This is the true God
      and eternal life" (1 Jn 5:20). For the Son himself is the commandment of
      the Father, or, he is eternal life. "If you would enter life, keep the
      commandments" (Mt 19:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, because the Father has given me commandment, and this
      commandment is eternal life, and since I have come to lead men to eternal
      life, I accomplish the commandment of the Father in all that I do. This is
      what he is saying,
      <b>What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has said to me</b>.
      According to Chrysostom, whose explanation is clear, the meaning is:
      <b>what I say, therefore</b>, when preaching in public,
      <b>I say as the Father has said to me</b>, that is, insofar as I have
      received knowledge from him - understanding this was received by Christ as
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      1726 But if, with Augustine, we understand this to apply to Christ as God,
      how can the Father say something to him, since Christ is his Word? The
      answer is that the Father did not say anything to him as though he spoke
      by words to his only Word. Rather, the Father spoke to the Son by
      generating him, and giving him life in himself: "He [the Lord] said to me,
      'You are my son'" (Ps 2:7).
