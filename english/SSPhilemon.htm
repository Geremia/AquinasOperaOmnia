      Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and our brother Timothy, to Philemon,
      our beloved and fellow worker, and to Appia, the sister, and to Archippus,
      our fellow soldier, and to the church that is in your house: grace be to
      you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give thanks to my God, always making remembrance of you in my prayers,
      as I hear of your charity and of the faith that you have in our Lord Jesus
      and towards all the saints. May the sharing of your faith be made evident
      in full knowledge of all the good that is in you, in Christ Jesus. For I
      had great joy and consolation in your charity, because through you,
      brother, the hearts of the saints have found rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, though I am very confident that I might charge you in
      Christ Jesus to do, what is fitting, yet for the sake of charity I prefer
      to plead, since you are such as you are; as Paul, an old man — and now
      also a prisoner of Jesus Christ — I plead with you for my own son, whom I
      have begotten in prison, for Onesimus. He once was useless to you, but now
      is useful both to me and to you. I am sending him back to you, and do you
      welcome him as though he were my very heart. I had wanted to keep him here
      with me that in your stead he might wait on me in my imprisonment for the
      Gospel; but I did not want to do anything without your counsel, in order
      that your kindness might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, indeed, he departed from you for a short while so that you might
      receive him for ever, no longer as a slave, but instead of a slave as a
      brother most dear, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the
      flesh and in the Lord! If therefore you does count me as a partner,
      welcome him as you would me. And if he did you any injury or owes
      anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, write it with my own hand: I will
      repay it — not to say to you that you owe me your very self. Yes, indeed,
      brother! May I too make use of you in the Lord! Console my heart in the
      Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      Trusting in your compliance, I am writing to you, knowing that you wilt do
      even beyond what I say. At the same time make ready a lodging for me too,
      for I hope that through your prayers I shall be restored to you. Epaphras,
      my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my
      fellow workers send you greetings. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
      with your spirit. Amen.

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Preface</span></p>
    <p>
      ‘If you have a faithful servant, let him be to you as your own soul’
      (Sirach 33:31). The wise man shows three things concerning master and
      slave, namely, what is required on the side of the servant; what ought to
      be the feeling of the master towards the servant; and what is the use of
      the servant. From the servant fidelity is asked, for in this he is a good
      servant, because what he is and all that he has he ought to give to the
      master. Matthew 24-45: ‘Who, do you think, is the faithful and prudent
      servant...’ And he says, ‘if he is faithful’, because fidelity is found in
      few. Proverbs 20:6: ‘But who shall find a faithful man?’ The master ought
      to feel towards his servant as a friend, hence it is said, ‘as his own
      soul’. For this is proper to friends, that they are of one mind in what
      they will and what they do not will. Acts 4.32: ‘Now the multitude of the
      believers were of one heart and one soul.’ By which we are given to
      understand that there is a consensus of master and servant, when the
      faithful servant becomes a friend. As for his use, he should be treated
      like a brother, for he is a brother, both with respect to generation of
      nature, because they have the same author —Job 31.13: ‘If I have despised
      to abide judgement with my man-servant’; Malachi 2:10: ‘Have we not all
      one father? Did not one God created us?’ —and with respect to the
      generation of grace, which is the same for both. Galatians 3:27: ‘For all
      you who have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is
      neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor freeman; there is
      neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.’ Matthew
      23:8: ‘And all you are brothers.’ These words are relevant to the matter
      of this epistle. For as it was shown above how spiritual prelates should
      relate to their subjects, so here he shows how temporal masters should
      relate to their temporal servants, and how the faithful servant to his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion of the epistle is this. At Colossae an important Christian
      had a servant who secretly fled to Rome where he was baptized by the
      Apostle who now writes on his behalf. First he gives a greeting, followed
      by the narrative of the epistle. In the greeting he mentions persons who
      send their greeting and then the recipients and finally the good hoped
      for.
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">On the text</span></p>
    <p>
      Therefore he says <i>Paul</i>, — a name to be revered by all the faithful
      who have been taught by him — <i>a prisoner</i>. 2 Timothy 2:9: ‘in which
      I suffer even to bonds, as a criminal’. For now he is a prisoner in Rome,
      but of Christ Jesus, to give the reason for his chains. For it is highly
      praiseworthy to be imprisoned for the sake of Christ; for in this he is
      blessed. Matthew 5:10: ‘Blessed are they who suffer persecution for
      justice’ sake...’ 2 Peter 4:15: ‘Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or
      a thief, or a slanderer, or as one coveting what belongs to others. But if
      he suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God
      under this name.’ Acts 5.41: ‘So they departed from the Sanhedrin,
      rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the
      name of Jesus.’
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And our brother Timothy</i>... They are brothers with regard to perfect
      faith. Philippians 2:20: ‘For I have no one so like-minded who is so
      genuinely solicitous for you.’ He joins Timothy to himself, that he might
      more easily succeed, because it is impossible that the prayers of many
      will not be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he mentions the persons greeted. And first the principal person
      greeted, then others, particularly the husband and wife whose house it is,
      to whom the servant is obliged.
      <i
        >To Philemon, our beloved and fellow worker, and to Appia, beloved
        sister</i
      >... Beloved, he says on account of her good works. John 13:34: ‘This is
      my command, that you love one another.’ Fellow worker, because he
      ministers to the saints. Proverbs 18.19: ‘A brother that is helped by his
      brother is like a strong city.’ Then he mentions
      <i>Archippus our fellow soldier</i>, who was so powerful at Colossae that
      all Christians were under his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why he brings in the whole Church there, of which he was the
      bishop, writing in Colossians 4:17, ‘And say to Archippus: “Look to the
      ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfil it.”’ And he
      calls Archippus ‘fellow soldier’ because all prelates are, as it were,
      spiritual soldiers of the Church. 2 Corinthians 10:4: ‘For the weapons of
      our warfare are not carnal...’ <i>And to the church</i>... He adds this in
      order to move him to hear plainly the expected good that is set forth, as
      was customary. Then when he says, <i>I give thanks to my God</i>, the
      burden of the letter begins. First, he gives thanks; then he makes his
      plea, <i>For this reason</i>...; finally, he concludes,
      <i>For I had great joy</i>...
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, first he expresses thanks; second he gives the reason for his
      gratitude: <i>as I hear of your charity</i>...; third, the reason why he
      thanks God:
      <i>For I had great joy and consolation... I give thanks to my God</i>.
      Colossians 3:15: ‘Show yourself thankful.’ Philippians 4.6: ‘With
      thanksgiving let your petitions be made to God.’ As if he said: I give
      thanks for past things in order that I might pray for future things.
      Therefore he says:
      <i>always making remembrance of you in my prayers</i>... Philippians 11:7:
      ‘Because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my chains.’ Isaiah
      49-15: ‘Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to have pity on the son
      of her womb? And if she should forget, yet will not I forget you.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Stating the matter of his giving thanks and of his prayer, he shows what
      he asks when he prays for them. The matter of this was the needs and goods
      of Philemon, namely, both charity and faith. For without charity nothing
      avails and through it all things are had. 1 Corinthians 13:1: ‘If I should
      speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I
      have become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.’ Again, without faith
      no one can love God, because he does not truly know God. He makes no
      mention of hope, because it is midway between and is understood in the
      others. But in whom should they have faith and charity?
      <i>in our Lord Jesus</i>. 1 Corinthians 16:22: ‘If any man does not love
      the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.’ This is necessary, because
      from Christ more sweetly comes love for the members; because he who does
      not love the members, does not love the head. 1 John 4.20: ‘For how can he
      who does not love his brother, whom he sees, love God, whom he does not
      see?’
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And towards all the saints</i>... Faith is based on doctrine insofar as
      it is manifested through Christ, ‘because no one has seen God’, John
      31.18; and, ‘You believe in God, believe also in me,’ John 14.1. We have
      Christ, therefore, through faith. <i>Towards all the saints</i> can be
      understood in two ways. In one way, because from the faith they have in
      Christ proceed the prayers made for the saints. Or, faith consists
      principally in the divinity as it is announced by Christ, and not only by
      Christ, but also by the saints. Matthew 28:19: ‘Go therefore and make
      disciples of all nations...’ Therefore we ought to believe not only what
      was said by Christ but also what was said by the saints. Hebrews 2:3: ‘For
      it was first announced by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by those who
      heard him.’
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>May the sharing of your faith</i>... This is shared in two ways. In one
      way, that it might be a sign. <i>Be made evident in full knowledge</i>...
      That is, so great is your charity, that the sharing of your faith...
      <i>I give thanks... always making remembrance</i>... That he might show
      what he seeks for him in praying. And the sharing of the faith can be
      understood in two ways. Either because in faith they share with all the
      saints, not having any new faith, like heretics. 1 Corinthians 1:10: ‘That
      you all say the same thing.’ Or, sharing, whereby you share good things
      with the saints, proceeding from faith. 1 Timothy 6.17: ‘Charge the rich
      of this world not to be proud, or to trust in the uncertainty of riches,
      but in God, who provides all things in abundance for our enjoyment.’
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Made evident in full knowledge</i>... That is, that the good hidden in
      the heart become evident in good works.
      <i
        >In full knowledge of all the good that is in you... And this in Christ
        Jesus</i
      >. James 2.18: ‘Show me your faith without works, and I from my works will
      show you my faith.’ Or, there are in the world many works which are good
      for men, and yet are not good for God, because they do not come about
      rightly. Proverbs 14:12: ‘There is a way which seems just to a man: but in
      the end it leads to death.’ Ecclesiastes 8:10: ‘I saw the wicked buried:
      who also when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were
      praised in the city as men of just works.’ But this is manifested through
      correct faith, when reward comes from God, who only rewards the righteous.
      Therefore he says <i>made evident in full knowledge</i>, that is, that
      this might be made evident, that you might know every good. Or that
      <i>all the good that is in you</i> might become known, which is the fruit
      of divinity. Exodus 33.19: ‘I will show you all good.’ Wisdom 7:11: ‘Now
      all good things come to me together with her.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason he gives thanks is joy. And he says,
      <i>For I had great joy and consolation</i>... 3 John 4: ‘I have no greater
      joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.’ For this joy
      alleviates anxiety. That is why he adds consolation. Psalm 93:119: ‘When
      anxieties are increased in my heart, your comfortings delight my soul.’ He
      explains why, saying
      <i
        >because through you, brother, the hearts of the saints have found
        rest</i
      >. Colossians 3:12... ‘Put on, therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and
      beloved, a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience.’ 3 John
      2: ‘Beloved I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in health...’
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when he says <i>For this reason</i>, he makes his plea. And first he
      states the confidence with which he asks; second, the petition itself,
      <i>I plead with you</i>...; third, his reason, <i>Perhaps, indeed</i>...
      He says, For this reason, that is, because you so abound in charity, I
      have great trust in Christ Jesus, as if to say, not from me, but from the
      authority of Jesus Christ, in which faith I gave birth to you. Therefore,
      I could command you as a father both concerning your own and common
      matters. Otherwise a prelate would not have had the power to command what
      was for his usefulness, or the Church’s, or of the good morals of the
      Christian religion.
      <i>Yet for the sake of charity I prefer to plead</i>... Proverbs 18.23:
      ‘The poor will speak with supplications...’ And why?
      <i>Since you are such as you are</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two things on account of which one ought to plead. Because of
      old age. 1 Timothy 1: ‘Do not reproach an old man, but ask him as a
      father.’ Again, because of the honourableness of virtue, for where we are
      not deficient, we are equals. Sirach 32:1, ‘Have they made you ruler? Be
      not lifted up: be among them as one of them.’ Therefore he says,
      <i>since you are such as you are</i>, as Paul, <i>an old man</i>, as if to
      say, if you were a boy, I would demand this of you, but you too are old.
      You are of the same stage of life as I. Not that they are such and so much
      simply speaking, but in a way similar, which he says out of his humility.
      Romans 12:10: ‘anticipating one another with honour’. Origen said that it
      is rare to find a useful teacher in the Church who is not old, thinking of
      Peter and Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having expressed his confidence in Philemon’s goodness, here he states his
      request. And first he indicates the person on whose behalf he pleads;
      second, he concludes the request. The first is subdivided into two,
      because first by describing the person he shows that he has received him
      in spiritual birth; second, by a change of status. Therefore he says,
      <i
        >I plead with you for my own son, whom I have begotten in prison, for
        Onesimus</i
      >, who is his present concern. And acquiring a son in default of time, he
      loves him more, as an old man loves sons born to him in his old age.
      Genesis 37:3: ‘Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had
      him in his old age.’ This one [Onesimus] was given birth in chains.
      Second, there is the change in status. For if he had persevered in sin, he
      would not be worthy of leniency. Note that Paul says little and means
      much. For as Cicero taught, one ought to make little of one’s own deed as
      much as possible. Thus the Apostle speaks lightly of his offence, saying,
      <i>He once was useless to you</i>, that is, harmful in taking away your
      possession, but now, converted from evil to the state of virtue, he is
      useful for the service of God and man. 2 Timothy 2:21: ‘If anyone,
      therefore, has cleansed himself from these, he will be a vessel for
      honourable use...’ Proverbs 25:4: ‘Take away the rust from silver, and
      there shall come forth a most pure vessel.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when he says, <i>I am sending him back to you</i>, he makes his
      request. First, he makes it, then he answers a question:
      <i>I had wanted to keep him here.</i> And so he says,
      <i>and do you welcome him as though he were my very heart.</i> And this
      because I have seen him changed, the sign of which is, I send him back to
      you. On the contrary, Deuteronomy 23.15: ‘Thou shalt not deliver to his
      master the servant that is fled to you.’ I reply that is true when the
      master seeks him in order to put him to death. Therefore, he says, I did
      not want to do anything...’ Philippians 1-7: ‘I have the right to feel so
      about you, because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my
      chains.’
    </p>
    <p>
      And he responds to a question, because it might be said if he is useful to
      you, why do you not keep him unto death? And he gives the reason for
      sending him back. First, he considers why he might keep him; second, why
      he rejects that idea:
      <i>but I did not want to do anything without your counsel.</i> Therefore,
      he says to Philemon who, although he is a great man, is accustomed to
      minister to the Apostle. Matthew 10:26: ‘On the contrary, whoever wishes
      to become great among you shall be your servant.’ Out of this confidence
      he proposed to keep him, so that in place of Philemon he might minister to
      him.
      <i
        >I had wanted to keep him here with me that in your stead he might wait
        on me in my imprisonment for the Gospel.</i
      >
      This was something especially needed since he was in chains for the sake
      of Christ, for one is provided for when he suffers for his master. The
      reason he rejected the idea was that he did not want to use another’s
      property without the owner’s knowledge. Hence,
      <i>but I did not want to do anything</i>... As if he said: if I should
      keep him, it would please you who do not wish to resist but it would be a
      kind of force. But I did not want that, indeed I wanted it to come about
      voluntarily. Exodus 25.2: ‘Of every man who offers of his own accord, you
      shall take them,’ that is, the first fruits. 2 Corinthians 9:7: ‘Let each
      one give according as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or
      from compulsion, for “God loves a cheerful giver.”’
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when he says, <i>Perhaps, indeed</i>..., he gives the reason why he
      ought to receive him kindly, first, on the side of God, second, on the
      side of the Apostle: <i>If therefore you count me as a partner</i>...;
      third, on the part of Philemon himself:
      <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>... On the side of God, because the
      providence of God often permits what is evil to come about, in order that
      good might follow from it, as is clear from the sale of Joseph, that he
      might free Egypt and the family of his father. Genesis 45-5: ‘For God sent
      me before you into Egypt for your preservation.’ He says Perhaps because
      the judgements of God are incomprehensible, Romans 11:33. And he says
      <i>instead of a slave</i>, that is, in place of a slave. Matthew 23.8:
      ‘For one is your master and all are your brothers.’ And not only yours,
      but mine in comparison to God, though he is a son to the ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>How much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</i> This can
      be expounded in two ways. First, as referring to the first origin of the
      divine creation, and thus he is a brother. Deuteronomy 32:6: ‘Is not he
      your father, that hath possessed you, and made you, and created you?’
      Malachi 2:10: ‘Have we not all one father? Did not one God created us?’
      Again, by trust in God. Or it might rather be for the good of Philemon,
      because he is close to him in the flesh, since that is how he is his
      slave, because whatever he is bodily belongs to Philemon. Hence one is
      moved by charity for two reasons, by love which has its origin in the
      flesh, or by spiritual love. On the part of the Apostle, he first declares
      his friendship, under which aegis he wants Philemon to take Onesimus back;
      second, he offers to pay any damages; third he shows the function of
      receiving. Second, <i>If, therefore, you</i>... Third,
      <i>Yes, indeed, brother!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, he says, If, therefore, you dost count me as a partner, welcome
      him. 1 John 1:7: ‘But if we walk in the light as he also is in the light,
      we have fellowship with one another.’And he says
      <i>as you would me</i> because he is linked with me. Matthew 10:40: ‘Who
      receives you, receives me.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, he offers to make good any injury to Philemon, saying,
      <i>And if he did you any injury or owes you anything</i>, namely by
      leaving his service, <i>charge it to me</i>. As if to say, I will make
      satisfaction. Galatians 6.2.: ‘Bear one another’s burdens.’ And more,
      because he first offers to make it good; second, he shows that Philemon is
      in his debt, not of necessity but of will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he says, <i>I, Paul</i>, as if to say, that you might be certain
      of restitution. <i>I write it with my own hand.</i> And this not out of
      necessity, <i>because you owe me your very self</i>, because I snatched
      you from eternal death, and thus he should do this for his liberator.
      Tobias 9:2: ‘If I should give myself to be your servant, I should not make
      a worthy return for your care.’ And he adds,
      <i>Yes, indeed, brother, may I too make use of you</i>, as if to say, if
      you want me for a partner, take him back, and I will so use you, brother,
      that is, if you do it, you will fill my wishes with joy. For to make use
      is to use the fruit and thus it is to use for the useful, as I enjoy
      fruit. It implies the sweetness of the fruit; Song of Songs 2:3: ‘And his
      fruit was sweet to my palate.’ And the end, because the ultimate produce
      of the tree is its fruit. Therefore, to enjoy is properly to have
      something which is pleasant and final. Hence Augustine says that we enjoy
      thinking of things in which the will delights because of their sweetness.
      Again, to enjoy is to adhere to something for its own sake. Sometimes
      ‘enjoy’ and,use’ are taken commonly as implying enjoyment without the
      contrary. Sirach 8:10: ‘and to serve great men without blame’. Therefore
      he says, <i>May I too make use of you</i>, because you are against me in
      nothing. And if in this you please me, there will be nothing in my heart
      concerning you that saddens me, and thus you will delight me. But if we
      take enjoyment as something final, then one does not enjoy man, but God
      alone. Contrary to this seems to be Wisdom 2:6: ‘Come therefore, and let
      us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the
      creatures as in youth.’ Hence he adds <i>in the Lord</i>, that is, May I,
      too, make use of you in the delight of God, rejoicing in the divine good
      that is in you, because his action is love, and the enjoyment of its
      effect, namely, charity. That is why he adds <i>console my heart</i>. A
      man is consoled spiritually when the desires of his heart are fulfilled.
      As if he said: fulfil the deepest desires of my heart. And not with
      respect to evil, but in the Lord, and thus the fulfilment of desire is
      good.

      Then when he says <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>, he provides a reason
      on the side of Philemon, and a commendation of his obedience. First he
      shows how he is confident in his obeying; second he adds to it something
      similar. Therefore he says, <i>Trusting in your compliance.</i> 2
      Corinthians 7:16: ‘I rejoice that in all things I can have confidence in
      you.’ 1 Sam 15:22: ‘For obedience is better than sacrifices.’ But he
      writes more cautiously because a man listens more closely to one he
      expects to see again than if he despairs. Therefore he says,
      <i>At the same time make ready a lodging for me too.</i> For it was his
      custom when he was in Colossae to stay in his home. Chrysostom asks what
      we are to make of this remark in which a poor man commands a rich man by
      letter from across the expanse of the earth to prepare a lodging for him.
      What would have to be prepared for one content with bread and cheap
      victuals? It should be said that it was not for the sake of the
      preparation of lodging that he says this, but to insinuate familiarity and
      love; in this way he will be prompt to obey. The Apostle therefore does
      not say this on account of external trappings but out of his devotion.
      <i>For I hope that through your prayers I shall be restored to you.</i>

      Against this is the fact that he never returned to them but died in Rome,
      therefore his hope was dashed. I reply that the hope of the just is of two
      kinds, the chief of which is for his own good, and this is never dashed;
      another secondary hope is the proof of others, and this is sometimes
      dashed, because their merits are contrary, as the just man is sometimes
      not heeded by others. But was he deceived in his trust? It should be said
      that God alone knows the future; that is not for human knowledge, except
      the prophetic. And no prophet knows all the future events that concern
      himself. Only Christ did, because he did not have the Holy Spirit in a
      limited way. Thus Isaac the great prophet was deceived in Jacob. So it is
      not to be wondered at in an apostle if he does not know.

      Then he ends his letter with a greeting, and first on the part of others,
      second on his own. He says, they send you greetings, and we read of them
      at the end of Colossians. But this can be doubted since he mentions Demas.
      How can this be, since he said in 2. Timothy 3:8, ‘For Demas has deserted
      me, loving this world’? How, then, can he use his name?
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be said that he returned to him, but this does not seem to be the
      case, because this letter was written after that to Timothy and here he
      says, <i>I hope that through your prayers</i>, and there he foretells his
      death, saying, ‘The time of my deliverance is at hand.’ Therefore it
      should be said that Paul was in Rome for nearly nine years, and this
      letter was written at the beginning, whereas the second letter to Timothy
      was written at the end of his life and then Demas weary of imprisonment
      deserted him. The letters of Paul are not arranged chronologically,
      because the letters to the Corinthians were written before the letter to
      the Romans, and this before the last letter to Timothy. That is placed
      first because of its matter, which is worthier. His own greeting here is
      the same one that ends the second letter to Timothy. Thanks be to God,
      amen.
