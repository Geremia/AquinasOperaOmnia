<H3 Align="Center">OF THINGS PERTAINING TO THE FIRST MAN'S WILL---NAMELY, GRACE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider what belongs to the will of the first man; concerning 
which there are two points of treatment: (1) the grace and righteousness 
of the first man; (2) the use of righteousness as regards his dominion 
over other things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the first man was created in grace?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in the state of innocence he had passions of the soul?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether he had all virtues?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether what he did would have been as meritorious as now?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first man was not created in grace. For 
the Apostle, distinguishing between Adam and Christ, says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A45">1 Cor. 15:45</a>): 
"The first Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a 
quickening spirit." But the spirit is quickened by grace. Therefore 
Christ alone was made in grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 123) [*Work 
of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of St. Augustine] 
that "Adam did not possess the Holy Ghost." But whoever possesses grace 
has the Holy Ghost. Therefore Adam was not created in grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Correp. et Grat. x) that "God so 
ordered the life of the angels and men, as to show first what they could 
do by free-will, then what they could do by His grace, and by the 
discernment of righteousness." God thus first created men and angels in 
the state of natural free-will only; and afterwards bestowed grace on 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. ii, D, xxiv): "When man was 
created he was given sufficient help to stand, but not sufficient to 
advance." But whoever has grace can advance by merit. Therefore the first 
man was not created in grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the reception of grace requires the consent of the 
recipient, since thereby a kind of spiritual marriage takes place between 
God and the soul. But consent presupposes existence. Therefore man did 
not receive grace in the first moment of his creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, nature is more distant from grace than grace is from 
glory, which is but grace consummated. But in man grace precedes glory. 
Therefore much more did nature precede grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Man and angel are both ordained to grace. But the 
angels were created in grace, for Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9): 
"God at the same time fashioned their nature and endowed them with 
grace." Therefore man also was created in grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some say that man was not created in grace; but that it 
was bestowed on him subsequently before sin: and many authorities of the 
Saints declare that man possessed grace in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the very rectitude of the primitive state, wherewith man was endowed 
by God, seems to require that, as others say, he was created in grace, 
according to Eccles. 7:30, "God made man right." For this rectitude 
consisted in his reason being subject to God, the lower powers to reason, 
and the body to the soul: and the first subjection was the cause of both 
the second and the third; since while reason was subject to God, the 
lower powers remained subject to reason, as Augustine says [*Cf. De Civ. 
Dei xiii, 13; De Pecc.  Merit. et Remiss. i, 16]. Now it is clear that 
such a subjection of the body to the soul and of the lower powers to 
reason, was not from nature; otherwise it would have remained after sin; 
since even in the demons the natural gifts remained after sin, as 
Dionysius declared (Div. Nom. iv). Hence it is clear that also the 
primitive subjection by virtue of which reason was subject to God, was 
not a merely natural gift, but a supernatural endowment of grace; for it 
is not possible that the effect should be of greater efficiency than the 
cause. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 13) that, "as soon as they 
disobeyed the Divine command, and forfeited Divine grace, they were 
ashamed of their nakedness, for they felt the impulse of disobedience in 
the flesh, as though it were a punishment corresponding to their own 
disobedience." Hence if the loss of grace dissolved the obedience of the 
flesh to the soul, we may gather that the inferior powers were subjected 
to the soul through grace existing therein.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle in these words means to show that there is a 
spiritual body, if there is an animal body, inasmuch as the spiritual 
life of the body began in Christ, who is "the firstborn of the dead," as 
the body's animal life began in Adam. From the Apostle's words, 
therefore, we cannot gather that Adam had no spiritual life in his soul; 
but that he had not spiritual life as regards the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in the same passage, it is not disputed 
that Adam, like other just souls, was in some degree gifted with the Holy 
Ghost; but "he did not possess the Holy Ghost, as the faithful possess 
Him now," who are admitted to eternal happiness directly after death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This passage from Augustine does not assert that angels or 
men were created with natural free-will before they possessed grace; but 
that God shows first what their free-will could do before being confirmed 
in grace, and what they acquired afterwards by being so confirmed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The Master here speaks according to the opinion of those 
who held that man was not created in grace, but only in a state of 
nature. We may also say that, though man was created in grace, yet it was 
not by virtue of the nature wherein he was created that he could advance 
by merit, but by virtue of the grace which was added.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As the motion of the will is not continuous there is 
nothing against the first man having consented to grace even in the first 
moment of his existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> We merit glory by an act of grace; but we do not merit 
grace by an act of nature; hence the comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether passions existed in the soul of the first man?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first man's soul had no passions. For by 
the passions of the soul "the flesh lusteth against the spirit" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A7">Gal. 5:7</a>). But this did not happen in the state of innocence. Therefore in the 
state of innocence there were no passions of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Adam's soul was nobler than his body. But his body was 
impassible. Therefore no passions were in his soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the passions of the soul are restrained by the moral 
virtues. But in Adam the moral virtues were perfect. Therefore the 
passions were entirely excluded from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10) that "in our first 
parents there was undisturbed love of God," and other passions of the 
soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The passions of the soul are in the sensual appetite, the 
object of which is good and evil. Wherefore some passions of the soul are 
directed to what is good, as love and joy; others to what is evil, as 
fear and sorrow. And since in the primitive state, evil was neither 
present nor imminent, nor was any good wanting which a good-will could 
desire to have then, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10), therefore 
Adam had no passion with evil as its object; such as fear, sorrow, and 
the like; neither had he passions in respect of good not possessed, but 
to be possessed then, as burning concupiscence. But those passions which 
regard present good, as joy and love; or which regard future good to be 
had at the proper time, as desire and hope that casteth not down, existed 
in the state of innocence; otherwise, however, than as they exist in 
ourselves. For our sensual appetite, wherein the passions reside, is not 
entirely subject to reason; hence at times our passions forestall and 
hinder reason's judgment; at other times they follow reason's judgment, 
accordingly as the sensual appetite obeys reason to some extent. But in 
the state of innocence the inferior appetite was wholly subject to 
reason: so that in that state the passions of the soul existed only as 
consequent upon the judgment of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The flesh lusts against the spirit by the rebellion of the 
passions against reason; which could not occur in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The human body was impassible in the state of innocence as 
regards the passions which alter the disposition of nature, as will be 
explained later on (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); likewise the soul was impassible as 
regards the passions which impede the free use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Perfection of moral virtue does not wholly take away the 
passions, but regulates them; for the temperate man desires as he ought 
to desire, and what he ought to desire, as stated in Ethic. iii, 11.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Adam had all the virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Adam had not all the virtues. For some virtues 
are directed to curb passions: thus immoderate concupiscence is 
restrained by temperance, and immoderate fear by fortitude. But in the 
state of innocence no immoderation existed in the passions. Therefore 
neither did these virtues then exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some virtues are concerned with the passions which have 
evil as their object; as meekness with anger; fortitude with fear. But 
these passions did not exist in the state of innocence, as stated above 
(<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore neither did those virtues exist then.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, penance is a virtue that regards sin committed. Mercy, 
too, is a virtue concerned with unhappiness. But in the state of 
innocence neither sin nor unhappiness existed. Therefore neither did 
those virtues exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, perseverance is a virtue. But Adam possessed it not; as 
proved by his subsequent sin. Therefore he possessed not every virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, faith is a virtue. But it did not exist in the state of 
innocence; for it implies an obscurity of knowledge which seems to be 
incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says, in a homily (Serm. contra Judaeos): 
"The prince of sin overcame Adam who was made from the slime of the earth 
to the image of God, adorned with modesty, restrained by temperance, 
refulgent with brightness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> in the state of innocence man in a certain sense 
possessed all the virtues; and this can be proved from what precedes. For 
it was shown above (<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that such was the rectitude of the primitive 
state, that reason was subject to God, and the lower powers to reason. 
Now the virtues are nothing but those perfections whereby reason is 
directed to God, and the inferior powers regulated according to the 
dictate of reason, as will be explained in the Treatise on the Virtues 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Wherefore the rectitude of the primitive state 
required that man should in a sense possess every virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must, however, be noted that some virtues of their very nature do not 
involve imperfection, such as charity and justice; and these virtues did 
exist in the primitive state absolutely, both in habit and in act. But 
other virtues are of such a nature as to imply imperfection either in 
their act, or on the part of the matter. If such imperfection be 
consistent with the perfection of the primitive state, such virtues 
necessarily existed in that state; as faith, which is of things not seen, 
and hope which is of things not yet possessed. For the perfection of that 
state did not  extend to the vision of the Divine Essence, and the 
possession of God with the enjoyment of final beatitude. Hence faith and 
hope could exist in the primitive state, both as to habit and as to act. 
But any virtue which implies imperfection incompatible with the 
perfection of the primitive state, could exist in that state as a habit, 
but not as to the act; for instance, penance, which is sorrow for sin 
committed; and mercy, which is sorrow for others' unhappiness; because 
sorrow, guilt, and unhappiness are incompatible with the perfection of 
the primitive state. Wherefore such virtues existed as habits in the 
first man, but not as to their acts; for he was so disposed that he would 
repent, if there had been a sin to repent for; and had he seen 
unhappiness in his neighbor, he would have done his best to remedy it. 
This is in accordance with what the Philosopher says, "Shame, which 
regards what is ill done, may be found in a virtuous man, but only 
conditionally; as being so disposed that he would be ashamed if he did 
wrong" (Ethic. iv, 9).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is accidental to temperance and fortitude to subdue 
superabundant passion, in so far as they are in a subject which happens 
to have superabundant passions, and yet those virtues are 'per se' 
competent to moderate the passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passions which have evil for their object were incompatible 
with the perfection of the primitive state, if that evil be in the one 
affected by the passion; such as fear and sorrow. But passions which 
relate to evil in another are not incompatible with the perfection of the 
primitive state; for in that state man could hate the demons' malice, as 
he could love God's goodness. Thus the virtues which relate to such 
passions could exist in the primitive state, in habit and in act. 
Virtues, however, relating to passions which regard evil in the same 
subject, if relating to such passions only, could not exist in the 
primitive state in act, but only in habit, as we have said above of 
penance and of mercy. But other virtues there are which have relation not 
to such passions only, but to others; such as temperance, which relates 
not only to sorrow, but also to joy; and fortitude, which relates not 
only to fear, but also to daring and hope. Thus the act of temperance 
could exist in the primitive state, so far as it moderates pleasure; and 
in like manner, fortitude, as moderating daring and hope, but not as 
moderating sorrow and fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> appears from what has been said above.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Perseverance may be taken in two ways: in one sense as a 
particular virtue, signifying a habit whereby a man makes a choice of 
persevering in good; in that sense Adam possessed perseverance. In 
another sense it is taken as a circumstance of virtue; signifying a 
certain uninterrupted continuation of virtue; in which sense Adam did not 
possess perseverance.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the actions of the first man were less 
meritorious than ours are. For grace is given to us through the mercy of 
God, Who succors most those who are most in need. Now we are more in need 
of grace than was man in the state of innocence. Therefore grace is more 
copiously poured out upon us; and since grace is the source of merit, our 
actions are more meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, struggle and difficulty are required for merit; for it 
is written (2 Tm. 2:5): "He . . . is not crowned except he strive 
lawfully" and the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3): "The object of virtue 
is the difficult and the good." But there is more strife and difficulty 
now. Therefore there is greater efficacy for merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. ii., D, xxiv) that "man would not 
have merited in resisting temptation; whereas he does merit now, when he 
resists." Therefore our actions are more meritorious than in the 
primitive state.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Merit as regards degree may be gauged in two ways. First, 
in its root, which is grace and charity. Merit thus measured corresponds 
in degree to the essential reward, which consists in the enjoyment of 
God; for the greater the charity whence our actions proceed, the more 
perfectly shall we enjoy God. Secondly, the degree of merit is measured 
by the degree of the action itself. This degree is of two kinds, absolute 
and proportional. The widow who put two mites into the treasury performed 
a deed of absolutely less degree than the others who put great sums 
therein. But in proportionate degree the widow gave more, as Our Lord 
said; because she gave more in proportion to her means. In each of these 
cases the degree of merit corresponds to the accidental reward, which 
consists in rejoicing for created good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We conclude therefore that in the state of innocence man's works were 
more meritorious than after sin was committed, if we consider the degree 
of merit on the part of grace, which would have been more copious as 
meeting with no obstacle in human nature: and in like manner, if we 
consider the absolute degree of the work done; because, as man would have 
had greater virtue, he would have performed greater works. But if we 
consider the proportionate degree, a greater reason for merit exists 
after sin, on account of man's weakness; because a small deed is more 
beyond the capacity of one who works with difficulty than a great deed is 
beyond one who performs it easily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> After sin man requires grace for more things than before 
sin; but he does not need grace more; forasmuch as man even before sin 
required grace to obtain eternal life, which is the chief reason for the 
need of grace. But after sin man required grace also for the remission of 
sin, and for the support of his weakness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Difficulty and struggle belong to the degree of merit 
according to the proportionate degree of the work done, as above 
explained. It is also a sign of the will's promptitude striving after 
what is difficult to itself: and the promptitude of the will is caused by 
the intensity of charity. Yet it may happen that a person performs an 
easy deed with as prompt a will as another performs an arduous deed; 
because he is ready to do even what may be difficult to him. But the 
actual difficulty, by its penal character, enables the deed to satisfy 
for sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[95] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The first man would not have gained merit in resisting 
temptation, according to the opinion of those who say that he did not 
possess grace; even as now there is no merit to those who have not grace. 
But in this point there is a difference, inasmuch as in the primitive 
state there was no interior impulse to evil, as in our present state. 
Hence man was more able then than now to resist temptation even without 
grace.<br>
