<H3 Align="Center">OF THE SPECIFIC POWERS OF THE SOUL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next treat of the powers of the soul specifically. The theologian, 
however, has only to inquire specifically concerning the intellectual and 
appetitive powers, in which the virtues reside. And since the knowledge 
of these powers depends to a certain extent on the other powers, our 
consideration of the powers of the soul taken specifically will be 
divided into three parts: first, we shall consider those powers which are 
a preamble to the intellect; secondly, the intellectual powers; thirdly, 
the appetitive powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A1THEP1">(1)</a> The powers of the soul considered generally;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A2THEP1">(2)</a> The various species of the vegetative part;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A3THEP1">(3)</a> The exterior senses;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A4THEP1">(4)</a> The interior senses.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there are to be distinguished five genera of powers in the soul?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not to be distinguished five genera 
of powers in the soul---namely, vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, 
locomotive, and intellectual. For the powers of the soul are called its 
parts. But only three parts of the soul are commonly assigned---namely, 
the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Therefore 
there are only three genera of powers in the soul, and not five.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the powers of the soul are the principles of its vital 
operations. Now, in four ways is a thing said to live. For the 
Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 2): "In several ways a thing is said to 
live, and even if only one of these is present, the thing is said to 
live; as intellect and sense, local movement and rest, and lastly, 
movement of decrease and increase due to nourishment." Therefore there 
are only four genera of powers of the soul, as the appetitive is excluded.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a special kind of soul ought not to be assigned as 
regards what is common to all the powers. Now desire is common to each 
power of the soul. For sight desires an appropriate visible object; 
whence we read (Ecclus. 40:22): "The eye desireth favor and beauty, but 
more than these green sown fields." In the same way every other power 
desires its appropriate object. Therefore the appetitive power should not 
be made a special genus of the powers of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the moving principle in animals is sense, intellect or 
appetite, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore the 
motive power should not be added to the above as a special genus of soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 3), "The  powers are 
the vegetative, the sensitive, the appetitive, the locomotion, and the 
intellectual."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are five genera of powers of the soul, as above 
numbered. Of these, three are called souls, and four are called modes of 
living. The reason of this diversity lies in the various souls being 
distinguished accordingly as the operation of the soul transcends the 
operation of the corporeal nature in various ways; for the whole 
corporeal nature is subject to the soul, and is related to it as its 
matter and instrument. There exists, therefore, an operation of the soul 
which so far exceeds the corporeal nature that it is not even performed 
by any corporeal organ; and such is the operation of the "rational soul." 
Below this, there is another operation of the soul, which is indeed 
performed through a corporeal organ, but not through a corporeal quality, 
and this is the operation of the "sensitive soul"; for though hot and 
cold, wet and dry, and other such corporeal qualities are required for 
the work of the senses, yet they are not required in such a way that the 
operation of the senses takes place by virtue of such qualities; but only 
for the proper disposition of the organ. The lowest of the operations of 
the soul is that which is performed by a corporeal organ, and by virtue 
of a corporeal quality. Yet this transcends the operation of the 
corporeal nature; because the movements of bodies are caused by an 
extrinsic principle, while these operations are from an intrinsic 
principle; for this is common to all the operations of the soul; since 
every animate thing, in some way, moves itself. Such is the operation of 
the "vegetative soul"; for digestion, and what follows, is caused 
instrumentally by the action of heat, as the Philosopher says (De Anima 
ii, 4).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the powers of the soul are distinguished generically by their 
objects. For the higher a power is, the more universal is the object to 
which it extends, as we have said above (<A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4). But the 
object of the soul's operation may be considered in a triple order. For 
in the soul there is a power the object of which is only the body that is 
united to that soul; the powers of this genus are called "vegetative" for 
the vegetative power acts only on the body to which the soul is united. 
There is another genus in the powers of the soul, which genus regards a 
more universal object---namely, every sensible body, not only the body to 
which the soul is united. And there is yet another genus in the powers of 
the soul, which genus regards a still more universal object---namely, not 
only the sensible body, but all being in universal. Wherefore it is 
evident that the latter two genera of the soul's powers have an operation 
in regard not merely to that which is united to them, but also to 
something extrinsic. Now, since whatever operates must in some way be 
united to the object about which it operates, it follows of necessity 
that this something extrinsic, which is the object of the soul's 
operation, must be related to the soul in a twofold manner. First, 
inasmuch as this something extrinsic has a natural aptitude to be united 
to the soul, and to be by its likeness in the soul. In this way there are 
two kinds of powers ---namely, the "sensitive" in regard to the  less 
common object---the sensible body; and the "intellectual," in regard to 
the most common object---universal being. Secondly, forasmuch as the soul 
itself has an inclination and tendency to the something extrinsic. And in 
this way there are again two kinds of powers in the soul: one---the 
"appetitive"---in respect of which the soul is referred to something 
extrinsic as to an end, which is first in the intention; the other---the 
"locomotive" power---in respect of which the soul is referred to 
something extrinsic as to the term of its operation and movement; for 
every animal is moved for the purpose of realizing its desires and 
intentions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The modes of living are distinguished according to the degrees of living 
things. There are some living things in which there exists only 
vegetative power, as the plants. There are others in which with the 
vegetative there exists also the sensitive, but not the locomotive power; 
such as immovable animals, as shellfish. There are others which besides 
this have locomotive powers, as perfect animals, which require many 
things for their life, and consequently movement to seek necessaries of 
life from a distance. And there are some living things which with these 
have intellectual power---namely, men. But the appetitive power does not 
constitute a degree of living things; because wherever there is sense 
there is also appetite (De Anima ii, 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the first two objectives are hereby solved.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The "natural appetite" is that inclination which each thing 
has, of its own nature, for something; wherefore by its natural appetite 
each power desires something suitable to itself. But the "animal 
appetite" results from the form apprehended; this sort of appetite 
requires a special power of the soul---mere apprehension does not 
suffice. For a thing is desired as it exists in its own nature, whereas 
in the apprehensive power it exists not according to its own nature, but 
according to its likeness. Whence it is clear that sight desires 
naturally a visible object for the purpose of its act only---namely, for 
the purpose of seeing; but the animal by the appetitive power desires the 
thing seen, not merely for the purpose of seeing it, but also for other 
purposes. But if the soul did not require things perceived by the senses, 
except on account of the actions of the senses, that is, for the purpose 
of sensing them; there would be no need for a special genus of appetitive 
powers, since the natural appetite of the powers would suffice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although sense and appetite are principles of movement in 
perfect animals, yet sense and appetite, as such, are not sufficient to 
cause movement, unless another power be added to them; for immovable 
animals have sense and appetite, and yet they have not the power of 
motion. Now this motive power is not only in the appetite and sense as 
commanding the movement, but also in the parts of the body, to make them 
obey the appetite of the soul which moves them. Of this we have a sign in 
the fact that when the members are deprived of their natural disposition, 
they do not move in obedience to the appetite.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the parts of the vegetative soul are fittingly described as the nutritive, augmentative, and generative?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the parts of the vegetative soul are not 
fittingly described---namely, the nutritive, augmentative, and 
generative. For these are called "natural" forces. But the powers of the 
soul are above the natural forces. Therefore we should not class the 
above forces as powers of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we should not assign a particular power of the soul to 
that which is common to living and non-living things. But generation is 
common to all things that can be generated and corrupted, whether living 
or not living. Therefore the generative force should not be classed as a 
power of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soul is more powerful than the body. But the body by 
the same force gives species and quantity; much more, therefore, does the 
soul. Therefore the augmentative power of the soul is not distinct from 
the generative power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, everything is preserved in being by that whereby it 
exists. But the generative power is that whereby a living thing exists. 
Therefore by the same power the living thing is preserved. Now the 
nutritive force is directed to the preservation of the living thing (De 
Anima ii, 4), being "a power which is capable of preserving whatever 
receives it." Therefore we should not distinguish the nutritive power 
from the generative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 2,4) that the 
operations of this soul are "generation, the use of food," and (cf. De 
Anima iii, 9) "growth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The vegetative part has three powers. For the vegetative 
part, as we have said (<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), has for its object the body itself, living 
by the soul; for which body a triple operation of the soul is required. 
One is whereby it acquires existence, and to this is directed the 
"generative" power. Another is whereby the living body acquires its due 
quantity; to this is directed the "augmentative" power. Another is 
whereby the body of a living thing is preserved in its existence and in 
its due quantity; to this is directed the "nutritive" power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, however, observe a difference among these powers. The nutritive 
and the augmentative have their effect where they exist, since the body 
itself united to the soul grows and is preserved by the augmentative and 
nutritive powers which exist in one and the same soul. But the generative 
power has its effect, not in one and the same body but in another; for a 
thing cannot generate itself. Therefore the generative power, in a way, 
approaches to the dignity of the sensitive soul, which has an operation 
extending to extrinsic things, although in a more excellent and more 
universal manner; for that which is highest in an inferior nature 
approaches to that which is lowest in the higher nature, as is made clear 
by  Dionysius (Div. Nom. vii). Therefore, of these three powers, the 
generative has the greater finality, nobility, and perfection, as the 
Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 4), for it belongs to a thing which is 
already perfect to "produce another like unto itself." And the generative 
power is served by the augmentative and nutritive powers; and the 
augmentative power by the nutritive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such forces are called natural, both because they produce 
an effect like that of nature, which also gives existence, quantity and 
preservation (although the above forces accomplish these things in a more 
perfect way); and because those forces perform their actions 
instrumentally, through the active and passive qualities, which are the 
principles of natural actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Generation of inanimate things is entirely from an 
extrinsic source; whereas the generation of living things is in a higher 
way, through something in the living thing itself, which is the semen 
containing the principle productive of the body. Therefore there must be 
in the living thing a power that prepares this semen; and this is the 
generative power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the generation of living things is from a semen, it 
is necessary that in the beginning an animal of small size be generated. 
For this reason it must have a power in the soul, whereby it is brought 
to its appropriate size. But the inanimate body is generated from 
determinate matter by an extrinsic agent; therefore it receives at once 
its nature and its quantity, according to the condition of the matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As we have said above (<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the operation of the 
vegetative principle is performed by means of heat, the property of which 
is to consume humidity. Therefore, in order to restore the humidity thus 
lost, the nutritive power is required, whereby the food is changed into 
the substance of the body. This is also necessary for the action of the 
augmentative and generative powers.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the five exterior senses are properly distinguished?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem inaccurate to distinguish five exterior senses. But 
there are many kinds of accidents. Therefore, as powers are distinguished 
by their objects, it seems that the senses are multiplied according to 
the number of the kinds of accidents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, magnitude and shape, and other things which are called 
"common sensibles," are "not sensibles by accident," but are 
contradistinguished from them by the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 6). Now 
the diversity of objects, as such, diversifies the powers. Since, 
therefore, magnitude and shape are further from color than sound is, it 
seems that there is much more need for another sensitive power than can 
grasp magnitude or shape than for that which grasps color or sound.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one sense regards one contrariety; as sight  regards 
white and black. But the sense of touch grasps several contraries; such 
as hot or cold, damp or dry, and suchlike. Therefore it is not a single 
sense but several. Therefore there are more than five senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a species is not divided against its genus. But taste is 
a kind of touch. Therefore it should not be classed as a distinct sense 
of touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 1): "There is no 
other besides the five senses."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The reason of the distinction and number of the senses 
has been assigned by some to the organs in which one or other of the 
elements preponderate, as water, air, or the like. By others it has been 
assigned to the medium, which is either in conjunction or extrinsic and 
is either water or air, or such like. Others have ascribed it to the 
various natures of the sensible qualities, according as such quality 
belongs to a simple body or results from complexity. But none of these 
explanations is apt. For the powers are not for the organs, but the 
organs for the powers; wherefore there are not various powers for the 
reason that there are various organs; on the contrary, for this has 
nature provided a variety of organs, that they might be adapted to 
various powers. In the same way nature provided various mediums for the 
various senses, according to the convenience of the acts of the powers. 
And to be cognizant of the natures of sensible qualities does not pertain 
to the senses, but to the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason of the number and distinction of the exterior senses must 
therefore be ascribed to that which belongs to the senses properly and 
"per se." Now, sense is a passive power, and is naturally immuted by the 
exterior sensible. Wherefore the exterior cause of such immutation is 
what is "per se" perceived by the sense, and according to the diversity 
of that exterior cause are the sensitive powers diversified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, immutation is of two kinds, one natural, the other spiritual. 
Natural immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received 
according to its natural existence, into the thing immuted, as heat is 
received into the thing heated. Whereas spiritual immutation takes place 
by the form of the immuter being received, according to a spiritual mode 
of existence, into the thing immuted, as the form of color is received 
into the pupil which does not thereby become colored. Now, for the 
operation of the senses, a spiritual immutation is required, whereby an 
intention of the sensible form is effected in the sensile organ. 
Otherwise, if a natural immutation alone sufficed for the sense's action, 
all natural bodies would feel when they undergo alteration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in some senses we find spiritual immutation only, as in "sight" 
while in others we find not only spiritual but also a natural immutation; 
either on the part of the object only, or likewise on the part of the 
organ. On the part of the object we  find natural immutation, as to 
place, in sound which is the object of "hearing"; for sound is caused by 
percussion and commotion of air: and we find natural immutation by 
alteration, in odor which is the object of "smelling"; for in order to 
exhale an odor, a body must be in a measure affected by heat. On the part 
of an organ, natural immutation takes place in "touch" and "taste"; for 
the hand that touches something hot becomes hot, while the tongue is 
moistened by the humidity of the flavored morsel. But the organs of 
smelling and hearing are not affected in their respective operations by 
any natural immutation unless indirectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the sight, which is without natural immutation either in its organ 
or in its object, is the most spiritual, the most perfect, and the most 
universal of all the senses. After this comes the hearing and then the 
smell, which require a natural immutation on the part of the object; 
while local motion is more perfect than, and naturally prior to, the 
motion of alteration, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 7). Touch 
and taste are the most material of all: of the distinction of which we 
shall speak later on (ad 3,4). Hence it is that the three other senses 
are not exercised through a medium united to them, to obviate any natural 
immutation in their organ; as happens as regards these two senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not every accident has in itself a power of immutation but 
only qualities of the third species, which are the principles of 
alteration: therefore only suchlike qualities are the objects of the 
senses; because "the senses are affected by the same things whereby 
inanimate bodies are affected," as stated in Phys. vii, 2.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Size, shape, and the like, which are called "common 
sensibles," are midway between "accidental sensibles" and "proper 
sensibles," which are the objects of the senses. For the proper sensibles 
first, and of their very nature, affect the senses; since they are 
qualities that cause alteration. But the common sensibles are all 
reducible to quantity. As to size and number, it is clear that they are 
species of quantity. Shape is a quality about quantity. Shape is a 
quality about quantity, since the notion of shape consists of fixing the 
bounds of magnitude. Movement and rest are sensed according as the 
subject is affected in one or more ways in the magnitude of the subject 
or of its local distance, as in the movement of growth or of locomotion, 
or again, according as it is affected in some sensible qualities, as in 
the movement of alteration; and thus to sense movement and rest is, in a 
way, to sense one thing and many. Now quantity is the proximate subject 
of the qualities that cause alteration, as surface is of color. Therefore 
the common sensibles do not move the senses first and of their own 
nature, but by reason of the sensible quality; as the surface by reason 
of color. Yet they are not accidental sensibles, for they produce a 
certain variety in the immutation of the senses. For sense is immuted 
differently by a large and by a small surface: since whiteness itself is 
said to be great or small, and therefore it is divided according to its 
proper subject.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher seems to say (De Anima ii, 11), the 
sense of touch is generically one, but is divided into several specific 
senses, and for this reason it extends to various contrarieties; which 
senses, however, are not separate from one another in their organ, but 
are spread throughout the whole body, so that their distinction is not 
evident. But taste, which perceives the sweet and the bitter, accompanies 
touch in the tongue, but not in the whole body; so it is easily 
distinguished from touch. We might also say that all those contrarieties 
agree, each in some proximate genus, and all in a common genus, which is 
the common and formal object of touch. Such common genus is, however, 
unnamed, just as the proximate genus of hot and cold is unnamed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The sense of taste, according to a saying of the 
Philosopher (De Anima ii, 9), is a kind of touch existing in the tongue 
only. It is not distinct from touch in general, but only from the species 
of touch distributed in the body. But if touch is one sense only, on 
account of the common formality of its object: we must say that taste is 
distinguished from touch by reason of a different formality of 
immutation. For touch involves a natural, and not only a spiritual, 
immutation in its organ, by reason of the quality which is its proper 
object. But the organ of taste is not necessarily immuted by a natural 
immutation by reason of the quality which is its proper object, so that 
the tongue itself becomes sweet and bitter: but by reason of a quality 
which is a preamble to, and on which is based, the flavor, which quality 
is moisture, the object of touch.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the interior senses are suitably distinguished?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the interior senses are not suitably 
distinguished. For the common is not divided against the proper. 
Therefore the common sense should not be numbered among the interior 
sensitive powers, in addition to the proper exterior senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no need to assign an interior power of 
apprehension when the proper and exterior sense suffices. But the proper 
and exterior senses suffice for us to judge of sensible things; for each 
sense judges of its proper object. In like manner they seem to suffice 
for the perception of their own actions; for since the action of the 
sense is, in a way, between the power and its object, it seems that sight 
must be much more able to perceive its own vision, as being nearer to it, 
than the color; and in like manner with the other senses. Therefore for 
this there is no need to assign an interior power, called the common 
sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (De Memor. et Remin. i), 
the imagination and the memory are passions of the "first sensitive." But 
passion is not divided against its subject. Therefore memory and 
imagination should not be assigned as powers distinct from the senses. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the intellect depends on the senses less than any power 
of the sensitive part. But the intellect knows nothing but what it 
receives from the senses; whence we read (Poster. i, 8), that "those who 
lack one sense lack one kind of knowledge." Therefore much less should we 
assign to the sensitive part a power, which they call the "estimative" 
power, for the perception of intentions which the sense does not perceive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the action of the cogitative power, which consists in 
comparing, adding and dividing, and the action of the reminiscence, which 
consists in the use of a kind of syllogism for the sake of inquiry, is 
not less distant from the actions of the estimative and memorative 
powers, than the action of the estimative is from the action of the 
imagination. Therefore either we must add the cognitive and reminiscitive 
to the estimative and memorative powers, or the estimative and memorative 
powers should not be made distinct from the imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7,24) describes three 
kinds of vision; namely, corporeal, which is the action of the sense; 
spiritual, which is an action of the imagination or phantasy; and 
intellectual, which is an action of the intellect. Therefore there is no 
interior power between the sense and intellect, besides the imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Avicenna (De Anima iv, 1) assigns five interior 
sensitive powers; namely, "common sense, phantasy, imagination, and the 
estimative and memorative powers."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As nature does not fail in necessary things, there must 
needs be as many actions of the sensitive soul as may suffice for the 
life of a perfect animal. If any of these actions cannot be reduced to 
the same one principle, they must be assigned to diverse powers; since a 
power of the soul is nothing else than the proximate principle of the 
soul's operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we must observe that for the life of a perfect animal, the animal 
should apprehend a thing not only at the actual time of sensation, but 
also when it is absent. Otherwise, since animal motion and action follow 
apprehension, an animal would not be moved to seek something absent: the 
contrary of which we may observe specially in perfect animals, which are 
moved by progression, for they are moved towards something apprehended 
and absent. Therefore an animal through the sensitive soul must not only 
receive the species of sensible things, when it is actually affected by 
them, but it must also retain and preserve them. Now to receive and 
retain are, in corporeal things, reduced to diverse principles; for moist 
things are apt to receive, but retain with difficulty, while it is the 
reverse with dry things. Wherefore, since the sensitive power is the act 
of a corporeal organ, it follows that the power which receives the 
species of sensible things must be distinct from the power which 
preserves them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Body Para. 3/5 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again we must observe that if an animal were moved by pleasing and 
disagreeable things only as affecting the sense, there would be no need 
to suppose that an animal has a power besides the apprehension of those 
forms which the senses perceive, and in which the animal takes pleasure, 
or from which it shrinks with horror. But the animal needs to seek or to 
avoid certain things, not only because they are pleasing or otherwise to 
the senses, but also on account of other advantages and uses, or 
disadvantages: just as the sheep runs away when it sees a wolf, not on 
account of its color or shape, but as a natural enemy: and again a bird 
gathers together straws, not because they are pleasant to the sense, but 
because they are useful for building its nest. Animals, therefore, need 
to perceive such intentions, which the exterior sense does not perceive. 
And some distinct principle is necessary for this; since the perception 
of sensible forms comes by an immutation caused by the sensible, which is 
not the case with the perception of those intentions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, therefore, for the reception of sensible forms, the "proper sense" 
and the "common sense" are appointed, and of their distinction we shall 
speak farther on (ad 1,2). But for the retention and preservation of 
these forms, the "phantasy" or "imagination" is appointed; which are the 
same, for phantasy or imagination is as it were a storehouse of forms 
received through the senses. Furthermore, for the apprehension of 
intentions which are not received through the senses, the "estimative" 
power is appointed: and for the preservation thereof, the "memorative" 
power, which is a storehouse of such-like intentions. A sign of which we 
have in the fact that the principle of memory in animals is found in some 
such intention, for instance, that something is harmful or otherwise. And 
the very formality of the past, which memory observes, is to be reckoned 
among these intentions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no difference 
between man and other animals; for they are similarly immuted by the 
extrinsic sensible. But there is a difference as to the above intentions: 
for other animals perceive these intentions only by some natural 
instinct, while man perceives them by means of coalition of ideas. 
Therefore the power by which in other animals is called the natural 
estimative, in man is called the "cogitative," which by some sort of 
collation discovers these intentions. Wherefore it is also called the 
"particular reason," to which medical men assign a certain particular 
organ, namely, the middle part of the head: for it compares individual 
intentions, just as the intellectual reason compares universal 
intentions. As to the memorative power, man has not only memory, as other 
animals have in the sudden recollection of the past; but also 
"reminiscence" by syllogistically, as it were, seeking for a recollection 
of the past by the application of individual intentions. Avicenna, 
however, assigns between the estimative and the imaginative, a fifth 
power, which combines and divides imaginary forms: as when from the 
imaginary form of gold, and imaginary form of a mountain, we compose the 
one form of a golden mountain, which we have never seen. But this 
operation is not to be  found in animals other than man, in whom the 
imaginative power suffices thereto. To man also does Averroes attribute 
this action in his book De sensu et sensibilibus (viii). So there is no 
need to assign more than four interior powers of the sensitive 
part---namely, the common sense, the imagination, and the estimative and 
memorative powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The interior sense is called "common" not by predication, 
as if it were a genus; but as the common root and principle of the 
exterior senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The proper sense judges of the proper sensible by 
discerning it from other things which come under the same sense; for 
instance, by discerning white from black or green. But neither sight nor 
taste can discern white from sweet: because what discerns between two 
things must know both. Wherefore the discerning judgment must be assigned 
to the common sense; to which, as to a common term, all apprehensions of 
the senses must be referred: and by which, again, all the intentions of 
the senses are perceived; as when someone sees that he sees. For this 
cannot be done by the proper sense, which only knows the form of the 
sensible by which it is immuted, in which immutation the action of sight 
is completed, and from immutation follows another in the common sense 
which perceives the act of vision.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As one power arises from the soul by means of another, as 
we have seen above (<A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), so also the soul is the subject of one 
power through another. In this way the imagination and the memory are 
called passions of the "first sensitive."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although the operation of the intellect has its origin in 
the senses: yet, in the thing apprehended through the senses, the 
intellect knows many things which the senses cannot perceive. In like 
manner does the estimative power, though in a less perfect manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The cogitative and memorative powers in man owe their 
excellence not to that which is proper to the sensitive part; but to a 
certain affinity and proximity to the universal reason, which, so to 
speak, overflows into them. Therefore they are not distinct powers, but 
the same, yet more perfect than in other animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[78] A[4] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Augustine calls that vision spiritual which is effected by 
the images of bodies in the absence of bodies. Whence it is clear that it 
is common to all interior apprehensions.<br>
