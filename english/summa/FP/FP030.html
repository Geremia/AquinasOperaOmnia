  <h3 align="left">Whether there are several persons in God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not several persons
    in God. For person is "the individual substance of a rational nature." If
    then there are several persons in God, there must be several substances;
    which appears to be heretical.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Plurality of absolute properties does
    not make a distinction of persons, either in God, or in ourselves. Much less
    therefore is this effected by a plurality of relations. But in God there is
    no plurality but of relations (<a href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1"
      >Question [28]</a
    >, <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore there
    cannot be several persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Boethius says of God (De Trin. i), that
    "this is truly one which has no number." But plurality implies number.
    Therefore there are not several persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, where number is, there is whole and
    part. Thus, if in God there exist a number of persons, there must be whole
    and part in God; which is inconsistent with the divine simplicity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Athanasius says: "One is the person of the
    Father, another of the Son, another of the Holy Ghost." Therefore the
    Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are several persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It follows from what precedes that there are
    several persons in God. For it was shown above (<a
      href="FP029.html#FPQ29OUTP1"
      >Question [29]</a
    >, <a href="FP029.html#FPQ29A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that this word
    "person" signifies in God a relation as subsisting in the divine nature. It
    was also established (<a href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>,
    <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that there are several
    real relations in God; and hence it follows that there are also several
    realities subsistent in the divine nature; which means that there are
    several persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The definition of "person" includes
    "substance," not as meaning the essence, but the "suppositum" which is made
    clear by the addition of the term "individual." To signify the substance
    thus understood, the Greeks use the name "hypostasis." So, as we say, "Three
    persons," they say "Three hypostases." We are not, however, accustomed to
    say Three substances, lest we be understood to mean three essences or
    natures, by reason of the equivocal signification of the term.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The absolute properties in God, such as
    goodness and wisdom, are not mutually opposed; and hence, neither are they
    really distinguished from each other. Therefore, although they subsist,
    nevertheless they are not several subsistent realities---that is, several
    persons. But the absolute properties in creatures do not subsist, although
    they are really distinguished from each other, as whiteness and sweetness;
    on the other hand, the relative properties in God subsist, and are really
    distinguished from each other (<a href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1"
      >Question [28]</a
    >, <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence the plurality
    of persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The supreme unity and simplicity of God
    exclude every kind of plurality of absolute things, but not plurality of
    relations. Because relations are predicated relatively, and thus the
    relations do not import composition in that of which they are predicated, as
    Boethius teaches in the same book.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Number is twofold, simple or absolute,
    as two and three and four; and number as existing in things numbered, as two
    men and two horses. So, if number in God is taken absolutely or
    abstractedly, there is nothing to prevent whole and part from being in Him,
    and thus number in Him is only in our way of understanding; forasmuch as
    number regarded apart from things numbered exists only in the intellect. But
    if number be taken as it is in the things numbered, in that sense as
    existing in creatures, one is part of two, and two of three, as one man is
    part of two men, and two of three; but this does not apply to God, because
    the Father is of the same magnitude as the whole Trinity, as we shall show
    further on (<a href="FP042.html#FPQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>,

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are more than three persons in God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are more than three
    persons in God. For the plurality of persons in God arises from the
    plurality of the relative properties as stated above (<a
      href="FP030.html#FPQ30A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). But there are four relations in God as stated above (<a
      href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1"
      >Question [28]</a
    >, <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), paternity, filiation,
    common spiration, and procession. Therefore there are four persons in
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> The nature of God does not differ from His will
    more than from His intellect. But in God, one person proceeds from the will,
    as love; and another proceeds from His nature, as Son. Therefore another
    proceeds from His intellect, as Word, besides the one Who proceeds from His
    nature, as Son; thus again it follows that there are not only three persons
    in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more perfect a creature is, the more
    interior operations it has; as a man has understanding and will beyond other
    animals. But God infinitely excels every creature. Therefore in God not only
    is there a person proceeding from the will, and another from the intellect,
    but also in an infinite number of ways. Therefore there are an infinite
    number of persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is from the infinite goodness of the
    Father that He communicates Himself infinitely in the production of a divine
    person. But also in the Holy Ghost is infinite goodness. Therefore the Holy
    Ghost produces a divine person; and that person another; and so to
    infinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, everything within a determinate number
    is measured, for number is a measure. But the divine persons are immense, as
    we say in the Creed of Athanasius: "The Father is immense, the Son is
    immense, the Holy Ghost is immense." Therefore the persons are not contained
    within the number three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "There are three who bear witness
    in heaven, the father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++5%3A7"
      >1 Jn. 5:7</a
    >). To those who ask, "Three what?" we answer, with Augustine (De Trin. vii,
    4), "Three persons." Therefore there are but three persons in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was explained above, there can be only three
    persons in God. For it was shown above that the several persons are the
    several subsisting relations really distinct from each other. But a real
    distinction between the divine relations can come only from relative
    opposition. Therefore two opposite relations must needs refer to two
    persons: and if any relations are not opposite they must needs belong to the
    same person. Since then paternity and filiation are opposite relations, they
    belong necessarily to two persons. Therefore the subsisting paternity is the
    person of the Father; and the subsisting filiation is the person of the Son.
    The other two relations are not opposed to each other; therefore these two
    cannot belong to one person: hence either one of them must belong to both of
    the aforesaid persons; or one must belong to one person, and the other to
    the other. Now, procession cannot belong to the Father and the Son, or to
    either of them; for thus it would follows that the procession of the
    intellect, which in God is generation, wherefrom paternity and filiation are
    derived, would issue from the procession of love, whence spiration and
    procession are derived, if the person generating and the person generated
    proceeded from the person spirating; and this is against what was laid down
    above (<a href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). We must frequently
    admit that spiration belongs to the person of the Father, and to the person
    of the Son, forasmuch as it has no relative opposition either to paternity
    or to filiation; and consequently that procession belongs to the other
    person who is called the person of the Holy Ghost, who proceeds by way of
    love, as above explained. Therefore only three persons exist in God, the
    Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although there are four relations in
    God, one of them, spiration, is not separated from the person of the Father
    and of the Son, but belongs to both; thus, although it is a relation, it is
    not called a property, because it does not belong to only one person; nor is
    it a personal relation---i.e. constituting a person. The three
    relations---paternity, filiation, and procession---are called personal
    properties, constituting as it were the persons; for paternity is the person
    of the Father, filiation is the person of the Son, procession is the person
    of the Holy Ghost proceeding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which proceeds by way of
    intelligence, as word, proceeds according to similitude, as also that which
    proceeds by way of nature; thus, as above explained (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the procession of the
    divine Word is the very same as generation by way of nature. But love, as
    such, does not proceed as the similitude of that whence it proceeds;
    although in God love is co-essential as being divine; and therefore the
    procession of love is not called generation in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As man is more perfect than other
    animals, he has more intrinsic operations than other animals, because his
    perfection is something composite. Hence the angels, who are more perfect
    and more simple, have fewer intrinsic operations than man, for they have no
    imagination, or feeling, or the like. In God there exists only one real
    operation---that is, His essence. How there are in Him two processions was
    above explained (<a href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument would prove if the Holy
    Ghost possessed another goodness apart from the goodness of the Father; for
    then if the Father produced a divine person by His goodness, the Holy Ghost
    also would do so. But the Father and the Holy Ghost have one and the same
    goodness. Nor is there any distinction between them except by the personal
    relations. So goodness belongs to the Holy Ghost, as derived from another;
    and it belongs to the Father, as the principle of its communication to
    another. The opposition of relation does not allow the relation of the Holy
    Ghost to be joined with the relation of principle of another divine person;
    because He Himself proceeds from the other persons who are in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A determinate number, if taken as a
    simple number, existing in the mind only, is measured by one. But when we
    speak of a number of things as applied to the persons in God, the notion of
    measure has no place, because the magnitude of the three persons is the same
    (<a href="FP042.html#FPQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>,
    <a href="FP042.html#FPQ42ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4), and the same is not
    measured by the same.

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the numeral terms denote anything real in God?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the numeral terms denote
    something real in God. For the divine unity is the divine essence. But every
    number is unity repeated. Therefore every numeral term in God signifies the
    essence; and therefore it denotes something real in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is said of God and of
    creatures, belongs to God in a more eminent manner than to creatures. But
    the numeral terms denote something real in creatures; therefore much more so
    in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the numeral terms do not denote
    anything real in God, and are introduced simply in a negative and removing
    sense, as plurality is employed to remove unity, and unity to remove
    plurality; it follows that a vicious circle results, confusing the mind and
    obscuring the truth; and this ought not to be. Therefore it must be said
    that the numeral terms denote something real in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. iv): "If we admit
    companionship"---that is, plurality---"we exclude the idea of oneness and of
    solitude;" and Ambrose says (De Fide i): "When we say one God, unity
    excludes plurality of gods, and does not imply quantity in God." Hence we
    see that these terms are applied to God in order to remove something; and
    not to denote anything positive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Master (Sent. i, D, 24) considers that the
    numeral terms do not denote anything positive in God, but have only a
    negative meaning. Others, however, assert the contrary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to resolve this point, we may observe that all plurality is a
    consequence of division. Now division is twofold; one is material, and is
    division of the continuous; from this results number, which is a species of
    quantity. Number in this sense is found only in material things which have
    quantity. The other kind of division is called formal, and is effected by
    opposite or diverse forms; and this kind of division results in a multitude,
    which does not belong to a genus, but is transcendental in the sense in
    which being is divided by one and by many. This kind of multitude is found
    only in immaterial things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, considering only that multitude which is a species of discrete
    quantity, and seeing that such kind of quantity has no place in God,
    asserted that the numeral terms do not denote anything real in God, but
    remove something from Him. Others, considering the same kind of multitude,
    said that as knowledge exists in God according to the strict sense of the
    word, but not in the sense of its genus (as in God there is no such thing as
    a quality), so number exists in God in the proper sense of number, but not
    in the sense of its genus, which is quantity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But we say that numeral terms predicated of God are not derived from number,
    a species of quantity, for in that sense they could bear only a metaphorical
    sense in God, like other corporeal properties, such as length, breadth, and
    the like; but that they are taken from multitude in a transcendent sense.
    Now multitude so understood has relation to the many of which it is
    predicated, as "one" convertible with "being" is related to being; which
    kind of oneness does not add anything to being, except a negation of
    division, as we saw when treating of the divine unity (<a
      href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1"
      >Question [11]</a
    >, <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); for "one" signifies
    undivided being. So, of whatever we say "one," we imply its undivided
    reality: thus, for instance, "one" applied to man signifies the undivided
    nature or substance of a man. In the same way, when we speak of many things,
    multitude in this latter sense points to those things as being each
    undivided in itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But number, if taken as a species of quantity, denotes an accident added to
    being; as also does "one" which is the principle of that number. Therefore
    the numeral terms in God signify the things of which they are said, and
    beyond this they add negation only, as stated (Sent. i, D, 24); in which
    respect the Master was right (Sent. i, D, 24). So when we say, the essence
    is one, the term "one" signifies the essence undivided; and when we say the
    person is one, it signifies the person undivided; and when we say the
    persons are many, we signify those persons, and their individual
    undividedness; for it is of the very nature of multitude that it should be
    composed of units.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> One, as it is a transcendental, is wider
    and more general than substance and relation. And so likewise is multitude;
    hence in God it may mean both substance and relation, according to the
    context. Still, the very signification of such names adds a negation of
    division, beyond substance and relation; as was explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Multitude, which denotes something real
    in creatures, is a species of quantity, and cannot be used when speaking of
    God: unlike transcendental multitude, which adds only indivision to those of
    which it is predicated. Such a kind of multitude is applicable to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "One" does not exclude multitude, but
    division, which logically precedes one or multitude. Multitude does not
    remove unity, but division from each of the individuals which compose the
    multitude. This was explained when we treated of the divine unity (<a
      href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1"
      >Question [11]</a
    >, <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be observed, nevertheless, that the opposite arguments do not
    sufficiently prove the point advanced. Although the idea of solitude is
    excluded by plurality, and the plurality of gods by unity, it does not
    follow that these terms express this signification alone. For blackness is
    excluded by whiteness; nevertheless, the term whiteness does not signify the
    mere exclusion of blackness.<br />

    Whether this term "person" can be common to the three persons?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this term "person" cannot be
    common to the three persons. For nothing is common to the three persons but
    the essence. But this term "person" does not signify the essence directly.
    Therefore it is not common to all three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the common is the opposite to the
    incommunicable. But the very meaning of person is that it is incommunicable;
    as appears from the definition given by Richard of St. Victor (<a
      href="FP029.html#FPQ29OUTP1"
      >Question [29]</a
    >, <a href="FP029.html#FPQ29A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4). Therefore this
    term "person" is not common to all the three persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the name "person" is common to the
    three, it is common either really, or logically. But it is not so really;
    otherwise the three persons would be one person; nor again is it so
    logically; otherwise person would be a universal. But in God there is
    neither universal nor particular; neither genus nor species, as we proved
    above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore this term
    'person' is not common to the three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 4) that when we
    ask, "Three what?" we say, "Three persons," because what a person is, is
    common to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The very mode of expression itself shows that
    this term "person" is common to the three when we say "three persons"; for
    when we say "three men" we show that "man" is common to the three. Now it is
    clear that this is not community of a real thing, as if one essence were
    common to the three; otherwise there would be only one person of the three,
    as also one essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    What is meant by such a community has been variously determined by those who
    have examined the subject. Some have called it a community of exclusion,
    forasmuch as the definition of "person" contains the word "incommunicable."
    Others thought it to be a community of intention, as the definition of
    person contains the word "individual"; as we say that to be a "species" is
    common to horse and ox. Both of these explanations, however, are excluded by
    the fact that "person" is not a name of exclusion nor of intention, but the
    name of a reality. We must therefore resolve that even in human affairs this
    name "person" is common by a community of idea, not as genus or species, but
    as a vague individual thing. The names of genera and species, as man or
    animal, are given to signify the common natures themselves, but not the
    intentions of those common natures, signified by the terms "genus" or
    "species." The vague individual thing, as "some man," signifies the common
    nature with the determinate mode of existence of singular things---that is,
    something self-subsisting, as distinct from others. But the name of a
    designated singular thing signifies that which distinguishes the determinate
    thing; as the name Socrates signifies this flesh and this bone. But there is
    this difference---that the term "some man" signifies the nature, or the
    individual on the part of its nature, with the mode of existence of singular
    things; while this name "person" is not given to signify the individual on
    the part of the nature, but the subsistent reality in that nature. Now this
    is common in idea to the divine persons, that each of them subsists
    distinctly from the others in the divine nature. Thus this name "person" is
    common in idea to the three divine persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is founded on a real
    community.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although person is incommunicable, yet
    the mode itself of incommunicable existence can be common to many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although this community is logical and
    not real, yet it does not follow that in God there is universal or
    particular, or genus, or species; both because neither in human affairs is
    the community of person the same as community of genus or species; and
    because the divine persons have one being; whereas genus and species and
    every other universal are predicated of many which differ in being.<br />
