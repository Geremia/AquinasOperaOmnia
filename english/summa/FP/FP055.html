    OF THE MEDIUM OF THE ANGELIC KNOWLEDGE (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Next in order, the question arises as to the medium of the angelic
    knowledge. Under this heading there are three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A1THEP1">(1)</a> Do the angels know everything by
    their substance, or by some species?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">(2)</a> If by species, is it by connatural
    species, or is it by such as they have derived from things?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A3THEP1">(3)</a> Do the higher angels know by more
    universal species than the lower angels?<br />

    Whether the angels know all things by their substance?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels know all things by
    their substance. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "the angels,
    according to the proper nature of a mind, know the things which are
    happening upon earth." But the angel's nature is his essence. Therefore the
    angel knows things by his essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph.
    xii, text. 51; De Anima iii, text. 15), "in things which are without matter,
    the intellect is the same as the object understood." But the object
    understood is the same as the one who understands it, as regards that
    whereby it is understood. Therefore in things without matter, such as the
    angels, the medium whereby the object is understood is the very substance of
    the one understanding it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything which is contained in another
    is there according to the mode of the container. But an angel has an
    intellectual nature. Therefore whatever is in him is there in an
    intelligible mode. But all things are in him: because the lower orders of
    beings are essentially in the higher, while the higher are in the lower
    participatively: and therefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that God
    "enfolds the whole in the whole," i.e. all in all. Therefore the angel knows
    all things in his substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the
    angels are enlightened by the forms of things." Therefore they know by the
    forms of things, and not by their own substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The medium through which the intellect
    understands, is compared to the intellect understanding it as its form,
    because it is by the form that the agent acts. Now in order that the faculty
    may be perfectly completed by the form, it is necessary for all things to
    which the faculty extends to be contained under the form. Hence it is that
    in things which are corruptible, the form does not perfectly complete the
    potentiality of the matter: because the potentiality of the matter extends
    to more things than are contained under this or that form. But the
    intellective power of the angel extends to understanding all things: because
    the object of the intellect is universal being or universal truth. The
    angel's essence, however, does not comprise all things in itself, since it
    is an essence restricted to a genus and species. This is proper to the
    Divine essence, which is infinite, simply and perfectly to comprise all
    things in Itself. Therefore God alone knows all things by His essence. But
    an angel cannot know all things by his essence; and his intellect must be
    perfected by some species in order to know things.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When it is said that the angel knows
    things according to his own nature, the words "according to" do not
    determine the medium of such knowledge, since the medium is the similitude
    of the thing known; but they denote the knowing power, which belongs to the
    angel of his own nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the sense in act is the sensible in
    act, as stated in De Anima ii, text. 53, not so that the sensitive power is
    the sensible object's likeness contained in the sense, but because one thing
    is made from both as from act and potentiality: so likewise the intellect in
    act is said to be the thing understood in act, not that the substance of the
    intellect is itself the similitude by which it understands, but because that
    similitude is its form. Now, it is precisely the same thing to say "in
    things which are without matter, the intellect is the same thing as the
    object understood," as to say that "the intellect in act is the thing
    understood in act"; for a thing is actually understood, precisely because it
    is immaterial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The things which are beneath the angel,
    and those which are above him, are in a measure in his substance, not indeed
    perfectly, nor according to their own proper formality---because the angel's
    essence, as being finite, is distinguished by its own formality from other
    things---but according to some common formality. Yet all things are
    perfectly and according to their own formality in God's essence, as in the
    first and universal operative power, from which proceeds whatever is proper
    or common to anything. Therefore God has a proper knowledge of all things by
    His own essence: and this the angel has not, but only a common knowledge.<br />

    Whether the angels understand by species drawn from things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels understand by
    species drawn from things. For everything understood is apprehended by some
    likeness within him who understands it. But the likeness of the thing
    existing in another is there either by way of an exemplar, so that the
    likeness is the cause of the thing; or else by way of an image, so that it
    is caused by such thing. All knowledge, then, of the person understanding
    must either be the cause of the object understood, or else caused by it. Now
    the angel's knowledge is not the cause of existing things; that belongs to
    the Divine knowledge alone. Therefore it is necessary for the species, by
    which the angelic mind understands, to be derived from things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angelic light is stronger than the
    light of the active intellect of the soul. But the light of the active
    intellect abstracts intelligible species from phantasms. Therefore the light
    of the angelic mind can also abstract species from sensible things. So there
    is nothing to hinder us from saying that the angel understands through
    species drawn from things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the species in the intellect are
    indifferent to what is present or distant, except in so far as they are
    taken from sensible objects. Therefore, if the angel does not understand by
    species drawn from things, his knowledge would be indifferent as to things
    present and distant; and so he would be moved locally to no purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that the
    "angels do not gather their Divine knowledge from things divisible or
    sensible."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The species whereby the angels understand are
    not drawn from things, but are connatural to them. For we must observe that
    there is a similarity between the distinction and order of spiritual
    substances and the distinction and order of corporeal substances. The
    highest bodies have in their nature a potentiality which is fully perfected
    by the form; whereas in the lower bodies the potentiality of matter is not
    entirely perfected by the form, but receives from some agent, now one form,
    now another. In like fashion also the lower intellectual substances ---that
    is to say, human souls---have a power of understanding which is not
    naturally complete, but is successively completed in them by their drawing
    intelligible species from things. But in the higher spiritual
    substances---that is, the angels---the power of understanding is naturally
    complete by intelligible species, in so far as they have such species
    connatural to them, so as to understand all things which they can know
    naturally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The same is evident from the manner of existence of such substances. The
    lower spiritual substances---that is, souls---have a nature akin to a body,
    in so far as they are the forms of bodies: and consequently from their very
    mode of existence it behooves them to seek their intelligible perfection
    from bodies, and through bodies; otherwise they would be united with bodies
    to no purpose. On the other hand, the higher substances---that is, the
    angels---are utterly free from bodies, and subsist immaterially and in their
    own intelligible nature; consequently they attain their intelligible
    perfection through an intelligible outpouring, whereby they received from
    God the species of things known, together with their intellectual nature.
    Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8): "The other things which are lower
    than the angels are so created that they first receive existence in the
    knowledge of the rational creature, and then in their own nature."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are images of creatures in the
    angel's mind, not, indeed derived from creatures, but from God, Who is the
    cause of creatures, and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first exist.
    Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that, "As the type, according to
    which the creature is fashioned, is in the Word of God before the creature
    which is fashioned, so the knowledge of the same type exists first in the
    intellectual creature, and is afterwards the very fashioning of the
    creature."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To go from one extreme to the other it
    is necessary to pass through the middle. Now the nature of a form in the
    imagination, which form is without matter but not without material
    conditions, stands midway between the nature of a form which is in matter,
    and the nature of a form which is in the intellect by abstraction from
    matter and from material conditions. Consequently, however powerful the
    angelic mind might be, it could not reduce material forms to an intelligible
    condition, except it were first to reduce them to the nature of imagined
    forms; which is impossible, since the angel has no imagination, as was said
    above (<a href="FP054.html#FPQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>,
    <a href="FP054.html#FPQ54A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Even granted that he
    could abstract intelligible species from material things, yet he would not
    do so; because he would not need them, for he has connatural intelligible
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The angel's knowledge is quite
    indifferent as to what is near or distant. Nevertheless his local movement
    is not purposeless on that account: for he is not moved to a place for the
    purpose of acquiring knowledge, but for the purpose of operation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the higher angels understand by more universal species than the
    lower angels?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the higher angels do not
    understand by more universal species than the lower angels. For the
    universal, seemingly, is what is abstracted from particulars. But angels do
    not understand by species abstracted from things. Therefore it cannot be
    said that the species of the angelic intellect are more or less
    universal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is known in detail is more
    perfectly known than what is known generically; because to know anything
    generically is, in a fashion, midway between potentiality and act. If,
    therefore, the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower,
    it follows that the higher have a more imperfect knowledge than the lower;
    which is not befitting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same cannot be the proper type of
    many. But if the higher angel knows various things by one universal form,
    which the lower angel knows by several special forms, it follows that the
    higher angel uses one universal form for knowing various things. Therefore
    he will not be able to have a proper knowledge of each; which seems
    unbecoming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xii) that the
    higher angels have a more universal knowledge than the lower. And in De
    Causis it is said that the higher angels have more universal forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> For this reason are some things of a more
    exalted nature, because they are nearer to and more like unto the first,
    which is God. Now in God the whole plenitude of intellectual knowledge is
    contained in one thing, that is to say, in the Divine essence, by which God
    knows all things. This plenitude of knowledge is found in created intellects
    in a lower manner, and less simply. Consequently it is necessary for the
    lower intelligences to know by many forms what God knows by one, and by so
    many forms the more according as the intellect is lower.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus the higher the angel is, by so much the fewer species will he be able
    to apprehend the whole mass of intelligible objects. Therefore his forms
    must be more universal; each one of them, as it were, extending to more
    things. An example of this can in some measure be observed in ourselves. For
    some people there are who cannot grasp an intelligible truth, unless it be
    explained to them in every part and detail; this comes of their weakness of
    intellect: while there are others of stronger intellect, who can grasp many
    things from few.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is accidental to the universal to be
    abstracted from particulars, in so far as the intellect knowing it derives
    its knowledge from things. But if there be an intellect which does not
    derive its knowledge from things, the universal which it knows will not be
    abstracted from things, but in a measure will be pre-existing to them;
    either according to the order of causality, as the universal ideas of things
    are in the Word of God; or at least in the order of nature, as the universal
    ideas of things are in the angelic mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To know anything universally can be
    taken in two senses. In one way, on the part of the thing known, namely,
    that only the universal nature of the thing is known. To know a thing thus
    is something less perfect: for he would have but an imperfect knowledge of a
    man who only knew him to be an animal. In another way, on the part of the
    medium of such knowledge. In this way it is more perfect to know a thing in
    the universal; for the intellect, which by one universal medium can know
    each of the things which are properly contained in it, is more perfect than
    one which cannot.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same cannot be the proper and
    adequate type of several things. But if it be eminent, then it can be taken
    as the proper type and likeness of many. Just as in man, there is a
    universal prudence with respect to all the acts of the virtues; which can be
    taken as the proper type and likeness of that prudence which in the lion
    leads to acts of magnanimity, and in the fox to acts of wariness; and so on
    of the rest. The Divine essence, on account of Its eminence, is in like
    fashion taken as the proper type of each thing contained therein: hence each
    one is likened to It according to its proper type. The same applies to the
    universal form which is in the mind of the angel, so that, on account of its
    excellence, many things can be known through it with a proper knowledge.<br />
