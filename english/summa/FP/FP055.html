<H3 Align="Center">OF THE MEDIUM OF THE ANGELIC KNOWLEDGE (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next in order, the question arises as to the medium of the angelic 
knowledge. Under this heading there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A1THEP1">(1)</a> Do the angels know everything by their substance, or by  some 
species?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">(2)</a> If by species, is it by connatural species, or is it by such as they 
have derived from things?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A3THEP1">(3)</a> Do the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower 
angels?<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels know all things by their substance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels know all things by their substance. 
For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "the angels, according to the 
proper nature of a mind, know the things which are happening upon earth." 
But the angel's nature is his essence. Therefore the angel knows things 
by his essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. xii, text. 51; De 
Anima iii, text. 15), "in things which are without matter, the intellect 
is the same as the object understood." But the object understood is the 
same as the one who understands it, as regards that whereby it is 
understood. Therefore in things without matter, such as the angels, the 
medium whereby the object is understood is the very substance of the one 
understanding it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything which is contained in another is there 
according to the mode of the container. But an angel has an intellectual 
nature. Therefore whatever is in him is there in an intelligible mode. 
But all things are in him: because the lower orders of beings are 
essentially in the higher, while the higher are in the lower 
participatively: and therefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that God 
"enfolds the whole in the whole," i.e. all in all. Therefore the angel 
knows all things in his substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the angels are 
enlightened by the forms of things." Therefore they know by the forms of 
things, and not by their own substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The medium through which the intellect understands, is 
compared to the intellect understanding it as its form, because it is by 
the form that the agent acts. Now in order that the faculty may be 
perfectly completed by the form, it is necessary for all things to which 
the faculty extends to be contained under the form. Hence it is that in 
things which are corruptible, the form does not perfectly complete the 
potentiality of the matter: because the potentiality of the matter 
extends to more things than are contained under this or that form. But 
the intellective power of the angel extends to understanding all things: 
because the object of the intellect is universal being or universal 
truth. The angel's essence, however, does not comprise all things in 
itself, since it is an essence restricted to a genus and species. This is 
proper to the Divine essence, which is infinite, simply and perfectly to 
comprise all things in Itself. Therefore God alone knows all things by 
His essence. But an angel cannot know all things by his essence; and his 
intellect must be perfected by some species in order to know things. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When it is said that the angel knows things according to 
his own nature, the words "according to" do not determine the medium of 
such knowledge, since the medium is the similitude of the thing known; 
but they denote the knowing power, which belongs to the angel of his own 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the sense in act is the sensible in act, as stated in De 
Anima ii, text. 53, not so that the sensitive power is the sensible 
object's likeness contained in the sense, but because one thing is made 
from both as from act and potentiality: so likewise the intellect in act 
is said to be the thing understood in act, not that the substance of the 
intellect is itself the similitude by which it understands, but because 
that similitude is its form. Now, it is precisely the same thing to say 
"in things which are without matter, the intellect is the same thing as 
the object understood," as to say that "the intellect in act is the thing 
understood in act"; for a thing is actually understood, precisely because 
it is immaterial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The things which are beneath the angel, and those which are 
above him, are in a measure in his substance, not indeed perfectly, nor 
according to their own proper formality---because the angel's essence, as 
being finite, is distinguished by its own formality from other 
things---but according to some common formality. Yet all things are 
perfectly and according to their own formality in God's essence, as in 
the first and universal operative power, from which proceeds whatever is 
proper or common to anything. Therefore God has a proper knowledge of all 
things by His own essence: and this the angel has not, but only a common 
knowledge.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels understand by species drawn from things?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels understand by species drawn from 
things. For everything understood is apprehended by some likeness within 
him who understands it. But the likeness of the thing existing in another 
is there either by way of an exemplar, so that the likeness is the cause 
of the thing; or else by way of an image, so that it is caused by such 
thing. All knowledge, then, of the person understanding must either be 
the cause of the object understood, or else caused by it. Now the angel's 
knowledge is not the cause of existing things; that belongs to the Divine 
knowledge alone. Therefore it is necessary for the species, by which the 
angelic mind understands, to be derived from things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angelic light is stronger than the light of the 
active intellect of the soul. But the light of the active intellect 
abstracts intelligible species from phantasms. Therefore the light of the 
angelic mind can also abstract species from sensible things. So there is 
nothing to hinder us from saying that the angel understands through 
species drawn from things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the species in the intellect are indifferent to what is 
present or distant, except in so far as they are taken from sensible 
objects. Therefore, if the angel does not understand by species drawn 
from things, his knowledge would be indifferent as to things present and 
distant; and so he would be moved locally to no purpose.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that the "angels do not 
gather their Divine knowledge from things divisible or sensible."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The species whereby the angels understand are not drawn 
from things, but are connatural to them. For we must observe that there 
is a similarity between the distinction and order of spiritual substances 
and the distinction and order of corporeal substances. The highest bodies 
have in their nature a potentiality which is fully perfected by the form; 
whereas in the lower bodies the potentiality of matter is not entirely 
perfected by the form, but receives from some agent, now one form, now 
another. In like fashion also the lower intellectual substances ---that 
is to say, human souls---have a power of understanding which is not 
naturally complete, but is successively completed in them by their 
drawing intelligible species from things. But in the higher spiritual 
substances---that is, the angels---the power of understanding is 
naturally complete by intelligible species, in so far as they have such 
species connatural to them, so as to understand all things which they can 
know naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same is evident from the manner of existence of such substances. The 
lower spiritual substances---that is, souls---have a nature akin to a 
body, in so far as they are the forms of bodies: and consequently from 
their very mode of existence it behooves them to seek their intelligible 
perfection from bodies, and through bodies; otherwise they would be 
united with bodies to no purpose. On the other hand, the higher 
substances---that is, the angels---are utterly free from bodies, and 
subsist immaterially and in their own intelligible nature; consequently 
they attain their intelligible perfection through an intelligible 
outpouring, whereby they received from God the species of things known, 
together with their intellectual nature. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad 
lit. ii, 8): "The other things which are lower than the angels are so 
created that they first receive existence in the knowledge of the 
rational creature, and then in their own nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are images of creatures in the angel's mind, not, 
indeed derived from creatures, but from God, Who is the cause of 
creatures, and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first exist. Hence 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that, "As the type, according to 
which the creature is fashioned, is in the Word of God before the 
creature which is fashioned, so the knowledge of the same type exists 
first in the intellectual creature, and is afterwards the very fashioning 
of the creature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To go from one extreme to the other it is  necessary to 
pass through the middle. Now the nature of a form in the imagination, 
which form is without matter but not without material conditions, stands 
midway between the nature of a form which is in matter, and the nature of 
a form which is in the intellect by abstraction from matter and from 
material conditions. Consequently, however powerful the angelic mind 
might be, it could not reduce material forms to an intelligible 
condition, except it were first to reduce them to the nature of imagined 
forms; which is impossible, since the angel has no imagination, as was 
said above (<A Href="FP054.html#FPQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="FP054.html#FPQ54A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Even granted that he could abstract 
intelligible species from material things, yet he would not do so; 
because he would not need them, for he has connatural intelligible 
species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The angel's knowledge is quite indifferent as to what is 
near or distant. Nevertheless his local movement is not purposeless on 
that account: for he is not moved to a place for the purpose of acquiring 
knowledge, but for the purpose of operation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the higher angels understand by more universal species than the lower angels?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the higher angels do not understand by more 
universal species than the lower angels. For the universal, seemingly, is 
what is abstracted from particulars. But angels do not understand by 
species abstracted from things. Therefore it cannot be said that the 
species of the angelic intellect are more or less universal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is known in detail is more perfectly known than 
what is known generically; because to know anything generically is, in a 
fashion, midway between potentiality and act. If, therefore, the higher 
angels know by more universal species than the lower, it follows that the 
higher have a more imperfect knowledge than the lower; which is not 
befitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same cannot be the proper type of many. But if the 
higher angel knows various things by one universal form, which the lower 
angel knows by several special forms, it follows that the higher angel 
uses one universal form for knowing various things. Therefore he will not 
be able to have a proper knowledge of each; which seems unbecoming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xii) that the higher angels 
have a more universal knowledge than the lower. And in De Causis it is 
said that the higher angels have more universal forms.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> For this reason are some things of a more exalted nature, 
because they are nearer to and more like unto the first, which is God. 
Now in God the whole plenitude of intellectual knowledge is contained in 
one thing, that is to say, in the Divine essence, by which God knows all 
things. This plenitude of knowledge is found in created intellects in a 
lower manner, and less simply.  Consequently it is necessary for the 
lower intelligences to know by many forms what God knows by one, and by 
so many forms the more according as the intellect is lower.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the higher the angel is, by so much the fewer species will he be 
able to apprehend the whole mass of intelligible objects. Therefore his 
forms must be more universal; each one of them, as it were, extending to 
more things. An example of this can in some measure be observed in 
ourselves. For some people there are who cannot grasp an intelligible 
truth, unless it be explained to them in every part and detail; this 
comes of their weakness of intellect: while there are others of stronger 
intellect, who can grasp many things from few.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is accidental to the universal to be abstracted from 
particulars, in so far as the intellect knowing it derives its knowledge 
from things. But if there be an intellect which does not derive its 
knowledge from things, the universal which it knows will not be 
abstracted from things, but in a measure will be pre-existing to them; 
either according to the order of causality, as the universal ideas of 
things are in the Word of God; or at least in the order of nature, as the 
universal ideas of things are in the angelic mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To know anything universally can be taken in two senses. In 
one way, on the part of the thing known, namely, that only the universal 
nature of the thing is known. To know a thing thus is something less 
perfect: for he would have but an imperfect knowledge of a man who only 
knew him to be an animal. In another way, on the part of the medium of 
such knowledge. In this way it is more perfect to know a thing in the 
universal; for the intellect, which by one universal medium can know each 
of the things which are properly contained in it, is more perfect than 
one which cannot.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same cannot be the proper and adequate type of several 
things. But if it be eminent, then it can be taken as the proper type and 
likeness of many. Just as in man, there is a universal prudence with 
respect to all the acts of the virtues; which can be taken as the proper 
type and likeness of that prudence which in the lion leads to acts of 
magnanimity, and in the fox to acts of wariness; and so on of the rest. 
The Divine essence, on account of Its eminence, is in like fashion taken 
as the proper type of each thing contained therein: hence each one is 
likened to It according to its proper type. The same applies to the 
universal form which is in the mind of the angel, so that, on account of 
its excellence, many things can be known through it with a proper 
knowledge.<br>
