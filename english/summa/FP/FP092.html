</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider the production of the woman. Under this head there 
are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the woman should have been made in that first production of 
things?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the woman should have been made from man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether of man's rib?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the woman was made immediately by God?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the woman should not have been made in the 
first production of things. For the Philosopher says (De Gener. ii, 3), 
that "the female is a misbegotten male." But nothing misbegotten or 
defective should have been in the first production of things. Therefore 
woman should not have been made at that first production.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, subjection and limitation were a result of sin, for to 
the woman was it said after sin (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++3:16">Gn. 3:16</a>): "Thou shalt be under the 
man's power"; and Gregory says that, "Where there is no sin, there is no 
inequality." But woman is naturally of less strength and dignity than 
man; "for the agent is always more honorable than the patient," as 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16). Therefore woman should not have 
been made in the first production of things before sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, occasions of sin should be cut off. But God foresaw that 
the woman would be an occasion of sin to man. Therefore He should not 
have made woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++2:18">Gn. 2:18</a>): "It is not good for man to be 
alone; let us make him a helper like to himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was necessary for woman to be made, as the Scripture 
says, as a "helper" to man; not, indeed, as a helpmate in other works, as 
some say, since man can be more efficiently helped by another man in 
other works; but as a helper in the work of generation. This can be made 
clear if we observe the mode of generation carried out in various living 
things. Some living things do not possess in themselves the power of 
generation, but are generated by some other specific agent, such as some 
plants and animals by the influence of the heavenly bodies, from some 
fitting matter and not from seed: others possess the active and passive 
generative power together; as we see in plants which are generated from 
seed; for the noblest vital function in plants is generation. Wherefore 
we observe that in these the active power of generation invariably 
accompanies the passive power. Among perfect animals the active power of 
generation belongs to the male sex, and the passive power to the female. 
And as among animals there is a vital operation nobler than generation, 
to which their life is principally directed; therefore the male sex is 
not found in continual union with the female in perfect animals, but only 
at the time of coition; so that we may consider that by this means the 
male and female are one, as in plants they are always united; although in 
some cases one of them preponderates, and in some the other. But man is 
yet further ordered to a still nobler vital action, and that is 
intellectual operation. Therefore there was greater reason for the 
distinction of these two forces in man; so that the female should be 
produced separately from the male; although they are carnally united for 
generation. Therefore directly after the formation of woman, it was said: 
"And they shall be two in one flesh" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++2:24">Gn. 2:24</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and 
misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the 
production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the 
production of woman comes from defect in the active force or from some 
material indisposition, or even from some external influence; such as 
that of a south wind, which is moist, as the Philosopher observes (De 
Gener. Animal. iv, 2). On the other hand, as regards human nature in 
general, woman is not misbegotten, but is included in nature's intention 
as directed to the work of generation. Now the general intention of 
nature depends on God, Who is the universal Author of nature. Therefore, 
in producing nature, God formed not only the male but also the female.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Subjection is twofold. One is servile, by virtue of which a 
superior makes use of a subject for his own benefit; and this kind of 
subjection began after sin. There is another kind of subjection which is 
called economic or civil, whereby the superior makes use of his subjects 
for their own benefit and good; and this kind of subjection existed even 
before sin. For good order would have been wanting in the human family if 
some were not governed by others wiser than themselves. So by such a kind 
of subjection woman is naturally subject to man, because in man the 
discretion of reason predominates. Nor is inequality among men excluded 
by the state of innocence, as we shall prove (<A Href="FP096.html#FPQ96OUTP1">Question [96]</a>, <A Href="FP096.html#FPQ96A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If God had deprived the world of all those things which 
proved an occasion of sin, the universe would have been imperfect. Nor 
was it fitting for the common good to be destroyed in order that 
individual evil might be avoided; especially as God is so powerful that 
He can direct any evil to a good end.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that woman should not have been made from man. For 
sex belongs both to man and animals. But in the other animals the female 
was not made from the male. Therefore neither should it have been so with 
man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things of the same species are of the same matter. But 
male and female are of the same species. Therefore, as man was made of 
the slime of the earth, so woman should have been made of the same, and 
not from man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, woman was made to be a helpmate to man in the work of 
generation. But close relationship makes a person unfit for that office; 
hence near relations are debarred from intermarriage, as is written (Lev. 
18:6). Therefore woman should not have been made from man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 17:5): "He created of him," that 
is, out of man, "a helpmate like to himself," that is, woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When all things were first formed, it was more suitable 
for the woman to be made from man that (for the female to be from the 
male) in other animals. First, in order thus to give the first man a 
certain dignity consisting in this, that as God is the principle of the 
whole universe, so the first man, in likeness to God, was the principle 
of the whole human race. Wherefore Paul says that "God made the whole 
human race from one" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+17:26">Acts 17:26</a>). Secondly, that man might love woman 
all the more, and cleave to her more closely, knowing her to be fashioned 
from himself. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++2:23,24">Gn. 2:23,24</a>): "She was taken out of 
man, wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to 
his wife." This was most necessary as regards the human race, in which 
the male and female live together for life; which is not the case with 
other animals. Thirdly, because, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 
12), the human male and female are united, not only for generation, as 
with other animals, but also for the purpose of domestic life, in which 
each has his or her particular duty, and in which the man is the head of 
the woman. Wherefore it was suitable for the woman to be made out of man, 
as out of her principle. Fourthly, there is a sacramental reason for 
this. For by this is signified that the Church takes her origin from 
Christ. Wherefore the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:32">Eph. 5:32</a>): "This is a great 
sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the Church."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>is clear from the foregoing.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Matter is that from which something is made. Now created 
nature has a determinate principle; and since it is determined to one 
thing, it has also a determinate mode of proceeding. Wherefore from 
determinate matter it produces something in a determinate species. On the 
other hand, the Divine Power, being infinite, can produce things of the 
same species out of any matter, such as a man from the slime of the 
earth, and a woman from out of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A certain affinity arises from natural generation, and this 
is an impediment to matrimony. Woman, however, was not produced from man 
by natural generation, but by the Divine Power alone. Wherefore Eve is 
not called the daughter of Adam; and so this argument does not prove.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the woman was fittingly made from the rib of man?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the woman should not have been formed from the 
rib of man. For the rib was much smaller than the woman's body. Now from 
a smaller thing a larger thing can be made only---either by addition (and 
then the woman ought to have been described as made out of that which was 
added, rather than out of the rib itself)---or by rarefaction, because, 
as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x): "A body cannot increase in bulk 
except by rarefaction." But the woman's body is not more rarefied than 
man's---at least, not in the proportion of a rib to Eve's body. Therefore 
Eve was not formed from a rib of Adam.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in those things which were first created there was 
nothing superfluous. Therefore a rib of Adam belonged to the integrity of 
his body. So, if a rib was removed, his body remained imperfect; which is 
unreasonable to suppose.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a rib cannot be removed from man without pain. But there 
was no pain before sin. Therefore it was not right for a rib to be taken 
from the man, that Eve might be made from it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++2:22">Gn. 2:22</a>): "God built the rib, which He 
took from Adam, into a woman."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was right for the woman to be made from a rib of man. 
First, to signify the social union of man and woman, for the woman should 
neither "use authority over man," and so she was not made from his head; 
nor was it right for her to be subject to man's contempt as his slave, 
and so she was not made from his feet. Secondly, for the sacramental 
signification; for from the side of Christ sleeping on the Cross the 
Sacraments flowed---namely, blood and water---on which the Church was 
established.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some say that the woman's body was formed by a  material 
increase, without anything being added; in the same way as our Lord 
multiplied the five loaves. But this is quite impossible. For such an 
increase of matter would either be by a change of the very substance of 
the matter itself, or by a change of its dimensions. Not by change of the 
substance of the matter, both because matter, considered in itself, is 
quite unchangeable, since it has a potential existence, and has nothing 
but the nature of a subject, and because quantity and size are extraneous 
to the essence of matter itself. Wherefore multiplication of matter is 
quite unintelligible, as long as the matter itself remains the same 
without anything added to it; unless it receives greater dimensions. This 
implies rarefaction, which is for the same matter to receive greater 
dimensions, as the Philosopher says (Phys. iv). To say, therefore, that 
the same matter is enlarged, without being rarefied, is to combine 
contradictories ---viz. the definition with the absence of the thing 
defined.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, as no rarefaction is apparent in such multiplication of 
matter, we must admit an addition of matter: either by creation, or which 
is more probable, by conversion. Hence Augustine says (Tract. xxiv in 
Joan.) that "Christ filled five thousand men with five loaves, in the 
same way as from a few seeds He produces the harvest of corn"---that is, 
by transformation of the nourishment. Nevertheless, we say that the 
crowds were fed with five loaves, or that woman was made from the rib, 
because an addition was made to the already existing matter of the loaves 
and of the rib.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The rib belonged to the integral perfection of Adam, not as 
an individual, but as the principle of the human race; just as the semen 
belongs to the perfection of the begetter, and is released by a natural 
and pleasurable operation. Much more, therefore, was it possible that by 
the Divine power the body of the woman should be produced from the man's 
rib.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this it is clear how to answer the third objection.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the woman was not formed immediately by God. 
For no individual is produced immediately by God from another individual 
alike in species. But the woman was made from a man who is of the same 
species. Therefore she was not made immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Trin. iii, 4) says that corporeal things 
are governed by God through the angels. But the woman's body was formed 
from corporeal matter. Therefore it was made through the ministry of the 
angels, and not immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those things which pre-exist in creatures as to their 
causal virtues are produced by the power of some creature,  and not 
immediately by God. But the woman's body was produced in its causal 
virtues among the first created works, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. 
ix, 15). Therefore it was not produced immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says, in the same work: "God alone, to Whom 
all nature owes its existence, could form or build up the woman from the 
man's rib."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2), the natural generation of 
every species is from some determinate matter. Now the matter whence man 
is naturally begotten is the human semen of man or woman. Wherefore from 
any other matter an individual of the human species cannot naturally be 
generated. Now God alone, the Author of nature, can produce an effect 
into existence outside the ordinary course of nature. Therefore God alone 
could produce either a man from the slime of the earth, or a woman from 
the rib of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is verified when an individual is begotten, 
by natural generation, from that which is like it in the same species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 15), we do not know 
whether the angels were employed by God in the formation of the woman; 
but it is certain that, as the body of man was not formed by the angels 
from the slime of the earth, so neither was the body of the woman formed 
by them from the man's rib.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[92] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 18): "The first 
creation of things did not demand that woman should be made thus; it made 
it possible for her to be thus made." Therefore the body of the woman did 
indeed pre-exist in these causal virtues, in the things first created; 
not as regards active potentiality, but as regards a potentiality passive 
in relation to the active potentiality of the Creator.<br>
