<H3 Align="Center">OF THE STATE AND CONDITION OF THE FIRST MAN AS REGARDS HIS INTELLECT (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider the state or condition of the first man; first, as 
regards his soul; secondly, as regards his body. Concerning the first 
there are two things to be considered: (1) The condition of man as to his 
intellect; (2) the condition of man as to his will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the first man saw the Essence of God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether he could see the separate substances, that is, the angels?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether he possessed all knowledge?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he could err or be deceived?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the first man saw God through His Essence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first man saw God through His Essence. For 
man's happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. But the 
first man, "while established in paradise, led a life of happiness in the 
enjoyment of all things," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11). And 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): "If man was gifted with the same 
tastes as now, how happy must he have been in paradise, that place of 
ineffable happiness!" Therefore the first man in paradise saw God through 
His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, loc. cit.) that "the 
first man lacked nothing which his good-will might obtain." But our 
good-will can obtain nothing better than the vision of the Divine 
Essence. Therefore man saw God through His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the vision of God is His Essence is whereby God is seen 
without a medium or enigma. But man in the state of innocence "saw God 
immediately," as the Master of the Sentences asserts (Sent. iv, D, i). He 
also saw without an enigma, for an enigma implies obscurity, as Augustine 
says (De Trin. xv, 9). Now, obscurity resulted from sin. Therefore man in 
the primitive state saw God through His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A46">1 Cor. 15:46</a>): "That was  not first 
which is spiritual, but that which is natural." But to see God through 
His Essence is most spiritual. Therefore the first man in the primitive 
state of his natural life did not see God through His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The first man did not see God through His Essence if we 
consider the ordinary state of that life; unless, perhaps, it be said 
that he saw God in a vision, when "God cast a deep sleep upon Adam" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A21">Gn. 2:21</a>). The reason is because, since in the Divine Essence is beatitude 
itself, the intellect of a man who sees the Divine Essence has the same 
relation to God as a man has to beatitude. Now it is clear that man 
cannot willingly be turned away from beatitude, since naturally and 
necessarily he desires it, and shuns unhappiness. Wherefore no one who 
sees the Essence of God can willingly turn away from God, which means to 
sin. Hence all who see God through His Essence are so firmly established 
in the love of God, that for eternity they can never sin. Therefore, as 
Adam did sin, it is clear that he did not see God through His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless he knew God with a more perfect knowledge than we do now. 
Thus in a sense his knowledge was midway between our knowledge in the 
present state, and the knowledge we shall have in heaven, when we see God 
through His Essence. To make this clear, we must consider that the vision 
of God through His Essence is contradistinguished from the vision of God 
through His creatures. Now the higher the creature is, and the more like 
it is to God, the more clearly is God seen in it; for instance, a man is 
seen more clearly through a mirror in which his image is the more clearly 
expressed. Thus God is seen in a much more perfect manner through His 
intelligible effects than through those which are only sensible or 
corporeal. But in his present state man is impeded as regards the full 
and clear consideration of intelligible creatures, because he is 
distracted by and occupied with sensible things. Now, it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++7%3A30">Eccles. 7:30</a>): "God made man right." And man was made right by God in 
this sense, that in him the lower powers were subjected to the higher, 
and the higher nature was made so as not to be impeded by the lower. 
Wherefore the first man was not impeded by exterior things from a clear 
and steady contemplation of the intelligible effects which he perceived 
by the radiation of the first truth, whether by a natural or by a 
gratuitous knowledge. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 33) that, 
"perhaps God used to speak to the first man as He speaks to the angels; 
by shedding on his mind a ray of the unchangeable truth, yet without 
bestowing on him the experience of which the angels are capable in the 
participation of the Divine Essence." Therefore, through these 
intelligible effects of God, man knew God then more clearly than we know 
Him now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man was happy in paradise, but not with that perfect 
happiness to which he was destined, which consists in the vision of the 
Divine Essence. He was, however, endowed with "a life of happiness in a 
certain measure," as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18), so far as he 
was gifted with natural integrity and perfection. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A good will is a well-ordered will; but the will of the 
first man would have been ill-ordered had he wished to have, while in the 
state of merit, what had been promised to him as a reward.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A medium (of knowledge) is twofold; one through which, and, 
at the same time, in which, something is seen, as, for example, a man is 
seen through a mirror, and is seen with the mirror: another kind of 
medium is that whereby we attain to the knowledge of something unknown; 
such as the medium in a demonstration. God was seen without this second 
kind of medium, but not without the first kind. For there was no need for 
the first man to attain to the knowledge of God by demonstration drawn 
from an effect, such as we need; since he knew God simultaneously in His 
effects, especially in the intelligible effects, according to His 
capacity. Again, we must remark that the obscurity which is implied in 
the word enigma may be of two kinds: first, so far as every creature is 
something obscure when compared with the immensity of the Divine light; 
and thus Adam saw God in an enigma, because he saw Him in a created 
effect: secondly, we may take obscurity as an effect of sin, so far as 
man is impeded in the consideration of intelligible things by being 
preoccupied with sensible things; in which sense Adam did not see God in 
an enigma.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Adam in the state of innocence saw the angels through their essence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Adam, in the state of innocence, saw the 
angels through their essence. For Gregory says (Dialog. iv, 1): "In 
paradise man was accustomed to enjoy the words of God; and by purity of 
heart and loftiness of vision to have the company of the good angels."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul in the present state is impeded from the 
knowledge of separate substances by union with a corruptible body which 
"is a load upon the soul," as is written Wis. 9:15. Wherefore the 
separate soul can see separate substances, as above explained (<A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>, <A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the body of the first man was not a load upon his soul; for 
the latter was not corruptible. Therefore he was able to see separate 
substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one separate substance knows another separate substance, 
by knowing itself (De Causis xiii). But the soul of the first man knew 
itself. Therefore it knew separate substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The soul of Adam was of the same nature as ours. But 
our souls cannot now understand separate substances. Therefore neither 
could Adam's soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The state of the human soul may be distinguished in two 
ways. First, from a diversity of mode in its natural existence; and in 
this point the state of the separate soul  is distinguished from the 
state of the soul joined to the body. Secondly, the state of the soul is 
distinguished in relation to integrity and corruption, the state of 
natural existence remaining the same: and thus the state of innocence is 
distinct from the state of man after sin. For man's soul, in the state of 
innocence, was adapted to perfect and govern the body; wherefore the 
first man is said to have been made into a "living soul"; that is, a soul 
giving life to the body---namely animal life. But he was endowed with 
integrity as to this life, in that the body was entirely subject to the 
soul, hindering it in no way, as we have said above (<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now it is 
clear from what has been already said (<A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>, <A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that since the soul is adapted to perfect and govern the body, as 
regards animal life, it is fitting that it should have that mode of 
understanding which is by turning to phantasms. Wherefore this mode of 
understanding was becoming to the soul of the first man also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in virtue of this mode of understanding, there are three degrees of 
movement in the soul, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). The first is by 
the soul "passing from exterior things to concentrate its powers on 
itself"; the second is by the soul ascending "so as to be associated with 
the united superior powers," namely the angels; the third is when the 
soul is "led on" yet further "to the supreme good," that is, to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In virtue of the first movement of the soul from exterior things to 
itself, the soul's knowledge is perfected. This is because the 
intellectual operation of the soul has a natural order to external 
things, as we have said above (<A Href="FP087.html#FPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FP087.html#FPQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and so by the knowledge 
thereof, our intellectual operation can be known perfectly, as an act 
through its object. And through the intellectual operation itself, the 
human intellect can be known perfectly, as a power through its proper 
act. But in the second movement we do not find perfect knowledge. 
Because, since the angel does not understand by turning to phantasms, but 
by a far more excellent process, as we have said above (<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); the 
above-mentioned mode of knowledge, by which the soul knows itself, is not 
sufficient to lead it to the knowledge of an angel. Much less does the 
third movement lead to perfect knowledge: for even the angels themselves, 
by the fact that they know themselves, are not able to arrive at the 
knowledge of the Divine Substance, by reason of its surpassing 
excellence. Therefore the soul of the first man could not see the angels 
in their essence. Nevertheless he had a more excellent mode of knowledge 
regarding the angels than we possess, because his knowledge of 
intelligible things within him was more certain and fixed than our 
knowledge. And it was on account of this excellence of knowledge that 
Gregory says that "he enjoyed the company of the angelic spirits."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes clear the reply to the first objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That the soul of the first man fell short of the knowledge 
regarding separate substances, was not owing to the fact that the body 
was a load upon it; but to the fact that its  connatural object fell 
short of the excellence of separate substances. We, in our present state, 
fall short on account of both these reasons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The soul of the first man was not able to arrive at 
knowledge of separate substances by means of its self-knowledge, as we 
have shown above; for even each separate substance knows others in its 
own measure.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first man did not know all things. For if 
he had such knowledge it would be either by acquired species, or by 
connatural species, or by infused species. Not, however, by acquired 
species; for this kind of knowledge is acquired by experience, as stated 
in Metaph. i, 1; and the first man had not then gained experience of all 
things. Nor through connatural species, because he was of the same nature 
as we are; and our soul, as Aristotle says (De Anima iii, 4), is "like a 
clean tablet on which nothing is written." And if his knowledge came by 
infused species, it would have been of a different kind from ours, which 
we acquire from things themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, individuals of the same species have the same way of 
arriving at perfection. Now other men have not, from the beginning, 
knowledge of all things, but they acquire it in the course of time 
according to their capacity. Therefore neither did Adam know all things 
when he was first created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the present state of life is given to man in order that 
his soul may advance in knowledge and merit; indeed, the soul seems to be 
united to the body for that purpose. Now man would have advanced in merit 
in that state of life; therefore also in knowledge. Therefore he was not 
endowed with knowledge of all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Man named the animals (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A20">Gn. 2:20</a>). But names should be 
adapted to the nature of things. Therefore Adam knew the animals' 
natures; and in like manner he was possessed of the knowledge of all 
other things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the natural order, perfection comes before 
imperfection, as act precedes potentiality; for whatever is in 
potentiality is made actual only by something actual. And since God 
created things not only for their own existence, but also that they might 
be the principles of other things; so creatures were produced in their 
perfect state to be the principles as regards others. Now man can be the 
principle of another man, not only by generation of the body, but also by 
instruction and government. Hence, as the first man was produced in his 
perfect state, as regards his body, for the work of generation, so also 
was his soul established in a perfect state to instruct and govern others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now no one can instruct others unless he has knowledge, and so the first 
man was established by God in such a manner as to have knowledge of all 
those things for which man has a natural aptitude. And such are whatever 
are virtually contained in the first self-evident principles, that is, 
whatever truths man is naturally able to know. Moreover, in order to 
direct his own life and that of others, man needs to know not only those 
things which can be naturally known, but also things surpassing natural 
knowledge; because the life of man is directed to a supernatural end: 
just as it is necessary for us to know the truths of faith in order to 
direct our own lives. Wherefore the first man was endowed with such a 
knowledge of these supernatural truths as was necessary for the direction 
of human life in that state. But those things which cannot be known by 
merely human effort, and which are not necessary for the direction of 
human life, were not known by the first man; such as the thoughts of men, 
future contingent events, and some individual facts, as for instance the 
number of pebbles in a stream; and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The first man had knowledge of all things by divinely 
infused species. Yet his knowledge was not different from ours; as the 
eyes which Christ gave to the man born blind were not different from 
those given by nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To Adam, as being the first man, was due to a degree of 
perfection which was not due to other men, as is clear from what is above 
explained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Adam would have advanced in natural knowledge, not in the 
number of things known, but in the manner of knowing; because what he 
knew speculatively he would subsequently have known by experience. But as 
regards supernatural knowledge, he would also have advanced as regards 
the number of things known, by further revelation; as the angels advance 
by further enlightenment. Moreover there is no comparison between advance 
in knowledge and advance in merit; since one man cannot be a principle of 
merit to another, although he can be to another a principle of knowledge.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man in his primitive state could have been 
deceived. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2%3A14">1 Tim. 2:14</a>) that "the woman being

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. ii, D, xxi) that, "the woman was 
not frightened at the serpent speaking, because she thought that he had 
received the faculty of speech from God." But this was untrue. Therefore 
before sin the woman was deceived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is natural that the farther off anything is from us,

sin. Therefore this would have been the case in the state of innocence. 
Wherefore man would have been deceived in the  size of what he saw, just 
as he is deceived now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 2) that, in sleep the 
soul adheres to the images of things as if they were the things 
themselves. But in the state of innocence man would have eaten and 
consequently have slept and dreamed. Therefore he would have been 
deceived, adhering to images as to realities.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the first man would have been ignorant of other men's 
thoughts, and of future contingent events, as stated above (<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). So if 
anyone had told him what was false about these things, he would have been 
deceived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18): "To regard what 
is true as false, is not natural to man as created; but is a punishment 
of man condemned."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> in the opinion of some, deception may mean two things; 
namely, any slight surmise, in which one adheres to what is false, as 
though it were true, but without the assent of belief---or it may mean a 
firm belief. Thus before sin Adam could not be deceived in either of 
these ways as regards those things to which his knowledge extended; but 
as regards things to which his knowledge did not extend, he might have 
been deceived, if we take deception in the wide sense of the term for any 
surmise without assent of belief. This opinion was held with the idea 
that it is not derogatory to man to entertain a false opinion in such 
matters, and that provided he does not assent rashly, he is not to be 
blamed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an opinion, however, is not fitting as regards the integrity of the 
primitive state of life; because, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 
10), in that state of life "sin was avoided without struggle, and while 
it remained so, no evil could exist." Now it is clear that as truth is 
the good of the intellect, so falsehood is its evil, as the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. vi, 2). So that, as long as the state of innocence 
continued, it was impossible for the human intellect to assent to 
falsehood as if it were truth. For as some perfections, such as clarity, 
were lacking in the bodily members of the first man, though no evil could 
be therein; so there could be in his intellect the absence of some 
knowledge, but no false opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clear also from the very rectitude of the primitive state, by 
virtue of which, while the soul remained subject to God, the lower 
faculties in man were subject to the higher, and were no impediment to 
their action. And from what has preceded (<A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), it is clear that 
as regards its proper object the intellect is ever true; and hence it is 
never deceived of itself; but whatever deception occurs must be ascribed 
to some lower faculty, such as the imagination or the like. Hence we see 
that when the natural power of judgment is free we are not deceived by 
such images, but only when it is not free, as is the case in sleep. 
Therefore it is clear that the rectitude of the primitive state was 
incompatible  with deception of the intellect.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Though the woman was deceived before she sinned in deed, 
still it was not till she had already sinned by interior pride. For 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that "the woman could not have 
believed the words of the serpent, had she not already acquiesced in the 
love of her own power, and in a presumption of self-conceit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The woman thought that the serpent had received this 
faculty, not as acting in accordance with nature, but by virtue of some 
supernatural operation. We need not, however, follow the Master of the 
Sentences in this point.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Were anything presented to the imagination or sense of the 
first man, not in accordance with the nature of things, he would not have 
been deceived, for his reason would have enabled him to judge the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A man is not accountable for what occurs during sleep; as 
he has not then the use of his reason, wherein consists man's proper 
action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> If anyone had said something untrue as regards future 
contingencies, or as regards secret thoughts, man in the primitive state 
would not have believed it was so: but he might have believed that such a 
thing was possible; which would not have been to entertain a false 
opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might also be said that he would have been divinely guided from 
above, so as not to be deceived in a matter to which his knowledge did 
not extend.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[94] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If any object, as some do, that he was not guided, when tempted, though 
he was then most in need of guidance, we reply that man had already 
sinned in his heart, and that he failed to have recourse to the Divine 
aid.<br>
