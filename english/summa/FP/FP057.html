    OF THE ANGEL'S KNOWLEDGE OF MATERIAL THINGS (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next investigate the material objects which are known by the angels.
    Under this heading there are five points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>

    natures of material things?
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the angels know material things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels do not know
    material things. For the object understood is the perfection of him who
    understands it. But material things cannot be the perfections of angels,
    since they are beneath them. Therefore the angels do not know material
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, intellectual vision is only of such
    things as exist within the soul by their essence, as is said in the gloss
    [*On 2 Cor. 12:2, taken from Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii. 28)]. But the
    material things cannot enter by their essence into man's soul, nor into the
    angel's mind. Therefore they cannot be known by intellectual vision, but
    only by imaginary vision, whereby the images of bodies are apprehended, and
    by sensible vision, which regards bodies in themselves. Now there is neither
    imaginary nor sensible vision in the angels, but only intellectual.
    Therefore the angels cannot know material things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, material things are not actually
    intelligible, but are knowable by apprehension of sense and of imagination,
    which does not exist in angels. Therefore angels do not know material
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever the lower power can do, the higher
    can do likewise. But man's intellect, which in the order of nature is
    inferior to the angel's, can know material things. Therefore much more can
    the mind of an angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The established order of things is for the
    higher beings to be more perfect than the lower; and for whatever is
    contained deficiently, partially, and in manifold manner in the lower
    beings, to be contained in the higher eminently, and in a certain degree of
    fulness and simplicity. Therefore, in God, as in the highest source of
    things, all things pre-exist supersubstantially in respect of His simple
    Being itself, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 1). But among other creatures the
    angels are nearest to God, and resemble Him most; hence they share more
    fully and more perfectly in the Divine goodness, as Dionysius says (Coel.
    Hier. iv). Consequently, all material things pre-exist in the angels more
    simply and less materially even than in themselves, yet in a more manifold
    manner and less perfectly than in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now whatever exists in any subject, is contained in it after the manner of
    such subject. But the angels are intellectual beings of their own nature.
    Therefore, as God knows material things by His essence, so do the angels
    know them, forasmuch as they are in the angels by their intelligible
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The thing understood is the perfection
    of the one who understands, by reason of the intelligible species which he
    has in his intellect. And thus the intelligible species which are in the
    intellect of an angel are perfections and acts in regard to that
    intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sense does not apprehend the essences of
    things, but only their outward accidents. In like manner neither does the
    imagination; for it apprehends only the images of bodies. The intellect
    alone apprehends the essences of things. Hence it is said (De Anima iii,
    text. 26) that the object of the intellect is "what a thing is," regarding
    which it does not err; as neither does sense regarding its proper sensible
    object. So therefore the essences of material things are in the intellect of
    man and angels, as the thing understood is in him who understands, and not
    according to their real natures. But some things are in an intellect or in
    the soul according to both natures; and in either case there is intellectual
    vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If an angel were to draw his knowledge
    of material things from the material things themselves, he would require to
    make them actually intelligible by a process of abstraction. But he does not
    derive his knowledge of them from the material things themselves; he has
    knowledge of material things by actually intelligible species of things,
    which species are connatural to him; just as our intellect has, by species
    which it makes intelligible by abstraction.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether an angel knows singulars?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that angels do not know singulars.
    For the Philosopher says (Poster. i, text. 22): "The sense has for its
    object singulars, but the intellect, universals." Now, in the angels there
    is no power of understanding save the intellectual power, as is evident from
    what was said above (<a href="FP054.html#FPQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>,
    <a href="FP054.html#FPQ54A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Consequently they do not
    know singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all knowledge comes about by some
    assimilation of the knower to the object known. But it is not possible for
    any assimilation to exist between an angel and a singular object, in so far
    as it is singular; because, as was observed above (<a
      href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), an angel is
    immaterial, while matter is the principle of singularity. Therefore the
    angel cannot know singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if an angel does know singulars, it is
    either by singular or by universal species. It is not by singular species;
    because in this way he would require to have an infinite number of species.
    Nor is it by universal species; since the universal is not the sufficient
    principle for knowing the singular as such, because singular things are not
    known in the universal except potentially. Therefore the angel does not know
    singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No one can guard what he does not know. But
    angels guard individual men, according to Ps. 90:11: "He hath given His
    angels charge over Thee." Consequently the angels know singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have denied to the angels all knowledge of
    singulars. In the first place this derogates from the Catholic faith, which
    asserts that these lower things are administered by angels, according to
    Heb. 1:14: "They are all ministering spirits." Now, if they had no knowledge
    of singulars, they could exercise no provision over what is going on in this
    world; since acts belong to individuals: and this is against the text of
    Eccles. 5:5: "Say not before the angel: There is no providence." Secondly,
    it is also contrary to the teachings of philosophy, according to which the
    angels are stated to be the movers of the heavenly spheres, and to move them
    according to their knowledge and will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently others have said that the angel possesses knowledge of
    singulars, but in their universal causes, to which all particular effects
    are reduced; as if the astronomer were to foretell a coming eclipse from the
    dispositions of the movements of the heavens. This opinion does not escape
    the aforesaid implications; because, to know a singular, merely in its
    universal causes, is not to know it as singular, that is, as it exists here
    and now. The astronomer, knowing from computation of the heavenly movements
    that an eclipse is about to happen, knows it in the universal; yet he does
    not know it as taking place now, except by the senses. But administration,
    providence and movement are of singulars, as they are here and now
    existing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it must be said differently, that, as man by his various powers
    of knowledge knows all classes of things, apprehending universals and
    immaterial things by his intellect, and things singular and corporeal by the
    senses, so an angel knows both by his one mental power. For the order of
    things runs in this way, that the higher a thing is, so much the more is its
    power united and far-reaching: thus in man himself it is manifest that the
    common sense which is higher than the proper sense, although it is but one
    faculty, knows everything apprehended by the five outward senses, and some
    other things which no outer sense knows; for example, the difference between
    white and sweet. The same is to be observed in other cases. Accordingly,
    since an angel is above man in the order of nature, it is unreasonable to
    say that a man knows by any one of his powers something which an angel by
    his one faculty of knowledge, namely, the intellect, does not know. Hence
    Aristotle pronounces it ridiculous to say that a discord, which is known to
    us, should be unknown to God (De Anima i, text. 80; Metaph. text. 15).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The manner in which an angel knows singular things can be considered from
    this, that, as things proceed from God in order that they may subsist in
    their own natures, so likewise they proceed in order that they may exist in
    the angelic mind. Now it is clear that there comes forth from God not only
    whatever belongs to their universal nature, but likewise all that goes to
    make up their principles of individuation; since He is the cause of the
    entire substance of the thing, as to both its matter and its form. And for
    as much as He causes, does He know; for His knowledge is the cause of a
    thing, as was shown above (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore as by His
    essence, by which He causes all things, God is the likeness of all things,
    and knows all things, not only as to their universal natures, but also as to
    their singularity; so through the species imparted to them do the angels
    know things, not only as to their universal nature, but likewise in their
    individual conditions, in so far as they are the manifold representations of
    that one simple essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of our
    intellect, which apprehends only by a process of abstraction; and by such
    abstraction from material conditions the thing abstracted becomes a
    universal. Such a manner of understanding is not in keeping with the nature
    of the angels, as was said above (<a href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>,
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a> ad 1), and consequently
    there is no comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not according to their nature that
    the angels are likened to material things, as one thing resembles another by
    agreement in genus, species, or accident; but as the higher bears
    resemblance to the lower, as the sun does to fire. Even in this way there is
    in God a resemblance of all things, as to both matter and form, in so far as
    there pre-exists in Him as in its cause whatever is to be found in things.
    For the same reason, the species in the angel's intellect, which are images
    drawn from the Divine essence, are the images of things not only as to their
    form, but also as to their matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Angels know singulars by universal
    forms, which nevertheless are the images of things both as to their
    universal, and as to their individuating principles. How many things can be
    known by the same species, has been already stated above (<a

  <h3 align="left">Whether angels know the future?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels know future events.
    For angels are mightier in knowledge than men. But some men know many future
    events. Therefore much more do the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the present and the future are
    differences of time. But the angel's intellect is above time; because, as is
    said in De Causis, "an intelligence keeps pace with eternity," that is,
    aeviternity. Therefore, to the angel's mind, past and future are not
    different, but he knows each indifferently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angel does not understand by species
    derived from things, but by innate universal species. But universal species
    refer equally to present, past, and future. Therefore it appears that the
    angels know indifferently things past, present, and future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as a thing is spoken of as distant by
    reason of time, so is it by reason of place. But angels know things which
    are distant according to place. Therefore they likewise know things distant
    according to future time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is the exclusive sign of the
    Divinity, does not belong to the angels. But to know future events is the
    exclusive sign of the Divinity, according to Is. 41:23: "Show the things
    that are to come hereafter, and we shall know that ye are gods." Therefore
    the angels do not know future events.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The future can be known in two ways. First, it
    can be known in its cause. And thus, future events which proceed necessarily
    from their causes, are known with sure knowledge; as that the sun will rise
    tomorrow. But events which proceed from their causes in the majority of
    cases, are not known for certain, but conjecturally; thus the doctor knows
    beforehand the health of the patient. This manner of knowing future events
    exists in the angels, and by so much the more than it does in us, as they
    understand the causes of things both more universally and more perfectly;
    thus doctors who penetrate more deeply into the causes of an ailment can
    pronounce a surer verdict on the future issue thereof. But events which
    proceed from their causes in the minority of cases are quite unknown; such
    as casual and chance events.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In another way future events are known in themselves. To know the future in
    this way belongs to God alone; and not merely to know those events which
    happen of necessity, or in the majority of cases, but even casual and chance
    events; for God sees all things in His eternity, which, being simple, is
    present to all time, and embraces all time. And therefore God's one glance
    is cast over all things which happen in all time as present before Him; and
    He beholds all things as they are in themselves, as was said before when
    dealing with God's knowledge (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>). But the mind of an
    angel, and every created intellect, fall far short of God's eternity; hence
    the future as it is in itself cannot be known by any created intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Men cannot know future things except in
    their causes, or by God's revelation. The angels know the future in the same
    way, but much more distinctly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the angel's intellect is above
    that time according to which corporeal movements are reckoned, yet there is
    a time in his mind according to the succession of intelligible concepts; of
    which Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii) that "God moves the spiritual
    creature according to time." And thus, since there is succession in the
    angel's intellect, not all things that happen through all time, are present
    to the angelic mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the species in the intellect of
    an angel, in so far as they are species, refer equally to things present,
    past, and future; nevertheless the present, past, and future; nevertheless
    the present, past, and future do not bear the same relations to the species.
    Present things have a nature according to which they resemble the species in
    the mind of an angel: and so they can be known thereby. Things which are yet
    to come have not yet a nature whereby they are likened to such species;
    consequently, they cannot be known by those species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Things distant according to place are
    already existing in nature; and share in some species, whose image is in the
    angel; whereas this is not true of future things, as has been stated.
    Consequently there is no comparison.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether angels know secret thoughts?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels know secret
    thoughts. For Gregory (Moral. xviii), explaining Job 28:17: "Gold or crystal
    cannot equal it," says that "then," namely in the bliss of those rising from
    the dead, "one shall be as evident to another as he is to himself, and when
    once the mind of each is seen, his conscience will at the same time be
    penetrated." But those who rise shall be like the angels, as is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >). Therefore an angel can see what is in another's conscience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, intelligible species bear the same
    relation to the intellect as shapes do to bodies. But when the body is seen
    its shape is seen. Therefore, when an intellectual substance is seen, the
    intelligible species within it is also seen. Consequently, when one angel
    beholds another, or even a soul, it seems that he can see the thoughts of
    both.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the ideas of our intellect resemble the
    angel more than do the images in our imagination; because the former are
    actually understood, while the latter are understood only potentially. But
    the images in our imagination can be known by an angel as corporeal things
    are known: because the imagination is a corporeal faculty. Therefore it
    seems that an angel can know the thoughts of the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> What is proper to God does not belong to the
    angels. But it is proper to God to read the secrets of hearts, according to
    Jer. 17:9: "The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable; who
    can know it? I am the Lord, Who search the heart." Therefore angels do not
    know the secrets of hearts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A secret thought can be known in two ways:
    first, in its effect. In this way it can be known not only by an angel, but
    also by man; and with so much the greater subtlety according as the effect
    is the more hidden. For thought is sometimes discovered not merely by
    outward act, but also by change of countenance; and doctors can tell some
    passions of the soul by the mere pulse. Much more then can angels, or even
    demons, the more deeply they penetrate those occult bodily modifications.
    Hence Augustine says (De divin. daemon.) that demons "sometimes with the
    greatest faculty learn man's dispositions, not only when expressed by
    speech, but even when conceived in thought, when the soul expresses them by
    certain signs in the body"; although (Retract. ii, 30) he says "it cannot be
    asserted how this is done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In another way thoughts can be known as they are in the mind, and affections
    as they are in the will: and thus God alone can know the thoughts of hearts
    and affections of wills. The reason of this is, because the rational
    creature is subject to God only, and He alone can work in it Who is its
    principal object and last end: this will be developed later (<a

    <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Consequently all that
    is in the will, and all things that depend only on the will, are known to
    God alone. Now it is evident that it depends entirely on the will for anyone
    actually to consider anything; because a man who has a habit of knowledge,
    or any intelligible species, uses them at will. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A11"
      >1 Cor. 2:11</a
    >): "For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that
    is in him?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the present life one man's thought is
    not known by another owing to a twofold hindrance; namely, on account of the
    grossness of the body, and because the will shuts up its secrets. The first
    obstacle will be removed at the Resurrection, and does not exist at all in
    the angels; while the second will remain, and is in the angels now.
    Nevertheless the brightness of the body will show forth the quality of the
    soul; as to its amount of grace and of glory. In this way one will be able
    to see the mind of another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although one angel sees the intelligible
    species of another, by the fact that the species are proportioned to the
    rank of these substances according to greater or lesser universality, yet it
    does not follow that one knows how far another makes use of them by actual
    consideration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The appetite of the brute does not
    control its act, but follows the impression of some other corporeal or
    spiritual cause. Since, therefore, the angels know corporeal things and
    their dispositions, they can thereby know what is passing in the appetite or
    in the imaginative apprehension of the brute beasts, and even of man, in so
    far as the sensitive appetite sometimes, through following some bodily
    impression, influences his conduct, as always happens in brutes. Yet the
    angels do not necessarily know the movement of the sensitive appetite and
    the imaginative apprehension of man in so far as these are moved by the will
    and reason; because, even the lower part of the soul has some share of
    reason, as obeying its ruler, as is said in Ethics iii, 12. But it does not
    follow that, if the angel knows what is passing through man's sensitive
    appetite or imagination, he knows what is in the thought or will: because
    the intellect or will is not subject to the sensitive appetite or the
    imagination, but can make various uses of them.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the angels know the mysteries of grace?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels know mysteries of
    grace. For, the mystery of the Incarnation is the most excellent of all
    mysteries. But the angels knew of it from the beginning; for Augustine says
    (Gen. ad lit. v, 19): "This mystery was hidden in God through the ages, yet
    so that it was known to the princes and powers in heavenly places." And the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++3%3A16"
      >1 Tim. 3:16</a
    >): "That great mystery of godliness appeared unto angels*." [*Vulg.: 'Great
    is the mystery of godliness, which... appeared unto angels.'] Therefore the
    angels know the mysteries of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the reasons of all mysteries of grace
    are contained in the Divine wisdom. But the angels behold God's wisdom,
    which is His essence. Therefore they know the mysteries of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the prophets are enlightened by the
    angels, as is clear from Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv). But the prophets knew
    mysteries of grace; for it is said (Amos 3:7): "For the Lord God doth
    nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets."
    Therefore angels know the mysteries of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No one learns what he knows already. Yet even
    the highest angels seek out and learn mysteries of grace. For it is stated
    (Coel. Hier. vii) that "Sacred Scripture describes some heavenly essences as
    questioning Jesus, and learning from Him the knowledge of His Divine work
    for us; and Jesus as teaching them directly": as is evident in Is. 63:1,
    where, on the angels asking, "Who is he who cometh up from Edom?" Jesus
    answered, "It is I, Who speak justice." Therefore the angels do not know
    mysteries of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold knowledge in the angel. The
    first is his natural knowledge, according to which he knows things both by
    his essence, and by innate species. By such knowledge the angels cannot know
    mysteries of grace. For these mysteries depend upon the pure will of God:
    and if an angel cannot learn the thoughts of another angel, which depend
    upon the will of such angel, much less can he ascertain what depends
    entirely upon God's will. The Apostle reasons in this fashion (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A11"
      >1 Cor. 2:11</a
    >): "No one knoweth the things of a man [*Vulg.: 'What man knoweth the
    things of a man, but... ?'], but the spirit of a man that is in him." So,
    "the things also that are of God no man knoweth but the Spirit of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There is another knowledge of the angels, which renders them happy; it is
    the knowledge whereby they see the Word, and things in the Word. By such
    vision they know mysteries of grace, but not all mysteries: nor do they all
    know them equally; but just as God wills them to learn by revelation; as the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 2:10</a
    >): "But to us God hath revealed them through His Spirit"; yet so that the
    higher angels beholding the Divine wisdom more clearly, learn more and
    deeper mysteries in the vision of God, which mysteries they communicate to
    the lower angels by enlightening them. Some of these mysteries they knew
    from the very beginning of their creation; others they are taught
    afterwards, as befits their ministrations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> One can speak in two ways of the mystery
    of the Incarnation. First of all, in general; and in this way it was
    revealed to all from the commencement of their beatitude. The reason of this
    is, that this is a kind of general principle to which all their duties are
    ordered. For "all are [*Vulg.: 'Are they not all.'] ministering spirits,
    sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++1%3A14"
      >Heb. 1:14</a
    >)"; and this is brought by the mystery of the Incarnation. Hence it was
    necessary for all of them to be instructed in this mystery from the very
    beginning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We can speak of the mystery of the Incarnation in another way, as to its
    special conditions. Thus not all the angels were instructed on all points
    from the beginning; even the higher angels learned these afterwards, as
    appears from the passage of Dionysius already quoted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the angels in bliss behold the
    Divine wisdom, yet they do not comprehend it. So it is not necessary for
    them to know everything hidden in it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whatever the prophets knew by revelation
    of the mysteries of grace, was revealed in a more excellent way to the
    angels. And although God revealed in general to the prophets what He was one
    day to do regarding the salvation of the human race, still the apostles knew
    some particulars of the same, which the prophets did not know. Thus we read
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A4,5">Eph. 3:4,5</a
    >): "As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
    which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now
    revealed to His holy apostles." Among the prophets also, the later ones knew
    what the former did not know; according to Ps. 118:100: "I have had
    understanding above ancients," and Gregory says: "The knowledge of Divine
    things increased as time went on" (Hom. xvi in Ezech.).<br />
