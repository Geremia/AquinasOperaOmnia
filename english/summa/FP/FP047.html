<br>
<br>
OF THE DISTINCTION OF THINGS IN GENERAL (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering the production of creatures, we come to the 
consideration of the distinction of things. This consideration will be 
threefold---first, of the distinction of things in general; secondly, of 
the distinction of good and evil; thirdly, of the distinction of the 
spiritual and corporeal creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head, there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> The multitude or distinction of things.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> Their inequality.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> The unity of the world.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the multitude and distinction of things come from God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the multitude and distinction of things does 
not come from God. For one naturally always makes one. But God is 
supremely one, as appears from what precedes (<A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore He 
produces but one effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the representation is assimilated to its exemplar. But 
God is the exemplar cause of His effect, as was said above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). 
Therefore, as God is one, His effect is one only, and not diverse.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the means are proportional to the end. But the  end of 
the creation is one---viz. the divine goodness, as was shown above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore the effect of God is but one.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:4,7">Gn. 1:4,7</a>) that God "divided the light from 
the darkness," and "divided waters from waters." Therefore the 
distinction and multitude of things is from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The distinction of things has been ascribed to many 
causes. For some attributed the distinction to matter, either by itself 
or with the agent. Democritus, for instance, and all the ancient natural 
philosophers, who admitted no cause but matter, attributed it to matter 
alone; and in their opinion the distinction of things comes from chance 
according to the movement of matter. Anaxagoras, however, attributed the 
distinction and multitude of things to matter and to the agent together; 
and he said that the intellect distinguishes things by extracting what is 
mixed up in matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because, as was shown 
above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), even matter itself was created by God. Hence we must 
reduce whatever distinction comes from matter to a higher cause. 
Secondly, because matter is for the sake of the form, and not the form 
for the matter, and the distinction of things comes from their proper 
forms. Therefore the distinction of things is not on account of the 
matter; but rather, on the contrary, created matter is formless, in order 
that it may be accommodated to different forms.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others have attributed the distinction of things to secondary agents, as 
did Avicenna, who said that God by understanding Himself, produced the 
first intelligence; in which, forasmuch as it was not its own being, 
there is necessarily composition of potentiality and act, as will appear 
later (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). And so the first intelligence, inasmuch as it 
understood the first cause, produced the second intelligence; and in so 
far as it understood itself as in potentiality it produced the heavenly 
body, which causes movement, and inasmuch as it understood itself as 
having actuality it produced the soul of the heavens.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this opinion cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because it was 
shown above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) that to create belongs to God alone, and hence 
what can be caused only by creation is produced by God alone---viz. all 
those things which are not subject to generation and corruption. 
Secondly, because, according to this opinion, the universality of things 
would not proceed from the intention of the first agent, but from the 
concurrence of many active causes; and such an effect we can describe 
only as being produced by chance. Therefore, the perfection of the 
universe, which consists of the diversity of things, would thus be a 
thing of chance, which is impossible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence we must say that the distinction and multitude of things come from 
the intention of the first agent, who is God. For He brought things into 
being in order that His goodness might be  communicated to creatures, and 
be represented by them; and because His goodness could not be adequately 
represented by one creature alone, He produced many and diverse 
creatures, that what was wanting to one in the representation of the 
divine goodness might be supplied by another. For goodness, which in God 
is simple and uniform, in creatures is manifold and divided and hence the 
whole universe together participates the divine goodness more perfectly, 
and represents it better than any single creature whatever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And because the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things, 
therefore Moses said that things are made distinct by the word of God, 
which is the concept of His wisdom; and this is what we read in Gn. 
1:3,4: "God said: Be light made . . . And He divided the light from the 
darkness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural agent acts by the form which makes it what it 
is, and which is only one in one thing; and therefore its effect is one 
only. But the voluntary agent, such as God is, as was shown above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), acts by an intellectual form. Since, therefore, it is not against 
God's unity and simplicity to understand many things, as was shown above 
(<A Href="FP015.html#FPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="FP015.html#FPQ15A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that, although He is one, He can make many 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This reason would apply to the representation which 
reflects the exemplar perfectly, and which is multiplied by reason of 
matter only; hence the uncreated image, which is perfect, is only one. 
But no creature represents the first exemplar perfectly, which is the 
divine essence; and, therefore, it can be represented by many things. 
Still, according as ideas are called exemplars, the plurality of ideas 
corresponds in the divine mind to the plurality of things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In speculative things the medium of demonstration, which 
demonstrates the conclusion perfectly, is one only; whereas probable 
means of proof are many. Likewise when operation is concerned, if the 
means be equal, so to speak, to the end, one only is sufficient. But the 
creature is not such a means to its end, which is God; and hence the 
multiplication of creatures is necessary.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the inequality of things is from God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the inequality of things is not from God. For 
it belongs to the best to produce the best. But among things that are 
best, one is not greater than another. Therefore, it belongs to God, Who 
is the Best, to make all things equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, equality is the effect of unity (Metaph. v, text 20). 
But God is one. Therefore, He has made all things equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is the part of justice to give unequal to unequal 
things. But God is just in all His works. Since, therefore, no inequality 
of things is presupposed to the operation whereby He  gives being to 
things, it seems that He has made all things equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (Ecclus. 33:7): "Why does one day excel 
another, and one light another, and one year another year, one sun 
another sun? [Vulg.: 'when all come of the sun']. By the knowledge of the 
Lord they were distinguished."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When Origen wished to refute those who said that the 
distinction of things arose from the contrary principles of good and 
evil, he said that in the beginning all things were created equal by God. 
For he asserted that God first created only the rational creatures and 
all equal; and that inequality arose in them from free-will, some being 
turned to God more and some less, and others turned more and others less 
away from God. And so those rational creatures which were turned to God 
by free-will, were promoted to the order of angels according to the 
diversity of merits. And those who were turned away from God were bound 
down to bodies according to the diversity of their sin; and he said this 
was the cause of the creation and diversity of bodies. But according to 
this opinion, it would follow that the universality of bodily creatures 
would not be the effect of the goodness of God as communicated to 
creatures, but it would be for the sake of the punishment of sin, which 
is contrary to what is said: "God saw all the things that He had made, 
and they were very good" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:31">Gn. 1:31</a>). And, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei 
ii, 3): "What can be more foolish than to say that the divine Architect 
provided this one sun for the one world, not to be an ornament to its 
beauty, nor for the benefit of corporeal things, but that it happened 
through the sin of one soul; so that, if a hundred souls had sinned, 
there would be a hundred suns in the world?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it must be said that as the wisdom of God is the cause of the 
distinction of things, so the same wisdom is the cause of their 
inequality. This may be explained as follows. A twofold distinction is 
found in things; one is a formal distinction as regards things differing 
specifically; the other is a material distinction as regards things 
differing numerically only. And as the matter is on account of the form, 
material distinction exists for the sake of the formal distinction. Hence 
we see that in incorruptible things there is only one individual of each 
species, forasmuch as the species is sufficiently preserved in the one; 
whereas in things generated and corruptible there are many individuals of 
one species for the preservation of the species. Whence it appears that 
formal distinction is of greater consequence than material. Now, formal 
distinction always requires inequality, because as the Philosopher says 
(Metaph. viii, 10), the forms of things are like numbers in which species 
vary by addition or subtraction of unity. Hence in natural things species 
seem to be arranged in degrees; as the mixed things are more perfect than 
the elements, and plants than minerals, and animals than plants, and men 
than other animals; and in each of these one species is more perfect than 
others. Therefore, as the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction 
of things for the sake of the perfection of the universe, so it is the 
cause of inequality. For the universe would  not be perfect if only one 
grade of goodness were found in things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is part of the best agent to produce an effect which is 
best in its entirety; but this does not mean that He makes every part of 
the whole the best absolutely, but in proportion to the whole; in the 
case of an animal, for instance, its goodness would be taken away if 
every part of it had the dignity of an eye. Thus, therefore, God also 
made the universe to be best as a whole, according to the mode of a 
creature; whereas He did not make each single creature best, but one 
better than another. And therefore we find it said of each creature, "God 
saw the light that it was good" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:4">Gn. 1:4</a>); and in like manner of each one 
of the rest. But of all together it is said, "God saw all the things that 
He had made, and they were very good" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:31">Gn. 1:31</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The first effect of unity is equality; and then comes 
multiplicity; and therefore from the Father, to Whom, according to 
Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5), is appropriated unity, the Son 
proceeds to Whom is appropriated equality, and then from Him the creature 
proceeds, to which belongs inequality; but nevertheless even creatures 
share in a certain equality---namely, of proportion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This is the argument that persuaded Origen: but it holds 
only as regards the distribution of rewards, the inequality of which is 
due to unequal merits. But in the constitution of things there is no 
inequality of parts through any preceding inequality, either of merits or 
of the disposition of the matter; but inequality comes from the 
perfection of the whole. This appears also in works done by art; for the 
roof of a house differs from the foundation, not because it is made of 
other material; but in order that the house may be made perfect of 
different parts, the artificer seeks different material; indeed, he would 
make such material if he could.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not only one world, but many. 
Because, as Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 46), it is unfitting to say that 
God has created things without a reason. But for the same reason He 
created one, He could create many, since His power is not limited to the 
creation of one world; but rather it is infinite, as was shown above 
(<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore God has produced many worlds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nature does what is best and much more does God. But it 
is better for there to be many worlds than one, because many good things 
are better than a few. Therefore many worlds have been made by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything which has a form in matter can be multiplied 
in number, the species remaining the same, because multiplication in 
number comes from matter. But the world has a  form in matter. Thus as 
when I say "man" I mean the form, and when I say "this man," I mean the 
form in matter; so when we say "world," the form is signified, and when 
we say "this world," the form in the matter is signified. Therefore there 
is nothing to prevent the existence of many worlds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:10">Jn. 1:10</a>): "The world was made by Him," 
where the world is named as one, as if only one existed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The very order of things created by God shows the unity 
of the world. For this world is called one by the unity of order, whereby 
some things are ordered to others. But whatever things come from God, 
have relation of order to each other, and to God Himself, as shown above 
(<A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it must be that all things should 
belong to one world. Therefore those only can assert that many worlds 
exist who do not acknowledge any ordaining wisdom, but rather believe in 
chance, as Democritus, who said that this world, besides an infinite 
number of other worlds, was made from a casual concourse of atoms.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This reason proves that the world is one because all things 
must be arranged in one order, and to one end. Therefore from the unity 
of order in things Aristotle infers (Metaph. xii, text 52) the unity of 
God governing all; and Plato (Tim.), from the unity of the exemplar, 
proves the unity of the world, as the thing designed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No agent intends material plurality as the end forasmuch as 
material multitude has no certain limit, but of itself tends to infinity, 
and the infinite is opposed to the notion of end. Now when it is said 
that many worlds are better than one, this has reference to material 
order. But the best in this sense is not the intention of the divine 
agent; forasmuch as for the same reason it might be said that if He had 
made two worlds, it would be better if He had made three; and so on to 
infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The world is composed of the whole of its matter. For it is 
not possible for there to be another earth than this one, since every 
earth would naturally be carried to this central one, wherever it was. 
The same applies to the other bodies which are part of the world.<br>
