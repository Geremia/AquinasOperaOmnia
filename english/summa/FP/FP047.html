    TREATISE ON THE DISTINCTION OF THINGS IN GENERAL (Question [47])<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    OF THE DISTINCTION OF THINGS IN GENERAL (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After considering the production of creatures, we come to the consideration
    of the distinction of things. This consideration will be threefold---first,
    of the distinction of things in general; secondly, of the distinction of
    good and evil; thirdly, of the distinction of the spiritual and corporeal
    creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head, there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP047.html#FPQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> The multitude or distinction of
    things.
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> Their inequality.</p>
  <p><a href="FP047.html#FPQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> The unity of the world.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the multitude and distinction of things come from God?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the multitude and distinction
    of things does not come from God. For one naturally always makes one. But
    God is supremely one, as appears from what precedes (<a
      href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1"
      >Question [11]</a
    >, <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore He produces
    but one effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the representation is assimilated to its
    exemplar. But God is the exemplar cause of His effect, as was said above (<a
      href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, as God is
    one, His effect is one only, and not diverse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the means are proportional to the end.
    But the end of the creation is one---viz. the divine goodness, as was shown
    above (<a href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>,
    <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore the effect of
    God is but one.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A4,7"
      >Gn. 1:4,7</a
    >) that God "divided the light from the darkness," and "divided waters from
    waters." Therefore the distinction and multitude of things is from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The distinction of things has been ascribed to
    many causes. For some attributed the distinction to matter, either by itself
    or with the agent. Democritus, for instance, and all the ancient natural
    philosophers, who admitted no cause but matter, attributed it to matter
    alone; and in their opinion the distinction of things comes from chance
    according to the movement of matter. Anaxagoras, however, attributed the
    distinction and multitude of things to matter and to the agent together; and
    he said that the intellect distinguishes things by extracting what is mixed
    up in matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because, as was shown above
    (<a href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>,
    <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), even matter itself was
    created by God. Hence we must reduce whatever distinction comes from matter
    to a higher cause. Secondly, because matter is for the sake of the form, and
    not the form for the matter, and the distinction of things comes from their
    proper forms. Therefore the distinction of things is not on account of the
    matter; but rather, on the contrary, created matter is formless, in order
    that it may be accommodated to different forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others have attributed the distinction of things to secondary agents, as did
    Avicenna, who said that God by understanding Himself, produced the first
    intelligence; in which, forasmuch as it was not its own being, there is
    necessarily composition of potentiality and act, as will appear later (<a
      href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). And so the first
    intelligence, inasmuch as it understood the first cause, produced the second
    intelligence; and in so far as it understood itself as in potentiality it
    produced the heavenly body, which causes movement, and inasmuch as it
    understood itself as having actuality it produced the soul of the
    heavens.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this opinion cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because it was shown
    above (<a href="FP045.html#FPQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>,
    <a href="FP045.html#FPQ45A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) that to create belongs to
    God alone, and hence what can be caused only by creation is produced by God
    alone---viz. all those things which are not subject to generation and
    corruption. Secondly, because, according to this opinion, the universality
    of things would not proceed from the intention of the first agent, but from
    the concurrence of many active causes; and such an effect we can describe
    only as being produced by chance. Therefore, the perfection of the universe,
    which consists of the diversity of things, would thus be a thing of chance,
    which is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence we must say that the distinction and multitude of things come from the
    intention of the first agent, who is God. For He brought things into being
    in order that His goodness might be communicated to creatures, and be
    represented by them; and because His goodness could not be adequately
    represented by one creature alone, He produced many and diverse creatures,
    that what was wanting to one in the representation of the divine goodness
    might be supplied by another. For goodness, which in God is simple and
    uniform, in creatures is manifold and divided and hence the whole universe
    together participates the divine goodness more perfectly, and represents it
    better than any single creature whatever.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And because the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things,
    therefore Moses said that things are made distinct by the word of God, which
    is the concept of His wisdom; and this is what we read in Gn. 1:3,4: "God
    said: Be light made... And He divided the light from the darkness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural agent acts by the form which
    makes it what it is, and which is only one in one thing; and therefore its
    effect is one only. But the voluntary agent, such as God is, as was shown
    above (<a href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), acts by an intellectual
    form. Since, therefore, it is not against God's unity and simplicity to
    understand many things, as was shown above (<a href="FP015.html#FPQ15OUTP1"
      >Question [15]</a
    >, <a href="FP015.html#FPQ15A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that,
    although He is one, He can make many things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This reason would apply to the
    representation which reflects the exemplar perfectly, and which is
    multiplied by reason of matter only; hence the uncreated image, which is
    perfect, is only one. But no creature represents the first exemplar
    perfectly, which is the divine essence; and, therefore, it can be
    represented by many things. Still, according as ideas are called exemplars,
    the plurality of ideas corresponds in the divine mind to the plurality of
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In speculative things the medium of
    demonstration, which demonstrates the conclusion perfectly, is one only;
    whereas probable means of proof are many. Likewise when operation is
    concerned, if the means be equal, so to speak, to the end, one only is
    sufficient. But the creature is not such a means to its end, which is God;
    and hence the multiplication of creatures is necessary.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the inequality of things is from God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the inequality of things is
    not from God. For it belongs to the best to produce the best. But among
    things that are best, one is not greater than another. Therefore, it belongs
    to God, Who is the Best, to make all things equal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, equality is the effect of unity (Metaph.
    v, text 20). But God is one. Therefore, He has made all things equal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is the part of justice to give
    unequal to unequal things. But God is just in all His works. Since,
    therefore, no inequality of things is presupposed to the operation whereby
    He gives being to things, it seems that He has made all things equal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (Ecclus. 33:7): "Why does one day
    excel another, and one light another, and one year another year, one sun
    another sun? [Vulg.: 'when all come of the sun']. By the knowledge of the
    Lord they were distinguished."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> When Origen wished to refute those who said
    that the distinction of things arose from the contrary principles of good
    and evil, he said that in the beginning all things were created equal by
    God. For he asserted that God first created only the rational creatures and
    all equal; and that inequality arose in them from free-will, some being
    turned to God more and some less, and others turned more and others less
    away from God. And so those rational creatures which were turned to God by
    free-will, were promoted to the order of angels according to the diversity
    of merits. And those who were turned away from God were bound down to bodies
    according to the diversity of their sin; and he said this was the cause of
    the creation and diversity of bodies. But according to this opinion, it
    would follow that the universality of bodily creatures would not be the
    effect of the goodness of God as communicated to creatures, but it would be
    for the sake of the punishment of sin, which is contrary to what is said:
    "God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A31"
      >Gn. 1:31</a
    >). And, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 3): "What can be more foolish
    than to say that the divine Architect provided this one sun for the one
    world, not to be an ornament to its beauty, nor for the benefit of corporeal
    things, but that it happened through the sin of one soul; so that, if a
    hundred souls had sinned, there would be a hundred suns in the world?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it must be said that as the wisdom of God is the cause of the
    distinction of things, so the same wisdom is the cause of their inequality.
    This may be explained as follows. A twofold distinction is found in things;
    one is a formal distinction as regards things differing specifically; the
    other is a material distinction as regards things differing numerically
    only. And as the matter is on account of the form, material distinction
    exists for the sake of the formal distinction. Hence we see that in
    incorruptible things there is only one individual of each species, forasmuch
    as the species is sufficiently preserved in the one; whereas in things
    generated and corruptible there are many individuals of one species for the
    preservation of the species. Whence it appears that formal distinction is of
    greater consequence than material. Now, formal distinction always requires
    inequality, because as the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, 10), the forms of
    things are like numbers in which species vary by addition or subtraction of
    unity. Hence in natural things species seem to be arranged in degrees; as
    the mixed things are more perfect than the elements, and plants than
    minerals, and animals than plants, and men than other animals; and in each
    of these one species is more perfect than others. Therefore, as the divine
    wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things for the sake of the
    perfection of the universe, so it is the cause of inequality. For the
    universe would not be perfect if only one grade of goodness were found in
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is part of the best agent to produce
    an effect which is best in its entirety; but this does not mean that He
    makes every part of the whole the best absolutely, but in proportion to the
    whole; in the case of an animal, for instance, its goodness would be taken
    away if every part of it had the dignity of an eye. Thus, therefore, God
    also made the universe to be best as a whole, according to the mode of a
    creature; whereas He did not make each single creature best, but one better
    than another. And therefore we find it said of each creature, "God saw the
    light that it was good" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A4"
      >Gn. 1:4</a
    >); and in like manner of each one of the rest. But of all together it is
    said, "God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A31"
      >Gn. 1:31</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The first effect of unity is equality;
    and then comes multiplicity; and therefore from the Father, to Whom,
    according to Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5), is appropriated unity, the
    Son proceeds to Whom is appropriated equality, and then from Him the
    creature proceeds, to which belongs inequality; but nevertheless even
    creatures share in a certain equality---namely, of proportion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This is the argument that persuaded
    Origen: but it holds only as regards the distribution of rewards, the
    inequality of which is due to unequal merits. But in the constitution of
    things there is no inequality of parts through any preceding inequality,
    either of merits or of the disposition of the matter; but inequality comes
    from the perfection of the whole. This appears also in works done by art;
    for the roof of a house differs from the foundation, not because it is made
    of other material; but in order that the house may be made perfect of
    different parts, the artificer seeks different material; indeed, he would
    make such material if he could.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is only one world?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not only one world,
    but many. Because, as Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 46), it is
    unfitting to say that God has created things without a reason. But for the
    same reason He created one, He could create many, since His power is not
    limited to the creation of one world; but rather it is infinite, as was
    shown above (<a href="FP025.html#FPQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore God has
    produced many worlds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nature does what is best and much more
    does God. But it is better for there to be many worlds than one, because
    many good things are better than a few. Therefore many worlds have been made
    by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything which has a form in matter
    can be multiplied in number, the species remaining the same, because
    multiplication in number comes from matter. But the world has a form in
    matter. Thus as when I say "man" I mean the form, and when I say "this man,"
    I mean the form in matter; so when we say "world," the form is signified,
    and when we say "this world," the form in the matter is signified. Therefore
    there is nothing to prevent the existence of many worlds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A10"
      >Jn. 1:10</a
    >): "The world was made by Him," where the world is named as one, as if only
    one existed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The very order of things created by God shows
    the unity of the world. For this world is called one by the unity of order,
    whereby some things are ordered to others. But whatever things come from
    God, have relation of order to each other, and to God Himself, as shown
    above (<a href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>,
    <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>,
    <a href="FP021.html#FPQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it must be that
    all things should belong to one world. Therefore those only can assert that
    many worlds exist who do not acknowledge any ordaining wisdom, but rather
    believe in chance, as Democritus, who said that this world, besides an
    infinite number of other worlds, was made from a casual concourse of
    atoms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This reason proves that the world is one
    because all things must be arranged in one order, and to one end. Therefore
    from the unity of order in things Aristotle infers (Metaph. xii, text 52)
    the unity of God governing all; and Plato (Tim.), from the unity of the
    exemplar, proves the unity of the world, as the thing designed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No agent intends material plurality as
    the end forasmuch as material multitude has no certain limit, but of itself
    tends to infinity, and the infinite is opposed to the notion of end. Now
    when it is said that many worlds are better than one, this has reference to
    material order. But the best in this sense is not the intention of the
    divine agent; forasmuch as for the same reason it might be said that if He
    had made two worlds, it would be better if He had made three; and so on to
    infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The world is composed of the whole of
    its matter. For it is not possible for there to be another earth than this
    one, since every earth would naturally be carried to this central one,
    wherever it was. The same applies to the other bodies which are part of the
    world.<br />
