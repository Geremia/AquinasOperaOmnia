</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After the consideration of those things which belong to the divine 
knowledge, we now proceed to the consideration of the divine names. For 
everything is named by us according to our knowledge of it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this head, there are twelve points for inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether God can be named by us?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether any names applied to God are predicated of Him substantially?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether any names applied to God are said of Him literally, or are 
all to be taken metaphorically?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether any names applied to God are synonymous?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether some names are applied to God and to creatures univocally or 
equivocally?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether, supposing they are applied analogically, they are applied 
first to God or to creatures?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether any names are applicable to God from time?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether this name "God" is a name of nature, or of the operation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether this name "God" is a communicable name?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether it is taken univocally or equivocally as signifying God, by 
nature, by participation, and by opinion?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether this name, "Who is," is the supremely appropriate name of 
God?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A12THEP1">(12)</a> Whether affirmative propositions can be formed about God?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no name can be given to God. For Dionysius says 
(Div. Nom. i) that, "Of Him there is neither name, nor can one be found 
of Him;" and it is written: "What is His name, and what is the name of 
His Son, if thou knowest?" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++30%3A4">Prov. 30:4</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every name is either abstract or concrete. But concrete 
names do not belong to God, since He is simple, nor do abstract names 
belong to Him, forasmuch as they do not signify any perfect subsisting 
thing. Therefore no name can be said of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nouns are taken to signify substance with quality; verbs 
and participles signify substance with time; pronouns the same with 
demonstration or relation. But none of these can be applied to God, for 
He has no quality, nor accident, nor  time; moreover, He cannot be felt, 
so as to be pointed out; nor can He be described by relation, inasmuch as 
relations serve to recall a thing mentioned before by nouns, participles, 
or demonstrative pronouns. Therefore God cannot in any way be named by us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++15%3A3">Ex. 15:3</a>): "The Lord is a man of war, 
Almighty is His name."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm. i), words 
are signs of ideas, and ideas the similitude of things, it is evident 
that words relate to the meaning of things signified through the medium 
of the intellectual conception. It follows therefore that we can give a 
name to anything in as far as we can understand it. Now it was shown 
above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12ATHEP1">Articles [11]</a>,12) that in this life we cannot see the essence of 
God; but we know God from creatures as their principle, and also by way 
of excellence and remotion. In this way therefore He can be named by us 
from creatures, yet not so that the name which signifies Him expresses 
the divine essence in itself. Thus the name "man" expresses the essence 
of man in himself, since it signifies the definition of man by 
manifesting his essence; for the idea expressed by the name is the 
definition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The reason why God has no name, or is said to be above 
being named, is because His essence is above all that we understand about 
God, and signify in word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Because we know and name God from creatures, the names we 
attribute to God signify what belongs to material creatures, of which the 
knowledge is natural to us. And because in creatures of this kind what is 
perfect and subsistent is compound; whereas their form is not a complete 
subsisting thing, but rather is that whereby a thing is; hence it follows 
that all names used by us to signify a complete subsisting thing must 
have a concrete meaning as applicable to compound things; whereas names 
given to signify simple forms, signify a thing not as subsisting, but as 
that whereby a thing is; as, for instance, whiteness signifies that 
whereby a thing is white. And as God is simple, and subsisting, we 
attribute to Him abstract names to signify His simplicity, and concrete 
names to signify His substance and perfection, although both these kinds 
of names fail to express His mode of being, forasmuch as our intellect 
does not know Him in this life as He is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To signify substance with quality is to signify the 
"suppositum" with a nature or determined form in which it subsists. 
Hence, as some things are said of God in a concrete sense, to signify His 
subsistence and perfection, so likewise nouns are applied to God 
signifying substance with quality. Further, verbs and participles which 
signify time, are applied to Him because His eternity includes all time. 
For as we can apprehend and signify simple subsistences only by way of 
compound things, so we can understand and express simple eternity only by 
way of temporal things, because our intellect has a natural affinity to 
compound and temporal things. But demonstrative pronouns are applied to 
God  as describing what is understood, not what is sensed. For we can 
only describe Him as far as we understand Him. Thus, according as nouns, 
participles and demonstrative pronouns are applicable to God, so far can 
He be signified by relative pronouns.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any name can be applied to God substantially?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no name can be applied to God substantially. For 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 9): "Everything said of God signifies 
not His substance, but rather shows forth what He is not; or expresses 
some relation, or something following from His nature or operation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): "You will find a chorus of 
holy doctors addressed to the end of distinguishing clearly and 
praiseworthily the divine processions in the denomination of God." Thus 
the names applied by the holy doctors in praising God are distinguished 
according to the divine processions themselves. But what expresses the 
procession of anything, does not signify its essence. Therefore the names 
applied to God are not said of Him substantially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a thing is named by us according as we understand it. 
But God is not understood by us in this life in His substance. Therefore 
neither is any name we can use applied substantially to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi): "The being of God is the 
being strong, or the being wise, or whatever else we may say of that 
simplicity whereby His substance is signified." Therefore all names of 
this kind signify the divine substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Negative names applied to God, or signifying His relation 
to creatures manifestly do not at all signify His substance, but rather 
express the distance of the creature from Him, or His relation to 
something else, or rather, the relation of creatures to Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as regards absolute and affirmative names of God, as "good," "wise," 
and the like, various and many opinions have been given. For some have 
said that all such names, although they are applied to God affirmatively, 
nevertheless have been brought into use more to express some remotion 
from God, rather than to express anything that exists positively in Him. 
Hence they assert that when we say that God lives, we mean that God is 
not like an inanimate thing; and the same in like manner applies to other 
names; and this was taught by Rabbi Moses. Others say that these names 
applied to God signify His relationship towards creatures: thus in the 
words, "God is good," we mean, God is the cause of goodness in things; 
and the same rule applies to other names.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of these opinions, however, seem to be untrue for three reasons. 
First because in neither of them can a reason be assigned  why some names 
more than others are applied to God. For He is assuredly the cause of 
bodies in the same way as He is the cause of good things; therefore if 
the words "God is good," signified no more than, "God is the cause of 
good things," it might in like manner be said that God is a body, 
inasmuch as He is the cause of bodies. So also to say that He is a body 
implies that He is not a mere potentiality, as is primary matter. 
Secondly, because it would follow that all names applied to God would be 
said of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense, as healthy is 
secondarily said of medicine, forasmuch as it signifies only the cause of 
the health in the animal which primarily is called healthy. Thirdly, 
because this is against the intention of those who speak of God. For in 
saying that God lives, they assuredly mean more than to say the He is the 
cause of our life, or that He differs from inanimate bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we must hold a different doctrine---viz. that these names 
signify the divine substance, and are predicated substantially of God, 
although they fall short of a full representation of Him. Which is proved 
thus. For these names express God, so far as our intellects know Him. Now 
since our intellect knows God from creatures, it knows Him as far as 
creatures represent Him. Now it is shown above (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that God 
prepossesses in Himself all the perfections of creatures, being Himself 
simply and universally perfect. Hence every creature represents Him, and 
is like Him so far as it possesses some perfection; yet it represents Him 
not as something of the same species or genus, but as the excelling 
principle of whose form the effects fall short, although they derive some 
kind of likeness thereto, even as the forms of inferior bodies represent 
the power of the sun. This was explained above (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), in treating 
of the divine perfection. Therefore the aforesaid names signify the 
divine substance, but in an imperfect manner, even as creatures represent 
it imperfectly. So when we say, "God is good," the meaning is not, "God 
is the cause of goodness," or "God is not evil"; but the meaning is, 
"Whatever good we attribute to creatures, pre-exists in God," and in a 
more excellent and higher way. Hence it does not follow that God is good, 
because He causes goodness; but rather, on the contrary, He causes 
goodness in things because He is good; according to what Augustine says 
(De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), "Because He is good, we are."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene says that these names do not signify what God is, 
forasmuch as by none of these names is perfectly expressed what He is; 
but each one signifies Him in an imperfect manner, even as creatures 
represent Him imperfectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the significance of names, that from which the name is 
derived is different sometimes from what it is intended to signify, as 
for instance, this name "stone" [lapis] is imposed from the fact that it 
hurts the foot [loedit pedem], but it is not imposed to signify that 
which hurts the foot, but rather to signify a certain kind of body; 
otherwise everything that hurts the foot would be a stone [*This refers 
to the Latin etymology of the word "lapis" which has no place in 
English]. So we must say that these  kinds of divine names are imposed 
from the divine processions; for as according to the diverse processions 
of their perfections, creatures are the representations of God, although 
in an imperfect manner; so likewise our intellect knows and names God 
according to each kind of procession; but nevertheless these names are 
not imposed to signify the procession themselves, as if when we say "God 
lives," the sense were, "life proceeds from Him"; but to signify the 
principle itself of things, in so far as life pre-exists in Him, although 
it pre-exists in Him in a more eminent way than can be understood or 
signified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We cannot know the essence of God in this life, as He 
really is in Himself; but we know Him accordingly as He is represented in 
the perfections of creatures; and thus the names imposed by us signify 
Him in that manner only.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no name is applied literally to God. For all names 
which we apply to God are taken from creatures; as was explained above 
(<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the names of creatures are applied to God metaphorically, as 
when we say, God is a stone, or a lion, or the like. Therefore names are 
applied to God in a metaphorical sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no name can be applied literally to anything if it 
should be withheld from it rather than given to it. But all such names as 
"good," "wise," and the like are more truly withheld from God than given 
to Him; as appears from Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ii). Therefore none 
of these names belong to God in their literal sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, corporeal names are applied to God in a metaphorical 
sense only; since He is incorporeal. But all such names imply some kind 
of corporeal condition; for their meaning is bound up with time and 
composition and like corporeal conditions. Therefore all these names are 
applied to God in a metaphorical sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Fide ii), "Some names there are which 
express evidently the property of the divinity, and some which express 
the clear truth of the divine majesty, but others there are which are 
applied to God metaphorically by way of similitude." Therefore not all 
names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense, but there are some 
which are said of Him in their literal sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the preceding article, our knowledge of God 
is derived from the perfections which flow from Him to creatures, which 
perfections are in God in a more eminent way than in creatures. Now our 
intellect apprehends them as they are in creatures, and as it apprehends 
them it signifies them by names. Therefore as to the names applied to 
God---viz. the perfections which they signify, such as goodness, life and 
the  like, and their mode of signification. As regards what is signified 
by these names, they belong properly to God, and more properly than they 
belong to creatures, and are applied primarily to Him. But as regards 
their mode of signification, they do not properly and strictly apply to 
God; for their mode of signification applies to creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are some names which signify these perfections 
flowing from God to creatures in such a way that the imperfect way in 
which creatures receive the divine perfection is part of the very 
signification of the name itself as "stone" signifies a material being, 
and names of this kind can be applied to God only in a metaphorical 
sense. Other names, however, express these perfections absolutely, 
without any such mode of participation being part of their signification 
as the words "being," "good," "living," and the like, and such names can 
be literally applied to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Such names as these, as Dionysius shows, are denied of God 
for the reason that what the name signifies does not belong to Him in the 
ordinary sense of its signification, but in a more eminent way. Hence 
Dionysius says also that God is above all substance and all life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These names which are applied to God literally imply 
corporeal conditions not in the thing signified, but as regards their 
mode of signification; whereas those which are applied to God 
metaphorically imply and mean a corporeal condition in the thing 
signified.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that these names applied to God are synonymous names. 
For synonymous names are those which mean exactly the same. But these 
names applied to God mean entirely the same thing in God; for the 
goodness of God is His essence, and likewise it is His wisdom. Therefore 
these names are entirely synonymous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it be said these names signify one and the same thing 
in reality, but differ in idea, it can be objected that an idea to which 
no reality corresponds is a vain notion. Therefore if these ideas are 
many, and the thing is one, it seems also that all these ideas are vain 
notions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a thing which is one in reality and in idea, is more one 
than what is one in reality and many in idea. But God is supremely one. 
Therefore it seems that He is not one in reality and many in idea; and 
thus the names applied to God do not signify different ideas; and thus 
they are synonymous.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> All synonyms united with each other are redundant, as 
when we say, "vesture clothing." Therefore if all names applied to God 
are synonymous, we cannot properly say "good  God" or the like, and yet 
it is written, "O most mighty, great and powerful, the Lord of hosts is 
Thy name" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++32%3A18">Jer. 32:18</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> These names spoken of God are not synonymous. This would 
be easy to understand, if we said that these names are used to remove, or 
to express the relation of cause to creatures; for thus it would follow 
that there are different ideas as regards the diverse things denied of 
God, or as regards diverse effects connoted. But even according to what 
was said above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), that these names signify the divine substance, 
although in an imperfect manner, it is also clear from what has been said 
(Articles 1,2) that they have diverse meanings. For the idea signified by the 
name is the conception in the intellect of the thing signified by the 
name. But our intellect, since it knows God from creatures, in order to 
understand God, forms conceptions proportional to the perfections flowing 
from God to creatures, which perfections pre-exist in God unitedly and 
simply, whereas in creatures they are received and divided and 
multiplied. As therefore, to the different perfections of creatures, 
there corresponds one simple principle represented by different 
perfections of creatures in a various and manifold manner, so also to the 
various and multiplied conceptions of our intellect, there corresponds 
one altogether simple principle, according to these conceptions, 
imperfectly understood. Therefore although the names applied to God 
signify one thing, still because they signify that under many and 
different aspects, they are not synonymous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus appears the solution of the First Objection, since synonymous terms 
signify one thing under one aspect; for words which signify different 
aspects of one things, do not signify primarily and absolutely one thing; 
because the term only signifies the thing through the medium of the 
intellectual conception, as was said above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The many aspects of these names are not empty and vain, for 
there corresponds to all of them one simple reality represented by them 
in a manifold and imperfect manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The perfect unity of God requires that what are manifold 
and divided in others should exist in Him simply and unitedly. Thus it 
comes about that He is one in reality, and yet multiple in idea, because 
our intellect apprehends Him in a manifold manner, as things represent 
Him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether what is said of God and of creatures is univocally predicated of them?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the things attributed to God and creatures are 
univocal. For every equivocal term is reduced to the univocal, as many 
are reduced to one; for if the name "dog" be said equivocally of the 
barking dog, and of the dogfish, it must be said of some 
univocally---viz. of all barking dogs; otherwise we proceed to 
infinitude. Now there are some univocal agents which agree with  their 
effects in name and definition, as man generates man; and there are some 
agents which are equivocal, as the sun which causes heat, although the 
sun is hot only in an equivocal sense. Therefore it seems that the first 
agent to which all other agents are reduced, is an univocal agent: and 
thus what is said of God and creatures, is predicated univocally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no similitude among equivocal things. Therefore 
as creatures have a certain likeness to God, according to the word of 
Genesis (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1%3A26">Gn. 1:26</a>), "Let us make man to our image and likeness," it seems 
that something can be said of God and creatures univocally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, measure is homogeneous with the thing measured. But God 
is the first measure of all beings. Therefore God is homogeneous with 
creatures; and thus a word may be applied univocally to God and to 
creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> whatever is predicated of various things under the same 
name but not in the same sense, is predicated equivocally. But no name 
belongs to God in the same sense that it belongs to creatures; for 
instance, wisdom in creatures is a quality, but not in God. Now a 
different genus changes an essence, since the genus is part of the 
definition; and the same applies to other things. Therefore whatever is 
said of God and of creatures is predicated equivocally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, God is more distant from creatures than any creatures are from 
each other. But the distance of some creatures makes any univocal 
predication of them impossible, as in the case of those things which are 
not in the same genus. Therefore much less can anything be predicated 
univocally of God and creatures; and so only equivocal predication can be 
applied to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Univocal predication is impossible between God and 
creatures. The reason of this is that every effect which is not an 
adequate result of the power of the efficient cause, receives the 
similitude of the agent not in its full degree, but in a measure that 
falls short, so that what is divided and multiplied in the effects 
resides in the agent simply, and in the same manner; as for example the 
sun by exercise of its one power produces manifold and various forms in 
all inferior things. In the same way, as said in the preceding article, 
all perfections existing in creatures divided and multiplied, pre-exist 
in God unitedly. Thus when any term expressing perfection is applied to a 
creature, it signifies that perfection distinct in idea from other 
perfections; as, for instance, by the term "wise" applied to man, we 
signify some perfection distinct from a man's essence, and distinct from 
his power and existence, and from all similar things; whereas when we 
apply to it God, we do not mean to signify anything distinct from His 
essence, or power, or existence. Thus also this term "wise" applied to 
man in some degree circumscribes and comprehends the thing signified; 
whereas this is not the case when it is applied to God; but it leaves the 
thing signified as incomprehended, and as  exceeding the signification of 
the name. Hence it is evident that this term "wise" is not applied in the 
same way to God and to man. The same rule applies to other terms. Hence 
no name is predicated univocally of God and of creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither, on the other hand, are names applied to God and creatures in a 
purely equivocal sense, as some have said. Because if that were so, it 
follows that from creatures nothing could be known or demonstrated about 
God at all; for the reasoning would always be exposed to the fallacy of 
equivocation. Such a view is against the philosophers, who proved many 
things about God, and also against what the Apostle says: "The invisible 
things of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are 
made" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A20">Rm. 1:20</a>). Therefore it must be said that these names are said of 
God and creatures in an analogous sense, i.e. according to proportion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now names are thus used in two ways: either according as many things are 
proportionate to one, thus for example "healthy" predicated of medicine 
and urine in relation and in proportion to health of a body, of which the 
former is the sign and the latter the cause: or according as one thing is 
proportionate to another, thus "healthy" is said of medicine and animal, 
since medicine is the cause of health in the animal body. And in this way 
some things are said of God and creatures analogically, and not in a 
purely equivocal nor in a purely univocal sense. For we can name God only 
from creatures (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Thus whatever is said of God and creatures, is 
said according to the relation of a creature to God as its principle and 
cause, wherein all perfections of things pre-exist excellently. Now this 
mode of community of idea is a mean between pure equivocation and simple 
univocation. For in analogies the idea is not, as it is in univocals, one 
and the same, yet it is not totally diverse as in equivocals; but a term 
which is thus used in a multiple sense signifies various proportions to 
some one thing; thus "healthy" applied to urine signifies the sign of 
animal health, and applied to medicine signifies the cause of the same 
health.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although equivocal predications must be reduced to 
univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the 
univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the 
whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of 
all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause 
of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it 
is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this 
individual which it places under the species by way of participation. 
Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal 
agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But 
this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not 
altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, 
but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal 
predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical 
predication, which is being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of the creature to God is imperfect, for it 
does not represent one and the same generic thing (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God is not the measure proportioned to things measured; 
hence it is not necessary that God and creatures should be in the same 
genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The arguments adduced in the contrary sense prove indeed that these 
names are not predicated univocally of God and creatures; yet they do not 
prove that they are predicated equivocally.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether names predicated of God are predicated primarily of creatures?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that names are predicated primarily of creatures rather 
than of God. For we name anything accordingly as we know it, since 
"names", as the Philosopher says, "are signs of ideas." But we know 
creatures before we know God. Therefore the names imposed by us are 
predicated primarily of creatures rather than of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): "We name God from 
creatures." But names transferred from creatures to God, are said 
primarily of creatures rather than of God, as "lion," "stone," and the 
like. Therefore all names applied to God and creatures are applied 
primarily to creatures rather than to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all names equally applied to God and creatures, are 
applied to God as the cause of all creatures, as Dionysius says (De 
Mystica Theol.). But what is applied to anything through its cause, is 
applied to it secondarily, for "healthy" is primarily predicated of 
animal rather than of medicine, which is the cause of health. Therefore 
these names are said primarily of creatures rather than of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written, "I bow my knees to the Father, of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, of Whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++3%3A14,15">Eph. 3:14,15</a>); and the same applies to the other names applied to God 
and creatures. Therefore these names are applied primarily to God rather 
than to creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In names predicated of many in an analogical sense, all 
are predicated because they have reference to some one thing; and this 
one thing must be placed in the definition of them all. And since that 
expressed by the name is the definition, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. 
iv), such a name must be applied primarily to that which is put in the 
definition of such other things, and secondarily to these others 
according as they approach more or less to that first. Thus, for 
instance, "healthy" applied to animals comes into the definition of 
"healthy" applied to medicine, which is called healthy as being the cause 
of health in the animal; and also into the definition of "healthy" which 
is applied to urine, which is called healthy in so far as it is the  sign 
of the animal's health. Thus all names applied metaphorically to God, are 
applied to creatures primarily rather than to God, because when said of 
God they mean only similitudes to such creatures. For as "smiling" 
applied to a field means only that the field in the beauty of its 
flowering is like the beauty of the human smile by proportionate 
likeness, so the name of "lion" applied to God means only that God 
manifests strength in His works, as a lion in his. Thus it is clear that 
applied to God the signification of names can be defined only from what 
is said of creatures. But to other names not applied to God in a 
metaphorical sense, the same rule would apply if they were spoken of God 
as the cause only, as some have supposed. For when it is said, "God is 
good," it would then only mean "God is the cause of the creature's 
goodness"; thus the term good applied to God would included in its 
meaning the creature's goodness. Hence "good" would apply primarily to 
creatures rather than to God. But as was shown above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), these names 
are applied to God not as the cause only, but also essentially. For the 
words, "God is good," or "wise," signify not only that He is the cause of 
wisdom or goodness, but that these exist in Him in a more excellent way. 
Hence as regards what the name signifies, these names are applied 
primarily to God rather than to creatures, because these perfections flow 
from God to creatures; but as regards the imposition of the names, they 
are primarily applied by us to creatures which we know first. Hence they 
have a mode of signification which belongs to creatures, as said above 
(<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection refers to the imposition of the name.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same rule does not apply to metaphorical and to other 
names, as said above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection would be valid if these names were applied 
to God only as cause, and not also essentially, for instance as "healthy" 
is applied to medicine.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether names which imply relation to creatures are predicated of God temporally?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that names which imply relation to creatures are not 
predicated of God temporally. For all such names signify the divine 
substance, as is universally held. Hence also Ambrose (De Fide i) that 
this name "Lord" is the name of power, which is the divine substance; and 
"Creator" signifies the action of God, which is His essence. Now the 
divine substance is not temporal, but eternal. Therefore these names are 
not applied to God temporally, but eternally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that to which something applies temporally can be 
described as made; for what is white temporally is made white. But to 
make does no apply to God. Therefore nothing can be predicated of God 
temporally. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if any names are applied to God temporally as implying 
relation to creatures, the same rule holds good of all things that imply 
relation to creatures. But some names are spoken of God implying relation 
of God to creatures from eternity; for from eternity He knew and loved 
the creature, according to the word: "I have loved thee with an 
everlasting love" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++31%3A3">Jer. 31:3</a>). Therefore also other names implying 
relation to creatures, as "Lord" and "Creator," are applied to God from 
eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, names of this kind signify relation. Therefore that 
relation must be something in God, or in the creature only. But it cannot 
be that it is something in the creature only, for in that case God would 
be called "Lord" from the opposite relation which is in creatures; and 
nothing is named from its opposite. Therefore the relation must be 
something in God also. But nothing temporal can be in God, for He is 
above time. Therefore these names are not applied to God temporally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a thing is called relative from relation; for instance 
lord from lordship, as white from whiteness. Therefore if the relation of 
lordship is not really in God, but only in idea, it follows that God is 
not really Lord, which is plainly false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, in relative things which are not simultaneous in nature, 
one can exist without the other; as a thing knowable can exist without 
the knowledge of it, as the Philosopher says (Praedic. v). But relative 
things which are said of God and creatures are not simultaneous in 
nature. Therefore a relation can be predicated of God to the creature 
even without the existence of the creature; and thus these names "Lord" 
and "Creator" are predicated of God from eternity, and not temporally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. v) that this relative 
appellation "Lord" is applied to God temporally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The names which import relation to creatures are applied 
to God temporally, and not from eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To see this we must learn that some have said that relation is not a 
reality, but only an idea. But this is plainly seen to be false from the 
very fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and 
habitude. Nevertheless it is necessary to know that since relation has 
two extremes, it happens in three ways that a relation is real or 
logical. Sometimes from both extremes it is an idea only, as when mutual 
order or habitude can only go between things in the apprehension of 
reason; as when we say a thing "the same as itself." For reason 
apprehending one thing twice regards it as two; thus it apprehends a 
certain habitude of a thing to itself. And the same applies to relations 
between "being" and "non-being" formed by reason, apprehending 
"non-being" as an extreme. The same is true of relations that follow upon 
an act of reason, as genus and species, and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Body Para. 3/5 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there are other relations which are realities as regards both 
extremes, as when for instance a habitude exists between two things 
according to some reality that belongs to both; as is clear of all 
relations, consequent upon quantity; as great and small, double and half, 
and the like; for quantity exists in both extremes: and the same applies 
to relations consequent upon action and passion, as motive power and the 
movable thing, father and son, and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, sometimes a relation in one extreme may be a reality, while in 
the other extreme it is an idea only; and this happens whenever two 
extremes are not of one order; as sense and science refer respectively to 
sensible things and to intellectual things; which, inasmuch as they are 
realities existing in nature, are outside the order of sensible and 
intellectual existence. Therefore in science and in sense a real relation 
exists, because they are ordered either to the knowledge or to the 
sensible perception of things; whereas the things looked at in themselves 
are outside this order, and hence in them there is no real relation to 
science and sense, but only in idea, inasmuch as the intellect apprehends 
them as terms of the relations of science and sense. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Metaph. v) that they are called relative, not forasmuch 
as they are related to other things, but as others are related to them. 
Likewise for instance, "on the right" is not applied to a column, unless 
it stands as regards an animal on the right side; which relation is not 
really in the column, but in the animal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since therefore God is outside the whole order of creation, and all 
creatures are ordered to Him, and not conversely, it is manifest that 
creatures are really related to God Himself; whereas in God there is no 
real relation to creatures, but a relation only in idea, inasmuch as 
creatures are referred to Him. Thus there is nothing to prevent these 
names which import relation to the creature from being predicated of God 
temporally, not by reason of any change in Him, but by reason of the 
change of the creature; as a column is on the right of an animal, without 
change in itself, but by change in the animal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some relative names are imposed to signify the relative 
habitudes themselves, as "master" and "servant," "father," and "son," and 
the like, and these relatives are called predicamental [secundum esse]. 
But others are imposed to signify the things from which ensue certain 
habitudes, as the mover and the thing moved, the head and the thing that 
has a head, and the like: and these relatives are called transcendental 
[secundum dici]. Thus, there is the same two-fold difference in divine 
names. For some signify the habitude itself to the creature, as "Lord," 
and these do not signify the divine substance directly, but indirectly, 
in so far as they presuppose the divine substance; as dominion 
presupposes power, which is the divine substance. Others signify the 
divine essence directly, and consequently the corresponding habitudes, as 
"Saviour," "Creator," and suchlike; and these signify the action of God, 
which is His essence. Yet both names are said of  God temporarily so far 
as they imply a habitude either principally or consequently, but not as 
signifying the essence, either directly or indirectly.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As relations applied to God temporally are only in God in 
our idea, so, "to become" or "to be made" are applied to God only in 
idea, with no change in Him, as for instance when we say, "Lord, Thou art 
become [Douay: 'hast been'] our refuge" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++89%3A1">Ps. 89:1</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The operation of the intellect and the will is in the 
operator, therefore names signifying relations following upon the action 
of the intellect or will, are applied to God from eternity; whereas those 
following upon the actions proceeding according to our mode of thinking 
to external effects are applied to God temporally, as "Saviour," 
"Creator," and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Relations signified by these names which are applied to God 
temporally, are in God only in idea; but the opposite relations in 
creatures are real. Nor is it incongruous that God should be denominated 
from relations really existing in the thing, yet so that the opposite 
relations in God should also be understood by us at the same time; in the 
sense that God is spoken of relatively to the creature, inasmuch as the 
creature is related to Him: thus the Philosopher says (Metaph. v) that 
the object is said to be knowable relatively because knowledge relates to 
it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Since God is related to the creature for the reason that 
the creature is related to Him: and since the relation of subjection is 
real in the creature, it follows that God is Lord not in idea only, but 
in reality; for He is called Lord according to the manner in which the 
creature is subject to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[7] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> To know whether relations are simultaneous by nature or 
otherwise, it is not necessary by nature or otherwise of things to which 
they belong but the meaning of the relations themselves. For if one in 
its idea includes another, and vice versa, then they are simultaneous by 
nature: as double and half, father and son, and the like. But if one in 
its idea includes another, and not vice versa, they are not simultaneous 
by nature. This applies to science and its object; for the object 
knowable is considered as a potentiality, and the science as a habit, or 
as an act. Hence the knowable object in its mode of signification exists 
before science, but if the same object is considered in act, then it is 
simultaneous with science in act; for the object known is nothing as such 
unless it is known. Thus, though God is prior to the creature, still 
because the signification of Lord includes the idea of a servant and vice 
versa, these two relative terms, "Lord" and "servant," are simultaneous 
by nature. Hence, God was not "Lord" until He had a creature subject to 
Himself.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this name, "God," is not a name of the nature. For 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 1) that "God {Theos} is so called from the 
{theein} [which means to care of] and to cherish all things; or from the 
{aithein}, that is to burn, for our God is a fire consuming all malice; 
or from {theasthai}, which means to consider all things." But all these 
names belong to operation. Therefore this name "God" signifies His 
operation and not His nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing is named by us as we know it. But the divine 
nature is unknown to us. Therefore this name "God" does not signify the 
divine nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Fide i) that "God" is a name of the 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whence a name is imposed, and what the name signifies are 
not always the same thing. For as we know substance from its properties 
and operations, so we name substance sometimes for its operation, or its 
property; e.g. we name the substance of a stone from its act, as for 
instance that it hurts the foot [loedit pedem]; but still this name is 
not meant to signify the particular action, but the stone's substance. 
The things, on the other hand, known to us in themselves, such as heat, 
cold, whiteness and the like, are not named from other things. Hence as 
regards such things the meaning of the name and its source are the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because therefore God is not known to us in His nature, but is made 
known to us from His operations or effects, we name Him from these, as 
said in Article [1]; hence this name "God" is a name of operation so far as 
relates to the source of its meaning. For this name is imposed from His 
universal providence over all things; since all who speak of God intend 
to name God as exercising providence over all; hence Dionysius says (Div. 
Nom. ii), "The Deity watches over all with perfect providence and 
goodness." But taken from this operation, this name "God" is imposed to 
signify the divine nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All that Damascene says refers to providence; which is the 
source of the signification of the name "God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We can name a thing according to the knowledge we have of 
its nature from its properties and effects. Hence because we can know 
what stone is in itself from its property, this name "stone" signifies 
the nature of the stone itself; for it signifies the definition of stone, 
by which we know what it is, for the idea which the name signifies is the 
definition, as is said in Metaph. iv. Now from the divine effects we 
cannot know the divine nature in itself, so as to know what it is; but 
only by way of eminence, and by way of causality, and of negation as 
stated above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). Thus the name "God" signifies the divine 
nature, for this name was imposed to signify something existing above all 
things, the principle of all things and removed from all things; for 
those who name God intend to signify all this.

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this name "God" is communicable. For whosoever 
shares in the thing signified by a name shares in the name itself. But 
this name "God" signifies the divine nature, which is communicable to 
others, according to the words, "He hath given us great [Vulg.: 'most 
great'] and precious promises, that by these we [Vulg.: 'ye'] may be made 
partakers of the divine nature" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Pt++1%3A4">2 Pt. 1:4</a>). Therefore this name "God" 
can be communicated to others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, only proper names are not communicable. Now this name 
"God" is not a proper, but an appellative noun; which appears from the 
fact that it has a plural, according to the text, "I have said, You are 
gods" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++81%3A6">Ps. 81:6</a>). Therefore this name "God" is communicable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this name "God" comes from operation, as explained. But 
other names given to God from His operations or effects are communicable; 
as "good," "wise," and the like. Therefore this name "God" is 
communicable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "They gave the incommunicable name to 
wood and stones" (Wis. 14:21), in reference to the divine name. Therefore 
this name "God" is incommunicable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A name is communicable in two ways: properly, and by 
similitude. It is properly communicable in the sense that its whole 
signification can be given to many; by similitude it is communicable 
according to some part of the signification of the name. For instance 
this name "lion" is properly communicable to all things of the same 
nature as "lion"; by similitude it is communicable to those who 
participate in the nature of a lion, as for instance by courage, or 
strength, and those who thus participate are called lions metaphorically. 
To know, however, what names are properly communicable, we must consider 
that every form existing in the singular subject, by which it is 
individualized, is common to many either in reality, or in idea; as human 
nature is common to many in reality, and in idea; whereas the nature of 
the sun is not common to many in reality, but only in idea; for the 
nature of the sun can be understood as existing in many subjects; and the 
reason is because the mind understands the nature of every species by 
abstraction from the singular. Hence to be in one singular subject or in 
many is outside the idea of the nature of the species. So, given the idea 
of a species, it can be understood as existing in many. But the singular, 
from the fact that it is singular, is divided off from all others. Hence 
every name imposed to signify any singular thing is incommunicable both 
in reality and idea; for the plurality of this individual thing cannot 
be; nor can it be conceived in idea. Hence no name signifying any 
individual thing is properly communicable to many, but only by way of 
similitude; as for instance a person can be called "Achilles" 
metaphorically, forasmuch as he may possess something of the properties 
of Achilles, such as strength. On the other hand, forms  which are 
individualized not by any "suppositum," but by and of themselves, as 
being subsisting forms, if understood as they are in themselves, could 
not be communicable either in reality or in idea; but only perhaps by way 
of similitude, as was said of individuals. Forasmuch as we are unable to 
understand simple self-subsisting forms as they really are, we understand 
them as compound things having forms in matter; therefore, as was said in 
the first article, we give them concrete names signifying a nature 
existing in some "suppositum." Hence, so far as concerns images, the same 
rules apply to names we impose to signify the nature of compound things 
as to names given to us to signify simple subsisting natures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, then, this name "God" is given to signify the divine nature as 
stated above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), and since the divine nature cannot be multiplied as 
shown above (<A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it follows that this name "God" is 
incommunicable in reality, but communicable in opinion; just in the same 
way as this name "sun" would be communicable according to the opinion of 
those who say there are many suns. Therefore, it is written: "You served 
them who by nature are not gods," (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A8">Gal. 4:8</a>), and a gloss adds, "Gods not 
in nature, but in human opinion." Nevertheless this name "God" is 
communicable, not in its whole signification, but in some part of it by 
way of similitude; so that those are called gods who share in divinity by 
likeness, according to the text, "I have said, You are gods" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++81%3A6">Ps. 81:6</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if any name were given to signify God not as to His nature but as to 
His "suppositum," accordingly as He is considered as "this something," 
that name would be absolutely incommunicable; as, for instance, perhaps 
the Tetragrammaton among the Hebrew; and this is like giving a name to 
the sun as signifying this individual thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The divine nature is only communicable according to the 
participation of some similitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This name "God" is an appellative name, and not a proper 
name, for it signifies the divine nature in the possessor; although God 
Himself in reality is neither universal nor particular. For names do not 
follow upon the mode of being in things, but upon the mode of being as it 
is in our mind. And yet it is incommunicable according to the truth of 
the thing, as was said above concerning the name "sun."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These names "good," "wise," and the like, are imposed from 
the perfections proceeding from God to creatures; but they do not signify 
the divine nature, but rather signify the perfections themselves 
absolutely; and therefore they are in truth communicable to many. But 
this name "God" is given to God from His own proper operation, which we 
experience continually, to signify the divine nature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this name "God" is applied to God univocally by nature, by participation, and according to opinion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this name "God" is applied to God univocally by 
nature, by participation, and according to opinion. For where a diverse 
signification exists, there is no contradiction of affirmation and 
negation; for equivocation prevents contradiction. But a Catholic who 
says: "An idol is not God," contradicts a pagan who says: "An idol is 
God." Therefore GOD in both senses is spoken of univocally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as an idol is God in opinion, and not in truth, so the 
enjoyment of carnal pleasures is called happiness in opinion, and not in 
truth. But this name "beatitude" is applied univocally to this supposed 
happiness, and also to true happiness. Therefore also this name "God" is 
applied univocally to the true God, and to God also in opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, names are called univocal because they contain one idea. 
Now when a Catholic says: "There is one God," he understands by the name 
God an omnipotent being, and one venerated above all; while the heathen 
understands the same when he says: "An idol is God." Therefore this name 
"God" is applied univocally to both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The idea in the intellect is the likeness of what is in 
the thing as is said in Peri Herm. i. But the word "animal" applied to a 
true animal, and to a picture of one, is equivocal. Therefore this name 
"God" applied to the true God and to God in opinion is applied 
equivocally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, No one can signify what he does not know. But the heathen does 
not know the divine nature. So when he says an idol is God, he does not 
signify the true Deity. On the other hand, A Catholic signifies the true 
Deity when he says that there is one God. Therefore this name "God" is 
not applied univocally, but equivocally to the true God, and to God 
according to opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This name "God" in the three aforesaid significations is 
taken neither univocally nor equivocally, but analogically. This is 
apparent from this reason: Univocal terms mean absolutely the same thing, 
but equivocal terms absolutely different; whereas in analogical terms a 
word taken in one signification must be placed in the definition of the 
same word taken in other senses; as, for instance, "being" which is 
applied to "substance" is placed in the definition of being as applied to 
"accident"; and "healthy" applied to animal is placed in the definition 
of healthy as applied to urine and medicine. For urine is the sign of 
health in the animal, and medicine is the cause of health.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same applies to the question at issue. For this name "God," as 
signifying the true God, includes the idea of God when it is used to 
denote God in opinion, or participation. For when we  name anyone god by 
participation, we understand by the name of god some likeness of the true 
God. Likewise, when we call an idol god, by this name god we understand 
and signify something which men think is God; thus it is manifest that 
the name has different meanings, but that one of them is comprised in the 
other significations. Hence it is manifestly said analogically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The multiplication of names does not depend on the 
predication of the name, but on the signification: for this name "man," 
of whomsoever it is predicated, whether truly or falsely, is predicated 
in one sense. But it would be multiplied if by the name "man" we meant to 
signify different things; for instance, if one meant to signify by this 
name "man" what man really is, and another meant to signify by the same 
name a stone, or something else. Hence it is evident that a Catholic 
saying that an idol is not God contradicts the pagan asserting that it is 
God; because each of them uses this name GOD to signify the true God. For 
when the pagan says an idol is God, he does not use this name as meaning 
God in opinion, for he would then speak the truth, as also Catholics 
sometimes use the name in the sense, as in the Psalm, "All the gods of 
the Gentiles are demons" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++95%3A5">Ps. 95:5</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same remark applies to the Second and Third Objections. For these 
reasons proceed from the different predication of the name, and not from 
its various significations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The term "animal" applied to a true and a pictured animal 
is not purely equivocal; for the Philosopher takes equivocal names in a 
large sense, including analogous names; because also being, which is 
predicated analogically, is sometimes said to be predicated equivocally 
of different predicaments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[10] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Neither a Catholic nor a pagan knows the very nature of God 
as it is in itself; but each one knows it according to some idea of 
causality, or excellence, or remotion (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). So a pagan can take 
this name "God" in the same way when he says an idol is God, as the 
Catholic does in saying an idol is not God. But if anyone should be quite 
ignorant of God altogether, he could not even name Him, unless, perhaps, 
as we use names the meaning of which we know not.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every divine name seems to imply relation to creatures, 
for God is known to us only through creatures. But this name HE WHO IS 
imports no relation to creatures. Therefore this name HE WHO IS is not 
the most applicable to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written that when Moses asked, "If they should 
say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?" The Lord answered 
him, "Thus shalt thou say to them, HE WHO IS hath sent me to you" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++3%3A13,14">Ex. 3:13,14</a>). Therefor this name HE WHO IS most properly belongs to God.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This name HE WHO IS is most properly applied to God, for 
three reasons:<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, because of its signification. For it does not signify form, but 
simply existence itself. Hence since the existence of God is His essence 
itself, which can be said of no other (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it is clear that 
among other names this one specially denominates God, for everything is 
denominated by its form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on account of its universality. For all other names are either 
less universal, or, if convertible with it, add something above it at 
least in idea; hence in a certain way they inform and determine it. Now 
our intellect cannot know the essence of God itself in this life, as it 
is in itself, but whatever mode it applies in determining what it 
understands about God, it falls short of the mode of what God is in 
Himself. Therefore the less determinate the names are, and the more 
universal and absolute they are, the more properly they are applied to 
God. Hence Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i) that, "HE WHO IS, is the 
principal of all names applied to God; for comprehending all in itself, 
it contains existence itself as an infinite and indeterminate sea of 
substance." Now by any other name some mode of substance is determined, 
whereas this name HE WHO IS, determines no mode of being, but is 
indeterminate to all; and therefore it denominates the "infinite ocean of 
substance."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, from its consignification, for it signifies present existence; 
and this above all properly applies to God, whose existence knows not 
past or future, as Augustine says (De Trin. v).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This name HE WHO IS is the name of God more properly than 
this name "God," as regards its source, namely, existence; and as regards 
the mode of signification and consignification, as said above. But as 
regards the object intended by the name, this name "God" is more proper, 
as it is imposed to signify the divine nature; and still more proper is 
the Tetragrammaton, imposed to signify the substance of God itself, 
incommunicable and, if one may so speak, singular.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This name "good" is the principal name of God in so far as 
He is a cause, but not absolutely; for existence considered absolutely 
comes before the idea of cause. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not necessary that all the divine names should import 
relation to creatures, but it suffices that they be imposed from some 
perfections flowing from God to creatures. Among these the first is 
existence, from which comes this name, HE WHO IS.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether affirmative propositions can be formed about God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that affirmative propositions cannot be formed about 
God. For Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ii) that "negations about God are 
true; but affirmations are vague."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Trin. ii) that "a simple form cannot 
be a subject." But God is the most absolutely simple form, as shown (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>): therefore He cannot be a subject. But everything about which an 
affirmative proposition is made is taken as a subject. Therefore an 
affirmative proposition cannot be formed about God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every intellect is false which understands a thing 
otherwise than as it is. But God has existence without any composition as 
shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore since every affirmative intellect 
understands something as compound, it follows that a true affirmative 
proposition about God cannot be made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> What is of faith cannot be false. But some affirmative 
propositions are of faith; as that God is Three and One; and that He is 
omnipotent. Therefore true affirmative propositions can be formed about 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> True affirmative propositions can be formed about God. To 
prove this we must know that in every true affirmative proposition the 
predicate and the subject signify in some way the same thing in reality, 
and different things in idea. And this appears to be the case both in 
propositions which have an accidental predicate, and in those which have 
an essential predicate. For it is manifest that "man" and "white" are the 
same in subject, and different in idea; for the idea of man is one thing, 
and that of whiteness is another. The same applies when I say, "man is an 
animal"; since the same thing which is man is truly animal; for in the 
same "suppositum" there is sensible nature by reason of which he is 
called animal, and the rational nature by reason of which he is called 
man; hence here again predicate and subject are the same as to 
"suppositum," but different as to idea. But in propositions where one 
same thing is predicated of itself, the same rule in some way applies, 
inasmuch as the intellect draws to the "suppositum" what it places in the 
subject; and what it places in the predicate it draws to the nature of 
the form existing in the "suppositum"; according to the saying that 
"predicates are to be taken formally, and subjects materially." To this 
diversity in idea corresponds the plurality of predicate and subject, 
while the intellect signifies the identity of the thing by the  
composition itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; God, however, as considered in Himself, is altogether one and simple, 
yet our intellect knows Him by different conceptions because it cannot 
see Him as He is in Himself. Nevertheless, although it understands Him 
under different conceptions, it knows that one and the same simple object 
corresponds to its conceptions. Therefore the plurality of predicate and 
subject represents the plurality of idea; and the intellect represents 
the unity by composition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius says that the affirmations about God are vague 
or, according to another translation, "incongruous," inasmuch as no name 
can be applied to God according to its mode of signification.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our intellect cannot comprehend simple subsisting forms, as 
they really are in themselves; but it apprehends them as compound things 
in which there is something taken as subject and something that is 
inherent. Therefore it apprehends the simple form as a subject, and 
attributes something else to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[13] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This proposition, "The intellect understanding anything 
otherwise than it is, is false," can be taken in two senses, accordingly 
as this adverb "otherwise" determines the word "understanding" on the 
part of the thing understood, or on the part of the one who understands. 
Taken as referring to the thing understood, the proposition is true, and 
the meaning is: Any intellect which understands that the thing is 
otherwise than it is, is false. But this does not hold in the present 
case; because our intellect, when forming a proposition about God, does 
not affirm that He is composite, but that He is simple. But taken as 
referring to the one who understands, the proposition is false. For the 
mode of the intellect in understanding is different from the mode of the 
thing in its essence. Since it is clear that our intellect understands 
material things below itself in an immaterial manner; not that it 
understands them to be immaterial things; but its manner of understanding 
is immaterial. Likewise, when it understands simple things above itself, 
it understands them according to its own mode, which is in a composite 
manner; yet not so as to understand them to be composite things. And thus 
our intellect is not false in forming composition in its ideas concerning 
God.<br>
