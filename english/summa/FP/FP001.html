TREATISE ON SACRED DOCTRINE (Question [1])<br>
<br>
THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SACRED DOCTRINE (TEN ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To place our purpose within proper limits, we first endeavor to 
investigate the nature and extent of this sacred doctrine. Concerning 
this there are ten points of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is necessary?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a science?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is one or many?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is speculative or practical?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A5THEP1">(5)</a> How it is compared with other sciences?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it is the same as wisdom?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether God is its subject-matter?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it is a matter of argument?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether it rightly employs metaphors and similes?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether the Sacred Scripture of this doctrine may be expounded in 
different senses?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that, besides philosophical science, we have no need of 
any further knowledge. For man should not seek to know what is above 
reason: "Seek not the things that are too high for thee" (Ecclus. 3:22). 
But whatever is not above reason is fully treated of in philosophical 
science. Therefore any other knowledge besides philosophical science is 
superfluous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, knowledge can be concerned only with being, for nothing 
can be known, save what is true; and all that is, is true. But everything 
that is, is treated of in philosophical science---even God Himself; so 
that there is a part of philosophy called theology, or the divine 
science, as Aristotle has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore, besides 
philosophical science, there is no need of any further knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Tim++3%3A16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>): "All Scripture, inspired 
of God is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in 
justice." Now Scripture, inspired of God, is no part of philosophical 
science, which has been built up by human reason. Therefore it is useful 
that besides philosophical science, there should be other knowledge, i.e. 
inspired of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be 
a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by 
human reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an 
end that surpasses the grasp of his reason: "The eye hath not seen, O 
God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for 
Thee" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++66%3A4">Is. 66:4</a>). But the end must first be known by men who are to 
direct their thoughts and actions to the end. Hence it was necessary for 
the salvation of man that certain truths which exceed human reason should 
be made known to him by divine revelation. Even as regards those truths 
about God which human reason could have discovered, it was necessary that 
man should be taught by a divine revelation; because the truth about God 
such as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and that 
after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors. Whereas man's 
whole salvation, which is in God, depends upon the knowledge of this 
truth. Therefore, in order that the salvation of men might be brought 
about more fitly and more surely, it was  necessary that they should be 
taught divine truths by divine revelation. It was therefore necessary 
that besides philosophical science built up by reason, there should be a 
sacred science learned through revelation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although those things which are beyond man's knowledge may 
not be sought for by man through his reason, nevertheless, once they are 
revealed by God, they must be accepted by faith. Hence the sacred text 
continues, "For many things are shown to thee above the understanding of 
man" (Ecclus. 3:25). And in this, the sacred science consists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sciences are differentiated according to the various means 
through which knowledge is obtained. For the astronomer and the physicist 
both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth, for instance, is 
round: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e. abstracting from 
matter), but the physicist by means of matter itself. Hence there is no 
reason why those things which may be learned from philosophical science, 
so far as they can be known by natural reason, may not also be taught us 
by another science so far as they fall within revelation. Hence theology 
included in sacred doctrine differs in kind from that theology which is 
part of philosophy.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science. For every science 
proceeds from self-evident principles. But sacred doctrine proceeds from 
articles of faith which are not self-evident, since their truth is not 
admitted by all: "For all men have not faith" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Thess++3%3A2">2 Thess. 3:2</a>). Therefore 
sacred doctrine is not a science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no science deals with individual facts. But this sacred 
science treats of individual facts, such as the deeds of Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob and such like. Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) "to this science alone 
belongs that whereby saving faith is begotten, nourished, protected and 
strengthened." But this can be said of no science except sacred doctrine. 
Therefore sacred doctrine is a science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine is a science. We must bear in mind that 
there are two kinds of sciences. There are some which proceed from a 
principle known by the natural light of intelligence, such as arithmetic 
and geometry and the like. There are some which proceed from principles 
known by the light of a higher science: thus the science of perspective 
proceeds from principles established by geometry, and music from 
principles established by arithmetic. So it is that sacred doctrine is a 
science because it proceeds from principles established by the  light of 
a higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed. Hence, just 
as the musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the 
mathematician, so sacred science is established on principles revealed by 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The principles of any science are either in themselves 
self-evident, or reducible to the conclusions of a higher science; and 
such, as we have said, are the principles of sacred doctrine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Individual facts are treated of in sacred doctrine, not 
because it is concerned with them principally, but they are introduced 
rather both as examples to be followed in our lives (as in moral 
sciences) and in order to establish the authority of those men through 
whom the divine revelation, on which this sacred scripture or doctrine is 
based, has come down to us.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not one science; for according 
to the Philosopher (Poster. i) "that science is one which treats only of 
one class of subjects." But the creator and the creature, both of whom 
are treated of in sacred doctrine, cannot be grouped together under one 
class of subjects. Therefore sacred doctrine is not one science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in sacred doctrine we treat of angels, corporeal 
creatures and human morality. But these belong to separate philosophical 
sciences. Therefore sacred doctrine cannot be one science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Holy Scripture speaks of it as one science: "Wisdom 
gave him the knowledge [scientiam] of holy things" (Wis. 10:10).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine is one science. The unity of a faculty or 
habit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, 
but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object. For 
example, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being 
colored; and color is the formal object of sight. Therefore, because 
Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being 
divinely revealed, whatever has been divinely revealed possesses the one 
precise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is 
included under sacred doctrine as under one science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sacred doctrine does not treat of God and creatures 
equally, but of God primarily, and of creatures only so far as they are 
referable to God as their beginning or end. Hence the unity of this 
science is not impaired.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nothing prevents inferior faculties or habits from being 
differentiated by something which falls under a higher  faculty or habit 
as well; because the higher faculty or habit regards the object in its 
more universal formality, as the object of the "common sense" is whatever 
affects the senses, including, therefore, whatever is visible or audible. 
Hence the "common sense," although one faculty, extends to all the 
objects of the five senses. Similarly, objects which are the 
subject-matter of different philosophical sciences can yet be treated of 
by this one single sacred science under one aspect precisely so far as 
they can be included in revelation. So that in this way, sacred doctrine 
bears, as it were, the stamp of the divine science which is one and 
simple, yet extends to everything.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sacred doctrine is a practical science?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is a practical science; for a 
practical science is that which ends in action according to the 
Philosopher (Metaph. ii). But sacred doctrine is ordained to action: "Be 
ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+1%3A22">James 1:22</a>). Therefore 
sacred doctrine is a practical science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacred doctrine is divided into the Old and the New Law. 
But law implies a moral science which is a practical science. Therefore 
sacred doctrine is a practical science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Every practical science is concerned with human 
operations; as moral science is concerned with human acts, and 
architecture with buildings. But sacred doctrine is chiefly concerned 
with God, whose handiwork is especially man. Therefore it is not a 
practical but a speculative science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine, being one, extends to things which 
belong to different philosophical sciences because it considers in each 
the same formal aspect, namely, so far as they can be known through 
divine revelation. Hence, although among the philosophical sciences one 
is speculative and another practical, nevertheless sacred doctrine 
includes both; as God, by one and the same science, knows both Himself 
and His works. Still, it is speculative rather than practical because it 
is more concerned with divine things than with human acts; though it does 
treat even of these latter, inasmuch as man is ordained by them to the 
perfect knowledge of God in which consists eternal bliss. This is a 
sufficient answer to the Objections.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not nobler than other sciences; 
for the nobility of a science depends on the certitude it establishes. 
But other sciences, the principles of which cannot be doubted, seem to be 
more certain than sacred doctrine; for its principles---namely, articles 
of faith---can be doubted. Therefore other sciences seem to be nobler.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is the sign of a lower science to depend upon a 
higher; as music depends on arithmetic. But sacred doctrine does in a 
sense depend upon philosophical sciences; for Jerome observes, in his 
Epistle to Magnus, that "the ancient doctors so enriched their books with 
the ideas and phrases of the philosophers, that thou knowest not what 
more to admire in them, their profane erudition or their scriptural 
learning." Therefore sacred doctrine is inferior to other sciences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Other sciences are called the handmaidens of this one: 
"Wisdom sent her maids to invite to the tower" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++9%3A3">Prov. 9:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since this science is partly speculative and partly 
practical, it transcends all others speculative and practical. Now one 
speculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason 
of its greater certitude, or by reason of the higher worth of its 
subject-matter. In both these respects this science surpasses other 
speculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other 
sciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason, 
which can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of 
divine knowledge, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of 
its subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things 
which by their sublimity transcend human reason; while other sciences 
consider only those things which are within reason's grasp. Of the 
practical sciences, that one is nobler which is ordained to a further 
purpose, as political science is nobler than military science; for the 
good of the army is directed to the good of the State. But the purpose of 
this science, in so far as it is practical, is eternal bliss; to which as 
to an ultimate end the purposes of every practical science are directed. 
Hence it is clear that from every standpoint, it is nobler than other 
sciences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It may well happen that what is in itself the more certain 
may seem to us the less certain on account of the weakness of our 
intelligence, "which is dazzled by the clearest objects of nature; as the 
owl is dazzled by the light of the sun" (Metaph. ii, lect. i). Hence the 
fact that some happen to doubt about articles of faith is not due to the 
uncertain nature of the truths, but to the weakness of human 
intelligence; yet the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the 
highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained 
of lesser things, as is said in de Animalibus xi.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This science can in a sense depend upon the philosophical 
sciences, not as though it stood in need of them, but only in order to 
make its teaching clearer. For it accepts its principles not from other 
sciences, but immediately from God, by revelation. Therefore it does not 
depend upon other sciences as upon the higher, but makes use of them as 
of the lesser, and as handmaidens: even so the master sciences make use 
of the sciences that supply their materials, as political of military 
science. That it thus uses them is not due to its own defect or 
insufficiency,  but to the defect of our intelligence, which is more 
easily led by what is known through natural reason (from which proceed 
the other sciences) to that which is above reason, such as are the 
teachings of this science.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this doctrine is not the same as wisdom. For no 
doctrine which borrows its principles is worthy of the name of wisdom; 
seeing that the wise man directs, and is not directed (Metaph. i). But 
this doctrine borrows its principles. Therefore this science is not 
wisdom.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a part of wisdom to prove the principles of other 
sciences. Hence it is called the chief of sciences, as is clear in Ethic. 
vi. But this doctrine does not prove the principles of other sciences. 
Therefore it is not the same as wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this doctrine is acquired by study, whereas wisdom is 
acquired by God's inspiration; so that it is numbered among the gifts of 
the Holy Spirit (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11%3A2">Is. 11:2</a>). Therefore this doctrine is not the same as 
wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++4%3A6">Dt. 4:6</a>): "This is your wisdom and 
understanding in the sight of nations."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This doctrine is wisdom above all human wisdom; not 
merely in any one order, but absolutely. For since it is the part of a 
wise man to arrange and to judge, and since lesser matters should be 
judged in the light of some higher principle, he is said to be wise in 
any one order who considers the highest principle in that order: thus in 
the order of building, he who plans the form of the house is called wise 
and architect, in opposition to the inferior laborers who trim the wood 
and make ready the stones: "As a wise architect, I have laid the 
foundation" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++3%3A10">1 Cor. 3:10</a>). Again, in the order of all human life, the 
prudent man is called wise, inasmuch as he directs his acts to a fitting 
end: "Wisdom is prudence to a man" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++10:+23">Prov. 10: 23</a>). Therefore he who 
considers absolutely the highest cause of the whole universe, namely God, 
is most of all called wise. Hence wisdom is said to be the knowledge of 
divine things, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 14). But sacred doctrine 
essentially treats of God viewed as the highest cause---not only so far 
as He can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew 
Him---"That which is known of God is manifest in them" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A19">Rm. 1:19</a>)---but 
also as far as He is known to Himself alone and revealed to others. Hence 
sacred doctrine is especially called wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from any human 
knowledge, but from the divine knowledge, through which, as through the 
highest wisdom, all our knowledge is set in order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The principles of other sciences either are  evident and 
cannot be proved, or are proved by natural reason through some other 
science. But the knowledge proper to this science comes through 
revelation and not through natural reason. Therefore it has no concern to 
prove the principles of other sciences, but only to judge of them. 
Whatsoever is found in other sciences contrary to any truth of this 
science must be condemned as false: "Destroying counsels and every height 
that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++10%3A4,5">2 Cor. 10:4,5</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since judgment appertains to wisdom, the twofold manner of 
judging produces a twofold wisdom. A man may judge in one way by 
inclination, as whoever has the habit of a virtue judges rightly of what 
concerns that virtue by his very inclination towards it. Hence it is the 
virtuous man, as we read, who is the measure and rule of human acts. In 
another way, by knowledge, just as a man learned in moral science might 
be able to judge rightly about virtuous acts, though he had not the 
virtue. The first manner of judging divine things belongs to that wisdom 
which is set down among the gifts of the Holy Ghost: "The spiritual man 
judgeth all things" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2%3A15">1 Cor. 2:15</a>). And Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): 
"Hierotheus is taught not by mere learning, but by experience of divine 
things." The second manner of judging belongs to this doctrine which is 
acquired by study, though its principles are obtained by revelation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is the object of this science?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not the object of this science. For in every 
science, the nature of its object is presupposed. But this science cannot 
presuppose the essence of God, for Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, iv): 
"It is impossible to define the essence of God." Therefore God is not the 
object of this science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever conclusions are reached in any science must be 
comprehended under the object of the science. But in Holy Writ we reach 
conclusions not only concerning God, but concerning many other things, 
such as creatures and human morality. Therefore God is not the object of 
this science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The object of the science is that of which it 
principally treats. But in this science, the treatment is mainly about 
God; for it is called theology, as treating of God. Therefore God is the 
object of this science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God is the object of this science. The relation between a 
science and its object is the same as that between a habit or faculty and 
its object. Now properly speaking, the object of a faculty or habit is 
the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that 
faculty or habit, as man and stone are referred to the faculty of sight 
in that they are colored. Hence colored things are the proper objects of 
sight. But in sacred science, all things are treated of under the aspect 
of God: either because they are God Himself or because they refer to God 
as their  beginning and end. Hence it follows that God is in very truth 
the object of this science. This is clear also from the principles of 
this science, namely, the articles of faith, for faith is about God. The 
object of the principles and of the whole science must be the same, since 
the whole science is contained virtually in its principles. Some, 
however, looking to what is treated of in this science, and not to the 
aspect under which it is treated, have asserted the object of this 
science to be something other than God---that is, either things and 
signs; or the works of salvation; or the whole Christ, as the head and 
members. Of all these things, in truth, we treat in this science, but so 
far as they have reference to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although we cannot know in what consists the essence of 
God, nevertheless in this science we make use of His effects, either of 
nature or of grace, in place of a definition, in regard to whatever is 
treated of in this science concerning God; even as in some philosophical 
sciences we demonstrate something about a cause from its effect, by 
taking the effect in place of a definition of the cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Whatever other conclusions are reached in this sacred 
science are comprehended under God, not as parts or species or accidents 
but as in some way related to Him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sacred doctrine is a matter of argument?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems this doctrine is not a matter of argument. For Ambrose 
says (De Fide 1): "Put arguments aside where faith is sought." But in 
this doctrine, faith especially is sought: "But these things are written 
that you may believe" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++20%3A31">Jn. 20:31</a>). Therefore sacred doctrine is not a 
matter of argument.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it is a matter of argument, the argument is either 
from authority or from reason. If it is from authority, it seems 
unbefitting its dignity, for the proof from authority is the weakest form 
of proof. But if it is from reason, this is unbefitting its end, because, 
according to Gregory (Hom. 26), "faith has no merit in those things of 
which human reason brings its own experience." Therefore sacred doctrine 
is not a matter of argument.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Scripture says that a bishop should "embrace that 
faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to 
exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+1%3A9">Titus 1:9</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As other sciences do not argue in proof of their 
principles, but argue from their principles to demonstrate other truths 
in these sciences: so this doctrine does not argue in proof of its 
principles, which are the articles of faith, but from them it goes on to 
prove something else; as the Apostle from the resurrection of Christ 
argues in proof of the general resurrection  (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15">1 Cor. 15</a>). However, it is 
to be borne in mind, in regard to the philosophical sciences, that the 
inferior sciences neither prove their principles nor dispute with those 
who deny them, but leave this to a higher science; whereas the highest of 
them, viz. metaphysics, can dispute with one who denies its principles, 
if only the opponent will make some concession; but if he concede 
nothing, it can have no dispute with him, though it can answer his 
objections. Hence Sacred Scripture, since it has no science above itself, 
can dispute with one who denies its principles only if the opponent 
admits some at least of the truths obtained through divine revelation; 
thus we can argue with heretics from texts in Holy Writ, and against 
those who deny one article of faith, we can argue from another. If our 
opponent believes nothing of divine revelation, there is no longer any 
means of proving the articles of faith by reasoning, but only of 
answering his objections---if he has any---against faith. Since faith 
rests upon infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never 
be demonstrated, it is clear that the arguments brought against faith 
cannot be demonstrations, but are difficulties that can be answered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although arguments from human reason cannot avail to prove 
what must be received on faith, nevertheless, this doctrine argues from 
articles of faith to other truths.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This doctrine is especially based upon arguments from 
authority, inasmuch as its principles are obtained by revelation: thus we 
ought to believe on the authority of those to whom the revelation has 
been made. Nor does this take away from the dignity of this doctrine, for 
although the argument from authority based on human reason is the 
weakest, yet the argument from authority based on divine revelation is 
the strongest. But sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason, not, 
indeed, to prove faith (for thereby the merit of faith would come to an 
end), but to make clear other things that are put forward in this 
doctrine. Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, 
natural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will 
ministers to charity. Hence the Apostle says: "Bringing into captivity 
every understanding unto the obedience of Christ" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++10%3A5">2 Cor. 10:5</a>). Hence 
sacred doctrine makes use also of the authority of philosophers in those 
questions in which they were able to know the truth by natural reason, as 
Paul quotes a saying of Aratus: "As some also of your own poets said: For 
we are also His offspring" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+17%3A28">Acts 17:28</a>). Nevertheless, sacred doctrine 
makes use of these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments; but 
properly uses the authority of the canonical Scriptures as an 
incontrovertible proof, and the authority of the doctors of the Church as 
one that may properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our faith 
rests upon the revelation made to the apostles and prophets who wrote the 
canonical books, and not on the revelations (if any such there are) made 
to other doctors. Hence Augustine says (Epis. ad Hieron. xix, 1): "Only 
those books of Scripture which are called canonical have I learned to 
hold in such honor as to believe their authors have not erred in any way 
in writing them. But other authors I so read as not to deem everything in 
their works to be true, merely on  account of their having so thought and 
written, whatever may have been their holiness and learning."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Holy Scripture should not use metaphors. For that 
which is proper to the lowest science seems not to befit this science, 
which holds the highest place of all. But to proceed by the aid of 
various similitudes and figures is proper to poetry, the least of all the 
sciences. Therefore it is not fitting that this science should make use 
of such similitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this doctrine seems to be intended to make truth clear. 
Hence a reward is held out to those who manifest it: "They that explain 
me shall have life everlasting" (Ecclus. 24:31). But by such similitudes 
truth is obscured. Therefore, to put forward divine truths by likening 
them to corporeal things does not befit this science.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the higher creatures are, the nearer they approach to 
the divine likeness. If therefore any creature be taken to represent God, 
this representation ought chiefly to be taken from the higher creatures, 
and not from the lower; yet this is often found in Scriptures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Osee 12:10): "I have multiplied visions, 
and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets." But to put 
forward anything by means of similitudes is to use metaphors. Therefore 
this sacred science may use metaphors.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward divine and 
spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things. For God 
provides for everything according to the capacity of its nature. Now it 
is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible 
objects, because all our knowledge originates from sense. Hence in Holy 
Writ, spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of 
material things. This is what Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i): "We cannot 
be enlightened by the divine rays except they be hidden within the 
covering of many sacred veils." It is also befitting Holy Writ, which is 
proposed to all without distinction of persons---"To the wise and to the 
unwise I am a debtor" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A14">Rm. 1:14</a>)---that spiritual truths be expounded by 
means of figures taken from corporeal things, in order that thereby even 
the simple who are unable by themselves to grasp intellectual things may 
be able to understand it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Poetry makes use of metaphors to produce a representation, 
for it is natural to man to be pleased with representations. But sacred 
doctrine makes use of metaphors as both necessary and useful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The ray of divine revelation is not extinguished  by the 
sensible imagery wherewith it is veiled, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 
i); and its truth so far remains that it does not allow the minds of 
those to whom the revelation has been made, to rest in the metaphors, but 
raises them to the knowledge of truths; and through those to whom the 
revelation has been made others also may receive instruction in these 
matters. Hence those things that are taught metaphorically in one part of 
Scripture, in other parts are taught more openly. The very hiding of 
truth in figures is useful for the exercise of thoughtful minds and as a 
defense against the ridicule of the impious, according to the words "Give 
not that which is holy to dogs" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++7%3A6">Mt. 7:6</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Dionysius says, (Coel. Hier. i) it is more fitting that 
divine truths should be expounded under the figure of less noble than of 
nobler bodies, and this for three reasons. Firstly, because thereby men's 
minds are the better preserved from error. For then it is clear that 
these things are not literal descriptions of divine truths, which might 
have been open to doubt had they been expressed under the figure of 
nobler bodies, especially for those who could think of nothing nobler 
than bodies. Secondly, because this is more befitting the knowledge of 
God that we have in this life. For what He is not is clearer to us than 
what He is. Therefore similitudes drawn from things farthest away from 
God form within us a truer estimate that God is above whatsoever we may 
say or think of Him. Thirdly, because thereby divine truths are the 
better hidden from the unworthy.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that in Holy Writ a word cannot have several senses, 
historical or literal, allegorical, tropological or moral, and 
anagogical. For many different senses in one text produce confusion and 
deception and destroy all force of argument. Hence no argument, but only 
fallacies, can be deduced from a multiplicity of propositions. But Holy 
Writ ought to be able to state the truth without any fallacy. Therefore 
in it there cannot be several senses to a word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De util. cred. iii) that "the Old 
Testament has a fourfold division as to history, etiology, analogy and 
allegory." Now these four seem altogether different from the four 
divisions mentioned in the first objection. Therefore it does not seem 
fitting to explain the same word of Holy Writ according to the four 
different senses mentioned above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, besides these senses, there is the parabolical, which is 
not one of these four.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xx, 1): "Holy Writ by the manner 
of its speech transcends every science, because in one and the same 
sentence, while it describes a fact, it reveals a mystery."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to 
signify His meaning, not by words only (as man also can do), but also by 
things themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are 
signified by words, this science has the property, that the things 
signified by the words have themselves also a signification. Therefore 
that first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the 
first sense, the historical or literal. That signification whereby things 
signified by words have themselves also a signification is called the 
spiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now 
this spiritual sense has a threefold division. For as the Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++10%3A1">Heb. 10:1</a>) the Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and Dionysius says 
(Coel. Hier. i) "the New Law itself is a figure of future glory." Again, 
in the New Law, whatever our Head has done is a type of what we ought to 
do. Therefore, so far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of 
the New Law, there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in 
Christ, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are types of what 
we ought to do, there is the moral sense. But so far as they signify what 
relates to eternal glory, there is the anagogical sense. Since the 
literal sense is that which the author intends, and since the author of 
Holy Writ is God, Who by one act comprehends all things by His intellect, 
it is not unfitting, as Augustine says (Confess. xii), if, even according 
to the literal sense, one word in Holy Writ should have several senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[1] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The multiplicity of these senses does not produce 
equivocation or any other kind of multiplicity, seeing that these senses 
are not multiplied because one word signifies several things, but because 
the things signified by the words can be themselves types of other 
things. Thus in Holy Writ no confusion results, for all the senses are 
founded on one---the literal---from which alone can any argument be 
drawn, and not from those intended in allegory, as Augustine says (Epis. 
48). Nevertheless, nothing of Holy Scripture perishes on account of this, 
since nothing necessary to faith is contained under the spiritual sense 
which is not elsewhere put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These three---history, etiology, analogy---are grouped 
under the literal sense. For it is called history, as Augustine expounds 
(Epis. 48), whenever anything is simply related; it is called etiology 
when its cause is assigned, as when Our Lord gave the reason why Moses 
allowed the putting away of wives---namely, on account of the hardness of 
men's hearts; it is called analogy whenever the truth of one text of 
Scripture is shown not to contradict the truth of another. Of these four, 
allegory alone stands for the three spiritual senses. Thus Hugh of St. 
Victor (Sacram. iv, 4 Prolog.) includes the anagogical under the 
allegorical sense, laying down three senses only---the historical, the 
allegorical, and the tropological.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The parabolical sense is contained in the literal, for by 
words things are signified properly and figuratively. Nor is the figure 
itself, but that which is figured,  the literal sense. When Scripture 
speaks of God's arm, the literal sense is not that God has such a member, 
but only what is signified by this member, namely operative power. Hence 
it is plain that nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of 
Holy Writ.<br>
