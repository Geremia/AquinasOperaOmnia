  <br />
  <p>
    To place our purpose within proper limits, we first endeavor to investigate
    the nature and extent of this sacred doctrine. Concerning this there are ten
    points of inquiry:
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is necessary?</p>
  <p><a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a science?</p>
  <p><a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is one or many?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is speculative or
    practical?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A5THEP1">(5)</a> How it is compared with other
    sciences?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it is the same as wisdom?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether God is its subject-matter?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it is a matter of argument?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether it rightly employs
    metaphors and similes?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP001.html#FPQ1A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether the Sacred Scripture of
    this doctrine may be expounded in different senses?<br />

    Whether, besides philosophy, any further doctrine is required?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that, besides philosophical science, we
    have no need of any further knowledge. For man should not seek to know what
    is above reason: "Seek not the things that are too high for thee" (Ecclus.
    3:22). But whatever is not above reason is fully treated of in philosophical
    science. Therefore any other knowledge besides philosophical science is
    superfluous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, knowledge can be concerned only with
    being, for nothing can be known, save what is true; and all that is, is
    true. But everything that is, is treated of in philosophical science---even
    God Himself; so that there is a part of philosophy called theology, or the
    divine science, as Aristotle has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore, besides
    philosophical science, there is no need of any further knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++3%3A16"
      >2 Tim. 3:16</a
    >): "All Scripture, inspired of God is profitable to teach, to reprove, to
    correct, to instruct in justice." Now Scripture, inspired of God, is no part
    of philosophical science, which has been built up by human reason. Therefore
    it is useful that besides philosophical science, there should be other
    knowledge, i.e. inspired of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was necessary for man's salvation that there
    should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up
    by human reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an
    end that surpasses the grasp of his reason: "The eye hath not seen, O God,
    besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++66%3A4">Is. 66:4</a>).
    But the end must first be known by men who are to direct their thoughts and
    actions to the end. Hence it was necessary for the salvation of man that
    certain truths which exceed human reason should be made known to him by
    divine revelation. Even as regards those truths about God which human reason
    could have discovered, it was necessary that man should be taught by a
    divine revelation; because the truth about God such as reason could
    discover, would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with
    the admixture of many errors. Whereas man's whole salvation, which is in
    God, depends upon the knowledge of this truth. Therefore, in order that the
    salvation of men might be brought about more fitly and more surely, it was
    necessary that they should be taught divine truths by divine revelation. It
    was therefore necessary that besides philosophical science built up by
    reason, there should be a sacred science learned through revelation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although those things which are beyond
    man's knowledge may not be sought for by man through his reason,
    nevertheless, once they are revealed by God, they must be accepted by faith.
    Hence the sacred text continues, "For many things are shown to thee above
    the understanding of man" (Ecclus. 3:25). And in this, the sacred science
    consists.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sciences are differentiated according to
    the various means through which knowledge is obtained. For the astronomer
    and the physicist both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth, for
    instance, is round: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e. abstracting
    from matter), but the physicist by means of matter itself. Hence there is no
    reason why those things which may be learned from philosophical science, so
    far as they can be known by natural reason, may not also be taught us by
    another science so far as they fall within revelation. Hence theology
    included in sacred doctrine differs in kind from that theology which is part
    of philosophy.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether sacred doctrine is a science?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science.
    For every science proceeds from self-evident principles. But sacred doctrine
    proceeds from articles of faith which are not self-evident, since their
    truth is not admitted by all: "For all men have not faith" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++3%3A2"
      >2 Thess. 3:2</a
    >). Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no science deals with individual facts.
    But this sacred science treats of individual facts, such as the deeds of
    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and such like. Therefore sacred doctrine is not a
    science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) "to this
    science alone belongs that whereby saving faith is begotten, nourished,
    protected and strengthened." But this can be said of no science except
    sacred doctrine. Therefore sacred doctrine is a science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine is a science. We must bear in
    mind that there are two kinds of sciences. There are some which proceed from
    a principle known by the natural light of intelligence, such as arithmetic
    and geometry and the like. There are some which proceed from principles
    known by the light of a higher science: thus the science of perspective
    proceeds from principles established by geometry, and music from principles
    established by arithmetic. So it is that sacred doctrine is a science
    because it proceeds from principles established by the light of a higher
    science, namely, the science of God and the blessed. Hence, just as the
    musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the
    mathematician, so sacred science is established on principles revealed by
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The principles of any science are either
    in themselves self-evident, or reducible to the conclusions of a higher
    science; and such, as we have said, are the principles of sacred
    doctrine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Individual facts are treated of in
    sacred doctrine, not because it is concerned with them principally, but they
    are introduced rather both as examples to be followed in our lives (as in
    moral sciences) and in order to establish the authority of those men through
    whom the divine revelation, on which this sacred scripture or doctrine is
    based, has come down to us.<br />

    ><br />
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether sacred doctrine is one science?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not one science;
    for according to the Philosopher (Poster. i) "that science is one which
    treats only of one class of subjects." But the creator and the creature,
    both of whom are treated of in sacred doctrine, cannot be grouped together
    under one class of subjects. Therefore sacred doctrine is not one
    science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in sacred doctrine we treat of angels,
    corporeal creatures and human morality. But these belong to separate
    philosophical sciences. Therefore sacred doctrine cannot be one science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Holy Scripture speaks of it as one science:
    "Wisdom gave him the knowledge [scientiam] of holy things" (Wis. 10:10).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine is one science. The unity of a
    faculty or habit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material
    aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an object.
    For example, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being
    colored; and color is the formal object of sight. Therefore, because Sacred
    Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being divinely
    revealed, whatever has been divinely revealed possesses the one precise
    formality of the object of this science; and therefore is included under
    sacred doctrine as under one science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sacred doctrine does not treat of God
    and creatures equally, but of God primarily, and of creatures only so far as
    they are referable to God as their beginning or end. Hence the unity of this
    science is not impaired.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nothing prevents inferior faculties or
    habits from being differentiated by something which falls under a higher
    faculty or habit as well; because the higher faculty or habit regards the
    object in its more universal formality, as the object of the "common sense"
    is whatever affects the senses, including, therefore, whatever is visible or
    audible. Hence the "common sense," although one faculty, extends to all the
    objects of the five senses. Similarly, objects which are the subject-matter
    of different philosophical sciences can yet be treated of by this one single
    sacred science under one aspect precisely so far as they can be included in
    revelation. So that in this way, sacred doctrine bears, as it were, the
    stamp of the divine science which is one and simple, yet extends to
    everything.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether sacred doctrine is a practical science?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is a practical
    science; for a practical science is that which ends in action according to
    the Philosopher (Metaph. ii). But sacred doctrine is ordained to action: "Be
    ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A22"
      >James 1:22</a
    >). Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacred doctrine is divided into the Old
    and the New Law. But law implies a moral science which is a practical
    science. Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Every practical science is concerned with
    human operations; as moral science is concerned with human acts, and
    architecture with buildings. But sacred doctrine is chiefly concerned with
    God, whose handiwork is especially man. Therefore it is not a practical but
    a speculative science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacred doctrine, being one, extends to things
    which belong to different philosophical sciences because it considers in
    each the same formal aspect, namely, so far as they can be known through
    divine revelation. Hence, although among the philosophical sciences one is
    speculative and another practical, nevertheless sacred doctrine includes
    both; as God, by one and the same science, knows both Himself and His works.
    Still, it is speculative rather than practical because it is more concerned
    with divine things than with human acts; though it does treat even of these
    latter, inasmuch as man is ordained by them to the perfect knowledge of God
    in which consists eternal bliss. This is a sufficient answer to the
    Objections.<br />

    Whether sacred doctrine is nobler than other sciences?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacred doctrine is not nobler than
    other sciences; for the nobility of a science depends on the certitude it
    establishes. But other sciences, the principles of which cannot be doubted,
    seem to be more certain than sacred doctrine; for its principles---namely,
    articles of faith---can be doubted. Therefore other sciences seem to be
    nobler.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is the sign of a lower science to
    depend upon a higher; as music depends on arithmetic. But sacred doctrine
    does in a sense depend upon philosophical sciences; for Jerome observes, in
    his Epistle to Magnus, that "the ancient doctors so enriched their books
    with the ideas and phrases of the philosophers, that thou knowest not what
    more to admire in them, their profane erudition or their scriptural
    learning." Therefore sacred doctrine is inferior to other sciences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Other sciences are called the handmaidens of
    this one: "Wisdom sent her maids to invite to the tower" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++9%3A3"
      >Prov. 9:3</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since this science is partly speculative and
    partly practical, it transcends all others speculative and practical. Now
    one speculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason
    of its greater certitude, or by reason of the higher worth of its
    subject-matter. In both these respects this science surpasses other
    speculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other sciences
    derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason, which can
    err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of divine knowledge,
    which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of its subject-matter
    because this science treats chiefly of those things which by their sublimity
    transcend human reason; while other sciences consider only those things
    which are within reason's grasp. Of the practical sciences, that one is
    nobler which is ordained to a further purpose, as political science is
    nobler than military science; for the good of the army is directed to the
    good of the State. But the purpose of this science, in so far as it is
    practical, is eternal bliss; to which as to an ultimate end the purposes of
    every practical science are directed. Hence it is clear that from every
    standpoint, it is nobler than other sciences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It may well happen that what is in
    itself the more certain may seem to us the less certain on account of the
    weakness of our intelligence, "which is dazzled by the clearest objects of
    nature; as the owl is dazzled by the light of the sun" (Metaph. ii, lect.
    i). Hence the fact that some happen to doubt about articles of faith is not
    due to the uncertain nature of the truths, but to the weakness of human
    intelligence; yet the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the
    highest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained of
    lesser things, as is said in de Animalibus xi.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This science can in a sense depend upon
    the philosophical sciences, not as though it stood in need of them, but only
    in order to make its teaching clearer. For it accepts its principles not
    from other sciences, but immediately from God, by revelation. Therefore it
    does not depend upon other sciences as upon the higher, but makes use of
    them as of the lesser, and as handmaidens: even so the master sciences make
    use of the sciences that supply their materials, as political of military
    science. That it thus uses them is not due to its own defect or
    insufficiency, but to the defect of our intelligence, which is more easily
    led by what is known through natural reason (from which proceed the other
    sciences) to that which is above reason, such as are the teachings of this
    science.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether this doctrine is the same as wisdom?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this doctrine is not the same as
    wisdom. For no doctrine which borrows its principles is worthy of the name
    of wisdom; seeing that the wise man directs, and is not directed (Metaph.
    i). But this doctrine borrows its principles. Therefore this science is not
    wisdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a part of wisdom to prove the
    principles of other sciences. Hence it is called the chief of sciences, as
    is clear in Ethic. vi. But this doctrine does not prove the principles of
    other sciences. Therefore it is not the same as wisdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this doctrine is acquired by study,
    whereas wisdom is acquired by God's inspiration; so that it is numbered
    among the gifts of the Holy Spirit (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++11%3A2"
      >Is. 11:2</a
    >). Therefore this doctrine is not the same as wisdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A6"
      >Dt. 4:6</a
    >): "This is your wisdom and understanding in the sight of nations."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This doctrine is wisdom above all human wisdom;
    not merely in any one order, but absolutely. For since it is the part of a
    wise man to arrange and to judge, and since lesser matters should be judged
    in the light of some higher principle, he is said to be wise in any one
    order who considers the highest principle in that order: thus in the order
    of building, he who plans the form of the house is called wise and
    architect, in opposition to the inferior laborers who trim the wood and make
    ready the stones: "As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 3:10</a
    >). Again, in the order of all human life, the prudent man is called wise,
    inasmuch as he directs his acts to a fitting end: "Wisdom is prudence to a
    man" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++10:+23"
      >Prov. 10: 23</a
    >). Therefore he who considers absolutely the highest cause of the whole
    universe, namely God, is most of all called wise. Hence wisdom is said to be
    the knowledge of divine things, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 14). But
    sacred doctrine essentially treats of God viewed as the highest cause---not
    only so far as He can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew
    Him---"That which is known of God is manifest in them" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A19"
      >Rm. 1:19</a
    >)---but also as far as He is known to Himself alone and revealed to others.
    Hence sacred doctrine is especially called wisdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sacred doctrine derives its principles
    not from any human knowledge, but from the divine knowledge, through which,
    as through the highest wisdom, all our knowledge is set in order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The principles of other sciences either
    are evident and cannot be proved, or are proved by natural reason through
    some other science. But the knowledge proper to this science comes through
    revelation and not through natural reason. Therefore it has no concern to
    prove the principles of other sciences, but only to judge of them.
    Whatsoever is found in other sciences contrary to any truth of this science
    must be condemned as false: "Destroying counsels and every height that
    exalteth itself against the knowledge of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++10%3A4,5"
      >2 Cor. 10:4,5</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since judgment appertains to wisdom, the
    twofold manner of judging produces a twofold wisdom. A man may judge in one
    way by inclination, as whoever has the habit of a virtue judges rightly of
    what concerns that virtue by his very inclination towards it. Hence it is
    the virtuous man, as we read, who is the measure and rule of human acts. In
    another way, by knowledge, just as a man learned in moral science might be
    able to judge rightly about virtuous acts, though he had not the virtue. The
    first manner of judging divine things belongs to that wisdom which is set
    down among the gifts of the Holy Ghost: "The spiritual man judgeth all
    things" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 2:15</a
    >). And Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): "Hierotheus is taught not by mere
    learning, but by experience of divine things." The second manner of judging
    belongs to this doctrine which is acquired by study, though its principles
    are obtained by revelation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is the object of this science?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not the object of this
    science. For in every science, the nature of its object is presupposed. But
    this science cannot presuppose the essence of God, for Damascene says (De
    Fide Orth. i, iv): "It is impossible to define the essence of God."
    Therefore God is not the object of this science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever conclusions are reached in any
    science must be comprehended under the object of the science. But in Holy
    Writ we reach conclusions not only concerning God, but concerning many other
    things, such as creatures and human morality. Therefore God is not the
    object of this science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The object of the science is that of which it
    principally treats. But in this science, the treatment is mainly about God;
    for it is called theology, as treating of God. Therefore God is the object
    of this science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God is the object of this science. The relation
    between a science and its object is the same as that between a habit or
    faculty and its object. Now properly speaking, the object of a faculty or
    habit is the thing under the aspect of which all things are referred to that
    faculty or habit, as man and stone are referred to the faculty of sight in
    that they are colored. Hence colored things are the proper objects of sight.
    But in sacred science, all things are treated of under the aspect of God:
    either because they are God Himself or because they refer to God as their
    beginning and end. Hence it follows that God is in very truth the object of
    this science. This is clear also from the principles of this science,
    namely, the articles of faith, for faith is about God. The object of the
    principles and of the whole science must be the same, since the whole
    science is contained virtually in its principles. Some, however, looking to
    what is treated of in this science, and not to the aspect under which it is
    treated, have asserted the object of this science to be something other than
    God---that is, either things and signs; or the works of salvation; or the
    whole Christ, as the head and members. Of all these things, in truth, we
    treat in this science, but so far as they have reference to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although we cannot know in what consists
    the essence of God, nevertheless in this science we make use of His effects,
    either of nature or of grace, in place of a definition, in regard to
    whatever is treated of in this science concerning God; even as in some
    philosophical sciences we demonstrate something about a cause from its
    effect, by taking the effect in place of a definition of the cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Whatever other conclusions are reached
    in this sacred science are comprehended under God, not as parts or species
    or accidents but as in some way related to Him.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether sacred doctrine is a matter of argument?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems this doctrine is not a matter of
    argument. For Ambrose says (De Fide 1): "Put arguments aside where faith is
    sought." But in this doctrine, faith especially is sought: "But these things
    are written that you may believe" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A31"
      >Jn. 20:31</a
    >). Therefore sacred doctrine is not a matter of argument.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it is a matter of argument, the
    argument is either from authority or from reason. If it is from authority,
    it seems unbefitting its dignity, for the proof from authority is the
    weakest form of proof. But if it is from reason, this is unbefitting its
    end, because, according to Gregory (Hom. 26), "faith has no merit in those
    things of which human reason brings its own experience." Therefore sacred
    doctrine is not a matter of argument.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Scripture says that a bishop should
    "embrace that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be
    able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Titus+1%3A9"
      >Titus 1:9</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As other sciences do not argue in proof of
    their principles, but argue from their principles to demonstrate other
    truths in these sciences: so this doctrine does not argue in proof of its
    principles, which are the articles of faith, but from them it goes on to
    prove something else; as the Apostle from the resurrection of Christ argues
    in proof of the general resurrection (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15"
      >1 Cor. 15</a
    >). However, it is to be borne in mind, in regard to the philosophical
    sciences, that the inferior sciences neither prove their principles nor
    dispute with those who deny them, but leave this to a higher science;
    whereas the highest of them, viz. metaphysics, can dispute with one who
    denies its principles, if only the opponent will make some concession; but
    if he concede nothing, it can have no dispute with him, though it can answer
    his objections. Hence Sacred Scripture, since it has no science above
    itself, can dispute with one who denies its principles only if the opponent
    admits some at least of the truths obtained through divine revelation; thus
    we can argue with heretics from texts in Holy Writ, and against those who
    deny one article of faith, we can argue from another. If our opponent
    believes nothing of divine revelation, there is no longer any means of
    proving the articles of faith by reasoning, but only of answering his
    objections---if he has any---against faith. Since faith rests upon
    infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never be
    demonstrated, it is clear that the arguments brought against faith cannot be
    demonstrations, but are difficulties that can be answered.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although arguments from human reason
    cannot avail to prove what must be received on faith, nevertheless, this
    doctrine argues from articles of faith to other truths.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This doctrine is especially based upon
    arguments from authority, inasmuch as its principles are obtained by
    revelation: thus we ought to believe on the authority of those to whom the
    revelation has been made. Nor does this take away from the dignity of this
    doctrine, for although the argument from authority based on human reason is
    the weakest, yet the argument from authority based on divine revelation is
    the strongest. But sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason, not,
    indeed, to prove faith (for thereby the merit of faith would come to an
    end), but to make clear other things that are put forward in this doctrine.
    Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, natural
    reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will ministers to
    charity. Hence the Apostle says: "Bringing into captivity every
    understanding unto the obedience of Christ" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++10%3A5"
      >2 Cor. 10:5</a
    >). Hence sacred doctrine makes use also of the authority of philosophers in
    those questions in which they were able to know the truth by natural reason,
    as Paul quotes a saying of Aratus: "As some also of your own poets said: For
    we are also His offspring" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+17%3A28"
      >Acts 17:28</a
    >). Nevertheless, sacred doctrine makes use of these authorities as
    extrinsic and probable arguments; but properly uses the authority of the
    canonical Scriptures as an incontrovertible proof, and the authority of the
    doctors of the Church as one that may properly be used, yet merely as
    probable. For our faith rests upon the revelation made to the apostles and
    prophets who wrote the canonical books, and not on the revelations (if any
    such there are) made to other doctors. Hence Augustine says (Epis. ad
    Hieron. xix, 1): "Only those books of Scripture which are called canonical
    have I learned to hold in such honor as to believe their authors have not
    erred in any way in writing them. But other authors I so read as not to deem
    everything in their works to be true, merely on account of their having so
    thought and written, whatever may have been their holiness and learning."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Holy Scripture should use metaphors?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Holy Scripture should not use
    metaphors. For that which is proper to the lowest science seems not to befit
    this science, which holds the highest place of all. But to proceed by the
    aid of various similitudes and figures is proper to poetry, the least of all
    the sciences. Therefore it is not fitting that this science should make use
    of such similitudes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this doctrine seems to be intended to
    make truth clear. Hence a reward is held out to those who manifest it: "They
    that explain me shall have life everlasting" (Ecclus. 24:31). But by such
    similitudes truth is obscured. Therefore, to put forward divine truths by
    likening them to corporeal things does not befit this science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the higher creatures are, the nearer
    they approach to the divine likeness. If therefore any creature be taken to
    represent God, this representation ought chiefly to be taken from the higher
    creatures, and not from the lower; yet this is often found in Scriptures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Osee 12:10): "I have
    multiplied visions, and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the
    prophets." But to put forward anything by means of similitudes is to use
    metaphors. Therefore this sacred science may use metaphors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward divine
    and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things. For God
    provides for everything according to the capacity of its nature. Now it is
    natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects,
    because all our knowledge originates from sense. Hence in Holy Writ,
    spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things.
    This is what Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i): "We cannot be enlightened by
    the divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of many sacred
    veils." It is also befitting Holy Writ, which is proposed to all without
    distinction of persons---"To the wise and to the unwise I am a debtor" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A14"
      >Rm. 1:14</a
    >)---that spiritual truths be expounded by means of figures taken from
    corporeal things, in order that thereby even the simple who are unable by
    themselves to grasp intellectual things may be able to understand it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Poetry makes use of metaphors to produce
    a representation, for it is natural to man to be pleased with
    representations. But sacred doctrine makes use of metaphors as both
    necessary and useful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The ray of divine revelation is not
    extinguished by the sensible imagery wherewith it is veiled, as Dionysius
    says (Coel. Hier. i); and its truth so far remains that it does not allow
    the minds of those to whom the revelation has been made, to rest in the
    metaphors, but raises them to the knowledge of truths; and through those to
    whom the revelation has been made others also may receive instruction in
    these matters. Hence those things that are taught metaphorically in one part
    of Scripture, in other parts are taught more openly. The very hiding of
    truth in figures is useful for the exercise of thoughtful minds and as a
    defense against the ridicule of the impious, according to the words "Give
    not that which is holy to dogs" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++7%3A6"
      >Mt. 7:6</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Dionysius says, (Coel. Hier. i) it is
    more fitting that divine truths should be expounded under the figure of less
    noble than of nobler bodies, and this for three reasons. Firstly, because
    thereby men's minds are the better preserved from error. For then it is
    clear that these things are not literal descriptions of divine truths, which
    might have been open to doubt had they been expressed under the figure of
    nobler bodies, especially for those who could think of nothing nobler than
    bodies. Secondly, because this is more befitting the knowledge of God that
    we have in this life. For what He is not is clearer to us than what He is.
    Therefore similitudes drawn from things farthest away from God form within
    us a truer estimate that God is above whatsoever we may say or think of Him.
    Thirdly, because thereby divine truths are the better hidden from the
    unworthy.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that in Holy Writ a word cannot have
    several senses, historical or literal, allegorical, tropological or moral,
    and anagogical. For many different senses in one text produce confusion and
    deception and destroy all force of argument. Hence no argument, but only
    fallacies, can be deduced from a multiplicity of propositions. But Holy Writ
    ought to be able to state the truth without any fallacy. Therefore in it
    there cannot be several senses to a word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De util. cred. iii) that
    "the Old Testament has a fourfold division as to history, etiology, analogy
    and allegory." Now these four seem altogether different from the four
    divisions mentioned in the first objection. Therefore it does not seem
    fitting to explain the same word of Holy Writ according to the four
    different senses mentioned above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, besides these senses, there is the
    parabolical, which is not one of these four.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xx, 1): "Holy Writ by
    the manner of its speech transcends every science, because in one and the
    same sentence, while it describes a fact, it reveals a mystery."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power
    it is to signify His meaning, not by words only (as man also can do), but
    also by things themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are
    signified by words, this science has the property, that the things signified
    by the words have themselves also a signification. Therefore that first
    signification whereby words signify things belongs to the first sense, the
    historical or literal. That signification whereby things signified by words
    have themselves also a signification is called the spiritual sense, which is
    based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now this spiritual sense has a
    threefold division. For as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++10%3A1"
      >Heb. 10:1</a
    >) the Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and Dionysius says (Coel. Hier.
    i) "the New Law itself is a figure of future glory." Again, in the New Law,
    whatever our Head has done is a type of what we ought to do. Therefore, so
    far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of the New Law, there is
    the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in Christ, or so far as the
    things which signify Christ, are types of what we ought to do, there is the
    moral sense. But so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory, there
    is the anagogical sense. Since the literal sense is that which the author
    intends, and since the author of Holy Writ is God, Who by one act
    comprehends all things by His intellect, it is not unfitting, as Augustine
    says (Confess. xii), if, even according to the literal sense, one word in
    Holy Writ should have several senses.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The multiplicity of these senses does
    not produce equivocation or any other kind of multiplicity, seeing that
    these senses are not multiplied because one word signifies several things,
    but because the things signified by the words can be themselves types of
    other things. Thus in Holy Writ no confusion results, for all the senses are
    founded on one---the literal---from which alone can any argument be drawn,
    and not from those intended in allegory, as Augustine says (Epis. 48).
    Nevertheless, nothing of Holy Scripture perishes on account of this, since
    nothing necessary to faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is
    not elsewhere put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These three---history, etiology,
    analogy---are grouped under the literal sense. For it is called history, as
    Augustine expounds (Epis. 48), whenever anything is simply related; it is
    called etiology when its cause is assigned, as when Our Lord gave the reason
    why Moses allowed the putting away of wives---namely, on account of the
    hardness of men's hearts; it is called analogy whenever the truth of one
    text of Scripture is shown not to contradict the truth of another. Of these
    four, allegory alone stands for the three spiritual senses. Thus Hugh of St.
    Victor (Sacram. iv, 4 Prolog.) includes the anagogical under the allegorical
    sense, laying down three senses only---the historical, the allegorical, and
    the tropological.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The parabolical sense is contained in
    the literal, for by words things are signified properly and figuratively.
    Nor is the figure itself, but that which is figured, the literal sense. When
    Scripture speaks of God's arm, the literal sense is not that God has such a
    member, but only what is signified by this member, namely operative power.
    Hence it is plain that nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of
    Holy Writ.<br />
