<H3 Align="Center">OF THE DIVINE BEATITUDE (FOUR ARTICLES) <br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering all that pertains to the unity of the divine essence, 
we come to treat of the divine beatitude. Concerning this, there are four 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP026.html#FPQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether beatitude belongs to God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP026.html#FPQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> In regard to what is God called blessed; does this regard His act of 
intellect?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP026.html#FPQ26A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He is essentially the beatitude of each of the blessed?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP026.html#FPQ26A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether all other beatitude is included in the divine beatitude?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that beatitude does not belong to God. For beatitude 
according to Boethius (De Consol. iv) "is a state made perfect by the 
aggregation of all good things." But the aggregation of goods has no 
place in God; nor has composition. Therefore beatitude does not belong to 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, beatitude or happiness is the reward of virtue, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 9). But reward does not apply to 
God; as neither does merit. Therefore neither does beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says: "Which in His times He shall show, 
who is the Blessed and only Almighty, the King of Kings and Lord of 
Lords." (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++6%3A15">1 Tim. 6:15</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Beatitude belongs to God in a very special manner. For 
nothing else is understood to be meant by the term beatitude than the 
perfect good of an intellectual nature; which is capable of knowing that 
it has a sufficiency of the good which it possesses, to which it is 
competent that good or ill may befall, and which can control its own 
actions. All of these things belong in a most excellent manner to God, 
namely, to be perfect, and to possess intelligence. Whence beatitude 
belongs to God in the highest degree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Aggregation of good is in God, after the manner not of 
composition, but of simplicity; for those things which in creatures is 
manifold, pre-exist in God, as was said above (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), 
in simplicity and unity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs as an accident to beatitude or happiness to be 
the reward of virtue, so far as anyone attains to beatitude; even as to 
be the term of generation belongs accidentally to a being, so far as it 
passes from potentiality to act. As, then, God has being, though not 
begotten; so He has beatitude, although not acquired by merit.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is called blessed in respect of His intellect?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not called blessed in respect to His 
intellect. For beatitude is the highest good. But good is said to be in 
God in regard to His essence, because good has reference to being which 
is according to essence, according to Boethius (De Hebdom.). Therefore 
beatitude also is said to be in God in regard to His essence, and not to 
His intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Beatitude implies the notion of end. Now the end is the 
object of the will, as also is the good. Therefore beatitude is said to 
be in God with reference to His will, and not with reference to His 
intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxii, 7): "He is in glory, Who 
whilst He rejoices in Himself, needs not further praise." To be in glory, 
however, is the same as to be blessed. Therefore, since we enjoy God in 
respect to our intellect, because "vision is the whole of the reward," as 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii), it would seem that beatitude is said 
to be in God in respect of His intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Beatitude, as stated above (<A Href="FP026.html#FPQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is the perfect good of 
an intellectual nature. Thus it is that, as everything desires the 
perfection of its nature, intellectual nature desires naturally to be 
happy. Now that which is most perfect in any intellectual nature is the 
intellectual operation, by which in some sense it grasps everything. 
Whence the beatitude of every intellectual nature consists in 
understanding. Now in God, to be and to understand are one and the same 
thing; differing only in the manner of our understanding them. Beatitude 
must therefore be assigned to God in respect of His intellect; as also to 
the blessed, who are called blesses [beati] by reason of the assimilation 
to His beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that beatitude belongs to God; not 
that beatitude pertains essentially to Him under the aspect of His 
essence; but rather under the aspect of His intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since beatitude is a good, it is the object of the will; 
now the object is understood as prior to the act of a power. Whence in 
our manner of understanding, divine beatitude precedes the act of the 
will at rest in it. This cannot be other than the act of the intellect; 
and thus beatitude is to be found in an act of the intellect.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is the beatitude of each of the blessed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is the beatitude of each of the blessed. For 
God is the supreme good, as was said above (<A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4). But it is 
quite impossible that there should be many supreme goods, as also is 
clear from what has been said above (<A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, since it is 
of the essence of beatitude that it should be the supreme good, it seems 
that beatitude is nothing else  but God Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, beatitude is the last end of the rational nature. But to 
be the last end of the rational nature belongs only to God. Therefore the 
beatitude of every blessed is God alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The beatitude of one is greater than that of another, 
according to 1 Cor. 15:41: "Star differeth from star in glory." But 
nothing is greater than God. Therefore beatitude is something different 
from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The beatitude of an intellectual nature consists in an 
act of the intellect. In this we may consider two things, namely, the 
object of the act, which is the thing understood; and the act itself 
which is to understand. If, then, beatitude be considered on the side of 
the object, God is the only beatitude; for everyone is blessed from this 
sole fact, that he understands God, in accordance with the saying of 
Augustine (Confess. v, 4): "Blessed is he who knoweth Thee, though he 
know nought else." But as regards the act of understanding, beatitude is 
a created thing in beatified creatures; but in God, even in this way, it 
is an uncreated thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Beatitude, as regards its object, is the supreme good 
absolutely, but as regards its act, in beatified creatures it is their 
supreme good, not absolutely, but in that kind of goods which a creature 
can participate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> End is twofold, namely, "objective" and "subjective," as 
the Philosopher says (Greater Ethics i, 3), namely, the "thing itself" 
and "its use." Thus to a miser the end is money, and its acquisition. 
Accordingly God is indeed the last end of a rational creature, as the 
thing itself; but created beatitude is the end, as the use, or rather 
fruition, of the thing.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the divine beatitude does not embrace all other 
beatitudes. For there are some false beatitudes. But nothing false can be 
in God. Therefore the divine beatitude does not embrace all other 
beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a certain beatitude, according to some, consists in 
things corporeal; as in pleasure, riches, and such like. Now none of 
these have to do with God, since He is incorporeal. Therefore His 
beatitude does not embrace all other beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Beatitude is a certain perfection. But the divine 
perfection embraces all other perfection, as was shown above (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore the divine beatitude embraces all other beatitudes.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever is desirable in whatsoever beatitude, whether 
true or false, pre-exists wholly and in a more eminent degree in the 
divine beatitude. As to contemplative happiness, God possesses a 
continual and most certain contemplation of Himself and of all things 
else; and as to that which is active, He has the governance of the whole 
universe. As to earthly happiness, which consists in delight, riches, 
power, dignity, and fame, according to Boethius (De Consol. iii, 10), He 
possesses joy in Himself and all things else for His delight; instead of 
riches He has that complete self-sufficiency, which is promised by 
riches; in place of power, He has omnipotence; for dignities, the 
government of all things; and in place of fame, He possesses the 
admiration of all creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A particular kind of beatitude is false according as it 
falls short of the idea of true beatitude; and thus it is not in God. But 
whatever semblance it has, howsoever slight, of beatitude, the whole of 
it pre-exists in the divine beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good that exists in things corporeal in a corporeal 
manner, is also in God, but in a spiritual manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[26] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now spoken enough concerning what pertains to the unity of the 
divine essence.<br>
