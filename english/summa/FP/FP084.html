    HOW THE SOUL WHILE UNITED TO THE BODY UNDERSTANDS CORPOREAL THINGS BENEATH
    IT (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now have to consider the acts of the soul in regard to the intellectual
    and the appetitive powers: for the other powers of the soul do not come
    directly under the consideration of the theologian. Furthermore, the acts of
    the appetitive part of the soul come under the consideration of the science
    of morals; wherefore we shall treat of them in the second part of this work,
    to which the consideration of moral matters belongs. But of the acts of the
    intellectual part we shall treat now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In treating of these acts we shall proceed in the following order: First, we
    shall inquire how the soul understands when united to the body; secondly,
    how it understands when separated therefrom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The former of these inquiries will be threefold: (1) How the soul
    understands bodies which are beneath it; (2) How it understands itself and
    things contained in itself; (3) How it understands immaterial substances,
    which are above it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In treating of the knowledge of corporeal things there are three points to
    be considered: (1) Through what does the soul know them? (2) How and in what
    order does it know them? (3) What does it know in them?<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the soul knows bodies
    through the intellect?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it understands them
    through its essence, or through any species?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A3THEP1">(3)</a> If through some species, whether
    the species of all things intelligible are naturally innate in the soul?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether these species are derived
    by the soul from certain separate immaterial forms?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether our soul sees in the
    eternal ideas all that it understands?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it acquires intellectual
    knowledge from the senses?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the intellect can, through
    the species of which it is possessed, actually understand, without turning
    to the phantasms?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the judgment of the
    intellect is hindered by an obstacle in the sensitive powers?<br />

    Whether the soul knows bodies through the intellect?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul does not know bodies
    through the intellect. For Augustine says (Soliloq. ii, 4) that "bodies
    cannot be understood by the intellect; nor indeed anything corporeal unless
    it can be perceived by the senses." He says also (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24) that
    intellectual vision is of those things that are in the soul by their
    essence. But such are not bodies. Therefore the soul cannot know bodies
    through the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as sense is to the intelligible, so is
    the intellect to the sensible. But the soul can by no means, through the
    senses, understand spiritual things, which are intelligible. Therefore by no
    means can it, through the intellect, know bodies, which are sensible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect is concerned with things
    that are necessary and unchangeable. But all bodies are mobile and
    changeable. Therefore the soul cannot know bodies through the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Science is in the intellect. If, therefore,
    the intellect does not know bodies, it follows that there is no science of
    bodies; and thus perishes natural science, which treats of mobile bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It should be said in order to elucidate this
    question, that the early philosophers, who inquired into the natures of
    things, thought there was nothing in the world save bodies. And because they
    observed that all bodies are mobile, and considered them to be ever in a
    state of flux, they were of opinion that we can have no certain knowledge of
    the true nature of things. For what is in a continual state of flux, cannot
    be grasped with any degree of certitude, for it passes away ere the mind can
    form a judgment thereon: according to the saying of Heraclitus, that "it is
    not possible twice to touch a drop of water in a passing torrent," as the
    Philosopher relates (Metaph. iv, Did. iii, 5).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    After these came Plato, who, wishing to save the certitude of our knowledge
    of truth through the intellect, maintained that, besides these things
    corporeal, there is another genus of beings, separate from matter and
    movement, which beings he called "species" or "ideas," by participation of
    which each one of these singular and sensible things is said to be either a
    man, or a horse, or the like. Wherefore he said that sciences and
    definitions, and whatever appertains to the act of the intellect, are not
    referred to these sensible bodies, but to those beings immaterial and
    separate: so that according to this the soul does not understand these
    corporeal things, but the separate species thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this may be shown to be false for two reasons. First, because, since
    those species are immaterial and immovable, knowledge of movement and matter
    would be excluded from science (which knowledge is proper to natural
    science), and likewise all demonstration through moving and material causes.
    Secondly, because it seems ridiculous, when we seek for knowledge of things
    which are to us manifest, to introduce other beings, which cannot be the
    substance of those others, since they differ from them essentially: so that
    granted that we have a knowledge of those separate substances, we cannot for
    that reason claim to form a judgment concerning these sensible things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it seems that Plato strayed from the truth because, having observed that
    all knowledge takes place through some kind of similitude, he thought that
    the form of the thing known must of necessity be in the knower in the same
    manner as in the thing known. Then he observed that the form of the thing
    understood is in the intellect under conditions of universality,
    immateriality, and immobility: which is apparent from the very operation of
    the intellect, whose act of understanding has a universal extension, and is
    subject to a certain amount of necessity: for the mode of action corresponds
    to the mode of the agent's form. Wherefore he concluded that the things
    which we understand must have in themselves an existence under the same
    conditions of immateriality and immobility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But there is no necessity for this. For even in sensible things it is to be
    observed that the form is otherwise in one sensible than in another: for
    instance, whiteness may be of great intensity in one, and of a less
    intensity in another: in one we find whiteness with sweetness, in another
    without sweetness. In the same way the sensible form is conditioned
    differently in the thing which is external to the soul, and in the senses
    which receive the forms of sensible things without receiving matter, such as
    the color of gold without receiving gold. So also the intellect, according
    to its own mode, receives under conditions of immateriality and immobility,
    the species of material and mobile bodies: for the received is in the
    receiver according to the mode of the receiver. We must conclude, therefore,
    that through the intellect the soul knows bodies by a knowledge which is
    immaterial, universal, and necessary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These words of Augustine are to be
    understood as referring to the medium of intellectual knowledge, and not to
    its object. For the intellect knows bodies by understanding them, not indeed
    through bodies, nor through material and corporeal species; but through
    immaterial and intelligible species, which can be in the soul by their own
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii,
    29), it is not correct to say that as the sense knows only bodies so the
    intellect knows only spiritual things; for it follows that God and the
    angels would not know corporeal things. The reason of this diversity is that
    the lower power does not extend to those things that belong to the higher
    power; whereas the higher power operates in a more excellent manner those
    things which belong to the lower power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every movement presupposes something
    immovable: for when a change of quality occurs, the substance remains
    unmoved; and when there is a change of substantial form, matter remains
    unmoved. Moreover the various conditions of mutable things are themselves
    immovable; for instance, though Socrates be not always sitting, yet it is an
    immovable truth that whenever he does sit he remains in one place. For this
    reason there is nothing to hinder our having an immovable science of movable
    things.<br />

    Whether the soul understands corporeal things through its essence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul understands corporeal
    things through its essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. x, 5) that the soul
    "collects and lays hold of the images of bodies which are formed in the soul
    and of the soul: for in forming them it gives them something of its own
    substance." But the soul understands bodies by images of bodies. Therefore
    the soul knows bodies through its essence, which it employs for the
    formation of such images, and from which it forms them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 8)
    that "the soul, after a fashion, is everything." Since, therefore, like is
    known by like, it seems that the soul knows corporeal things through
    itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soul is superior to corporeal
    creatures. Now lower things are in higher things in a more eminent way than
    in themselves, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xii). Therefore all corporeal
    creatures exist in a more excellent way in the soul than in themselves.
    Therefore the soul can know corporeal creatures through its essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 3) that "the
    mind gathers knowledge of corporeal things through the bodily senses." But
    the soul itself cannot be known through the bodily senses. Therefore it does
    not know corporeal things through itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The ancient philosophers held that the soul
    knows bodies through its essence. For it was universally admitted that "like
    is known by like." But they thought that the form of the thing known is in
    the knower in the same mode as in the thing known. The Platonists however
    were of a contrary opinion. For Plato, having observed that the intellectual
    soul has an immaterial nature, and an immaterial mode of knowledge, held
    that the forms of things known subsist immaterially. While the earlier
    natural philosophers, observing that things known are corporeal and
    material, held that things known must exist materially even in the soul that
    knows them. And therefore, in order to ascribe to the soul a knowledge of
    all things, they held that it has the same nature in common with all. And
    because the nature of a result is determined by its principles, they
    ascribed to the soul the nature of a principle; so that those who thought
    fire to be the principle of all, held that the soul had the nature of fire;
    and in like manner as to air and water. Lastly, Empedocles, who held the
    existence of our four material elements and two principles of movement, said
    that the soul was composed of these. Consequently, since they held that
    things exist in the soul materially, they maintained that all the soul's
    knowledge is material, thus failing to discern intellect from sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this opinion will not hold. First, because in the material principle of
    which they spoke, the various results do not exist save in potentiality. But
    a thing is not known according as it is in potentiality, but only according
    as it is in act, as is shown Metaph. ix (Did. viii, 9): wherefore neither is
    a power known except through its act. It is therefore insufficient to
    ascribe to the soul the nature of the principles in order to explain the
    fact that it knows all, unless we further admit in the soul natures and
    forms of each individual result, for instance, of bone, flesh, and the like;
    thus does Aristotle argue against Empedocles (De Anima i, 5). Secondly,
    because if it were necessary for the thing known to exist materially in the
    knower, there would be no reason why things which have a material existence
    outside the soul should be devoid of knowledge; why, for instance, if by
    fire the soul knows fire, that fire also which is outside the soul should
    not have knowledge of fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must conclude, therefore, that material things known must needs exist in
    the knower, not materially, but immaterially. The reason of this is, because
    the act of knowledge extends to things outside the knower: for we know
    things even that are external to us. Now by matter the form of a thing is
    determined to some one thing. Wherefore it is clear that knowledge is in
    inverse ratio of materiality. And consequently things that are not receptive
    of forms save materially, have no power of knowledge whatever---such as
    plants, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 12). But the more immaterially
    a thing receives the form of the thing known, the more perfect is its
    knowledge. Therefore the intellect which abstracts the species not only from
    matter, but also from the individuating conditions of matter, has more
    perfect knowledge than the senses, which receive the form of the thing
    known, without matter indeed, but subject to material conditions. Moreover,
    among the senses, sight has the most perfect knowledge, because it is the
    least material, as we have remarked above (<a href="FP078.html#FPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="FP078.html#FPQ78A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): while among
    intellects the more perfect is the more immaterial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore clear from the foregoing, that if there be an intellect
    which knows all things by its essence, then its essence must needs have all
    things in itself immaterially; thus the early philosophers held that the
    essence of the soul, that it may know all things, must be actually composed
    of the principles of all material things. Now this is proper to God, that
    His Essence comprise all things immaterially as effects pre-exist virtually
    in their cause. God alone, therefore, understands all things through His
    Essence: but neither the human soul nor the angels can do so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine in that passage is speaking of
    an imaginary vision, which takes place through the image of bodies. To the
    formation of such images the soul gives part of its substance, just as a
    subject is given in order to be informed by some form. In this way the soul
    makes such images from itself; not that the soul or some part of the soul be
    turned into this or that image; but just as we say that a body is made into
    something colored because of its being informed with color. That this is the
    sense, is clear from what follows. For he says that the soul "keeps
    something"---namely, not informed with such image---"which is able freely to
    judge of the species of these images": and that this is the "mind" or
    "intellect." And he says that the part which is informed with these
    images---namely, the imagination---is "common to us and beasts."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Aristotle did not hold that the soul is
    actually composed of all things, as did the earlier philosophers; he said
    that the soul is all things, "after a fashion," forasmuch as it is in
    potentiality to all---through the senses, to all things sensible---through
    the intellect, to all things intelligible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every creature has a finite and
    determinate essence. Wherefore although the essence of the higher creature
    has a certain likeness to the lower creature, forasmuch as they have
    something in common generically, yet it has not a complete likeness thereof,
    because it is determined to a certain species other than the species of the
    lower creature. But the Divine Essence is a perfect likeness of all,
    whatsoever may be found to exist in things created, being the universal
    principle of all.<br />

    Whether the soul understands all things through innate species?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul understands all
    things through innate species. For Gregory says, in a homily for the
    Ascension (xxix in Ev.), that "man has understanding in common with the
    angels." But angels understand all things through innate species: wherefore
    in the book De Causis it is said that "every intelligence is full of forms."
    Therefore the soul also has innate species of things, by means of which it
    understands corporeal things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the intellectual soul is more excellent
    than corporeal primary matter. But primary matter was created by God under
    the forms to which it has potentiality. Therefore much more is the
    intellectual soul created by God under intelligible species. And so the soul
    understands corporeal things through innate species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one can answer the truth except
    concerning what he knows. But even a person untaught and devoid of acquired
    knowledge, answers the truth to every question if put to him in orderly
    fashion, as we find related in the Meno (xv seqq.) of Plato, concerning a
    certain individual. Therefore we have some knowledge of things even before
    we acquire knowledge; which would not be the case unless we had innate
    species. Therefore the soul understands corporeal things through innate
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher, speaking of the intellect,
    says (De Anima iii, 4) that it is like "a tablet on which nothing is
    written."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since form is the principle of action, a thing
    must be related to the form which is the principle of an action, as it is to
    that action: for instance, if upward motion is from lightness, then that
    which only potentially moves upwards must needs be only potentially light,
    but that which actually moves upwards must needs be actually light. Now we
    observe that man sometimes is only a potential knower, both as to sense and
    as to intellect. And he is reduced from such potentiality to act---through
    the action of sensible objects on his senses, to the act of sensation---by
    instruction or discovery, to the act of understanding. Wherefore we must say
    that the cognitive soul is in potentiality both to the images which are the
    principles of sensing, and to those which are the principles of
    understanding. For this reason Aristotle (De Anima iii, 4) held that the
    intellect by which the soul understands has no innate species, but is at
    first in potentiality to all such species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since that which has a form actually, is sometimes unable to act
    according to that form on account of some hindrance, as a light thing may be
    hindered from moving upwards; for this reason did Plato hold that naturally
    man's intellect is filled with all intelligible species, but that, by being
    united to the body, it is hindered from the realization of its act. But this
    seems to be unreasonable. First, because, if the soul has a natural
    knowledge of all things, it seems impossible for the soul so far to forget
    the existence of such knowledge as not to know itself to be possessed
    thereof: for no man forgets what he knows naturally; that, for instance, the
    whole is larger than the part, and such like. And especially unreasonable
    does this seem if we suppose that it is natural to the soul to be united to
    the body, as we have established above (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1"
      >Question [76]</a
    >, <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): for it is
    unreasonable that the natural operation of a thing be totally hindered by
    that which belongs to it naturally. Secondly, the falseness of this opinion
    is clearly proved from the fact that if a sense be wanting, the knowledge of
    what is apprehended through that sense is wanting also: for instance, a man
    who is born blind can have no knowledge of colors. This would not be the
    case if the soul had innate images of all intelligible things. We must
    therefore conclude that the soul does not know corporeal things through
    innate species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man indeed has intelligence in common
    with the angels, but not in the same degree of perfection: just as the lower
    grades of bodies, which merely exist, according to Gregory (Homily on
    Ascension, xxix In Ev.), have not the same degree of perfection as the
    higher bodies. For the matter of the lower bodies is not totally completed
    by its form, but is in potentiality to forms which it has not: whereas the
    matter of heavenly bodies is totally completed by its form, so that it is
    not in potentiality to any other form, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP066.html#FPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). In the same way the
    angelic intellect is perfected by intelligible species, in accordance with
    its nature; whereas the human intellect is in potentiality to such
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Primary matter has substantial being
    through its form, consequently it had need to be created under some form:
    else it would not be in act. But when once it exists under one form it is in
    potentiality to others. On the other hand, the intellect does not receive
    substantial being through the intelligible species; and therefore there is
    no comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If questions be put in an orderly
    fashion they proceed from universal self-evident principles to what is
    particular. Now by such a process knowledge is produced in the mind of the
    learner. Wherefore when he answers the truth to a subsequent question, this
    is not because he had knowledge previously, but because he thus learns for
    the first time. For it matters not whether the teacher proceed from
    universal principles to conclusions by questioning or by asserting; for in
    either case the mind of the listener is assured of what follows by that
    which preceded.<br />

    Whether the intelligible species are derived by the soul from certain
    separate forms?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intelligible species are
    derived by the soul from some separate forms. For whatever is such by
    participation is caused by what is such essentially; for instance, that
    which is on fire is reduced to fire as the cause thereof. But the
    intellectual soul forasmuch as it is actually understanding, participates
    the thing understood: for, in a way, the intellect in act is the thing
    understood in act. Therefore what in itself and in its essence is understood
    in act, is the cause that the intellectual soul actually understands. Now
    that which in its essence is actually understood is a form existing without
    matter. Therefore the intelligible species, by which the soul understands,
    are caused by some separate forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the intelligible is to the intellect, as
    the sensible is to the sense. But the sensible species which are in the
    senses, and by which we sense, are caused by the sensible object which
    exists actually outside the soul. Therefore the intelligible species, by
    which our intellect understands, are caused by some things actually
    intelligible, existing outside the soul. But these can be nothing else than
    forms separate from matter. Therefore the intelligible forms of our
    intellect are derived from some separate substances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever is in potentiality is reduced
    to act by something actual. If, therefore, our intellect, previously in
    potentiality, afterwards actually understands, this must needs be caused by
    some intellect which is always in act. But this is a separate intellect.
    Therefore the intelligible species, by which we actually understand, are
    caused by some separate substances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> If this were true we should not need the
    senses in order to understand. And this is proved to be false especially
    from the fact that if a man be wanting in a sense, he cannot have any
    knowledge of the sensibles corresponding to that sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that the intelligible species of
    our intellect are derived from certain separate forms or substances. And
    this in two ways. For Plato, as we have said (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), held that the forms of sensible things subsist by themselves without
    matter; for instance, the form of a man which he called "per se" man, and
    the form or idea of a horse which is called "per se" horse, and so forth. He
    said therefore that these forms are participated both by our soul and by
    corporeal matter; by our soul, to the effect of knowledge thereof, and by
    corporeal matter to the effect of existence: so that, just as corporeal
    matter by participating the idea of a stone, becomes an individuating stone,
    so our intellect, by participating the idea of a stone, is made to
    understand a stone. Now participation of an idea takes place by some image
    of the idea in the participator, just as a model is participated by a copy.
    So just as he held that the sensible forms, which are in corporeal matter,
    are derived from the ideas as certain images thereof: so he held that the
    intelligible species of our intellect are images of the ideas, derived
    therefrom. And for this reason, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), he referred sciences and definitions to those ideas.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since it is contrary to the nature of sensible things that their forms
    should subsist without matter, as Aristotle proves in many ways (Metaph.
    vi), Avicenna (De Anima v) setting this opinion aside, held that the
    intelligible species of all sensible things, instead of subsisting in
    themselves without matter, pre-exist immaterially in the separate
    intellects: from the first of which, said he, such species are derived by a
    second, and so on to the last separate intellect which he called the "active
    intelligence," from which, according to him, intelligible species flow into
    our souls, and sensible species into corporeal matter. And so Avicenna
    agrees with Plato in this, that the intelligible species of our intellect
    are derived from certain separate forms; but these Plato held to subsist of
    themselves, while Avicenna placed them in the "active intelligence." They
    differ, too, in this respect, that Avicenna held that the intelligible
    species do not remain in our intellect after it has ceased actually to
    understand, and that it needs to turn (to the active intellect) in order to
    receive them anew. Consequently he does not hold that the soul has innate
    knowledge, as Plato, who held that the participated ideas remain immovably
    in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But in this opinion no sufficient reason can be assigned for the soul being
    united to the body. For it cannot be said that the intellectual soul is
    united to the body for the sake of the body: for neither is form for the
    sake of matter, nor is the mover for the sake of the moved, but rather the
    reverse. Especially does the body seem necessary to the intellectual soul,
    for the latter's proper operation which is to understand: since as to its
    being the soul does not depend on the body. But if the soul by its very
    nature had an inborn aptitude for receiving intelligible species through the
    influence of only certain separate principles, and were not to receive them
    from the senses, it would not need the body in order to understand:
    wherefore to no purpose would it be united to the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if it be said that our soul needs the senses in order to understand,
    through being in some way awakened by them to the consideration of those
    things, the intelligible species of which it receives from the separate
    principles: even this seems an insufficient explanation. For this awakening
    does not seem necessary to the soul, except in as far as it is overcome by
    sluggishness, as the Platonists expressed it, and by forgetfulness, through
    its union with the body: and thus the senses would be of no use to the
    intellectual soul except for the purpose of removing the obstacle which the
    soul encounters through its union with the body. Consequently the reason of
    the union of the soul with the body still remains to be sought.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And if it be said with Avicenna, that the senses are necessary to the soul,
    because by them it is aroused to turn to the "active intelligence" from
    which it receives the species: neither is this a sufficient explanation.
    Because if it is natural for the soul to understand through species derived
    from the "active intelligence," it follows that at times the soul of an
    individual wanting in one of the senses can turn to the active intelligence,
    either from the inclination of its very nature, or through being roused by
    another sense, to the effect of receiving the intelligible species of which
    the corresponding sensible species are wanting. And thus a man born blind
    could have knowledge of colors; which is clearly untrue. We must therefore
    conclude that the intelligible species, by which our soul understands, are
    not derived from separate forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intelligible species which are
    participated by our intellect are reduced, as to their first cause, to a
    first principle which is by its essence intelligible---namely, God. But they
    proceed from that principle by means of the sensible forms and material
    things, from which we gather knowledge, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
    vii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Material things, as to the being which
    they have outside the soul, may be actually sensible, but not actually
    intelligible. Wherefore there is no comparison between sense and
    intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our passive intellect is reduced from
    potentiality to act by some being in act, that is, by the active intellect,
    which is a power of the soul, as we have said (<a
      href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>); and not by a separate
    intelligence, as proximate cause, although perchance as remote cause.<br />

    Whether the intellectual soul knows material things in the eternal types?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellectual soul does not
    know material things in the eternal types. For that in which anything is
    known must itself be known more and previously. But the intellectual soul of
    man, in the present state of life, does not know the eternal types: for it
    does not know God in Whom the eternal types exist, but is "united to God as
    to the unknown," as Dionysius says (Myst. Theolog. i). Therefore the soul
    does not know all in the eternal types.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A20"
      >Rm. 1:20</a
    >) that "the invisible things of God are clearly seen... by the things that
    are made." But among the invisible things of God are the eternal types.
    Therefore the eternal types are known through creatures and not the
    converse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the eternal types are nothing else but
    ideas, for Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 46) that "ideas are permanent
    types existing in the Divine mind." If therefore we say that the
    intellectual soul knows all things in the eternal types, we come back to the
    opinion of Plato who said that all knowledge is derived from them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. xii, 25): "If we
    both see that what you say is true, and if we both see that what I say is
    true, where do we see this, I pray? Neither do I see it in you, nor do you
    see it in me: but we both see it in the unchangeable truth which is above
    our minds." Now the unchangeable truth is contained in the eternal types.
    Therefore the intellectual soul knows all true things in the eternal
    types.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 11):
    "If those who are called philosophers said by chance anything that was true
    and consistent with our faith, we must claim it from them as from unjust
    possessors. For some of the doctrines of the heathens are spurious
    imitations or superstitious inventions, which we must be careful to avoid
    when we renounce the society of the heathens." Consequently whenever
    Augustine, who was imbued with the doctrines of the Platonists, found in
    their teaching anything consistent with faith, he adopted it: and those
    thing which he found contrary to faith he amended. Now Plato held, as we
    have said above (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), that
    the forms of things subsist of themselves apart from matter; and these he
    called ideas, by participation of which he said that our intellect knows all
    things: so that just as corporeal matter by participating the idea of a
    stone becomes a stone, so our intellect, by participating the same idea, has
    knowledge of a stone. But since it seems contrary to faith that forms of
    things themselves, outside the things themselves and apart from matter, as
    the Platonists held, asserting that "per se" life or "per se" wisdom are
    creative substances, as Dionysius relates (Div. Nom. xi); therefore
    Augustine (Questions. 83, qu. 46), for the ideas defended by Plato,
    substituted the types of all creatures existing in the Divine mind,
    according to which types all things are made in themselves, and are known to
    the human soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    When, therefore, the question is asked: Does the human soul know all things
    in the eternal types? we must reply that one thing is said to be known in
    another in two ways. First, as in an object itself known; as one may see in
    a mirror the images of things reflected therein. In this way the soul, in
    the present state of life, cannot see all things in the eternal types; but
    the blessed who see God, and all things in Him, thus know all things in the
    eternal types. Secondly, on thing is said to be known in another as in a
    principle of knowledge: thus we might say that we see in the sun what we see
    by the sun. And thus we must needs say that the human soul knows all things
    in the eternal types, since by participation of these types we know all
    things. For the intellectual light itself which is in us, is nothing else
    than a participated likeness of the uncreated light, in which are contained
    the eternal types. Whence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++4%3A6,7"
      >Ps. 4:6,7</a
    >), "Many say: Who showeth us good things?" which question the Psalmist
    answers, "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us," as
    though he were to say: By the seal of the Divine light in us, all things are
    made known to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since besides the intellectual light which is in us, intelligible
    species, which are derived from things, are required in order for us to have
    knowledge of material things; therefore this same knowledge is not due
    merely to a participation of the eternal types, as the Platonists held,
    maintaining that the mere participation of ideas sufficed for knowledge.
    Wherefore Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 16): "Although the philosophers prove
    by convincing arguments that all things occur in time according to the
    eternal types, were they able to see in the eternal types, or to find out
    from them how many kinds of animals there are and the origin of each? Did
    they not seek for this information from the story of times and places?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But that Augustine did not understand all things to be known in their
    "eternal types" or in the "unchangeable truth," as though the eternal types
    themselves were seen, is clear from what he says (Questions. 83, qu.
    46)---viz. that "not each and every rational soul can be said to be worthy
    of that vision," namely, of the eternal types, "but only those that are holy
    and pure," such as the souls of the blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From what has been said the objections are easily solved.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether intellectual knowledge is derived from sensible things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that intellectual knowledge is not
    derived from sensible things. For Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 9) that
    "we cannot expect to learn the fulness of truth from the senses of the
    body." This he proves in two ways. First, because "whatever the bodily
    senses reach, is continually being changed; and what is never the same
    cannot be perceived." Secondly, because, "whatever we perceive by the body,
    even when not present to the senses, may be present to the imagination, as
    when we are asleep or angry: yet we cannot discern by the senses, whether
    what we perceive be the sensible object or the deceptive image thereof. Now
    nothing can be perceived which cannot be distinguished from its
    counterfeit." And so he concludes that we cannot expect to learn the truth
    from the senses. But intellectual knowledge apprehends the truth. Therefore
    intellectual knowledge cannot be conveyed by the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16):
    "We must not thing that the body can make any impression on the spirit, as
    though the spirit were to supply the place of matter in regard to the body's
    action; for that which acts is in every way more excellent than that which
    it acts on." Whence he concludes that "the body does not cause its image in
    the spirit, but the spirit causes it in itself." Therefore intellectual
    knowledge is not derived from sensible things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an effect does not surpass the power of
    its cause. But intellectual knowledge extends beyond sensible things: for we
    understand some things which cannot be perceived by the senses. Therefore
    intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Metaph. i, 1; Poster.
    ii, 15) that the principle of knowledge is in the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> On this point the philosophers held three
    opinions. For Democritus held that "all knowledge is caused by images
    issuing from the bodies we think of and entering into our souls," as
    Augustine says in his letter to Dioscorus (cxviii, 4). And Aristotle says
    (De Somn. et Vigil.) that Democritus held that knowledge is cause by a
    "discharge of images." And the reason for this opinion was that both
    Democritus and the other early philosophers did not distinguish between
    intellect and sense, as Aristotle relates (De Anima iii, 3). Consequently,
    since the sense is affected by the sensible, they thought that all our
    knowledge is affected by this mere impression brought about by sensible
    things. Which impression Democritus held to be caused by a discharge of
    images.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Plato, on the other hand, held that the intellect is distinct from the
    senses: and that it is an immaterial power not making use of a corporeal
    organ for its action. And since the incorporeal cannot be affected by the
    corporeal, he held that intellectual knowledge is not brought about by
    sensible things affecting the intellect, but by separate intelligible forms
    being participated by the intellect, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84ATHEP1"
      >Articles [4]</a
    >,5). Moreover he held that sense is a power operating of itself.
    Consequently neither is sense, since it is a spiritual power, affected by
    the sensible: but the sensible organs are affected by the sensible, the
    result being that the soul is in a way roused to form within itself the
    species of the sensible. Augustine seems to touch on this opinion (Gen. ad
    lit. xii, 24) where he says that the "body feels not, but the soul through
    the body, which it makes use of as a kind of messenger, for reproducing
    within itself what is announced from without." Thus according to Plato,
    neither does intellectual knowledge proceed from sensible knowledge, nor
    sensible knowledge exclusively from sensible things; but these rouse the
    sensible soul to the sentient act, while the senses rouse the intellect to
    the act of understanding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Aristotle chose a middle course. For with Plato he agreed that intellect and
    sense are different. But he held that the sense has not its proper operation
    without the cooperation of the body; so that to feel is not an act of the
    soul alone, but of the "composite." And he held the same in regard to all
    the operations of the sensitive part. Since, therefore, it is not
    unreasonable that the sensible objects which are outside the soul should
    produce some effect in the "composite," Aristotle agreed with Democritus in
    this, that the operations of the sensitive part are caused by the impression
    of the sensible on the sense: not by a discharge, as Democritus said, but by
    some kind of operation. For Democritus maintained that every operation is by
    way of a discharge of atoms, as we gather from De Gener. i, 8. But Aristotle
    held that the intellect has an operation which is independent of the body's
    cooperation. Now nothing corporeal can make an impression on the
    incorporeal. And therefore in order to cause the intellectual operation
    according to Aristotle, the impression caused by the sensible does not
    suffice, but something more noble is required, for "the agent is more noble
    than the patient," as he says (De Gener. i, 5). Not, indeed, in the sense
    that the intellectual operation is effected in us by the mere intellectual
    operation is effected in us by the mere impression of some superior beings,
    as Plato held; but that the higher and more noble agent which he calls the
    active intellect, of which we have spoken above (<a
      href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4) causes the phantasms
    received from the senses to be actually intelligible, by a process of
    abstraction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    According to this opinion, then, on the part of the phantasms, intellectual
    knowledge is caused by the senses. But since the phantasms cannot of
    themselves affect the passive intellect, and require to be made actually
    intelligible by the active intellect, it cannot be said that sensible
    knowledge is the total and perfect cause of intellectual knowledge, but
    rather that it is in a way the material cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those words of Augustine mean that we
    must not expect the entire truth from the senses. For the light of the
    active intellect is needed, through which we achieve the unchangeable truth
    of changeable things, and discern things themselves from their likeness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In this passage Augustine speaks not of
    intellectual but of imaginary knowledge. And since, according to the opinion
    of Plato, the imagination has an operation which belongs to the soul only,
    Augustine, in order to show that corporeal images are impressed on the
    imagination, not by bodies but by the soul, uses the same argument as
    Aristotle does in proving that the active intellect must be separate,
    namely, because "the agent is more noble than the patient." And without
    doubt, according to the above opinion, in the imagination there must needs
    be not only a passive but also an active power. But if we hold, according to
    the opinion of Aristotle, that the action of the imagination, is an action
    of the "composite," there is no difficulty; because the sensible body is
    more noble than the organ of the animal, in so far as it is compared to it
    as a being in act to a being in potentiality; even as the object actually
    colored is compared to the pupil which is potentially colored. It may,
    however, be said, although the first impression of the imagination is
    through the agency of the sensible, since "fancy is movement produced in
    accordance with sensation" (De Anima iii, 3), that nevertheless there is in
    man an operation which by synthesis and analysis forms images of various
    things, even of things not perceived by the senses. And Augustine's words
    may be taken in this sense.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sensitive knowledge is not the entire
    cause of intellectual knowledge. And therefore it is not strange that
    intellectual knowledge should extend further than sensitive knowledge.<br />

    Whether the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible
    species of which it is possessed, without turning to the phantasms?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellect can actually
    understand through the intelligible species of which it is possessed,
    without turning to the phantasms. For the intellect is made actual by the
    intelligible species by which it is informed. But if the intellect is in
    act, it understands. Therefore the intelligible species suffices for the
    intellect to understand actually, without turning to the phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the imagination is more dependent on the
    senses than the intellect on the imagination. But the imagination can
    actually imagine in the absence of the sensible. Therefore much more can the
    intellect understand without turning to the phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> There are no phantasms of incorporeal things: for
    the imagination does not transcend time and space. If, therefore, our
    intellect cannot understand anything actually without turning to the
    phantasms, it follows that it cannot understand anything incorporeal. Which
    is clearly false: for we understand truth, and God, and the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7) that
    "the soul understands nothing without a phantasm."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the present state of life in which the soul
    is united to a passible body, it is impossible for our intellect to
    understand anything actually, except by turning to the phantasms. First of
    all because the intellect, being a power that does not make use of a
    corporeal organ, would in no way be hindered in its act through the lesion
    of a corporeal organ, if for its act there were not required the act of some
    power that does make use of a corporeal organ. Now sense, imagination and
    the other powers belonging to the sensitive part, make use of a corporeal
    organ. Wherefore it is clear that for the intellect to understand actually,
    not only when it acquires fresh knowledge, but also when it applies
    knowledge already acquired, there is need for the act of the imagination and
    of the other powers. For when the act of the imagination is hindered by a
    lesion of the corporeal organ, for instance in a case of frenzy; or when the
    act of the memory is hindered, as in the case of lethargy, we see that a man
    is hindered from actually understanding things of which he had a previous
    knowledge. Secondly, anyone can experience this of himself, that when he
    tries to understand something, he forms certain phantasms to serve him by
    way of examples, in which as it were he examines what he is desirous of
    understanding. For this reason it is that when we wish to help someone to
    understand something, we lay examples before him, from which he forms
    phantasms for the purpose of understanding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the reason of this is that the power of knowledge is proportioned to the
    thing known. Wherefore the proper object of the angelic intellect, which is
    entirely separate from a body, is an intelligible substance separate from a
    body. Whereas the proper object of the human intellect, which is united to a
    body, is a quiddity or nature existing in corporeal matter; and through such
    natures of visible things it rises to a certain knowledge of things
    invisible. Now it belongs to such a nature to exist in an individual, and
    this cannot be apart from corporeal matter: for instance, it belongs to the
    nature of a stone to be in an individual stone, and to the nature of a horse
    to be in an individual horse, and so forth. Wherefore the nature of a stone
    or any material thing cannot be known completely and truly, except in as
    much as it is known as existing in the individual. Now we apprehend the
    individual through the senses and the imagination. And, therefore, for the
    intellect to understand actually its proper object, it must of necessity
    turn to the phantasms in order to perceive the universal nature existing in
    the individual. But if the proper object of our intellect were a separate
    form; or if, as the Platonists say, the natures of sensible things subsisted
    apart from the individual; there would be no need for the intellect to turn
    to the phantasms whenever it understands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The species preserved in the passive
    intellect exist there habitually when it does not understand them actually,
    as we have said above (<a href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>,
    <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Wherefore for us to
    understand actually, the fact that the species are preserved does not
    suffice; we need further to make use of them in a manner befitting the
    things of which they are the species, which things are natures existing in
    individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even the phantasm is the likeness of an
    individual thing; wherefore the imagination does not need any further
    likeness of the individual, whereas the intellect does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Incorporeal things, of which there are
    no phantasms, are known to us by comparison with sensible bodies of which
    there are phantasms. Thus we understand truth by considering a thing of
    which we possess the truth; and God, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i), we
    know as cause, by way of excess and by way of remotion. Other incorporeal
    substances we know, in the present state of life, only by way of remotion or
    by some comparison to corporeal things. And, therefore, when we understand
    something about these things, we need to turn to phantasms of bodies,
    although there are no phantasms of the things themselves.<br />

    Whether the judgment of the intellect is hindered through suspension of the
    sensitive powers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judgment of the intellect
    is not hindered by suspension of the sensitive powers. For the superior does
    not depend on the inferior. But the judgment of the intellect is higher than
    the senses. Therefore the judgment of the intellect is not hindered through
    suspension of the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to syllogize is an act of the intellect.
    But during sleep the senses are suspended, as is said in De Somn. et Vigil.
    i and yet it sometimes happens to us to syllogize while asleep. Therefore
    the judgment of the intellect is not hindered through suspension of the
    senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> What a man does while asleep, against the
    moral law, is not imputed to him as a sin; as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
    xii, 15). But this would not be the case if man, while asleep, had free use
    of his reason and intellect. Therefore the judgment of the intellect is
    hindered by suspension of the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have said above (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >), our intellect's proper and proportionate object is the nature of a
    sensible thing. Now a perfect judgment concerning anything cannot be formed,
    unless all that pertains to that thing's nature be known; especially if that
    be ignored which is the term and end of judgment. Now the Philosopher says
    (De Coel. iii), that "as the end of a practical science is action, so the
    end of natural science is that which is perceived principally through the
    senses"; for the smith does not seek knowledge of a knife except for the
    purpose of action, in order that he may produce a certain individual knife;
    and in like manner the natural philosopher does not seek to know the nature
    of a stone and of a horse, save for the purpose of knowing the essential
    properties of those things which he perceives with his senses. Now it is
    clear that a smith cannot judge perfectly of a knife unless he knows the
    action of the knife: and in like manner the natural philosopher cannot judge
    perfectly of natural things, unless he knows sensible things. But in the
    present state of life whatever we understand, we know by comparison to
    natural sensible things. Consequently it is not possible for our intellect
    to form a perfect judgment, while the senses are suspended, through which
    sensible things are known to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the intellect is superior to
    the senses, nevertheless in a manner it receives from the senses, and its
    first and principal objects are founded in sensible things. And therefore
    suspension of the senses necessarily involves a hindrance to the judgment of
    the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The senses are suspended in the sleeper
    through certain evaporations and the escape of certain exhalations, as we
    read in De Somn. et Vigil. iii. And, therefore, according to the amount of
    such evaporation, the senses are more or less suspended. For when the amount
    is considerable, not only are the senses suspended, but also the
    imagination, so that there are no phantasms; thus does it happen, especially
    when a man falls asleep after eating and drinking copiously. If, however,
    the evaporation be somewhat less, phantasms appear, but distorted and
    without sequence; thus it happens in a case of fever. And if the evaporation
    be still more attenuated, the phantasms will have a certain sequence: thus
    especially does it happen towards the end of sleep in sober men and those
    who are gifted with a strong imagination. If the evaporation be very slight,
    not only does the imagination retain its freedom, but also the common sense
    is partly freed; so that sometimes while asleep a man may judge that what he
    sees is a dream, discerning, as it were, between things, and their images.
    Nevertheless, the common sense remains partly suspended; and therefore,
    although it discriminates some images from the reality, yet is it always
    deceived in some particular. Therefore, while man is asleep, according as
    sense and imagination are free, so is the judgment of his intellect
    unfettered, though not entirely. Consequently, if a man syllogizes while
    asleep, when he wakes up he invariably recognizes a flaw in some respect.<br />
