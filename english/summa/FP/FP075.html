    TREATISE ON MAN (Questions [75]-102)<br />
    <br />
    OF MAN WHO IS COMPOSED OF A SPIRITUAL AND A CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE: AND IN THE
    FIRST PLACE, CONCERNING WHAT BELONGS TO THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL (SEVEN
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Having treated of the spiritual and of the corporeal creature, we now
    proceed to treat of man, who is composed of a spiritual and corporeal
    substance. We shall treat first of the nature of man, and secondly of his
    origin. Now the theologian considers the nature of man in relation to the
    soul; but not in relation to the body, except in so far as the body has
    relation to the soul. Hence the first object of our consideration will be
    the soul. And since Dionysius (Ang. Hier. xi) says that three things are to
    be found in spiritual substances---essence, power, and operation---we shall
    treat first of what belongs to the essence of the soul; secondly, of what
    belongs to its power; thirdly, of what belongs to its operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning the first, two points have to be considered; the first is the
    nature of the soul considered in itself; the second is the union of the soul
    with the body. Under the first head there are seven points of inquiry.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the soul is a body?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul is a body. For the
    soul is the moving principle of the body. Nor does it move unless moved.
    First, because seemingly nothing can move unless it is itself moved, since
    nothing gives what it has not; for instance, what is not hot does not give
    heat. Secondly, because if there be anything that moves and is not moved, it
    must be the cause of eternal, unchanging movement, as we find proved Phys.
    viii, 6; and this does not appear to be the case in the movement of an
    animal, which is caused by the soul. Therefore the soul is a mover moved.
    But every mover moved is a body. Therefore the soul is a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all knowledge is caused by means of a
    likeness. But there can be no likeness of a body to an incorporeal thing.
    If, therefore, the soul were not a body, it could not have knowledge of
    corporeal things.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, between the mover and the moved there
    must be contact. But contact is only between bodies. Since, therefore, the
    soul moves the body, it seems that the soul must be a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 6) that the soul
    "is simple in comparison with the body, inasmuch as it does not occupy space
    by its bulk."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise
    that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those things
    which live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e. having a soul], and
    those things which have no life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally
    by two actions, knowledge and movement. The philosophers of old, not being
    able to rise above their imagination, supposed that the principle of these
    actions was something corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were
    real things; and that what is not corporeal is nothing: hence they
    maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This opinion can be proved
    to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof, based on
    universal and certain principles, which shows clearly that the soul is not a
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a soul, for then
    the eye would be a soul, as it is a principle of vision; and the same might
    be applied to the other instruments of the soul: but it is the "first"
    principle of life, which we call the soul. Now, though a body may be a
    principle of life, or to be a living thing, as the heart is a principle of
    life in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle of life.
    For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to be a living thing,
    does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were the case, every body
    would be a living thing, or a principle of life. Therefore a body is
    competent to be a living thing or even a principle of life, as "such" a
    body. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to some principle which
    is called its act. Therefore the soul, which is the first principle of life,
    is not a body, but the act of a body; thus heat, which is the principle of
    calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As everything which is in motion must be
    moved by something else, a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely,
    we must allow that not every mover is moved. For, since to be moved is to
    pass from potentiality to actuality, the mover gives what it has to the
    thing moved, inasmuch as it causes it to be in act. But, as is shown in
    Phys. viii, 6, there is a mover which is altogether immovable, and not moved
    either essentially, or accidentally; and such a mover can cause an
    invariable movement. There is, however, another kind of mover, which, though
    not moved essentially, is moved accidentally; and for this reason it does
    not cause an invariable movement; such a mover, is the soul. There is,
    again, another mover, which is moved essentially---namely, the body. And
    because the philosophers of old believed that nothing existed but bodies,
    they maintained that every mover is moved; and that the soul is moved
    directly, and is a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of a thing known is not of
    necessity actually in the nature of the knower; but given a thing which
    knows potentially, and afterwards knows actually, the likeness of the thing
    known must be in the nature of the knower, not actually, but only
    potentially; thus color is not actually in the pupil of the eye, but only
    potentially. Hence it is necessary, not that the likeness of corporeal
    things should be actually in the nature of the soul, but that there be a
    potentiality in the soul for such a likeness. But the ancient philosophers
    omitted to distinguish between actuality and potentiality; and so they held
    that the soul must be a body in order to have knowledge of a body; and that
    it must be composed of the principles of which all bodies are formed in
    order to know all bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two kinds of contact; of
    "quantity," and of "power." By the former a body can be touched only by a
    body; by the latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal thing, which
    moves that body.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the human soul is something subsistent?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human soul is not
    something subsistent. For that which subsists is said to be "this particular
    thing." Now "this particular thing" is said not of the soul, but of that
    which is composed of soul and body. Therefore the soul is not something
    subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everything subsistent operates. But the
    soul does not operate; for, as the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 4), "to say
    that the soul feels or understands is like saying that the soul weaves or
    builds." Therefore the soul is not subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would
    have some operation apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from
    the body, not even that of understanding: for the act of understanding does
    not take place without a phantasm, which cannot exist apart from the body.
    Therefore the human soul is not something subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. x, 7): "Who
    understands that the nature of the soul is that of a substance and not that
    of a body, will see that those who maintain the corporeal nature of the
    soul, are led astray through associating with the soul those things without
    which they are unable to think of any nature---i.e. imaginary pictures of
    corporeal things." Therefore the nature of the human intellect is not only
    incorporeal, but it is also a substance, that is, something subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It must necessarily be allowed that the
    principle of intellectual operation which we call the soul, is a principle
    both incorporeal and subsistent. For it is clear that by means of the
    intellect man can have knowledge of all corporeal things. Now whatever knows
    certain things cannot have any of them in its own nature; because that which
    is in it naturally would impede the knowledge of anything else. Thus we
    observe that a sick man's tongue being vitiated by a feverish and bitter
    humor, is insensible to anything sweet, and everything seems bitter to it.
    Therefore, if the intellectual principle contained the nature of a body it
    would be unable to know all bodies. Now every body has its own determinate
    nature. Therefore it is impossible for the intellectual principle to be a
    body. It is likewise impossible for it to understand by means of a bodily
    organ; since the determinate nature of that organ would impede knowledge of
    all bodies; as when a certain determinate color is not only in the pupil of
    the eye, but also in a glass vase, the liquid in the vase seems to be of
    that same color.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore the intellectual principle which we call the mind or the intellect
    has an operation "per se" apart from the body. Now only that which subsists
    can have an operation "per se." For nothing can operate but what is actual:
    for which reason we do not say that heat imparts heat, but that what is hot
    gives heat. We must conclude, therefore, that the human soul, which is
    called the intellect or the mind, is something incorporeal and
    subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "This particular thing" can be taken in
    two senses. Firstly, for anything subsistent; secondly, for that which
    subsists, and is complete in a specific nature. The former sense excludes
    the inherence of an accident or of a material form; the latter excludes also
    the imperfection of the part, so that a hand can be called "this particular
    thing" in the first sense, but not in the second. Therefore, as the human
    soul is a part of human nature, it can indeed be called "this particular
    thing," in the first sense, as being something subsistent; but not in the
    second, for in this sense, what is composed of body and soul is said to be
    "this particular thing."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Aristotle wrote those words as
    expressing not his own opinion, but the opinion of those who said that to
    understand is to be moved, as is clear from the context. Or we may reply
    that to operate "per se" belongs to what exists "per se." But for a thing to
    exist "per se," it suffices sometimes that it be not inherent, as an
    accident or a material form; even though it be part of something.
    Nevertheless, that is rightly said to subsist "per se," which is neither
    inherent in the above sense, nor part of anything else. In this sense, the
    eye or the hand cannot be said to subsist "per se"; nor can it for that
    reason be said to operate "per se." Hence the operation of the parts is
    through each part attributed to the whole. For we say that man sees with the
    eye, and feels with the hand, and not in the same sense as when we say that
    what is hot gives heat by its heat; for heat, strictly speaking, does not
    give heat. We may therefore say that the soul understands, as the eye sees;
    but it is more correct to say that man understands through the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The body is necessary for the action of
    the intellect, not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object;
    for the phantasm is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither
    does such a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be non-subsistent;
    otherwise it would follow that an animal is non-subsistent, since it
    requires external objects of the senses in order to perform its act of
    perception.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the souls of brute animals are subsistent?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the souls of brute animals are
    subsistent. For man is of the same 'genus' as other animals; and, as we have
    just shown (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the soul of
    man is subsistent. Therefore the souls of other animals are subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the relation of the sensitive faculty to
    sensible objects is like the relation of the intellectual faculty to
    intelligible objects. But the intellect, apart from the body, apprehends
    intelligible objects. Therefore the sensitive faculty, apart from the body,
    perceives sensible objects. Therefore, since the souls of brute animals are
    sensitive, it follows that they are subsistent; just as the human
    intellectual soul is subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soul of brute animals moves the
    body. But the body is not a mover, but is moved. Therefore the soul of brute
    animals has an operation apart from the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Is what is written in the book De Eccl. Dogm.
    xvi, xvii: "Man alone we believe to have a subsistent soul: whereas the
    souls of animals are not subsistent."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The ancient philosophers made no distinction
    between sense and intellect, and referred both a corporeal principle, as has
    been said (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Plato,
    however, drew a distinction between intellect and sense; yet he referred
    both to an incorporeal principle, maintaining that sensing, just as
    understanding, belongs to the soul as such. From this it follows that even
    the souls of brute animals are subsistent. But Aristotle held that of the
    operations of the soul, understanding alone is performed without a corporeal
    organ. On the other hand, sensation and the consequent operations of the
    sensitive soul are evidently accompanied with change in the body; thus in
    the act of vision, the pupil of the eye is affected by a reflection of
    color: and so with the other senses. Hence it is clear that the sensitive
    soul has no "per se" operation of its own, and that every operation of the
    sensitive soul belongs to the composite. Wherefore we conclude that as the
    souls of brute animals have no "per se" operations they are not subsistent.
    For the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although man is of the same "genus" as
    other animals, he is of a different "species." Specific difference is
    derived from the difference of form; nor does every difference of form
    necessarily imply a diversity of "genus."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The relation of the sensitive faculty to
    the sensible object is in one way the same as that of the intellectual
    faculty to the intelligible object, in so far as each is in potentiality to
    its object. But in another way their relations differ, inasmuch as the
    impression of the object on the sense is accompanied with change in the
    body; so that excessive strength of the sensible corrupts sense; a thing
    that never occurs in the case of the intellect. For an intellect that
    understands the highest of intelligible objects is more able afterwards to
    understand those that are lower. If, however, in the process of intellectual
    operation the body is weary, this result is accidental, inasmuch as the
    intellect requires the operation of the sensitive powers in the production
    of the phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Motive power is of two kinds. One, the
    appetitive power, commands motion. The operation of this power in the
    sensitive soul is not apart from the body; for anger, joy, and passions of a
    like nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The other motive power
    is that which executes motion in adapting the members for obeying the
    appetite; and the act of this power does not consist in moving, but in being
    moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an act of the sensitive soul
    without the body.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the soul is man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul is man. For it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++4%3A16"
      >2 Cor. 4:16</a
    >): "Though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day
    by day." But that which is within man is the soul. Therefore the soul is the
    inward man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the human soul is a substance. But it is
    not a universal substance. Therefore it is a particular substance. Therefore
    it is a "hypostasis" or a person; and it can only be a human person.
    Therefore the soul is man; for a human person is a man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 3) commends Varro
    as holding "that man is not a mere soul, nor a mere body; but both soul and
    body."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The assertion "the soul is man," can be taken
    in two senses. First, that man is a soul; though this particular man,
    Socrates, for instance, is not a soul, but composed of soul and body. I say
    this, forasmuch as some held that the form alone belongs to the species;
    while matter is part of the individual, and not the species. This cannot be
    true; for to the nature of the species belongs what the definition
    signifies; and in natural things the definition does not signify the form
    only, but the form and the matter. Hence in natural things the matter is
    part of the species; not, indeed, signate matter, which is the principle of
    individuality; but the common matter. For as it belongs to the notion of
    this particular man to be composed of this soul, of this flesh, and of these
    bones; so it belongs to the notion of man to be composed of soul, flesh, and
    bones; for whatever belongs in common to the substance of all the
    individuals contained under a given species, must belong to the substance of
    the species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be understood in this sense, that this soul is this man; and
    this could be held if it were supposed that the operation of the sensitive
    soul were proper to it, apart from the body; because in that case all the
    operations which are attributed to man would belong to the soul only; and
    whatever performs the operations proper to a thing, is that thing; wherefore
    that which performs the operations of a man is man. But it has been shown
    above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that sensation is
    not the operation of the soul only. Since, then, sensation is an operation
    of man, but not proper to him, it is clear that man is not a soul only, but
    something composed of soul and body. Plato, through supposing that sensation
    was proper to the soul, could maintain man to be a soul making use of the
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix,
    8), a thing seems to be chiefly what is principle in it; thus what the
    governor of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes
    what is principle in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the
    intellectual part which, in accordance with truth, is called the "inward"
    man; and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is called man in the
    opinion of those whose observation does not go beyond the senses. And this
    is called the "outward" man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not every particular substance is a
    hypostasis or a person, but that which has the complete nature of its
    species. Hence a hand, or a foot, is not called a hypostasis, or a person;
    nor, likewise, is the soul alone so called, since it is a part of the human
    species.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the soul is composed of matter and form?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul is composed of matter
    and form. For potentiality is opposed to actuality. Now, whatsoever things
    are in actuality participate of the First Act, which is God; by
    participation of Whom, all things are good, are beings, and are living
    things, as is clear from the teaching of Dionysius (Div. Nom. v). Therefore
    whatsoever things are in potentiality participate of the first potentiality.
    But the first potentiality is primary matter. Therefore, since the human
    soul is, after a manner, in potentiality; which appears from the fact that
    sometimes a man is potentially understanding; it seems that the human soul
    must participate of primary matter, as part of itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, wherever the properties of matter are
    found, there matter is. But the properties of matter are found in the
    soul---namely, to be a subject, and to be changed, for it is a subject to
    science, and virtue; and it changes from ignorance to knowledge and from
    vice to virtue. Therefore matter is in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things which have no matter, have no
    cause of their existence, as the Philosopher says Metaph. viii (Did. vii,
    6). But the soul has a cause of its existence, since it is created by God.
    Therefore the soul has matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what has no matter, and is a form only,
    is a pure act, and is infinite. But this belongs to God alone. Therefore the
    soul has matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Gen. ad lit. vii, 7,8,9) proves
    that the soul was made neither of corporeal matter, nor of spiritual
    matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The soul has no matter. We may consider this
    question in two ways. First, from the notion of a soul in general; for it
    belongs to the notion of a soul to be the form of a body. Now, either it is
    a form by virtue of itself, in its entirety, or by virtue of some part of
    itself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it is impossible that
    any part of it should be matter, if by matter we understand something purely
    potential: for a form, as such, is an act; and that which is purely
    potentiality cannot be part of an act, since potentiality is repugnant to
    actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a form by virtue of
    a part of itself, then we call that part the soul: and that matter, which it
    actualizes first, we call the "primary animate."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human soul inasmuch
    as it is intellectual. For it is clear that whatever is received into
    something is received according to the condition of the recipient. Now a
    thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower. But the intellectual
    soul knows a thing in its nature absolutely: for instance, it knows a stone
    absolutely as a stone; and therefore the form of a stone absolutely, as to
    its proper formal idea, is in the intellectual soul. Therefore the
    intellectual soul itself is an absolute form, and not something composed of
    matter and form. For if the intellectual soul were composed of matter and
    form, the forms of things would be received into it as individuals, and so
    it would only know the individual: just as it happens with the sensitive
    powers which receive forms in a corporeal organ; since matter is the
    principle by which forms are individualized. It follows, therefore, that the
    intellectual soul, and every intellectual substance which has knowledge of
    forms absolutely, is exempt from composition of matter and form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The First Act is the universal principle
    of all acts; because It is infinite, virtually "precontaining all things,"
    as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v). Wherefore things participate of It not as a
    part of themselves, but by diffusion of Its processions. Now as potentiality
    is receptive of act, it must be proportionate to act. But the acts received
    which proceed from the First Infinite Act, and are participations thereof,
    are diverse, so that there cannot be one potentiality which receives all
    acts, as there is one act, from which all participated acts are derived; for
    then the receptive potentiality would equal the active potentiality of the
    First Act. Now the receptive potentiality in the intellectual soul is other
    than the receptive potentiality of first matter, as appears from the
    diversity of the things received by each. For primary matter receives
    individual forms; whereas the intelligence receives absolute forms. Hence
    the existence of such a potentiality in the intellectual soul does not prove
    that the soul is composed of matter and form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To be a subject and to be changed belong
    to matter by reason of its being in potentiality. As, therefore, the
    potentiality of the intelligence is one thing and the potentiality of
    primary matter another, so in each is there a different reason of subjection
    and change. For the intelligence is subject to knowledge, and is changed
    from ignorance to knowledge, by reason of its being in potentiality with
    regard to the intelligible species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The form causes matter to be, and so
    does the agent; wherefore the agent causes matter to be, so far as it
    actualizes it by transmuting it to the act of a form. A subsistent form,
    however, does not owe its existence to some formal principle, nor has it a
    cause transmuting it from potentiality to act. So after the words quoted
    above, the Philosopher concludes, that in things composed of matter and form
    "there is no other cause but that which moves from potentiality to act;
    while whatsoever things have no matter are simply beings at once." [*The
    Leonine edition has, "simpliciter sunt quod vere entia aliquid." The Parma
    edition of St. Thomas's Commentary on Aristotle has, "statim per se unum
    quiddam est... et ens quiddam."]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Everything participated is compared to
    the participator as its act. But whatever created form be supposed to
    subsist "per se," must have existence by participation; for "even life," or
    anything of that sort, "is a participator of existence," as Dionysius says
    (Div. Nom. v). Now participated existence is limited by the capacity of the
    participator; so that God alone, Who is His own existence, is pure act and
    infinite. But in intellectual substances there is composition of actuality
    and potentiality, not, indeed, of matter and form, but of form and
    participated existence. Wherefore some say that they are composed of that
    "whereby they are" and that "which they are"; for existence itself is that
    by which a thing is.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the human soul is incorruptible?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human soul is corruptible.
    For those things that have a like beginning and process seemingly have a
    like end. But the beginning, by generation, of men is like that of animals,
    for they are made from the earth. And the process of life is alike in both;
    because "all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than the
    beast," as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++3%3A19"
      >Eccles. 3:19</a
    >). Therefore, as the same text concludes, "the death of man and beast is
    one, and the condition of both is equal." But the souls of brute animals are
    corruptible. Therefore, also, the human soul is corruptible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is out of nothing can return to
    nothingness; because the end should correspond to the beginning. But as it
    is written (Wis. 2:2), "We are born of nothing"; which is true, not only of
    the body, but also of the soul. Therefore, as is concluded in the same
    passage, "After this we shall be as if we had not been," even as to our
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is without its own proper
    operation. But the operation proper to the soul, which is to understand
    through a phantasm, cannot be without the body. For the soul understands
    nothing without a phantasm; and there is no phantasm without the body as the
    Philosopher says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the soul cannot survive the
    dissolution of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that human
    souls owe to Divine goodness that they are "intellectual," and that they
    have "an incorruptible substantial life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must assert that the intellectual principle
    which we call the human soul is incorruptible. For a thing may be corrupted
    in two ways---"per se," and accidentally. Now it is impossible for any
    substance to be generated or corrupted accidentally, that is, by the
    generation or corruption of something else. For generation and corruption
    belong to a thing, just as existence belongs to it, which is acquired by
    generation and lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has existence "per
    se" cannot be generated or corrupted except 'per se'; while things which do
    not subsist, such as accidents and material forms, acquire existence or lost
    it through the generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was
    shown above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3) that the
    souls of brutes are not self-subsistent, whereas the human soul is; so that
    the souls of brutes are corrupted, when their bodies are corrupted; while
    the human soul could not be corrupted unless it were corrupted "per se."
    This, indeed, is impossible, not only as regards the human soul, but also as
    regards anything subsistent that is a form alone. For it is clear that what
    belongs to a thing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it; but existence
    belongs to a form, which is an act, by virtue of itself. Wherefore matter
    acquires actual existence as it acquires the form; while it is corrupted so
    far as the form is separated from it. But it is impossible for a form to be
    separated from itself; and therefore it is impossible for a subsistent form
    to cease to exist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Granted even that the soul is composed of matter and form, as some pretend,
    we should nevertheless have to maintain that it is incorruptible. For
    corruption is found only where there is contrariety; since generation and
    corruption are from contraries and into contraries. Wherefore the heavenly
    bodies, since they have no matter subject to contrariety, are incorruptible.
    Now there can be no contrariety in the intellectual soul; for it receives
    according to the manner of its existence, and those things which it receives
    are without contrariety; for the notions even of contraries are not
    themselves contrary, since contraries belong to the same knowledge.
    Therefore it is impossible for the intellectual soul to be corruptible.
    Moreover we may take a sign of this from the fact that everything naturally
    aspires to existence after its own manner. Now, in things that have
    knowledge, desire ensues upon knowledge. The senses indeed do not know
    existence, except under the conditions of "here" and "now," whereas the
    intellect apprehends existence absolutely, and for all time; so that
    everything that has an intellect naturally desires always to exist. But a
    natural desire cannot be in vain. Therefore every intellectual substance is
    incorruptible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Solomon reasons thus in the person of
    the foolish, as expressed in the words of Wisdom 2. Therefore the saying
    that man and animals have a like beginning in generation is true of the
    body; for all animals alike are made of earth. But it is not true of the
    soul. For the souls of brutes are produced by some power of the body;
    whereas the human soul is produced by God. To signify this it is written as
    to other animals: "Let the earth bring forth the living soul" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A24"
      >Gn. 1:24</a
    >): while of man it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A7"
      >Gn. 2:7</a
    >) that "He breathed into his face the breath of life." And so in the last
    chapter of Ecclesiastes (12:7) it is concluded: "(Before) the dust return
    into its earth from whence it was; and the spirit return to God Who gave
    it." Again the process of life is alike as to the body, concerning which it
    is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++3%3A19"
      >Eccles. 3:19</a
    >): "All things breathe alike," and (Wis. 2:2), "The breath in our nostrils
    is smoke." But the process is not alike of the soul; for man is intelligent,
    whereas animals are not. Hence it is false to say: "Man has nothing more
    than beasts." Thus death comes to both alike as to the body, by not as to
    the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As a thing can be created by reason, not
    of a passive potentiality, but only of the active potentiality of the
    Creator, Who can produce something out of nothing, so when we say that a
    thing can be reduced to nothing, we do not imply in the creature a
    potentiality to non-existence, but in the Creator the power of ceasing to
    sustain existence. But a thing is said to be corruptible because there is in
    it a potentiality to non-existence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To understand through a phantasm is the
    proper operation of the soul by virtue of its union with the body. After
    separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding, similar
    to other substances separated from bodies, as will appear later on (<a

    Whether the soul is of the same species as an angel?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul is of the same
    species as an angel. For each thing is ordained to its proper end by the
    nature of its species, whence is derived its inclination for that end. But
    the end of the soul is the same as that of an angel---namely, eternal
    happiness. Therefore they are of the same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the ultimate specific difference is the
    noblest, because it completes the nature of the species. But there is
    nothing nobler either in an angel or in the soul than their intellectual
    nature. Therefore the soul and the angel agree in the ultimate specific
    difference: therefore they belong to the same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems that the soul does not differ
    from an angel except in its union with the body. But as the body is outside
    the essence of the soul, it seems that it does not belong to its species.
    Therefore the soul and angel are of the same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things which have different natural
    operations are of different species. But the natural operations of the soul
    and of an angel are different; since, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii),
    "Angelic minds have simple and blessed intelligence, not gathering their
    knowledge of Divine things from visible things." Subsequently he says the
    contrary to this of the soul. Therefore the soul and an angel are not of the
    same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Origen (Peri Archon iii, 5) held that human
    souls and angels are all of the same species; and this because he supposed
    that in these substances the difference of degree was accidental, as
    resulting from their free-will: as we have seen above (<a
      href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But this cannot be;
    for in incorporeal substances there cannot be diversity of number without
    diversity of species and inequality of nature; because, as they are not
    composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms, it is clear that
    there is necessarily among them a diversity of species. For a separate form
    cannot be understood otherwise than as one of a single species; thus,
    supposing a separate whiteness to exist, it could only be one; forasmuch as
    one whiteness does not differ from another except as in this or that
    subject. But diversity of species is always accompanied with a diversity of
    nature; thus in species of colors one is more perfect than another; and the
    same applies to other species, because differences which divide a "genus"
    are contrary to one another. Contraries, however, are compared to one
    another as the perfect to the imperfect, since the "principle of contrariety
    is habit, and privation thereof," as is written Metaph. x (Did. ix, 4). The
    same would follow if the aforesaid substances were composed of matter and
    form. For if the matter of one be distinct from the matter of another, it
    follows that either the form is the principle of the distinction of
    matter---that is to say, that the matter is distinct on account of its
    relation to divers forms; and even then there would result a difference of
    species and inequality of nature: or else the matter is the principle of the
    distinction of forms. But one matter cannot be distinct from another, except
    by a distinction of quantity, which has no place in these incorporeal
    substances, such as an angel and the soul. So that it is not possible for
    the angel and the soul to be of the same species. How it is that there can
    be many souls of one species will be explained later (<a
      href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1"
      >Question [76]</a
    >, <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proceeds from the
    proximate and natural end. Eternal happiness is the ultimate and
    supernatural end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The ultimate specific difference is the
    noblest because it is the most determinate, in the same way as actuality is
    nobler than potentiality. Thus, however, the intellectual faculty is not the
    noblest, because it is indeterminate and common to many degrees of
    intellectuality; as the sensible faculty is common to many degrees in the
    sensible nature. Hence, as all sensible things are not of one species, so
    neither are all intellectual things of one species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The body is not of the essence of the
    soul; but the soul by the nature of its essence can be united to the body,
    so that, properly speaking, not the soul alone, but the "composite," is the
    species. And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires the body
    for its operation, proves that the soul is endowed with a grade of
    intellectuality inferior to that of an angel, who is not united to a
    body.<br />
