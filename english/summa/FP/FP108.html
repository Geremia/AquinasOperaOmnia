    OF THE ANGELIC DEGREES OF HIERARCHIES AND ORDERS (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next consider the degrees of the angels in their hierarchies and orders;
    for it was said above (Question [106], Article [3]), that the superior
    angels enlighten the inferior angels; and not conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under this head there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether all the angels belong to
    one hierarchy?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in one hierarchy there is
    only one order?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether in one order there are
    many angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the distinction of
    hierarchies and orders is natural?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of the names and properties of
    each order.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the comparison of the orders
    to one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the orders will outlast
    the Day of Judgment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether men are taken up into the
    angelic orders?

  <h3 align="left">Whether all the angels are of one hierarchy?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the angels belong to one
    hierarchy. For since the angels are supreme among creatures, it is evident
    that they are ordered for the best. But the best ordering of a multitude is
    for it to be governed by one authority, as the Philosopher shows (Metaph.
    xii, Did. xi, 10; Polit. iii, 4). Therefore as a hierarchy is nothing but a
    sacred principality, it seems that all the angels belong to one
    hierarchy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iii) that
    "hierarchy is order, knowledge, and action." But all the angels agree in one
    order towards God, Whom they know, and by Whom in their actions they are
    ruled. Therefore all the angels belong to one hierarchy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacred principality called hierarchy
    is to be found among men and angels. But all men are of one hierarchy.
    Therefore likewise all the angels are of one hierarchy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vi) distinguishes
    three hierarchies of angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Hierarchy means a "sacred" principality, as
    above explained. Now principality includes two things: the prince himself
    and the multitude ordered under the prince. Therefore because there is one
    God, the Prince not only of all the angels but also of men and all
    creatures; so there is one hierarchy, not only of all the angels, but also
    of all rational creatures, who can be participators of sacred things;
    according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xii, 1): "There are two cities, that is,
    two societies, one of the good angels and men, the other of the wicked." But
    if we consider the principality on the part of the multitude ordered under
    the prince, then principality is said to be "one" accordingly as the
    multitude can be subject in "one" way to the government of the prince. And
    those that cannot be governed in the same way by a prince belong to
    different principalities: thus, under one king there are different cities,
    which are governed by different laws and administrators. Now it is evident
    that men do not receive the Divine enlightenments in the same way as do the
    angels; for the angels receive them in their intelligible purity, whereas
    men receive them under sensible signs, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i).
    Therefore there must needs be a distinction between the human and the
    angelic hierarchy. In the same manner we distinguish three angelic
    hierarchies. For it was shown above (<a href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), in treating of the
    angelic knowledge, that the superior angels have a more universal knowledge
    of the truth than the inferior angels. This universal knowledge has three
    grades among the angels. For the types of things, concerning which the
    angels are enlightened, can be considered in a threefold manner. First as
    preceding from God as the first universal principle, which mode of knowledge
    belongs to the first hierarchy, connected immediately with God, and, "as it
    were, placed in the vestibule of God," as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii).
    Secondly, forasmuch as these types depend on the universal created causes
    which in some way are already multiplied; which mode belongs to the second
    hierarchy. Thirdly, forasmuch as these types are applied to particular
    things as depending on their causes; which mode belongs to the lowest
    hierarchy. All this will appear more clearly when we treat of each of the
    orders (<a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). In this way are
    the hierarchies distinguished on the part of the multitude of subjects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is clear that those err and speak against the opinion of Dionysius
    who place a hierarchy in the Divine Persons, and call it the
    "supercelestial" hierarchy. For in the Divine Persons there exists, indeed,
    a natural order, but there is no hierarchical order, for as Dionysius says
    (Coel. Hier. iii): "The hierarchical order is so directed that some be
    cleansed, enlightened, and perfected; and that others cleanse, enlighten,
    and perfect"; which far be it from us to apply to the Divine Persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection considers principality on
    the part of the ruler, inasmuch as a multitude is best ruled by one ruler,
    as the Philosopher asserts in those passages.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As regards knowing God Himself, Whom all
    see in one way---that is, in His essence---there is no hierarchical
    distinction among the angels; but there is such a distinction as regards the
    types of created things, as above explained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All men are of one species, and have one
    connatural mode of understanding; which is not the case in the angels: and
    hence the same argument does not apply to both.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are several orders in one hierarchy?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the one hierarchy there are
    not several orders. For when a definition is multiplied, the thing defined
    is also multiplied. But hierarchy is order, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier.
    iii). Therefore, if there are many orders, there is not one hierarchy only,
    but many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, different orders are different grades,
    and grades among spirits are constituted by different spiritual gifts. But
    among the angels all the spiritual gifts are common to all, for "nothing is
    possessed individually" (Sent. ii, D, ix). Therefore there are not different
    orders of angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the ecclesiastical hierarchy the
    orders are distinguished according to the actions of "cleansing,"
    "enlightening," and "perfecting." For the order of deacons is "cleansing,"
    the order of priests, is "enlightening," and of bishops "perfecting," as
    Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v). But each of the angels cleanses, enlightens,
    and perfects. Therefore there is no distinction of orders among the
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A20,21"
      >Eph. 1:20,21</a
    >) that "God has set the Man Christ above all principality and power, and
    virtue, and dominion": which are the various orders of the angels, and some
    of them belong to one hierarchy, as will be explained (<a
      href="FP108.html#FPQ108A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As explained above, one hierarchy is one
    principality---that is, one multitude ordered in one way under the rule of a
    prince. Now such a multitude would not be ordered, but confused, if there
    were not in it different orders. So the nature of a hierarchy requires
    diversity of orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This diversity of order arises from the diversity of offices and actions, as
    appears in one city where there are different orders according to the
    different actions; for there is one order of those who judge, and another of
    those who fight, and another of those who labor in the fields, and so
    forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But although one city thus comprises several orders, all may be reduced to
    three, when we consider that every multitude has a beginning, a middle, and
    an end. So in every city, a threefold order of men is to be seen, some of
    whom are supreme, as the nobles; others are the last, as the common people,
    while others hold a place between these, as the middle-class [populus
    honorabilis]. In the same way we find in each angelic hierarchy the orders
    distinguished according to their actions and offices, and all this diversity
    is reduced to three---namely, to the summit, the middle, and the base; and
    so in every hierarchy Dionysius places three orders (Coel. Hier. vi).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Order is twofold. In one way it is taken
    as the order comprehending in itself different grades; and in that way a
    hierarchy is called an order. In another way one grade is called an order;
    and in that sense the several orders of one hierarchy are so called.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All things are possessed in common by
    the angelic society, some things, however, being held more excellently by
    some than by others. Each gift is more perfectly possessed by the one who
    can communicate it, than by the one who cannot communicate it; as the hot
    thing which can communicate heat is more perfect that what is unable to give
    heat. And the more perfectly anyone can communicate a gift, the higher grade
    he occupies, as he is in the more perfect grade of mastership who can teach
    a higher science. By this similitude we can reckon the diversity of grades
    or orders among the angels, according to their different offices and
    actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The inferior angel is superior to the
    highest man of our hierarchy, according to the words, "He that is the lesser
    in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he"---namely, John the Baptist,
    than whom "there hath not risen a greater among them that are born of women"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A11">Mt. 11:11</a>).
    Hence the lesser angel of the heavenly hierarchy can not only cleanse, but
    also enlighten and perfect, and in a higher way than can the orders of our
    hierarchy. Thus the heavenly orders are not distinguished by reason of
    these, but by reason of other different acts.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are many angels in one order?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there are not many angels in one
    order. For it was shown above (<a href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), that all the angels
    are unequal. But equals belong to one order. Therefore there are not many
    angels in one order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is superfluous for a thing to be done
    by many, which can be done sufficiently by one. But that which belongs to
    one angelic office can be done sufficiently by one angel; so much more
    sufficiently than the one sun does what belongs to the office of the sun, as
    the angel is more perfect than a heavenly body. If, therefore, the orders
    are distinguished by their offices, as stated above (<a
      href="FP108.html#FPQ108A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), several angels in one order would be superfluous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was said above (OBJ 1) that all the
    angels are unequal. Therefore, if several angels (for instance, three or
    four), are of one order, the lowest one of the superior order will be more
    akin to the highest of the inferior order than with the highest of his own
    order; and thus he does not seem to be more of one order with the latter
    than with the former. Therefore there are not many angels of one order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "The Seraphim cried to one
    another" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++6%3A3"
      >Is. 6:3</a
    >). Therefore there are many angels in the one order of the Seraphim.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whoever knows anything perfectly, is able to
    distinguish its acts, powers, and nature, down to the minutest details,
    whereas he who knows a thing in an imperfect manner can only distinguish it
    in a general way, and only as regards a few points. Thus, one who knows
    natural things imperfectly, can distinguish their orders in a general way,
    placing the heavenly bodies in one order, inanimate inferior bodies in
    another, plants in another, and animals in another; whilst he who knows
    natural things perfectly, is able to distinguish different orders in the
    heavenly bodies themselves, and in each of the other orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now our knowledge of the angels is imperfect, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier.
    vi). Hence we can only distinguish the angelic offices and orders in a
    general way, so as to place many angels in one order. But if we knew the
    offices and distinctions of the angels perfectly, we should know perfectly
    that each angel has his own office and his own order among things, and much
    more so than any star, though this be hidden from us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the angels of one order are in some
    way equal in a common similitude, whereby they are placed in that order; but
    absolutely speaking they are not equal. Hence Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. x)
    that in one and the same order of angels there are those who are first,
    middle, and last.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That special distinction of orders and
    offices wherein each angel has his own office and order, is hidden from
    us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As in a surface which is partly white
    and partly black, the two parts on the borders of white and black are more
    akin as regards their position than any other two white parts, but are less
    akin in quality; so two angels who are on the boundary of two orders are
    more akin in propinquity of nature than one of them is akin to the others of
    its own order, but less akin in their fitness for similar offices, which
    fitness, indeed, extends to a definite limit.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the distinction of hierarchies and orders comes from the angelic
    nature?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the distinction of hierarchies
    and of orders is not from the nature of the angels. For hierarchy is "a
    sacred principality," and Dionysius places in its definition that it
    "approaches a resemblance to God, as far as may be" (Coel. Hier. iii). But
    sanctity and resemblance to God is in the angels by grace, and not by
    nature. Therefore the distinction of hierarchies and orders in the angels is
    by grace, and not by nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Seraphim are called "burning" or
    "kindling," as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii). This belongs to charity
    which comes not from nature but from grace; for "it is poured forth in our
    hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5"
      >Rm. 5:5</a
    >): "which is said not only of holy men, but also of the holy angels," as
    Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii). Therefore the angelic orders are not from
    nature, but from grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the ecclesiastical hierarchy is copied
    from the heavenly. But the orders among men are not from nature, but by the
    gift of grace; for it is not a natural gift for one to be a bishop, and
    another a priest, and another a deacon. Therefore neither in the angels are
    the orders from nature, but from grace only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Master says (ii, D. 9) that "an angelic
    order is a multitude of heavenly spirits, who are likened to each other by
    some gift of grace, just as they agree also in the participation of natural
    gifts." Therefore the distinction of orders among the angels is not only by
    gifts of grace, but also by gifts of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The order of government, which is the order of
    a multitude under authority, is derived from its end. Now the end of the
    angels may be considered in two ways. First, according to the faculty of
    nature, so that they may know and love God by natural knowledge and love;
    and according to their relation to this end the orders of the angels are
    distinguished by natural gifts. Secondly, the end of the angelic multitude
    can be taken from what is above their natural powers, which consists in the
    vision of the Divine Essence, and in the unchangeable fruition of His
    goodness; to which end they can reach only by grace; and hence as regards
    this end, the orders in the angels are adequately distinguished by the gifts
    of grace, but dispositively by natural gifts, forasmuch as to the angels are
    given gratuitous gifts according to the capacity of their natural gifts;
    which is not the case with men, as above explained (<a
      href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence among men the
    orders are distinguished according to the gratuitous gifts only, and not
    according to natural gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From the above the replies to the objections are evident.</p>

    Whether the orders of the angels are properly named?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the orders of the angels are
    not properly named. For all the heavenly spirits are called angels and
    heavenly virtues. But common names should not be appropriated to
    individuals. Therefore the orders of the angels and virtues are ineptly
    named.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to God alone to be Lord,
    according to the words, "Know ye that the Lord He is God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++99%3A3"
      >Ps. 99:3</a
    >). Therefore one order of the heavenly spirits is not properly called
    "Dominations."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the name "Domination" seems to imply
    government and likewise the names "Principalities" and "Powers." Therefore
    these three names do not seem to be properly applied to three orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, archangels are as it were angel princes.
    Therefore this name ought not to be given to any other order than to the
    "Principalities."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the name "Seraphim" is derived from
    ardor, which pertains to charity; and the name "Cherubim" from knowledge.
    But charity and knowledge are gifts common to all the angels. Therefore they
    ought not to be names of any particular orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Thrones are seats. But from the fact
    that God knows and loves the rational creature He is said to sit within it.
    Therefore there ought not to be any order of "Thrones" besides the
    "Cherubim" and "Seraphim." Therefore it appears that the orders of angels
    are not properly styled.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><b>On the contrary</b></i> is the authority of Holy Scripture wherein
    they are so named. For the name "Seraphim" is found in Is. 6:2; the name
    "Cherubim" in Ezech. 1 (Cf. 10:15,20); "Thrones" in Col. 1:16;
    "Dominations," "Virtues," "Powers," and "Principalities" are mentioned in
    Eph. 1:21; the name "Archangels" in the canonical epistle of St. Jude (9),
    and the name "Angels" is found in many places of Scripture.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii), in the
    names of the angelic orders it is necessary to observe that the proper name
    of each order expresses its property. Now to see what is the property of
    each order, we must consider that in coordinated things, something may be
    found in a threefold manner: by way of property, by way of excess, and by
    way of participation. A thing is said to be in another by way of property,
    if it is adequate and proportionate to its nature: by excess when an
    attribute is less than that to which it is attributed, but is possessed
    thereby in an eminent manner, as we have stated (<a
      href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="FP013.html#FPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) concerning all the
    names which are attributed to God: by participation, when an attribute is
    possessed by something not fully but partially; thus holy men are called
    gods by participation. Therefore, if anything is to be called by a name
    designating its property, it ought not to be named from what it participates
    imperfectly, nor from that which it possesses in excess, but from that which
    is adequate thereto; as, for instance, when we wish properly to name a man,
    we should call him a "rational substance," but not an "intellectual
    substance," which latter is the proper name of an angel; because simple
    intelligence belongs to an angel as a property, and to man by participation;
    nor do we call him a "sensible substance," which is the proper name of a
    brute; because sense is less than the property of a man, and belongs to man
    in a more excellent way than to other animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    So we must consider that in the angelic orders all spiritual perfections are
    common to all the angels, and that they are all more excellently in the
    superior than in the inferior angels. Further, as in these perfections there
    are grades, the superior perfection belongs to the superior order as its
    property, whereas it belongs to the inferior by participation; and
    conversely the inferior perfection belongs to the inferior order as its
    property, and to the superior by way of excess; and thus the superior order
    is denominated from the superior perfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    So in this way Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) explains the names of the orders
    accordingly as they befit the spiritual perfections they signify. Gregory,
    on the other hand, in expounding these names (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.) seems to
    regard more the exterior ministrations; for he says that "angels are so
    called as announcing the least things; and the archangels in the greatest;
    by the virtues miracles are wrought; by the powers hostile powers are
    repulsed; and the principalities preside over the good spirits
    themselves."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Angel means "messenger." So all the
    heavenly spirits, so far as they make known Divine things, are called
    "angels." But the superior angels enjoy a certain excellence, as regards
    this manifestation, from which the superior orders are denominated. The
    lowest order of angels possess no excellence above the common manifestation;
    and therefore it is denominated from manifestation only; and thus the common
    name remains as it were proper to the lowest order, as Dionysius says (Coel.
    Hier. v). Or we may say that the lowest order can be specially called the
    order of "angels," forasmuch as they announce things to us immediately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    "Virtue" can be taken in two ways. First, commonly, considered as the medium
    between the essence and the operation, and in that sense all the heavenly
    spirits are called heavenly virtues, as also "heavenly essences." Secondly,
    as meaning a certain excellence of strength; and thus it is the proper name
    of an angelic order. Hence Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the "name
    'virtues' signifies a certain virile and immovable strength"; first, in
    regard of those Divine operations which befit them; secondly, in regard to
    receiving Divine gifts. Thus it signifies that they undertake fearlessly the
    Divine behests appointed to them; and this seems to imply strength of
    mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii):
    "Dominion is attributed to God in a special manner, by way of excess: but
    the Divine word gives the more illustrious heavenly princes the name of Lord
    by participation, through whom the inferior angels receive the Divine
    gifts." Hence Dionysius also states (Coel. Hier. viii) that the name
    "Domination" means first "a certain liberty, free from servile condition and
    common subjection, such as that of plebeians, and from tyrannical
    oppression," endured sometimes even by the great. Secondly, it signifies "a
    certain rigid and inflexible supremacy which does not bend to any servile
    act, or to the act, of those who are subject to or oppressed by tyrants."
    Thirdly, it signifies "the desire and participation of the true dominion
    which belongs to God." Likewise the name of each order signifies the
    participation of what belongs to God; as the name "Virtues" signifies the
    participation of the Divine virtue; and the same principle applies to the
    rest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The names "Domination," "Power," and
    "Principality" belong to government in different ways. The place of a lord
    is only to prescribe what is to be done. So Gregory says (Hom. xxiv in
    Evang.), that "some companies of the angels, because others are subject to
    obedience to them, are called dominations." The name "Power" points out a
    kind of order, according to what the Apostle says, "He that resisteth the
    power, resisteth the ordination of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A2"
      >Rm. 13:2</a
    >). And so Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the name "Power" signifies
    a kind of ordination both as regards the reception of Divine things, and as
    regards the Divine actions performed by superiors towards inferiors by
    leading them to things above. Therefore, to the order of "Powers" it belongs
    to regulate what is to be done by those who are subject to them. To preside
    [principari] as Gregory says (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) is "to be first among
    others," as being first in carrying out what is ordered to be done. And so
    Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ix) that the name of "Principalities" signifies
    "one who leads in a sacred order." For those who lead others, being first
    among them, are properly called "princes," according to the words, "Princes
    went before joined with singers" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++67%3A26"
      >Ps. 67:26</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The "Archangels," according to Dionysius
    (Coel. Hier. ix), are between the "Principalities" and the "Angels." A
    medium compared to one extreme seems like the other, as participating in the
    nature of both extremes; thus tepid seems cold compared to hot, and hot
    compared to cold. So the "Archangels" are called the "angel princes";
    forasmuch as they are princes as regards the "Angels," and angels as regards
    the Principalities. But according to Gregory (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) they are
    called "Archangels," because they preside over the one order of the
    "Angels"; as it were, announcing greater things: and the "Principalities"
    are so called as presiding over all the heavenly "Virtues" who fulfil the
    Divine commands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The name "Seraphim" does not come from
    charity only, but from the excess of charity, expressed by the word ardor or
    fire. Hence Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds the name "Seraphim"
    according to the properties of fire, containing an excess of heat. Now in
    fire we may consider three things. First, the movement which is upwards and
    continuous. This signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards God.
    Secondly, the active force which is "heat," which is not found in fire
    simply, but exists with a certain sharpness, as being of most penetrating
    action, and reaching even to the smallest things, and as it were, with
    superabundant fervor; whereby is signified the action of these angels,
    exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them, rousing them to a
    like fervor, and cleansing them wholly by their heat. Thirdly we consider in
    fire the quality of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these
    angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they also
    perfectly enlighten others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same way the name "Cherubim" comes from a certain excess of
    knowledge; hence it is interpreted "fulness of knowledge," which Dionysius
    (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds in regard to four things: the perfect vision of
    God; the full reception of the Divine Light; their contemplation in God of
    the beauty of the Divine order; and in regard to the fact that possessing
    this knowledge fully, they pour it forth copiously upon others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The order of the "Thrones" excels the
    inferior orders as having an immediate knowledge of the types of the Divine
    works; whereas the "Cherubim" have the excellence of knowledge and the
    "Seraphim" the excellence of ardor. And although these two excellent
    attributes include the third, yet the gift belonging to the "Thrones" does
    not include the other two; and so the order of the "Thrones" is
    distinguished from the orders of the "Cherubim" and the "Seraphim." For it
    is a common rule in all things that the excellence of the inferior is
    contained in the superior, but not conversely. But Dionysius (Coel. Hier.
    vii) explains the name "Thrones" by its relation to material seats, in which
    we may consider four things. First, the site; because seats are raised above
    the earth, and to the angels who are called "Thrones" are raised up to the
    immediate knowledge of the types of things in God. Secondly, because in
    material seats is displayed strength, forasmuch as a person sits firmly on
    them. But here the reverse is the case; for the angels themselves are made
    firm by God. Thirdly, because the seat receives him who sits thereon, and he
    can be carried thereupon; and so the angels receive God in themselves, and
    in a certain way bear Him to the inferior creatures. Fourthly, because in
    its shape, a seat is open on one side to receive the sitter; and thus are
    the angels promptly open to receive God and to serve Him.<br />

    Whether the grades of the orders are properly assigned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the grades of the orders are
    not properly assigned. For the order of prelates is the highest. But the
    names of "Dominations," "Principalities," and "Powers" of themselves imply
    prelacy. Therefore these orders ought not to be supreme.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the nearer an order is to God, the
    higher it is. But the order of "Thrones" is the nearest to God; for nothing
    is nearer to the sitter than the seat. Therefore the order of the "Thrones"
    is the highest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, knowledge comes before love, and
    intellect is higher than will. Therefore the order of "Cherubim" seems to be
    higher than the "Seraphim."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Gregory (Hom. xxiv in Evang.) places the
    "Principalities" above the "Powers." These therefore are not placed
    immediately above the Archangels, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ix).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii), places in the
    highest hierarchy the "Seraphim" as the first, the "Cherubim" as the middle,
    the "Thrones" as the last; in the middle hierarchy he places the
    "Dominations," as the first, the "Virtues" in the middle, the "Powers" last;
    in the lowest hierarchy the "Principalities" first, then the "Archangels,"
    and lastly the "Angels."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The grades of the angelic orders are assigned
    by Gregory (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) and Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii), who agree as
    regards all except the "Principalities" and "Virtues." For Dionysius places
    the "Virtues" beneath the "Dominations," and above the "Powers"; the
    "Principalities" beneath the "Powers" and above the "Archangels." Gregory,
    however, places the "Principalities" between the "Dominations" and the
    "Powers"; and the "Virtues" between the "Powers" and the "Archangels." Each
    of these placings may claim authority from the words of the Apostle, who (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A20,21"
      >Eph. 1:20,21</a
    >) enumerates the middle orders, beginning from the lowest saying that "God
    set Him," i.e. Christ, "on His right hand in the heavenly places above all
    Principality and Power, and Virtue, and Dominion." Here he places "Virtues"
    between "Powers" and "Dominations," according to the placing of Dionysius.
    Writing however to the Colossians (1:16), numbering the same orders from the
    highest, he says: "Whether Thrones, or Dominations, or Principalities, or
    Powers, all things were created by Him and in Him." Here he places the
    "Principalities" between "Dominations" and "Powers," as does also
    Gregory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us then first examine the reason for the ordering of Dionysius, in which
    we see, that, as said above (<a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the highest hierarchy contemplates the ideas of things in God Himself;
    the second in the universal causes; and third in their application to
    particular effects. And because God is the end not only of the angelic
    ministrations, but also of the whole creation, it belongs to the first
    hierarchy to consider the end; to the middle one belongs the universal
    disposition of what is to be done; and to the last belongs the application
    of this disposition to the effect, which is the carrying out of the work;
    for it is clear that these three things exist in every kind of operation. So
    Dionysius, considering the properties of the orders as derived from their
    names, places in the first hierarchy those orders the names of which are
    taken from their relation to God, the "Seraphim," "Cherubim," and "Thrones";
    and he places in the middle hierarchy those orders whose names denote a
    certain kind of common government or disposition---the "Dominations,"
    "Virtues," and "Powers"; and he places in the third hierarchy the orders
    whose names denote the execution of the work, the "Principalities,"
    "Angels," and "Archangels."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards the end, three things may be considered. For firstly we consider
    the end; then we acquire perfect knowledge of the end; thirdly, we fix our
    intention on the end; of which the second is an addition to the first, and
    the third an addition to both. And because God is the end of creatures, as
    the leader is the end of an army, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. xii, Did.
    xi, 10); so a somewhat similar order may be seen in human affairs. For there
    are some who enjoy the dignity of being able with familiarity to approach
    the king or leader; others in addition are privileged to know his secrets;
    and others above these ever abide with him, in a close union. According to
    this similitude, we can understand the disposition in the orders of the
    first hierarchy; for the "Thrones" are raised up so as to be the familiar
    recipients of God in themselves, in the sense of knowing immediately the
    types of things in Himself; and this is proper to the whole of the first
    hierarchy. The "Cherubim" know the Divine secrets supereminently; and the
    "Seraphim" excel in what is the supreme excellence of all, in being united
    to God Himself; and all this in such a manner that the whole of this
    hierarchy can be called the "Thrones"; as, from what is common to all the
    heavenly spirits together, they are all called "Angels."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards government, three things are comprised therein, the first of
    which is to appoint those things which are to be done, and this belongs to
    the "Dominations"; the second is to give the power of carrying out what is
    to be done, which belongs to the "Virtues"; the third is to order how what
    has been commanded or decided to be done can be carried out by others, which
    belongs to the "Powers."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The execution of the angelic ministrations consists in announcing Divine
    things. Now in the execution of any action there are beginners and leaders;
    as in singing, the precentors; and in war, generals and officers; this
    belongs to the "Principalities." There are others who simply execute what is
    to be done; and these are the "Angels." Others hold a middle place; and
    these are the "Archangels," as above explained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This explanation of the orders is quite a reasonable one. For the highest in
    an inferior order always has affinity to the lowest in the higher order; as
    the lowest animals are near to the plants. Now the first order is that of
    the Divine Persons, which terminates in the Holy Ghost, Who is Love
    proceeding, with Whom the highest order of the first hierarchy has affinity,
    denominated as it is from the fire of love. The lowest order of the first
    hierarchy is that of the "Thrones," who in their own order are akin to the
    "Dominations"; for the "Thrones," according to Gregory (Hom. xxiv in Ev.),
    are so called "because through them God accomplishes His judgments," since
    they are enlightened by Him in a manner adapted to the immediate
    enlightening of the second hierarchy, to which belongs the disposition of
    the Divine ministrations. The order of the "Powers" is akin to the order of
    the "Principalities"; for as it belongs to the "Powers" to impose order on
    those subject to them, this ordering is plainly shown at once in the name of
    "Principalities," who, as presiding over the government of peoples and
    kingdoms (which occupies the first and principal place in the Divine
    ministrations), are the first in the execution thereof; "for the good of a
    nation is more divine than the good of one man" (Ethic. i, 2); and hence it
    is written, "The prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++10%3A13"
      >Dan. 10:13</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The disposition of the orders which is mentioned by Gregory is also
    reasonable. For since the "Dominations" appoint and order what belongs to
    the Divine ministrations, the orders subject to them are arranged according
    to the disposition of those things in which the Divine ministrations are
    effected. Still, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii), "bodies are ruled in a
    certain order; the inferior by the superior; and all of them by the
    spiritual creature, and the bad spirit by the good spirit." So the first
    order after the "Dominations" is called that of "Principalities," who rule
    even over good spirits; then the "Powers," who coerce the evil spirits; even
    as evil-doers are coerced by earthly powers, as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A3,4"
      >Rm. 13:3,4</a
    >). After these come the "Virtues," which have power over corporeal nature
    in the working of miracles; after these are the "Angels" and the
    "Archangels," who announce to men either great things above reason, or small
    things within the purview of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The angel's subjection to God is greater
    than their presiding over inferior things; and the latter is derived from
    the former. Thus the orders which derive their name from presiding are not
    the first and highest; but rather the orders deriving their name from their
    nearness and relation to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The nearness to God designated by the
    name of the "Thrones," belongs also to the "Cherubim" and "Seraphim," and in
    a more excellent way, as above explained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As above explained (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), knowledge takes place
    accordingly as the thing known is in the knower; but love as the lover is
    united to the object loved. Now higher things are in a nobler way in
    themselves than in lower things; whereas lower things are in higher things
    in a nobler way than they are in themselves. Therefore to know lower things
    is better than to love them; and to love the higher things, God above all,
    is better than to know them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A careful comparison will show that
    little or no difference exists in reality between the dispositions of the
    orders according to Dionysius and Gregory. For Gregory expounds the name
    "Principalities" from their "presiding over good spirits," which also agrees
    with the "Virtues" accordingly as this name expressed a certain strength,
    giving efficacy to the inferior spirits in the execution of the Divine
    ministrations. Again, according to Gregory, the "Virtues" seem to be the
    same as "Principalities" of Dionysius. For to work miracles holds the first
    place in the Divine ministrations; since thereby the way is prepared for the
    announcements of the "Archangels" and the "Angels."<br />

    Whether the orders will outlast the Day of Judgment?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the orders of angels will not
    outlast the Day of Judgment. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A24"
      >1 Cor. 15:24</a
    >), that Christ will "bring to naught all principality and power, when He
    shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father," and this will be
    in the final consummation. Therefore for the same reason all others will be
    abolished in that state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to the office of the angelic orders it
    belongs to cleanse, enlighten, and perfect. But after the Day of Judgment
    one angel will not cleanse, enlighten, or perfect another, because they will
    not advance any more in knowledge. Therefore the angelic orders would remain
    for no purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says of the angels (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++1%3A14"
      >Heb. 1:14</a
    >), that "they are all ministering spirits, sent to minister to them who
    shall receive the inheritance of salvation"; whence it appears that the
    angelic offices are ordered for the purpose of leading men to salvation. But
    all the elect are in pursuit of salvation until the Day of Judgment.
    Therefore the angelic offices and orders will not outlast the Day of
    Judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Judges 5:20): "Stars remaining
    in their order and courses," which is applied to the angels. Therefore the
    angels will ever remain in their orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the angelic orders we may consider two
    things; the distinction of grades, and the execution of their offices. The
    distinction of grades among the angels takes place according to the
    difference of grace and nature, as above explained (<a
      href="FP108.html#FPQ108A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >); and these differences will ever remain in the angels; for these
    differences of natures cannot be taken from them unless they themselves be
    corrupted. The difference of glory will also ever remain in them according
    to the difference of preceding merit. As to the execution of the angelic
    offices, it will to a certain degree remain after the Day of Judgment, and
    to a certain degree will cease. It will cease accordingly as their offices
    are directed towards leading others to their end; but it will remain,
    accordingly as it agrees with the attainment of the end. Thus also the
    various ranks of soldiers have different duties to perform in battle and in
    triumph.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The principalities and powers will come
    to an end in that final consummation as regards their office of leading
    others to their end; because when the end is attained, it is no longer
    necessary to tend towards the end. This is clear from the words of the
    Apostle, "When He shall have delivered up the kingdom of God and the
    Father," i.e. when He shall have led the faithful to the enjoyment of God
    Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The actions of angels over the other
    angels are to be considered according to a likeness to our own intellectual
    actions. In ourselves we find many intellectual actions which are ordered
    according to the order of cause and effect; as when we gradually arrive at
    one conclusion by many middle terms. Now it is manifest that the knowledge
    of a conclusion depends on all the preceding middle terms not only in the
    new acquisition of knowledge, but also as regards the keeping of the
    knowledge acquired. A proof of this is that when anyone forgets any of the
    preceding middle terms he can have opinion or belief about the conclusion,
    but not knowledge; as he is ignorant of the order of the causes. So, since
    the inferior angels know the types of the Divine works by the light of the
    superior angels, their knowledge depends on the light of the superior angels
    not only as regards the acquisition of knowledge, but also as regards the
    preserving of the knowledge possessed. So, although after the Judgment the
    inferior angels will not progress in the knowledge of some things, still
    this will not prevent their being enlightened by the superior angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although after the Day of Judgment men
    will not be led any more to salvation by the ministry of the angels, still
    those who are already saved will be enlightened through the angelic
    ministry.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether men are taken up into the angelic orders?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men are not taken up into the
    orders of the angels. For the human hierarchy is stationed beneath the
    lowest heavenly hierarchy, as the lowest under the middle hierarchy and the
    middle beneath the first. But the angels of the lowest hierarchy are never
    transferred into the middle, or the first. Therefore neither are men
    transferred to the angelic orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, certain offices belong to the orders of
    the angels, as to guard, to work miracles, to coerce the demons, and the
    like; which do not appear to belong to the souls of the saints. Therefore
    they are not transferred to the angelic orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the good angels lead on to good, so
    do the demons to what is evil. But it is erroneous to say that the souls of
    bad men are changed into demons; for Chrysostom rejects this (Hom. xxviii in
    Matt.). Therefore it does not seem that the souls of the saints will be
    transferred to the orders of angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Lord says of the saints that, "they will
    be as the angels of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >). I answer that, As above explained (<a href="FP108.html#FPQ108ATHEP1"
      >Articles [4]</a
    >,7), the orders of the angels are distinguished according to the conditions
    of nature and according to the gifts of grace. Considered only as regards
    the grade of nature, men can in no way be assumed into the angelic orders;
    for the natural distinction will always remain. In view of this distinction,
    some asserted that men can in no way be transferred to an equality with the
    angels; but this is erroneous, contradicting as it does the promise of
    Christ saying that the children of the resurrection will be equal to the
    angels in heaven (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++20%3A36"
      >Lk. 20:36</a
    >). For whatever belongs to nature is the material part of an order; whilst
    that which perfects is from grace which depends on the liberality of God,
    and not on the order of nature. Therefore by the gift of grace men can merit
    glory in such a degree as to be equal to the angels, in each of the angelic
    grades; and this implies that men are taken up into the orders of the
    angels. Some, however, say that not all who are saved are assumed into the
    angelic orders, but only virgins or the perfect; and that the other will
    constitute their own order, as it were, corresponding to the whole society
    of the angels. But this is against what Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9),
    that "there will not be two societies of men and angels, but only one;
    because the beatitude of all is to cleave to God alone."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Grace is given to the angels in
    proportion to their natural gifts. This, however, does not apply to men, as
    above explained (<a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). So, as the inferior
    angels cannot be transferred to the natural grade of the superior, neither
    can they be transferred to the superior grade of grace; whereas men can
    ascend to the grade of grace, but not of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angels according to the order of
    nature are between us and God; and therefore according to the common law not
    only human affairs are administered by them, but also all corporeal matters.
    But holy men even after this life are of the same nature with ourselves; and
    hence according to the common law they do not administer human affairs, "nor
    do they interfere in the things of the living," as Augustine says (De cura
    pro mortuis xiii, xvi). Still, by a certain special dispensation it is
    sometimes granted to some of the saints to exercise these offices; by
    working miracles, by coercing the demons, or by doing something of that
    kind, as Augustine says (De cura pro mortuis xvi).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not erroneous to say that men are
    transferred to the penalty of demons; but some erroneously stated that the
    demons are nothing but souls of the dead; and it is this that Chrysostom
    rejects.<br />
