  <h3 align="left">
    Whether our intellect understands corporeal and material things by
    abstraction from phantasms?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect does not
    understand corporeal and material things by abstraction from the phantasms.
    For the intellect is false if it understands an object otherwise than as it
    really is. Now the forms of material things do not exist as abstracted from
    the particular things represented by the phantasms. Therefore, if we
    understand material things by abstraction of the species from the phantasm,
    there will be error in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, material things are those natural things
    which include matter in their definition. But nothing can be understood
    apart from that which enters into its definition. Therefore material things
    cannot be understood apart from matter. Now matter is the principle of
    individualization. Therefore material things cannot be understood by
    abstraction of the universal from the particular, which is the process
    whereby the intelligible species is abstracted from the phantasm.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7)
    that the phantasm is to the intellectual soul what color is to the sight.
    But seeing is not caused by abstraction of species from color, but by color
    impressing itself on the sight. Therefore neither does the act of
    understanding take place by abstraction of something from the phantasm, but
    by the phantasm impressing itself on the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 5)
    there are two things in the intellectual soul---the passive intellect and
    the active intellect. But it does not belong to the passive intellect to
    abstract the intelligible species from the phantasm, but to receive them
    when abstracted. Neither does it seem to be the function of the active
    intellect, which is related to the phantasm, as light is to color; since
    light does not abstract anything from color, but rather streams on to it.
    Therefore in no way do we understand by abstraction from phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 7) says
    that "the intellect understands the species in the phantasm"; and not,
    therefore, by abstraction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 4) that
    "things are intelligible in proportion as they are separate from matter."
    Therefore material things must needs be understood according as they are
    abstracted from matter and from material images, namely, phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1"
      >Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the object of
    knowledge is proportionate to the power of knowledge. Now there are three
    grades of the cognitive powers. For one cognitive power, namely, the sense,
    is the act of a corporeal organ. And therefore the object of every sensitive
    power is a form as existing in corporeal matter. And since such matter is
    the principle of individuality, therefore every power of the sensitive part
    can only have knowledge of the individual. There is another grade of
    cognitive power which is neither the act of a corporeal organ, nor in any
    way connected with corporeal matter; such is the angelic intellect, the
    object of whose cognitive power is therefore a form existing apart from
    matter: for though angels know material things, yet they do not know them
    save in something immaterial, namely, either in themselves or in God. But
    the human intellect holds a middle place: for it is not the act of an organ;
    yet it is a power of the soul which is the form the body, as is clear from
    what we have said above (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And therefore it is
    proper to it to know a form existing individually in corporeal matter, but
    not as existing in this individual matter. But to know what is in individual
    matter, not as existing in such matter, is to abstract the form from
    individual matter which is represented by the phantasms. Therefore we must
    needs say that our intellect understands material things by abstracting from
    the phantasms; and through material things thus considered we acquire some
    knowledge of immaterial things, just as, on the contrary, angels know
    material things through the immaterial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But Plato, considering only the immateriality of the human intellect, and
    not its being in a way united to the body, held that the objects of the
    intellect are separate ideas; and that we understand not by abstraction, but
    by participating things abstract, as stated above (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1"
      >Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Abstraction may occur in two ways:
    First, by way of composition and division; thus we may understand that one
    thing does not exist in some other, or that it is separate therefrom.
    Secondly, by way of simple and absolute consideration; thus we understand
    one thing without considering the other. Thus for the intellect to abstract
    one from another things which are not really abstract from one another,
    does, in the first mode of abstraction, imply falsehood. But, in the second
    mode of abstraction, for the intellect to abstract things which are not
    really abstract from one another, does not involve falsehood, as clearly
    appears in the case of the senses. For if we understood or said that color
    is not in a colored body, or that it is separate from it, there would be
    error in this opinion or assertion. But if we consider color and its
    properties, without reference to the apple which is colored; or if we
    express in word what we thus understand, there is no error in such an
    opinion or assertion, because an apple is not essential to color, and
    therefore color can be understood independently of the apple. Likewise, the
    things which belong to the species of a material thing, such as a stone, or
    a man, or a horse, can be thought of apart from the individualizing
    principles which do not belong to the notion of the species. This is what we
    mean by abstracting the universal from the particular, or the intelligible
    species from the phantasm; that is, by considering the nature of the species
    apart from its individual qualities represented by the phantasms. If,
    therefore, the intellect is said to be false when it understands a thing
    otherwise than as it is, that is so, if the word "otherwise" refers to the
    thing understood; for the intellect is false when it understands a thing
    otherwise than as it is; and so the intellect would be false if it
    abstracted the species of a stone from its matter in such a way as to regard
    the species as not existing in matter, as Plato held. But it is not so, if
    the word "otherwise" be taken as referring to the one who understands. For
    it is quite true that the mode of understanding, in one who understands, is
    not the same as the mode of a thing in existing: since the thing understood
    is immaterially in the one who understands, according to the mode of the
    intellect, and not materially, according to the mode of a material thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some have thought that the species of a
    natural thing is a form only, and that matter is not part of the species. If
    that were so, matter would not enter into the definition of natural things.
    Therefore it must be said otherwise, that matter is twofold, common, and
    "signate" or individual; common, such as flesh and bone; and individual, as
    this flesh and these bones. The intellect therefore abstracts the species of
    a natural thing from the individual sensible matter, but not from the common
    sensible matter; for example, it abstracts the species of man from "this
    flesh and these bones," which do not belong to the species as such, but to
    the individual (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 10), and need not be considered in the
    species: whereas the species of man cannot be abstracted by the intellect
    form "flesh and bones."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Mathematical species, however, can be abstracted by the intellect from
    sensible matter, not only from individual, but also from common matter; not
    from common intelligible matter, but only from individual matter. For
    sensible matter is corporeal matter as subject to sensible qualities, such
    as being cold or hot, hard or soft, and the like: while intelligible matter
    is substance as subject to quantity. Now it is manifest that quantity is in
    substance before other sensible qualities are. Hence quantities, such as
    number, dimension, and figures, which are the terminations of quantity, can
    be considered apart from sensible qualities; and this is to abstract them
    from sensible matter; but they cannot be considered without understanding
    the substance which is subject to the quantity; for that would be to
    abstract them from common intelligible matter. Yet they can be considered
    apart from this or that substance; for that is to abstract them from
    individual intelligible matter. But some things can be abstracted even from
    common intelligible matter, such as "being," "unity," "power," "act," and
    the like; all these can exist without matter, as is plain regarding
    immaterial things. Because Plato failed to consider the twofold kind of
    abstraction, as above explained (ad 1), he held that all those things which
    we have stated to be abstracted by the intellect, are abstract in
    reality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Colors, as being in individual corporeal
    matter, have the same mode of existence as the power of sight: therefore
    they can impress their own image on the eye. But phantasms, since they are
    images of individuals, and exist in corporeal organs, have not the same mode
    of existence as the human intellect, and therefore have not the power of
    themselves to make an impression on the passive intellect. This is done by
    the power of the active intellect which by turning towards the phantasm
    produces in the passive intellect a certain likeness which represents, as to
    its specific conditions only, the thing reflected in the phantasm. It is
    thus that the intelligible species is said to be abstracted from the
    phantasm; not that the identical form which previously was in the phantasm
    is subsequently in the passive intellect, as a body transferred from one
    place to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Not only does the active intellect throw
    light on the phantasm: it does more; by its own power it abstracts the
    intelligible species from the phantasm. It throws light on the phantasm,
    because, just as the sensitive part acquires a greater power by its
    conjunction with the intellectual part, so by the power of the active
    intellect the phantasms are made more fit for the abstraction therefrom of
    intelligible intentions. Furthermore, the active intellect abstracts the
    intelligible species from the phantasm, forasmuch as by the power of the
    active intellect we are able to disregard the conditions of individuality,
    and to take into our consideration the specific nature, the image of which
    informs the passive intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Our intellect both abstracts the
    intelligible species from the phantasms, inasmuch as it considers the
    natures of things in universal, and, nevertheless, understands these natures
    in the phantasms since it cannot understand even the things of which it
    abstracts the species, without turning to the phantasms, as we have said
    above (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,

    Whether the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm is related to
    our intellect as that which is understood?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intelligible species
    abstracted from the phantasm is related to our intellect as that which is
    understood. For the understood in act is in the one who understands: since
    the understood in act is the intellect itself in act. But nothing of what is
    understood is in the intellect actually understanding, save the abstracted
    intelligible species. Therefore this species is what is actually
    understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is actually understood must be in
    something; else it would be nothing. But it is not in something outside the
    soul: for, since what is outside the soul is material, nothing therein can
    be actually understood. Therefore what is actually understood is in the
    intellect. Consequently it can be nothing else than the aforesaid
    intelligible species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (1 Peri Herm. i)
    that "words are signs of the passions in the soul." But words signify the
    things understood, for we express by word what we understand. Therefore
    these passions of the soul---viz. the intelligible species, are what is
    actually understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The intelligible species is to the intellect
    what the sensible image is to the sense. But the sensible image is not what
    is perceived, but rather that by which sense perceives. Therefore the
    intelligible species is not what is actually understood, but that by which
    the intellect understands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have asserted that our intellectual
    faculties know only the impression made on them; as, for example, that sense
    is cognizant only of the impression made on its own organ. According to this
    theory, the intellect understands only its own impression, namely, the
    intelligible species which it has received, so that this species is what is
    understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This is, however, manifestly false for two reasons. First, because the
    things we understand are the objects of science; therefore if what we
    understand is merely the intelligible species in the soul, it would follow
    that every science would not be concerned with objects outside the soul, but
    only with the intelligible species within the soul; thus, according to the
    teaching of the Platonists all science is about ideas, which they held to be
    actually understood [*Question [84], Article [1]]. Secondly, it is untrue,
    because it would lead to the opinion of the ancients who maintained that
    "whatever seems, is true" [*Aristotle, Metaph. iii. 5], and that
    consequently contradictories are true simultaneously. For if the faculty
    knows its own impression only, it can judge of that only. Now a thing seems
    according to the impression made on the cognitive faculty. Consequently the
    cognitive faculty will always judge of its own impression as such; and so
    every judgment will be true: for instance, if taste perceived only its own
    impression, when anyone with a healthy taste perceives that honey is sweet,
    he would judge truly; and if anyone with a corrupt taste perceives that
    honey is bitter, this would be equally true; for each would judge according
    to the impression on his taste. Thus every opinion would be equally true; in
    fact, every sort of apprehension.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it must be said that the intelligible species is related to the
    intellect as that by which it understands: which is proved thus. There is a
    twofold action (Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8), one which remains in the agent;
    for instance, to see and to understand; and another which passes into an
    external object; for instance, to heat and to cut; and each of these actions
    proceeds in virtue of some form. And as the form from which proceeds an act
    tending to something external is the likeness of the object of the action,
    as heat in the heater is a likeness of the thing heated; so the form from
    which proceeds an action remaining in the agent is the likeness of the
    object. Hence that by which the sight sees is the likeness of the visible
    thing; and the likeness of the thing understood, that is, the intelligible
    species, is the form by which the intellect understands. But since the
    intellect reflects upon itself, by such reflection it understands both its
    own act of intelligence, and the species by which it understands. Thus the
    intelligible species is that which is understood secondarily; but that which
    is primarily understood is the object, of which the species is the likeness.
    This also appears from the opinion of the ancient philosophers, who said
    that "like is known by like." For they said that the soul knows the earth
    outside itself, by the earth within itself; and so of the rest. If,
    therefore, we take the species of the earth instead of the earth, according
    to Aristotle (De Anima iii, 8), who says "that a stone is not in the soul,
    but only the likeness of the stone"; it follows that the soul knows external
    things by means of its intelligible species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The thing understood is in the intellect
    by its own likeness; and it is in this sense that we say that the thing
    actually understood is the intellect in act, because the likeness of the
    thing understood is the form of the intellect, as the likeness of a sensible
    thing is the form of the sense in act. Hence it does not follow that the
    intelligible species abstracted is what is actually understood; but rather
    that it is the likeness thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In these words "the thing actually
    understood" there is a double implication---the thing which is understood,
    and the fact that it is understood. In like manner the words "abstract
    universal" imply two things, the nature of a thing and its abstraction or
    universality. Therefore the nature itself to which it occurs to be
    understood, abstracted or considered as universal is only in individuals;
    but that it is understood, abstracted or considered as universal is in the
    intellect. We see something similar to this is in the senses. For the sight
    sees the color of the apple apart from its smell. If therefore it be asked
    where is the color which is seen apart from the smell, it is quite clear
    that the color which is seen is only in the apple: but that it be perceived
    apart from the smell, this is owing to the sight, forasmuch as the faculty
    of sight receives the likeness of color and not of smell. In like manner
    humanity understood is only in this or that man; but that humanity be
    apprehended without conditions of individuality, that is, that it be
    abstracted and consequently considered as universal, occurs to humanity
    inasmuch as it is brought under the consideration of the intellect, in which
    there is a likeness of the specific nature, but not of the principles of
    individuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two operations in the
    sensitive part. One, in regard of impression only, and thus the operation of
    the senses takes place by the senses being impressed by the sensible. The
    other is formation, inasmuch as the imagination forms for itself an image of
    an absent thing, or even of something never seen. Both of these operations
    are found in the intellect. For in the first place there is the passion of
    the passive intellect as informed by the intelligible species; and then the
    passive intellect thus informed forms a definition, or a division, or a
    composition, expressed by a word. Wherefore the concept conveyed by a word
    is its definition; and a proposition conveys the intellect's division or
    composition. Words do not therefore signify the intelligible species
    themselves; but that which the intellect forms for itself for the purpose of
    judging of external things.<br />

    Whether the more universal is first in our intellectual cognition?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the more universal is not
    first in our intellectual cognition. For what is first and more known in its
    own nature, is secondarily and less known in relation to ourselves. But
    universals come first as regards their nature, because "that is first which
    does not involve the existence of its correlative" (Categor. ix). Therefore
    the universals are secondarily known as regards our intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the composition precedes the simple in
    relation to us. But universals are the more simple. Therefore they are known
    secondarily by us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Phys. i, 1), that
    the object defined comes in our knowledge before the parts of its
    definition. But the more universal is part of the definition of the less
    universal, as "animal" is part of the definition of "man." Therefore the
    universals are secondarily known by us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we know causes and principles by their
    effects. But universals are principles. Therefore universals are secondarily
    known by us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "We must proceed from the universal to the
    singular and individual" (Phys. i, 1)<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In our knowledge there are two things to be
    considered. First, that intellectual knowledge in some degree arises from
    sensible knowledge: and, because sense has singular and individual things
    for its object, and intellect has the universal for its object, it follows
    that our knowledge of the former comes before our knowledge of the latter.
    Secondly, we must consider that our intellect proceeds from a state of
    potentiality to a state of actuality; and every power thus proceeding from
    potentiality to actuality comes first to an incomplete act, which is the
    medium between potentiality and actuality, before accomplishing the perfect
    act. The perfect act of the intellect is complete knowledge, when the object
    is distinctly and determinately known; whereas the incomplete act is
    imperfect knowledge, when the object is known indistinctly, and as it were
    confusedly. A thing thus imperfectly known, is known partly in act and
    partly in potentiality, and hence the Philosopher says (Phys. i, 1), that
    "what is manifest and certain is known to us at first confusedly; afterwards
    we know it by distinguishing its principles and elements." Now it is evident
    that to know an object that comprises many things, without proper knowledge
    of each thing contained in it, is to know that thing confusedly. In this way
    we can have knowledge not only of the universal whole, which contains parts
    potentially, but also of the integral whole; for each whole can be known
    confusedly, without its parts being known. But to know distinctly what is
    contained in the universal whole is to know the less common, as to "animal"
    indistinctly is to know it as "animal"; whereas to know "animal" distinctly
    is know it as "rational" or "irrational animal," that is, to know a man or a
    lion: therefore our intellect knows "animal" before it knows man; and the
    same reason holds in comparing any more universal idea with the less
    universal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, as sense, like the intellect, proceeds from potentiality to act,
    the same order of knowledge appears in the senses. For by sense we judge of
    the more common before the less common, in reference both to place and time;
    in reference to place, when a thing is seen afar off it is seen to be a body
    before it is seen to be an animal; and to be an animal before it is seen to
    be a man, and to be a man before it seen to be Socrates or Plato; and the
    same is true as regards time, for a child can distinguish man from not man
    before he distinguishes this man from that, and therefore "children at first
    call men fathers, and later on distinguish each one from the others" (Phys.
    i, 1). The reason of this is clear: because he who knows a thing
    indistinctly is in a state of potentiality as regards its principle of
    distinction; as he who knows "genus" is in a state of potentiality as
    regards "difference." Thus it is evident that indistinct knowledge is midway
    between potentiality and act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore conclude that knowledge of the singular and individual is
    prior, as regards us, to the knowledge of the universal; as sensible
    knowledge is prior to intellectual knowledge. But in both sense and
    intellect the knowledge of the more common precedes the knowledge of the
    less common.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The universal can be considered in two
    ways. First, the universal nature may be considered together with the
    intention of universality. And since the intention of universality---viz.
    the relation of one and the same to many---is due to intellectual
    abstraction, the universal thus considered is a secondary consideration.
    Hence it is said (De Anima i, 1) that the "universal animal is either
    nothing or something secondary." But according to Plato, who held that
    universals are subsistent, the universal considered thus would be prior to
    the particular, for the latter, according to him, are mere participations of
    the subsistent universals which he called ideas.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the universal can be considered in the nature itself---for
    instance, animality or humanity as existing in the individual. And thus we
    must distinguish two orders of nature: one, by way of generation and time;
    and thus the imperfect and the potential come first. In this way the more
    common comes first in the order of nature; as appears clearly in the
    generation of man and animal; for "the animal is generated before man," as
    the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal ii, 3). The other order is the order
    of perfection or of the intention of nature: for instance, act considered
    absolutely is naturally prior to potentiality, and the perfect to the
    imperfect: thus the less common comes naturally before the more common; as
    man comes before animal. For the intention of nature does not stop at the
    generation of animal but goes on to the generation of man.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The more common universal may be
    compared to the less common, as the whole, and as the part. As the whole,
    considering that in the more universal is potentially contained not only the
    less universal, but also other things, as in "animal" is contained not only
    "man" but also "horse." As part, considering that the less common contains
    in its idea not only the more common, but also more; as "man" contains not
    only "animal" but also "rational." Therefore "animal" in itself comes into
    our knowledge before "man"; but "man" comes before "animal" considered as
    part of the same idea.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A part can be known in two ways. First,
    absolutely considered in itself; and thus nothing prevents the parts being
    known before the whole, as stones are known before a house is known.
    Secondly as belonging to a certain whole; and thus we must needs know the
    whole before its parts. For we know a house vaguely before we know its
    different parts. So likewise principles of definition are known before the
    thing defined is known; otherwise the thing defined would not be known at
    all. But as parts of the definition they are known after. For we know man
    vaguely as man before we know how to distinguish all that belongs to human
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The universal, as understood with the
    intention of universality, is, indeed, in a way, a principle of knowledge,
    in so far as the intention of universality results from the mode of
    understanding by way of abstraction. But what is a principle of knowledge is
    not of necessity a principle of existence, as Plato thought: since at times
    we know a cause through its effect, and substance through accidents.
    Wherefore the universal thus considered, according to the opinion of
    Aristotle, is neither a principle of existence, nor a substance, as he makes
    clear (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 13). But if we consider the generic or specific
    nature itself as existing in the singular, thus in a way it is in the nature
    of a formal principle in regard to the singulars: for the singular is the
    result of matter, while the idea of species is from the form. But the
    generic nature is compared to the specific nature rather after the fashion
    of a material principle, because the generic nature is taken from that which
    is material in a thing, while the idea of species is taken from that which
    is formal: thus the notion of animal is taken from the sensitive part,
    whereas the notion of man is taken from the intellectual part. Thus it is
    that the ultimate intention of nature is to the species and not to the
    individual, or the genus: because the form is the end of generation, while
    matter is for the sake of the form. Neither is it necessary that, as regards
    us, knowledge of any cause or principle should be secondary: since at times
    through sensible causes we become acquainted with unknown effects, and
    sometimes conversely.<br />

    Whether we can understand many things at the same time?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we can understand many things
    at the same time. For intellect is above time, whereas the succession of
    before and after belongs to time. Therefore the intellect does not
    understand different things in succession, but at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is nothing to prevent different
    forms not opposed to each other from actually being in the same subject, as,
    for instance, color and smell are in the apple. But intelligible species are
    not opposed to each other. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the same
    intellect being in act as regards different intelligible species, and thus
    it can understand many things at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect understands a whole at the
    same time, such as a man or a house. But a whole contains many parts.
    Therefore the intellect understands many things at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we cannot know the difference between
    two things unless we know both at the same time (De Anima iii, 2), and the
    same is to be said of any other comparison. But our intellect knows the
    difference and comparison between one thing and another. Therefore it knows
    many things at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (Topic. ii, 10) that
    "understanding is of one thing only, knowledge is of many."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The intellect can, indeed, understand many
    things as one, but not as many: that is to say by "one" but not by "many"
    intelligible species. For the mode of every action follows the form which is
    the principle of that action. Therefore whatever things the intellect can
    understand under one species, it can understand at the same time: hence it
    is that God sees all things at the same time, because He sees all in one,
    that is, in His Essence. But whatever things the intellect understands under
    different species, it does not understand at the same time. The reason of
    this is that it is impossible for one and the same subject to be perfected
    at the same time by many forms of one genus and diverse species, just as it
    is impossible for one and the same body at the same time to have different
    colors or different shapes. Now all intelligible species belong to one
    genus, because they are the perfections of one intellectual faculty:
    although the things which the species represent belong to different genera.
    Therefore it is impossible for one and the same intellect to be perfected at
    the same time by different intelligible species so as actually to understand
    different things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellect is above that time, which
    is the measure of the movement of corporeal things. But the multitude itself
    of intelligible species causes a certain vicissitude of intelligible
    operations, according as one operation succeeds another. And this
    vicissitude is called time by Augustine, who says (Gen. ad lit. viii,
    20,22), that "God moves the spiritual creature through time."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not only is it impossible for opposite
    forms to exist at the same time in the same subject, but neither can any
    forms belonging to the same genus, although they be not opposed to one
    another, as is clear from the examples of colors and shapes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Parts can be understood in two ways.
    First, in a confused way, as existing in the whole, and thus they are known
    through the one form of the whole, and so are known together. In another way
    they are known distinctly: thus each is known by its species; and so they
    are not understood at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> If the intellect sees the difference or
    comparison between one thing and another, it knows both in relation to their
    difference or comparison; just, as we have said above (ad 3), as it knows
    the parts in the whole.<br />

    Whether our intellect understands by composition and division?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect does not
    understand by composition and division. For composition and division are
    only of many; whereas the intellect cannot understand many things at the
    same time. Therefore it cannot understand by composition and division.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every composition and division implies
    past, present, or future time. But the intellect abstracts from time, as
    also from other individual conditions. Therefore the intellect does not
    understand by composition and division.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect understands things by a
    process of assimilation to them. But composition and division are not in
    things, for nothing is in things but what is signified by the predicate and
    the subject, and which is one and the same, provided that the composition be
    true, for "man" is truly what "animal" is. Therefore the intellect does not
    act by composition and division.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Words signify the conceptions of the
    intellect, as the Philosopher says (Peri Herm. i). But in words we find
    composition and division, as appears in affirmative and negative
    propositions. Therefore the intellect acts by composition and division.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The human intellect must of necessity
    understand by composition and division. For since the intellect passes from
    potentiality to act, it has a likeness to things which are generated, which
    do not attain to perfection all at once but acquire it by degrees: so
    likewise the human intellect does not acquire perfect knowledge by the first
    act of apprehension; but it first apprehends something about its object,
    such as its quiddity, and this is its first and proper object; and then it
    understands the properties, accidents, and the various relations of the
    essence. Thus it necessarily compares one thing with another by composition
    or division; and from one composition and division it proceeds to another,
    which is the process of reasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the angelic and the Divine intellect, like all incorruptible things,
    have their perfection at once from the beginning. Hence the angelic and the
    Divine intellect have the entire knowledge of a thing at once and perfectly;
    and hence also in knowing the quiddity of a thing they know at once whatever
    we can know by composition, division, and reasoning. Therefore the human
    intellect knows by composition, division and reasoning. But the Divine
    intellect and the angelic intellect know, indeed, composition, division, and
    reasoning, not by the process itself, but by understanding the simple
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Composition and division of the
    intellect are made by differentiating and comparing. Hence the intellect
    knows many things by composition and division, as by knowing the difference
    and comparison of things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the intellect abstracts from
    the phantasms, it does not understand actually without turning to the
    phantasms, as we have said (<a href="FP085.html#FPQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). And forasmuch as it
    turns to the phantasms, composition and division of the intellect involve
    time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The likeness of a thing is received into
    the intellect according to the mode of the intellect, not according to the
    mode of the thing. Wherefore something on the part of the thing corresponds
    to the composition and division of the intellect; but it does not exist in
    the same way in the intellect and in the thing. For the proper object of the
    human intellect is the quiddity of a material thing, which comes under the
    action of the senses and the imagination. Now in a material thing there is a
    twofold composition. First, there is the composition of form with matter;
    and to this corresponds that composition of the intellect whereby the
    universal whole is predicated of its part: for the genus is derived from
    common matter, while the difference that completes the species is derived
    from the form, and the particular from individual matter. The second
    comparison is of accident with subject: and to this real composition
    corresponds that composition of the intellect, whereby accident is
    predicated of subject, as when we say "the man is white." Nevertheless
    composition of the intellect differs from composition of things; for in the
    latter the things are diverse, whereas composition of the intellect is a
    sign of the identity of the components. For the above composition of the
    intellect does not imply that "man" and "whiteness" are identical, but the
    assertion, "the man is white," means that "the man is something having
    whiteness": and the subject, which is a man, is identified with a subject
    having whiteness. It is the same with the composition of form and matter:
    for animal signifies that which has a sensitive nature; rational, that which
    has an intellectual nature; man, that which has both; and Socrates that
    which has all these things together with individual matter; and according to
    this kind of identity our intellect predicates the composition of one thing
    with another.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the intellect can be false?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellect can be false;
    for the Philosopher says (Metaph. vi, Did. v, 4) that "truth and falsehood
    are in the mind." But the mind and intellect are the same, as is shown above
    (<a href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>,
    <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore falsehood may
    be in the mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, opinion and reasoning belong to the
    intellect. But falsehood exists in both. Therefore falsehood can be in the
    intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin is in the intellectual faculty. But
    sin involves falsehood: for "those err that work evil" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++14%3A22"
      >Prov. 14:22</a
    >). Therefore falsehood can be in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 32), that
    "everyone who is deceived, does not rightly understand that wherein he is
    deceived." And the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 10), that "the intellect
    is always true."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Philosopher (De Anima iii, 6) compares
    intellect with sense on this point. For sense is not deceived in its proper
    object, as sight in regard to color; has accidentally through some hindrance
    occurring to the sensile organ---for example, the taste of a fever-stricken
    person judges a sweet thing to be bitter, through his tongue being vitiated
    by ill humors. Sense, however, may be deceived as regards common sensible
    objects, as size or figure; when, for example, it judges the sun to be only
    a foot in diameter, whereas in reality it exceeds the earth in size. Much
    more is sense deceived concerning accidental sensible objects, as when it
    judges that vinegar is honey by reason of the color being the same. The
    reason of this is evident; for every faculty, as such, is "per se" directed
    to its proper object; and things of this kind are always the same. Hence, as
    long as the faculty exists, its judgment concerning its own proper object
    does not fail. Now the proper object of the intellect is the "quiddity" of a
    material thing; and hence, properly speaking, the intellect is not at fault
    concerning this quiddity; whereas it may go astray as regards the
    surroundings of the thing in its essence or quiddity, in referring one thing
    to another, as regards composition or division, or also in the process of
    reasoning. Therefore, also in regard to those propositions, which are
    understood, the intellect cannot err, as in the case of first principles
    from which arises infallible truth in the certitude of scientific
    conclusions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The intellect, however, may be accidentally deceived in the quiddity of
    composite things, not by the defect of its organ, for the intellect is a
    faculty that is independent of an organ; but on the part of the composition
    affecting the definition, when, for instance, the definition of a thing is
    false in relation to something else, as the definition of a circle applied
    to a triangle; or when a definition is false in itself as involving the
    composition of things incompatible; as, for instance, to describe anything
    as "a rational winged animal." Hence as regards simple objects not subject
    to composite definitions we cannot be deceived unless, indeed, we understand
    nothing whatever about them, as is said Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 10.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher says that falsehood is
    in the intellect in regard to composition and division. The same answer
    applies to the Second Objection concerning opinion and reasoning, and to the
    Third Objection, concerning the error of the sinner, who errs in the
    practical judgment of the appetible object. But in the absolute
    consideration of the quiddity of a thing, and of those things which are
    known thereby, the intellect is never deceived. In this sense are to be
    understood the authorities quoted in proof of the opposite conclusion.<br />

    Whether one person can understand one and the same thing better than another
    can?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one person cannot understand
    one and the same thing better than another can. For Augustine says
    (Questions. 83, qu. 32), "Whoever understands a thing otherwise than as it
    is, does not understand it at all. Hence it is clear that there is a perfect
    understanding, than which none other is more perfect: and therefore there
    are not infinite degrees of understanding a thing: nor can one person
    understand a thing better than another can."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the intellect is true in its act of
    understanding. But truth, being a certain equality between thought and
    thing, is not subject to more or less; for a thing cannot be said to be more
    or less equal. Therefore a thing cannot be more or less understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect is the most formal of all
    that is in man. But different forms cause different species. Therefore if
    one man understands better than another, it would seem that they do not
    belong to the same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Experience shows that some understand more
    profoundly than do others; as one who carries a conclusion to its first
    principles and ultimate causes understands it better than the one who
    reduces it only to its proximate causes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing being understood more by one than by
    another may be taken in two senses. First, so that the word "more" be taken
    as determining the act of understanding as regards the thing understood; and
    thus, one cannot understand the same thing more than another, because to
    understand it otherwise than as it is, either better or worse, would entail
    being deceived, and such a one would not understand it, as Augustine argues
    (Questions. 83, qu. 32). In another sense the word "more" can be taken as
    determining the act of understanding on the part of him who understands; and
    so one may understand the same thing better than someone else, through
    having a greater power of understanding: just as a man may see a thing
    better with his bodily sight, whose power is greater, and whose sight is
    more perfect. The same applies to the intellect in two ways. First, as
    regards the intellect itself, which is more perfect. For it is plain that
    the better the disposition of a body, the better the soul allotted to it;
    which clearly appears in things of different species: and the reason thereof
    is that act and form are received into matter according to matter's
    capacity: thus because some men have bodies of better disposition, their
    souls have a greater power of understanding, wherefore it is said (De Anima
    ii, 9), that "it is to be observed that those who have soft flesh are of apt
    mind." Secondly, this occurs in regard to the lower powers of which the
    intellect has need in its operation: for those in whom the imaginative,
    cogitative, and memorative powers are of better disposition, are better
    disposed to understand.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reply to the First Objection is clear from the above; likewise the reply
    to the Second, for the truth of the intellect consists in the intellect
    understanding a thing as it is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The difference of form which is due only
    to the different disposition of matter, causes not a specific but only a
    numerical difference: for different individuals have different forms,
    diversified according to the difference of matter.<br />

    Whether the intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellect understands the
    indivisible before the divisible. For the Philosopher says (Phys. i, 1) that
    "we understand and know from the knowledge of principles and elements." But
    principles are indivisible, and elements are of divisible things. Therefore
    the indivisible is known to us before the divisible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the definition of a thing contains what
    is known previously, for a definition "proceeds from the first and more
    known," as is said Topic. vi, 4. But the indivisible is part of the
    definition of the divisible; as a point comes into the definition of a line;
    for as Euclid says, "a line is length without breadth, the extremities of
    which are points"; also unity comes into the definition of number, for
    "number is multitude measured by one," as is said Metaph. x, Did. ix, 6.
    Therefore our intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Like is known by like." But the
    indivisible is more like to the intellect than is the divisible; because
    "the intellect is simple" (De Anima iii, 4). Therefore our intellect first
    knows the indivisible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (De Anima iii, 6) that "the
    indivisible is expressed as a privation." But privation is known
    secondarily. Therefore likewise is the indivisible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The object of our intellect in its present
    state is the quiddity of a material thing, which it abstracts from the
    phantasms, as above stated (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). And since that which
    is known first and of itself by our cognitive power is its proper object, we
    must consider its relationship to that quiddity in order to discover in what
    order the indivisible is known. Now the indivisible is threefold, as is said
    De Anima iii, 6. First, the continuous is indivisible, since actually it is
    undivided, although potentially divisible: and this indivisible is known to
    us before its division, which is a division into parts: because confused
    knowledge is prior to distinct knowledge, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP085.html#FPQ85A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Secondly, the indivisible is so called in relation to species, as man's
    reason is something indivisible. This way, also, the indivisible is
    understood before its division into logical parts, as we have said above (De
    Anima iii, 6); and again before the intellect disposes and divides by
    affirmation and negation. The reason of this is that both these kinds of
    indivisible are understood by the intellect of itself, as being its proper
    object. The third kind of indivisible is what is altogether indivisible, as
    a point and unity, which cannot be divided either actually or potentially.
    And this indivisible is known secondarily, through the privation of
    divisibility. Wherefore a point is defined by way of privation "as that
    which has no parts"; and in like manner the notion of "one" is that is
    "indivisible," as stated in Metaph. x, Did. ix, 1. And the reason of this is
    that this indivisible has a certain opposition to a corporeal being, the
    quiddity of which is the primary and proper object of the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if our intellect understood by participation of certain separate
    indivisible (forms), as the Platonists maintained, it would follow that a
    like indivisible is understood primarily; for according to the Platonists
    what is first is first participated by things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the acquisition of knowledge,
    principles and elements are not always (known) first: for sometimes from
    sensible effects we arrive at the knowledge of principles and intelligible
    causes. But in perfect knowledge, the knowledge of effects always depends on
    the knowledge of principles and elements: for as the Philosopher says in the
    same passage: "Then do we consider that we know, when we can resolve
    principles into their causes."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A point is not included in the
    definition of a line in general: for it is manifest that in a line of
    indefinite length, and in a circular line, there is no point, save
    potentially. Euclid defines a finite straight line: and therefore he
    mentions a point in the definition, as the limit in the definition of that
    which is limited. Unity is the measure of number: wherefore it is included
    in the definition of a measured number. But it is not included in the
    definition of the divisible, but rather conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The likeness through which we understand
    is the species of the known in the knower; therefore a thing is known first,
    not on account of its natural likeness to the cognitive power, but on
    account of the power's aptitude for the object: otherwise sight would
    perceive hearing rather than color.<br />
