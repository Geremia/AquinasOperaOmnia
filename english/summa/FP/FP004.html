  <h3 align="center">THE PERFECTION OF GOD (THREE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Having considered the divine simplicity, we treat next of God's perfection.
    Now because everything in so far as it is perfect is called good, we shall
    speak first of the divine perfection; secondly of the divine goodness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning the first there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p><a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether God is perfect?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether God is perfect universally,
    as having in Himself the perfections of all things?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether creatures can be said to be
    like God?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is perfect?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that perfection does not belong to God.
    For we say a thing is perfect if it is completely made. But it does not
    befit God to be made. Therefore He is not perfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God is the first beginning of things.
    But the beginnings of things seem to be imperfect, as seed is the beginning
    of animal and vegetable life. Therefore God is imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as shown above (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), God's essence is
    existence. But existence seems most imperfect, since it is most universal
    and receptive of all modification. Therefore God is imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "Be you perfect as also your
    heavenly Father is perfect" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A48"
      >Mt. 5:48</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher relates (Metaph. xii), some
    ancient philosophers, namely, the Pythagoreans and Leucippus, did not
    predicate "best" and "most perfect" of the first principle. The reason was
    that the ancient philosophers considered only a material principle; and a
    material principle is most imperfect. For since matter as such is merely
    potential, the first material principle must be simply potential, and thus
    most imperfect. Now God is the first principle, not material, but in the
    order of efficient cause, which must be most perfect. For just as matter, as
    such, is merely potential, an agent, as such, is in the state of actuality.
    Hence, the first active principle must needs be most actual, and therefore
    most perfect; for a thing is perfect in proportion to its state of
    actuality, because we call that perfect which lacks nothing of the mode of
    its perfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Gregory says (Moral. v, 26,29):
    "Though our lips can only stammer, we yet chant the high things of God." For
    that which is not made is improperly called perfect. Nevertheless because
    created things are then called perfect, when from potentiality they are
    brought into actuality, this word "perfect" signifies whatever is not
    wanting in actuality, whether this be by way of perfection or not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The material principle which with us is
    found to be imperfect, cannot be absolutely primal; but must be preceded by
    something perfect. For seed, though it be the principle of animal life
    reproduced through seed, has previous to it, the animal or plant from which
    is came. Because, previous to that which is potential, must be that which is
    actual; since a potential being can only be reduced into act by some being
    already actual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Existence is the most perfect of all
    things, for it is compared to all things as that by which they are made
    actual; for nothing has actuality except so far as it exists. Hence
    existence is that which actuates all things, even their forms. Therefore it
    is not compared to other things as the receiver is to the received; but
    rather as the received to the receiver. When therefore I speak of the
    existence of man, or horse, or anything else, existence is considered a
    formal principle, and as something received; and not as that which
    exists.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the perfections of all things are in God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the perfections of all things are
    not in God. For God is simple, as shown above (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>); whereas the
    perfections of things are many and diverse. Therefore the perfections of all
    things are not in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, opposites cannot coexist. Now the
    perfections of things are opposed to each other, for each thing is perfected
    by its specific difference. But the differences by which "genera" are
    divided, and "species" constituted, are opposed to each other. Therefore
    because opposites cannot coexist in the same subject, it seems that the
    perfections of all things are not in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a living thing is more perfect than what
    merely exists; and an intelligent thing than what merely lives. Therefore
    life is more perfect than existence; and knowledge than life. But the
    essence of God is existence itself. Therefore He has not the perfections of
    life, and knowledge, and other similar perfections.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v) that "God in His
    one existence prepossesses all things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All created perfections are in God. Hence He is
    spoken of as universally perfect, because He lacks not (says the
    Commentator, Metaph. v) any excellence which may be found in any genus. This
    may be seen from two considerations. First, because whatever perfection
    exists in an effect must be found in the effective cause: either in the same
    formality, if it is a univocal agent---as when man reproduces man; or in a
    more eminent degree, if it is an equivocal agent---thus in the sun is the
    likeness of whatever is generated by the sun's power. Now it is plain that
    the effect pre-exists virtually in the efficient cause: and although to
    pre-exist in the potentiality of a material cause is to pre-exist in a more
    imperfect way, since matter as such is imperfect, and an agent as such is
    perfect; still to pre-exist virtually in the efficient cause is to pre-exist
    not in a more imperfect, but in a more perfect way. Since therefore God is
    the first effective cause of things, the perfections of all things must
    pre-exist in God in a more eminent way. Dionysius implies the same line of
    argument by saying of God (Div. Nom. v): "It is not that He is this and not
    that, but that He is all, as the cause of all." Secondly, from what has been
    already proved, God is existence itself, of itself subsistent (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Consequently, He must
    contain within Himself the whole perfection of being. For it is clear that
    if some hot thing has not the whole perfection of heat, this is because heat
    is not participated in its full perfection; but if this heat were
    self-subsisting, nothing of the virtue of heat would be wanting to it. Since
    therefore God is subsisting being itself, nothing of the perfection of being
    can be wanting to Him. Now all created perfections are included in the
    perfection of being; for things are perfect, precisely so far as they have
    being after some fashion. It follows therefore that the perfection of no one
    thing is wanting to God. This line of argument, too, is implied by Dionysius
    (Div. Nom. v), when he says that, "God exists not in any single mode, but
    embraces all being within Himself, absolutely, without limitation,
    uniformly;" and afterwards he adds that, "He is the very existence to
    subsisting things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even as the sun (as Dionysius remarks,
    (Div. Nom. v)), while remaining one and shining uniformly, contains within
    itself first and uniformly the substances of sensible things, and many and
    diverse qualities; "a fortiori" should all things in a kind of natural unity
    pre-exist in the cause of all things; and thus things diverse and in
    themselves opposed to each other, pre-exist in God as one, without injury to
    His simplicity. This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v)
    that, although existence is more perfect than life, and life than wisdom, if
    they are considered as distinguished in idea; nevertheless, a living thing
    is more perfect than what merely exists, because living things also exist
    and intelligent things both exist and live. Although therefore existence
    does not include life and wisdom, because that which participates in
    existence need not participate in every mode of existence; nevertheless
    God's existence includes in itself life and wisdom, because nothing of the
    perfection of being can be wanting to Him who is subsisting being itself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether any creature can be like God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no creature can be like God. For it
    is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++85%3A8"
      >Ps. 85:8</a
    >): "There is none among the gods like unto Thee, O Lord." But of all
    creatures the most excellent are those which are called participation gods.
    Therefore still less can other creatures be said to be like God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, likeness implies comparison. But there
    can be no comparison between things in a different "genus." Therefore
    neither can there be any likeness. Thus we do not say that sweetness is like
    whiteness. But no creature is in the same "genus" as God: since God is no
    "genus," as shown above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore no creature is
    like God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we speak of those things as like which
    agree in form. But nothing can agree with God in form; for, save in God
    alone, essence and existence differ. Therefore no creature can be like to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, among like things there is mutual
    likeness; for like is like to like. If therefore any creature is like God,
    God will be like some creature, which is against what is said by Isaias: "To
    whom have you likened God?" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++40%3A18"
      >Is. 40:18</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "Let us make man to our image
    and likeness" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A26"
      >Gn. 1:26</a
    >), and: "When He shall appear we shall be like to Him" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++3%3A2"
      >1 Jn. 3:2</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since likeness is based upon agreement or
    communication in form, it varies according to the many modes of
    communication in form. Some things are said to be like, which communicate in
    the same form according to the same formality, and according to the same
    mode; and these are said to be not merely like, but equal in their likeness;
    as two things equally white are said to be alike in whiteness; and this is
    the most perfect likeness. In another way, we speak of things as alike which
    communicate in form according to the same formality, though not according to
    the same measure, but according to more or less, as something less white is
    said to be like another thing more white; and this is imperfect likeness. In
    a third way some things are said to be alike which communicate in the same
    form, but not according to the same formality; as we see in non-univocal
    agents. For since every agent reproduces itself so far as it is an agent,
    and everything acts according to the manner of its form, the effect must in
    some way resemble the form of the agent. If therefore the agent is contained
    in the same species as its effect, there will be a likeness in form between
    that which makes and that which is made, according to the same formality of
    the species; as man reproduces man. If, however, the agent and its effect
    are not contained in the same species, there will be a likeness, but not
    according to the formality of the same species; as things generated by the
    sun's heat may be in some sort spoken of as like the sun, not as though they
    received the form of the sun in its specific likeness, but in its generic
    likeness. Therefore if there is an agent not contained in any "genus," its
    effect will still more distantly reproduce the form of the agent, not, that
    is, so as to participate in the likeness of the agent's form according to
    the same specific or generic formality, but only according to some sort of
    analogy; as existence is common to all. In this way all created things, so
    far as they are beings, are like God as the first and universal principle of
    all being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix), when
    Holy Writ declares that nothing is like God, it does not mean to deny all
    likeness to Him. For, "the same things can be like and unlike to God: like,
    according as they imitate Him, as far as He, Who is not perfectly imitable,
    can be imitated; unlike according as they fall short of their cause," not
    merely in intensity and remission, as that which is less white falls short
    of that which is more white; but because they are not in agreement,
    specifically or generically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is not related to creatures as
    though belonging to a different "genus," but as transcending every "genus,"
    and as the principle of all "genera."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Likeness of creatures to God is not
    affirmed on account of agreement in form according to the formality of the
    same genus or species, but solely according to analogy, inasmuch as God is
    essential being, whereas other things are beings by participation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although it may be admitted that
    creatures are in some sort like God, it must nowise be admitted that God is
    like creatures; because, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix): "A mutual
    likeness may be found between things of the same order, but not between a
    cause and that which is caused." For, we say that a statue is like a man,
    but not conversely; so also a creature can be spoken of as in some sort like
    God; but not that God is like a creature.<br />
