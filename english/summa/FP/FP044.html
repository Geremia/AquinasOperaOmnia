<br>
THE PROCESSION OF CREATURES FROM GOD, AND OF THE FIRST CAUSE OF ALL THINGS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After treating of the procession of the divine persons, we must consider 
the procession of creatures from God. This consideration will be 
threefold: (1) of the production of creatures; (2) of the distinction 
between them; (3) of their preservation and government. Concerning the 
first point there are three things to be considered: (1) the first cause 
of beings; (2) the mode of procession of creatures from the first cause; 
(3) the principle of the duration of things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether God is the efficient cause of all beings?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether primary matter is created by God, or is an independent 
coordinate principle with Him?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether God is the exemplar cause of beings or whether there are 
other exemplar causes?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He is the final cause of things?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is necessary that every being be created by God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary that every being be 
created by God. For there is nothing to prevent a thing from being 
without that which does not belong to its essence, as a man can be found 
without whiteness. But the relation of the thing caused to its cause does 
not appear to be essential to beings, for some beings can be understood 
without it; therefore they can exist without it; and therefore it is 
possible that some beings should not be created by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing requires an efficient cause in order to exist. 
Therefore whatever cannot but exist does not require an efficient cause. 
But no necessary thing can not exist, because  whatever necessarily 
exists cannot but exist. Therefore as there are many necessary things in 
existence, it appears that not all beings are from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever things have a cause, can be demonstrated by 
that cause. But in mathematics demonstration is not made by the efficient 
cause, as appears from the Philosopher (Metaph. iii, text 3); therefore 
not all beings are from God as from their efficient cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11%3A36">Rm. 11:36</a>): "Of Him, and by Him, and in Him 
are all things."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It must be said that every being in any way existing is 
from God. For whatever is found in anything by participation, must be 
caused in it by that to which it belongs essentially, as iron becomes 
ignited by fire. Now it has been shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) when treating 
of the divine simplicity that God is the essentially self-subsisting 
Being; and also it was shown (<A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4) that subsisting being must 
be one; as, if whiteness were self-subsisting, it would be one, since 
whiteness is multiplied by its recipients. Therefore all beings apart 
from God are not their own being, but are beings by participation. 
Therefore it must be that all things which are diversified by the diverse 
participation of being, so as to be more or less perfect, are caused by 
one First Being, Who possesses being most perfectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence Plato said (Parmen. xxvi) that unity must come before multitude; 
and Aristotle said (Metaph. ii, text 4) that whatever is greatest in 
being and greatest in truth, is the cause of every being and of every 
truth; just as whatever is the greatest in heat is the cause of all heat.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Though the relation to its cause is not part of the 
definition of a thing caused, still it follows, as a consequence, on what 
belongs to its essence; because from the fact that a thing has being by 
participation, it follows that it is caused. Hence such a being cannot be 
without being caused, just as man cannot be without having the faculty of 
laughing. But, since to be caused does not enter into the essence of 
being as such, therefore is it possible for us to find a being uncaused.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection has led some to say that what is necessary 
has no cause (Phys. viii, text 46). But this is manifestly false in the 
demonstrative sciences, where necessary principles are the causes of 
necessary conclusions. And therefore Aristotle says (Metaph. v, text 6), 
that there are some necessary things which have a cause of their 
necessity. But the reason why an efficient cause is required is not 
merely because the effect is not necessary, but because the effect might 
not be if the cause were not. For this conditional proposition is true, 
whether the antecedent and consequent be possible or impossible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The science of mathematics treats its object as  though it 
were something abstracted mentally, whereas it is not abstract in 
reality. Now, it is becoming that everything should have an efficient 
cause in proportion to its being. And so, although the object of 
mathematics has an efficient cause, still, its relation to that cause is 
not the reason why it is brought under the consideration of the 
mathematician, who therefore does not demonstrate that object from its 
efficient cause.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether primary matter is created by God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that primary matter is not created by God. For 
whatever is made is composed of a subject and of something else (Phys. i, 
text 62). But primary matter has no subject. Therefore primary matter 
cannot have been made by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, action and passion are opposite members of a division. 
But as the first active principle is God, so the first passive principle 
is matter. Therefore God and primary matter are two principles divided 
against each other, neither of which is from the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every agent produces its like, and thus, since every 
agent acts in proportion to its actuality, it follows that everything 
made is in some degree actual. But primary matter is only in 
potentiality, formally considered in itself. Therefore it is against the 
nature of primary matter to be a thing made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. xii, 7), Two "things hast Thou 
made, O Lord; one nigh unto Thyself"---viz. angels---"the other nigh unto 
nothing"---viz. primary matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The ancient philosophers gradually, and as it were step 
by step, advanced to the knowledge of truth. At first being of grosser 
mind, they failed to realize that any beings existed except sensible 
bodies. And those among them who admitted movement, did not consider it 
except as regards certain accidents, for instance, in relation to 
rarefaction and condensation, by union and separation. And supposing as 
they did that corporeal substance itself was uncreated, they assigned 
certain causes for these accidental changes, as for instance, affinity, 
discord, intellect, or something of that kind. An advance was made when 
they understood that there was a distinction between the substantial form 
and matter, which latter they imagined to be uncreated, and when they 
perceived transmutation to take place in bodies in regard to essential 
forms. Such transmutations they attributed to certain universal causes, 
such as the oblique circle [*The zodiac], according to Aristotle (De 
Gener. ii), or ideas, according to Plato. But we must take into 
consideration that matter is contracted by its form to a determinate 
species, as a substance, belonging to a certain species, is contracted by 
a supervening accident to a determinate mode of being; for instance, man 
by whiteness. Each of these opinions, therefore, considered "being" under 
some particular aspect, either as "this" or as "such"; and so  they 
assigned particular efficient causes to things. Then others there were 
who arose to the consideration of "being," as being, and who assigned a 
cause to things, not as "these," or as "such," but as "beings."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore whatever is the cause of things considered as beings, must be 
the cause of things, not only according as they are "such" by accidental 
forms, nor according as they are "these" by substantial forms, but also 
according to all that belongs to their being at all in any way. And thus 
it is necessary to say that also primary matter is created by the 
universal cause of things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher (Phys. i, text 62), is speaking of 
"becoming" in particular---that is, from form to form, either accidental 
or substantial. But here we are speaking of things according to their 
emanation from the universal principle of being; from which emanation 
matter itself is not excluded, although it is excluded from the former 
mode of being made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passion is an effect of action. Hence it is reasonable that 
the first passive principle should be the effect of the first active 
principle, since every imperfect thing is caused by one perfect. For the 
first principle must be most perfect, as Aristotle says (Metaph. xii, 
text 40).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reason adduced does not show that matter is not 
created, but that it is not created without form; for though everything 
created is actual, still it is not pure act. Hence it is necessary that 
even what is potential in it should be created, if all that belongs to 
its being is created.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the exemplar cause is anything besides God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the exemplar cause is something besides God. 
For the effect is like its exemplar cause. But creatures are far from 
being like God. Therefore God is not their exemplar cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is by participation is reduced to something 
self-existing, as a thing ignited is reduced to fire, as stated above 
(<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But whatever exists in sensible things exists only by 
participation of some species. This appears from the fact that in all 
sensible species is found not only what belongs to the species, but also 
individuating principles added to the principles of the species. 
Therefore it is necessary to admit self-existing species, as for 
instance, a "per se" man, and a "per se" horse, and the like, which are 
called the exemplars. Therefore exemplar causes exist besides God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sciences and definitions are concerned with species 
themselves, but not as these are in particular things, because there is 
no science or definition of particular things. Therefore there are some 
beings, which are beings or species not  existing in singular things, and 
these are called exemplars. Therefore the same conclusion follows as 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, this likewise appears from Dionysius, who says (Div. 
Nom. v) that self-subsisting being is before self-subsisting life, and 
before self-subsisting wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The exemplar is the same as the idea. But ideas, 
according to Augustine (Questions. 83, qu. 46), are "the master forms, which are 
contained in the divine intelligence." Therefore the exemplars of things 
are not outside God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God is the first exemplar cause of all things. In proof 
whereof we must consider that if for the production of anything an 
exemplar is necessary, it is in order that the effect may receive a 
determinate form. For an artificer produces a determinate form in matter 
by reason of the exemplar before him, whether it is the exemplar beheld 
externally, or the exemplar interiorily conceived in the mind. Now it is 
manifest that things made by nature receive determinate forms. This 
determination of forms must be reduced to the divine wisdom as its first 
principle, for divine wisdom devised the order of the universe, which 
order consists in the variety of things. And therefore we must say that 
in the divine wisdom are the types of all things, which types we have 
called ideas---i.e. exemplar forms existing in the divine mind (<A Href="FP015.html#FPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="FP015.html#FPQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And these ideas, though multiplied by their relations to things, 
in reality are not apart from the divine essence, according as the 
likeness to that essence can be shared diversely by different things. In 
this manner therefore God Himself is the first exemplar of all things. 
Moreover, in things created one may be called the exemplar of another by 
the reason of its likeness thereto, either in species, or by the analogy 
of some kind of imitation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although creatures do not attain to a natural likeness to 
God according to similitude of species, as a man begotten is like to the 
man begetting, still they do attain to likeness to Him, forasmuch as they 
represent the divine idea, as a material house is like to the house in 
the architect's mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is of a man's nature to be in matter, and so a man 
without matter is impossible. Therefore although this particular man is a 
man by participation of the species, he cannot be reduced to anything 
self-existing in the same species, but to a superior species, such as 
separate substances. The same applies to other sensible things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although every science and definition is concerned only 
with beings, still it is not necessary that a thing should have the same 
mode in reality as the thought of it has in our understanding. For we 
abstract universal ideas by force of the active intellect from the 
particular conditions; but it is not necessary that the universals should 
exist outside the particulars in order to be their exemplars. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), by "self-existing life 
and self-existing wisdom" he sometimes denotes God Himself, sometimes the 
powers given to things themselves; but not any self-subsisting things, as 
the ancients asserted.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God is not the final cause of all things. For 
to act for an end seems to imply need of the end. But God needs nothing. 
Therefore it does not become Him to act for an end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end of generation, and the form of the thing 
generated, and the agent cannot be identical (Phys. ii, text 70), because 
the end of generation is the form of the thing generated. But God is the 
first agent producing all things. Therefore He is not the final cause of 
all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all things desire their end. But all things do not 
desire God, for all do not even know Him. Therefore God is not the end of 
all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the final cause is the first of causes. If, therefore, 
God is the efficient cause and the final cause, it follows that before 
and after exist in Him; which is impossible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++16%3A4">Prov. 16:4</a>): "The Lord has made all things 
for Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every agent acts for an end: otherwise one thing would 
not follow more than another from the action of the agent, unless it were 
by chance. Now the end of the agent and of the patient considered as such 
is the same, but in a different way respectively. For the impression 
which the agent intends to produce, and which the patient intends to 
receive, are one and the same. Some things, however, are both agent and 
patient at the same time: these are imperfect agents, and to these it 
belongs to intend, even while acting, the acquisition of something. But 
it does not belong to the First Agent, Who is agent only, to act for the 
acquisition of some end; He intends only to communicate His perfection, 
which is His goodness; while every creature intends to acquire its own 
perfection, which is the likeness of the divine perfection and goodness. 
Therefore the divine goodness is the end of all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To act from need belongs only to an imperfect agent, which 
by its nature is both agent and patient. But this does not belong to God, 
and therefore He alone is the most perfectly liberal giver, because He 
does not act for His own profit, but only for His own goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The form of the thing generated is not the end of 
generation, except inasmuch as it is the likeness of the form of  the 
generator, which intends to communicate its own likeness; otherwise the 
form of the thing generated would be more noble than the generator, since 
the end is more noble than the means to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All things desire God as their end, when they desire some 
good thing, whether this desire be intellectual or sensible, or natural, 
i.e. without knowledge; because nothing is good and desirable except 
forasmuch as it participates in the likeness to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[44] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since God is the efficient, the exemplar and the final 
cause of all things, and since primary matter is from Him, it follows 
that the first principle of all things is one in reality. But this does 
not prevent us from mentally considering many things in Him, some of 
which come into our mind before others.<br>
