<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now inquire concerning free-will. Under this head there are four 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP083.html#FPQ83A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man has free-will?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP083.html#FPQ83A2THEP1">(2)</a> What is free-will---a power, an act, or a habit?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP083.html#FPQ83A3THEP1">(3)</a> If it is a power, is it appetitive or cognitive?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP083.html#FPQ83A4THEP1">(4)</a> If it is appetitive, is it the same power as the will, or distinct?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man has not free-will. For whoever has 
free-will does what he wills. But man does not what he wills; for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7:19">Rm. 7:19</a>): "For the good which I will I do not, but the evil 
which I will not, that I do." Therefore man has not free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever has free-will has in his power to will or not to 
will, to do or not to do. But this is not in man's power: for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9:16">Rm. 9:16</a>): "It is not of him that willeth"---namely, to 
will---"nor of him that runneth"---namely, to run. Therefore man has not 
free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is "free is cause of itself," as the Philosopher 
says (Metaph. i, 2). Therefore what is moved by another is not free. But 
God moves the will, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++21:1">Prov. 21:1</a>): "The heart of the 
king is in the hand of the Lord; whithersoever He will He shall turn it" 
and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2:13">Phil. 2:13</a>): "It is God Who worketh in you both to will and to 
accomplish." Therefore man has not free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever has free-will is master of his own actions. But 
man is not master of his own actions: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++10:23">Jer. 10:23</a>): 
"The way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk." Therefore 
man has not free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5): "According as each 
one is, such does the end seem to him." But it is not in our power to be 
of one quality or another; for this comes to us from nature. Therefore it 
is natural to us to follow some particular end, and therefore we are not 
free in so doing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 15:14): "God made man from the 
beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel"; and the gloss 
adds: "That is of his free-will."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man has free-will: otherwise counsels, exhortations, 
commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in vain. In 
order to make this evident, we must observe that some things act without 
judgment; as a stone moves downwards; and in like manner all things which 
lack knowledge. And some act from judgment, but not a free judgment; as 
brute animals. For the  sheep, seeing the wolf, judges it a thing to be 
shunned, from a natural and not a free judgment, because it judges, not 
from reason, but from natural instinct. And the same thing is to be said 
of any judgment of brute animals. But man acts from judgment, because by 
his apprehensive power he judges that something should be avoided or 
sought. But because this judgment, in the case of some particular act, is 
not from a natural instinct, but from some act of comparison in the 
reason, therefore he acts from free judgment and retains the power of 
being inclined to various things. For reason in contingent matters may 
follow opposite courses, as we see in dialectic syllogisms and rhetorical 
arguments. Now particular operations are contingent, and therefore in 
such matters the judgment of reason may follow opposite courses, and is 
not determinate to one. And forasmuch as man is rational is it necessary 
that man have a free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we have said above (<A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), the sensitive 
appetite, though it obeys the reason, yet in a given case can resist by 
desiring what the reason forbids. This is therefore the good which man 
does not when he wishes---namely, "not to desire against reason," as 
Augustine says.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those words of the Apostle are not to be taken as though 
man does not wish or does not run of his free-will, but because the 
free-will is not sufficient thereto unless it be moved and helped by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his 
free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong 
to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as 
neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. 
God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and 
voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their 
acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive 
their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very 
thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> "Man's way" is said "not to be his" in the execution of his 
choice, wherein he may be impeded, whether he will or not. The choice 
itself, however, is in us, but presupposes the help of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Quality in man is of two kinds: natural and adventitious. 
Now the natural quality may be in the intellectual part, or in the body 
and its powers. From the very fact, therefore, that man is such by virtue 
of a natural quality which is in the intellectual part, he naturally 
desires his last end, which is happiness. Which desire, indeed, is a 
natural desire, and is not subject to free-will, as is clear from what we 
have said above (<A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But on the part of the body and its 
powers man may be such by virtue of a natural quality, inasmuch as he is 
of such a temperament or disposition due to any impression whatever 
produced by corporeal causes, which cannot affect the intellectual part,  
since it is not the act of a corporeal organ. And such as a man is by 
virtue of a corporeal quality, such also does his end seem to him, 
because from such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject 
something. But these inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason, 
which the lower appetite obeys, as we have said (<A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore 
this is in no way prejudicial to free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The adventitious qualities are habits and passions, by virtue of which a 
man is inclined to one thing rather than to another. And yet even these 
inclinations are subject to the judgment of reason. Such qualities, too, 
are subject to reason, as it is in our power either to acquire them, 
whether by causing them or disposing ourselves to them, or to reject 
them. And so there is nothing in this that is repugnant to free-will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether free-will is a power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that free-will is not a power. For free-will is 
nothing but a free judgment. But judgment denominates an act, not a 
power. Therefore free-will is not a power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, free-will is defined as "the faculty of the will and 
reason." But faculty denominates a facility of power, which is due to a 
habit. Therefore free-will is a habit. Moreover Bernard says (De Gratia 
et Lib. Arb. 1,2) that free-will is "the soul's habit of disposing of 
itself." Therefore it is not a power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no natural power is forfeited through sin. But free-will 
is forfeited through sin; for Augustine says that "man, by abusing 
free-will, loses both it and himself." Therefore free-will is not a power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing but a power, seemingly, is the subject of a 
habit. But free-will is the subject of grace, by the help of which it 
chooses what is good. Therefore free-will is a power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Although free-will [*Liberum arbitrium---i.e. free 
judgment] in its strict sense denotes an act, in the common manner of 
speaking we call free-will, that which is the principle of the act by 
which man judges freely. Now in us the principle of an act is both power 
and habit; for we say that we know something both by knowledge and by the 
intellectual power. Therefore free-will must be either a power or a 
habit, or a power with a habit. That it is neither a habit nor a power 
together with a habit, can be clearly proved in two ways. First of all, 
because, if it is a habit, it must be a natural habit; for it is natural 
to man to have a free-will. But there is not natural habit in us with 
respect to those things which come under free-will: for we are naturally 
inclined to those things of which we have natural habits---for instance, 
to assent to first principles: while those things which we are naturally 
inclined are not subject to free-will, as we have said of the desire of 
happiness (<A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).  Wherefore it is against the very notion of 
free-will that it should be a natural habit. And that it should be a 
non-natural habit is against its nature. Therefore in no sense is it a 
habit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this is clear because habits are defined as that "by reason of 
which we are well or ill disposed with regard to actions and passions" 
(Ethic. ii, 5); for by temperance we are well-disposed as regards 
concupiscences, and by intemperance ill-disposed: and by knowledge we are 
well-disposed to the act of the intellect when we know the truth, and by 
the contrary ill-disposed. But the free-will is indifferent to good and 
evil choice: wherefore it is impossible for free-will to be a habit. 
Therefore it is a power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not unusual for a power to be named from its act. And 
so from this act, which is a free judgment, is named the power which is 
the principle of this act. Otherwise, if free-will denominated an act, it 
would not always remain in man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faculty sometimes denominates a power ready for operation, 
and in this sense faculty is used in the definition of free-will. But 
Bernard takes habit, not as divided against power, but as signifying a 
certain aptitude by which a man has some sort of relation to an act. And 
this may be both by a power and by a habit: for by a power man is, as it 
were, empowered to do the action, and by the habit he is apt to act well 
or ill.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is said to have lost free-will by falling into sin, not 
as to natural liberty, which is freedom from coercion, but as regards 
freedom from fault and unhappiness. Of this we shall treat later in the 
treatise on Morals in the second part of this work (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS085.html#FSQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, seqq.; <A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether free-will is an appetitive power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that free-will is not an appetitive, but a 
cognitive power. For Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 27) says that 
"free-will straightway accompanies the rational nature." But reason is a 
cognitive power. Therefore free-will is a cognitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, free-will is so called as though it were a free 
judgment. But to judge is an act of a cognitive power. Therefore 
free-will is a cognitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the principal function of free-will is to choose. But 
choice seems to belong to knowledge, because it implies a certain 
comparison of one thing to another, which belongs to the cognitive power. 
Therefore free-will is a cognitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 3) that choice is 
"the desire of those things which are in us." But desire is an act of the 
appetitive power: therefore choice is also. But free-will is that by 
which we choose. Therefore free-will is an  appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The proper act of free-will is choice: for we say that we 
have a free-will because we can take one thing while refusing another; 
and this is to choose. Therefore we must consider the nature of 
free-will, by considering the nature of choice. Now two things concur in 
choice: one on the part of the cognitive power, the other on the part of 
the appetitive power. On the part of the cognitive power, counsel is 
required, by which we judge one thing to be preferred to another: and on 
the part of the appetitive power, it is required that the appetite should 
accept the judgment of counsel. Therefore Aristotle (Ethic. vi, 2) leaves 
it in doubt whether choice belongs principally to the appetitive or the 
cognitive power: since he says that choice is either "an appetitive 
intellect or an intellectual appetite." But (Ethic. iii, 3) he inclines 
to its being an intellectual appetite when he describes choice as "a 
desire proceeding from counsel." And the reason of this is because the 
proper object of choice is the means to the end: and this, as such, is in 
the nature of that good which is called useful: wherefore since good, as 
such, is the object of the appetite, it follows that choice is 
principally an act of the appetitive power. And thus free-will is an 
appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The appetitive powers accompany the apprehensive, and in 
this sense Damascene says that free-will straightway accompanies the 
rational power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Judgment, as it were, concludes and terminates counsel. Now 
counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the 
acceptation of the appetite: whence the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 3) says 
that, "having formed a judgment by counsel, we desire in accordance with 
that counsel." And in this sense choice itself is a judgment from which 
free-will takes its name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This comparison which is implied in the choice belongs to 
the preceding counsel, which is an act of reason. For though the appetite 
does not make comparisons, yet forasmuch as it is moved by the 
apprehensive power which does compare, it has some likeness of comparison 
by choosing one in preference to another.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that free-will is a power distinct from the will. 
For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that {thelesis} is one thing 
and {boulesis} another. But {thelesis} is the will, while {boulesis} 
seems to be the free-will, because {boulesis}, according to him, is will 
as concerning an object by way of comparison between two things. 
Therefore it seems that free-will is a distinct power from the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, powers are known by their acts. But choice, which is the 
act of free-will, is distinct from the act of willing,  because "the act 
of the will regards the end, whereas choice regards the means to the end" 
(Ethic. iii, 2). Therefore free-will is a distinct power from the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the will is the intellectual appetite. But in the 
intellect there are two powers---the active and the passive. Therefore, 
also on the part of the intellectual appetite, there must be another 
power besides the will. And this, seemingly, can only be free-will. 
Therefore free-will is a distinct power from the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) free-will is 
nothing else than the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The appetitive powers must be proportionate to the 
apprehensive powers, as we have said above (<A Href="FP064.html#FPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="FP064.html#FPQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now, as on the 
part of the intellectual apprehension we have intellect and reason, so on 
the part of the intellectual appetite we have will, and free-will which 
is nothing else but the power of choice. And this is clear from their 
relations to their respective objects and acts. For the act of 
"understanding" implies the simple acceptation of something; whence we 
say that we understand first principles, which are known of themselves 
without any comparison. But to "reason," properly speaking, is to come 
from one thing to the knowledge of another: wherefore, properly speaking, 
we reason about conclusions, which are known from the principles. In like 
manner on the part of the appetite to "will" implies the simple appetite 
for something: wherefore the will is said to regard the end, which is 
desired for itself. But to "choose" is to desire something for the sake 
of obtaining something else: wherefore, properly speaking, it regards the 
means to the end. Now, in matters of knowledge, the principles are 
related to the conclusion to which we assent on account of the 
principles: just as, in appetitive matters, the end is related to the 
means, which is desired on account of the end. Wherefore it is evident 
that as the intellect is to reason, so is the will to the power of 
choice, which is free-will. But it has been shown above (<A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) 
that it belongs to the same power both to understand and to reason, even 
as it belongs to the same power to be at rest and to be in movement. 
Wherefore it belongs also to the same power to will and to choose: and on 
this account the will and the free-will are not two powers, but one.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> {Boulesis} is distinct from {thelesis} on account of a 
distinction, not of powers, but of acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Choice and will---that is, the act of willing ---are 
different acts: yet they belong to the same power, as also to understand 
and to reason, as we have said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[83] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellect is compared to the will as moving the will. 
And therefore there is no need to distinguish in the will an active and a 
passive will.<br>
