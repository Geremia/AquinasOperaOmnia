inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether one angel speaks to another?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the inferior speaks to the superior?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one angel does not speak to another. For 
Gregory says (Moral. xviii) that, in the state of the resurrection "each 
one's body will not hide his mind from his fellows." Much less, 
therefore, is one angel's mind hidden from another. But speech manifests 
to another what lies hidden in the mind. Therefore it is not necessary 
that one angel should speak to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, speech is twofold; interior, whereby one speaks to 
oneself; and exterior, whereby one speaks to another. But exterior speech 
takes place by some sensible sign, as by voice, or gesture, or some 
bodily member, as the tongue, or the fingers, and this cannot apply to 
the angels. Therefore one angel does not speak to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the speaker incites the hearer to listen to what he 
says. But it does not appear that one angel incites another to listen; 
for this happens among us by some sensible sign. Therefore one angel does 
not speak to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A1">1 Cor. 13:1</a>): "If I speak with the 
tongues of men and of angels."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angels speak in a certain way. But, as Gregory says 
(Moral. ii): "It is fitting that our mind, rising above the properties of 
bodily speech, should be lifted to the sublime and unknown methods of 
interior speech."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand how one angel speaks to another, we must consider that, as 
we explained above (<A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="FP082.html#FPQ82A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), when treating of the actions and powers 
of the soul, the will moves the intellect to its operation. Now an 
intelligible object is present to the intellect in three ways; first, 
habitually, or in the memory, as Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 6,7); 
secondly, as actually considered or conceived; thirdly, as related to 
something else. And it is clear that the intelligible object passes from 
the first to the second stage by the command of the will, and hence in 
the definition of habit these words occur, "which anyone uses when he 
wills." So likewise the intelligible object passes from the second to the 
third stage by the will; for by the will the concept of the mind is 
ordered to something else, as, for instance, either to the performing of 
an action, or to being made known to another. Now when the mind turns 
itself to the actual consideration of any habitual knowledge, then a 
person speaks to himself; for the concept of the mind is called "the 
interior word." And by the fact that the concept of the angelic mind is 
ordered to be made known to another by the will of the angel himself, the 
concept of one angel is made known to another; and in this way one angel 
speaks to another; for to speak to another only means to make known the 
mental concept to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our mental concept is hidden by a twofold obstacle. The 
first is in the will, which can retain the mental concept within, or can 
direct it externally. In this way God alone can see the mind of another, 
according to 1 Cor. 2:11: "What man knoweth the things of a man, but the 
spirit of a man that is in him?" The other obstacle whereby the mental 
concept is excluded from another one's knowledge, comes from the body; 
and so it happens that even when the will directs the concept of the mind 
to make itself known, it is not at once make known to another; but some 
sensible sign must be used. Gregory alludes to this fact when he says 
(Moral. ii): "To other eyes we seem to stand aloof as it  were behind the 
wall of the body; and when we wish to make ourselves known, we go out as 
it were by the door of the tongue to show what we really are." But an 
angel is under no such obstacle, and so he can make his concept known to 
another at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> External speech, made by the voice, is a necessity for us 
on account of the obstacle of the body. Hence it does not befit an angel; 
but only interior speech belongs to him, and this includes not only the 
interior speech by mental concept, but also its being ordered to 
another's knowledge by the will. So the tongue of an angel is called 
metaphorically the angel's power, whereby he manifests his mental concept.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is no need to draw the attention of the good angels, 
inasmuch as they always see each other in the Word; for as one ever sees 
the other, so he ever sees what is ordered to himself. But because by 
their very nature they can speak to each other, and even now the bad 
angels speak to each other, we must say that the intellect is moved by 
the intelligible object just as sense is affected by the sensible object. 
Therefore, as sense is aroused by the sensible object, so the mind of an 
angel can be aroused to attention by some intelligible power.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the inferior angel speaks to the superior?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the inferior angel does not speak to the 
superior. For on the text (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A1">1 Cor. 13:1</a>), "If I speak with the tongues of 
men and of angels," a gloss remarks that the speech of the angels is an 
enlightenment whereby the superior enlightens the inferior. But the 
inferior never enlightens the superior, as was above explained (<A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore neither do the inferior speak to the superior.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as was said above (<A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), to enlighten means 
merely to acquaint one man of what is known to another; and this is to 
speak. Therefore to speak and to enlighten are the same; so the same 
conclusion follows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. ii): "God speaks to the angels by 
the very fact that He shows to their hearts His hidden and invisible 
things." But this is to enlighten them. Therefore, whenever God speaks, 
He enlightens. In the same way every angelic speech is an enlightening. 
Therefore an inferior angel can in no way speak to a superior angel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the exposition of Dionysius (Coel. Hier. 
vii), the inferior angels said to the superior: "Who is this King of 
Glory?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The inferior angels can speak to the superior. To make 
this clear, we must consider that every angelic enlightening is an 
angelic speech; but on the other hand, not every speech is an 
enlightening; because, as we have said (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), for one  angel to speak to 
another angel means nothing else, but that by his own will he directs his 
mental concept in such a way, that it becomes known to the other. Now 
what the mind conceives may be reduced to a twofold principle; to God 
Himself, Who is the primal truth; and to the will of the one who 
understands, whereby we actually consider anything. But because truth is 
the light of the intellect, and God Himself is the rule of all truth; the 
manifestation of what is conceived by the mind, as depending on the 
primary truth, is both speech and enlightenment; for example, when one 
man says to another: "Heaven was created by God"; or, "Man is an animal." 
The manifestation, however, of what depends on the will of the one who 
understands, cannot be called an enlightenment, but is only a speech; for 
instance, when one says to another: "I wish to learn this; I wish to do 
this or that." The reason is that the created will is not a light, nor a 
rule of truth; but participates of light. Hence to communicate what comes 
from the created will is not, as such, an enlightening. For to know what 
you may will, or what you may understand does not belong to the 
perfection of my intellect; but only to know the truth in reality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is clear that the angels are called superior or inferior by 
comparison with this principle, God; and therefore enlightenment, which 
depends on the principle which is God, is conveyed only by the superior 
angels to the inferior. But as regards the will as the principle, he who 
wills is first and supreme; and therefore the manifestation of what 
belongs to the will, is conveyed to others by the one who wills. In that 
manner both the superior angels speak to the inferior, and the inferior 
speak to the superior.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this clearly appear the replies to the first and second objections.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every speech of God to the angels is an enlightening; 
because since the will of God is the rule of truth, it belongs to the 
perfection and enlightenment of the created mind to know even what God 
wills. But the same does not apply to the will of the angels, as was 
explained above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an angel speaks to God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an angel does not speak to God. For speech 
makes known something to another. But an angel cannot make known anything 
to God, Who knows all things. Therefore an angel does not speak to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to speak is to order the mental concept in reference to 
another, as was shown above (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But an angel ever orders his mental 
concept to God. So if an angel speaks to God, he ever speaks to God; 
which in some ways appears to be unreasonable, since an angel sometimes 
speaks to another angel. Therefore it seems that an angel never speaks to 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Zach. 1:12): "The angel of the Lord 
answered and said: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on 
Jerusalem." Therefore an angel speaks to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), the angel speaks by ordering 
his mental concept to something else. Now one thing is ordered to another 
in a twofold manner. In one way for the purpose of giving one thing to 
another, as in natural things the agent is ordered to the patient, and in 
human speech the teacher is ordered to the learner; and in this sense an 
angel in no way speaks to God either of what concerns the truth, or of 
whatever depends on the created will; because God is the principle and 
source of all truth and of all will. In another way one thing is ordered 
to another to receive something, as in natural things the passive is 
ordered to the agent, and in human speech the disciple to the master; and 
in this way an angel speaks to God, either by consulting the Divine will 
of what ought to be done, or by admiring the Divine excellence which he 
can never comprehend; thus Gregory says (Moral. ii) that "the angels 
speak to God, when by contemplating what is above themselves they rise to 
emotions of admiration."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Speech is not always for the purpose of making something 
known to another; but is sometimes finally ordered to the purpose of 
manifesting something to the speaker himself; as when the disciples ask 
instruction from the master.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angels are ever speaking to God in the sense of 
praising and admiring Him and His works; but they speak to Him by 
consulting Him about what ought to be done whenever they have to perform 
any new work, concerning which they desire enlightenment.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether local distance influences the angelic speech?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that local distance affects the angelic speech. For 
as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 13): "An angel works where he is." 
But speech is an angelic operation. Therefore, as an angel is in a 
determinate place, it seems that an angel's speech is limited by the 
bounds of that place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a speaker cries out on account of the distance of the 
hearer. But it is said of the Seraphim that "they cried one to another" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++6%3A3">Is. 6:3</a>). Therefore in the angelic speech local distance has some effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said that the rich man in hell spoke to Abraham, 
notwithstanding the local distance (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++16%3A24">Lk. 16:24</a>). Much less therefore does 
local distance impede the speech of one angel to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angelic speech consists in an intellectual operation, 
as explained above (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3). And the intellectual operation of an 
angel abstracts from the "here and now." For even our own intellectual 
operation takes place by abstraction from the  "here and now," except 
accidentally on the part of the phantasms, which do not exist at all in 
an angel. But as regards whatever is abstracted from "here and now," 
neither difference of time nor local distance has any influence whatever. 
Hence in the angelic speech local distance is no impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The angelic speech, as above explained (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), is 
interior; perceived, nevertheless, by another; and therefore it exists in 
the angel who speaks, and consequently where the angel is who speaks. But 
as local distance does not prevent one angel seeing another, so neither 
does it prevent an angel perceiving what is ordered to him on the part of 
another; and this is to perceive his speech.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The cry mentioned is not a bodily voice raised by reason of 
the local distance; but is taken to signify the magnitude of what is 
said, or the intensity of the affection, according to what Gregory says 
(Moral. ii): "The less one desires, the less one cries out."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the angels know what one speaks to 
another. For unequal local distance is the reason why all men do not know 
what one man says to another. But in the angelic speech local distance 
has no effect, as above explained (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore all the angels know 
what one speaks to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the angels have the intellectual power in common. So 
if the mental concept of one ordered to another is known by one, it is 
for the same reason known by all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, enlightenment is a kind of speech. But the enlightenment 
of one angel by another extends to all the angels, because, as Dionysius 
says (Coel. Hier. xv): "Each one of the heavenly beings communicates what 
he learns to the others." Therefore the speech of one angel to another 
extends to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above explained (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), the mental concept of one 
angel can be perceived by another when the angel who possesses the 
concept refers it by his will to another. Now a thing can be ordered 
through some cause to one thing and not to another; consequently the 
concept of one (angel) may be known by one and not by another; and 
therefore an angel can perceive the speech of one angel to another; 
whereas others do not, not through the obstacle of local distance, but on 
account of the will so ordering, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this appear the replies to the first and second objections. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[107] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Enlightenment is of those truths that emanate from the 
first rule of truth, which is the principle common to all the angels; and 
in that way all enlightenments are common to all. But speech may be of 
something ordered to the principle of the created will, which is proper 
to each angel; and in this way it is not necessary that these speeches 
should be common to all.<br>
