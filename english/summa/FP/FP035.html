<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next inquire concerning the image: about which there are two points 
of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP035.html#FPQ35A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Image in God is said personally?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP035.html#FPQ35A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this name belongs to the Son alone?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that image is not said personally of God. For 
Augustine (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i) says, "The Godhead of the 
Holy Trinity and the Image whereunto man is made are one." Therefore 
Image is said of God essentially, and not personally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Hilary says (De Synod.): "An image is a like species of 
that which it represents." But species or form is said of God 
essentially. Therefore so also is Image.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Image is derived from imitation, which implies "before" 
and "after." But in the divine persons there is no "before" and "after." 
Therefore Image cannot be a personal name in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 1): "What is more absurd 
than to say that an image is referred to itself?" Therefore the Image in 
God is a relation, and is thus a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Image includes the idea of similitude. Still, not any 
kind of similitude suffices for the notion of image, but only similitude 
of species, or at least of some specific sign. In corporeal things the 
specific sign consists chiefly in the figure. For we see that the species 
of different animals are of different figures; but not of different 
colors. Hence if the color of anything is depicted on a wall, this is not 
called an image unless the figure is likewise depicted. Further, neither 
the similitude of species or of figure is enough for an image, which 
requires also the idea of origin; because, as Augustine says (Questions. 
lxxxiii, qu. 74): "One egg is not the image of another, because it is not 
derived from it." Therefore for a true image it is required that one 
proceeds from another like to it in species, or at least in specific 
sign. Now whatever imports procession or origin in God, belongs to the 
persons. Hence the name "Image" is a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Image, properly speaking, means whatever proceeds forth in 
likeness to another. That to the likeness of which anything proceeds, is 
properly speaking called the exemplar, and is improperly called the 
image. Nevertheless Augustine (Fulgentius) uses the name of Image in this 
sense when he says that the divine nature of the Holy Trinity is the 
Image to whom man was made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Species," as mentioned by Hilary in the definition of 
image, means the form derived from one thing to another. In this sense 
image is said to be the species of anything, as that which is assimilated 
to anything is called its form, inasmuch as it has a like form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Imitation in God does not signify posteriority, but only 
assimilation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the name of Image is proper to the Son?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the name of Image is not proper to the Son; 
because, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 18), "The Holy Ghost is the 
Image of the Son." Therefore Image does not belong to the Son alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, similitude in expression belongs to the nature of an 
image, as Augustine says (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 74). But this belongs to the 
Holy Ghost, Who proceeds from another by way of similitude. Therefore the 
Holy Ghost is an Image; and so to be Image does not belong to the Son 
alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man is also called the image of God, according to 1 Cor. 
11:7, "The man ought not to cover his head, for he is the image and the 
glory of God." Therefore Image is not proper to the Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 2): "The Son alone is the 
Image of the Father."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Greek Doctors commonly say that the Holy Ghost is the 
Image of both the Father and of the Son; but the Latin Doctors attribute 
the name Image to the Son alone. For it is not found in the canonical 
Scripture except as applied to the Son; as in the words, "Who is the 
Image of the invisible God, the firstborn of creatures" (Col. 1:15) and 
again: "Who being the brightness of His glory, and the figure of His 
substance." (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++1:3">Heb. 1:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some explain this by the fact that the Son agrees with the Father, not 
in nature only, but also in the notion of principle: whereas the Holy 
Ghost agrees neither with the Son, nor with the Father in any notion. 
This, however, does not seem to suffice. Because as it is not by reason 
of the relations that we consider either equality or inequality in God, 
as Augustine says (De Trin. v, 6), so neither (by reason thereof do we 
consider) that similitude which is essential to image. Hence others say 
that the Holy Ghost cannot be called the Image of the Son, because there 
cannot be an image of an image; nor of the Father, because again the 
image must be immediately related to that which it is the image; and the 
Holy Ghost is related to the Father through the Son; nor again is He the 
Image of the Father and the Son, because then there would be one image of 
two; which is impossible. Hence it follows that the Holy Ghost is in no 
way an Image. But this is no proof: for the Father and the Son are one 
principle of the Holy Ghost, as we shall explain further on (<A Href="FP036.html#FPQ36OUTP1">Question [36]</a>, <A Href="FP036.html#FPQ36A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence there is nothing to prevent there being one Image of the Father 
and of the Son, inasmuch as they are one; since even man is one image of 
the whole Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] Body Para. 3/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we must explain the matter otherwise by saying that, as the 
Holy Ghost, although by His procession He receives the nature of the 
Father, as the Son also receives it, nevertheless is not said to be 
"born"; so, although He receives the likeness of the Father, He is not 
called the Image; because the Son proceeds as word, and it is essential 
to word to be like species with that whence it proceeds; whereas this 
does not essentially belong to love, although it may belong to that love 
which is the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He is the divine love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene and the other Greek Doctors commonly employ the 
term image as meaning a perfect similitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the Holy Ghost is like to the Father and the Son, 
still it does not follow that He is the Image, as above explained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The image of a thing may be found in something in two ways. 
In one way it is found in something of the same specific nature; as the 
image of the king is found in his son. In another way it is found in 
something of a different nature, as the king's image on the coin. In the 
first sense the Son is the Image of the Father; in the second sense man 
is called the image of God; and therefore in order to express the 
imperfect character of the divine image in man, man is not simply called 
the image, but "to the image," whereby is expressed a certain movement of 
tendency to perfection. But it cannot be said that the Son of God is "to 
the image," because He is the perfect Image of the Father.<br>
