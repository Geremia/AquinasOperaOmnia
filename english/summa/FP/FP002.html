<br>
THE EXISTENCE OF GOD (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the chief aim of sacred doctrine is to teach the knowledge of 
God, not only as He is in Himself, but also as He is the beginning of 
things and their last end, and especially of rational creatures, as is 
clear from what has been already said, therefore, in our endeavor to 
expound this science, we shall treat: (1) Of God; (2) Of the rational 
creature's advance towards God; (3) Of Christ, Who as man, is our way to 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] Out. Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In treating of God there will be a threefold division, for we shall 
consider: (1) Whatever concerns the Divine Essence; (2) Whatever concerns 
the distinctions of Persons; (3) Whatever concerns the procession of 
creatures from Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] Out. Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the Divine Essence, we must consider: (1) Whether God exists? 
(2) The manner of His existence, or, rather, what is NOT the manner of 
His existence; (3) Whatever concerns His operations---namely, His 
knowledge, will, power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] Out. Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first, there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the proposition "God exists" is self-evident?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is demonstrable?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether God exists?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the existence of God is self-evident. Now those 
things are said to be self-evident to us the knowledge of which is 
naturally implanted in us, as we can see in regard to first principles. 
But as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 1,3), "the knowledge of God is 
naturally implanted in all." Therefore the existence of God is 
self-evident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things are said to be self-evident which are known 
as soon as the terms are known, which the Philosopher (1 Poster. iii) 
says is true of the first principles of demonstration. Thus, when the 
nature of a whole and of a part is known, it is at once recognized that 
every whole is greater than its part. But as soon as the signification of 
the word "God" is understood, it is at once seen that God exists. For by 
this word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be 
conceived. But that which exists actually and mentally is greater than 
that which exists only mentally. Therefore, since as soon as the word 
"God" is understood it exists mentally, it also follows that it exists 
actually. Therefore the proposition "God exists" is self-evident. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the existence of truth is self-evident. For whoever 
denies the existence of truth grants that truth does not exist: and, if 
truth does not exist, then the proposition "Truth does not exist" is 
true: and if there is anything true, there must be truth. But God is 
truth itself: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++14:6">Jn. 14:6</a>) 
Therefore "God exists" is self-evident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No one can mentally admit the opposite of what is 
self-evident; as the Philosopher (Metaph. iv, lect. vi) states concerning 
the first principles of demonstration. But the opposite of the 
proposition "God is" can be mentally admitted: "The fool said in his 
heart, There is no God" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++52:1">Ps. 52:1</a>). Therefore, that God exists is not 
self-evident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the 
one hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the other, 
self-evident in itself, and to us. A proposition is self-evident because 
the predicate is included in the essence of the subject, as "Man is an 
animal," for animal is contained in the essence of man. If, therefore the 
essence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition 
will be self-evident to all; as is clear with regard to the first 
principles of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no 
one is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such 
like. If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate 
and subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, 
but not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject 
of the proposition. Therefore, it happens, as Boethius says (Hebdom., the 
title of which is: "Whether all that is, is good"), "that there are some 
mental concepts self-evident only to the learned, as that incorporeal 
substances are not in space." Therefore I say that this proposition, "God 
exists," of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the 
subject, because God is His own existence as will be hereafter shown 
(<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now because we do not know the essence of God, the 
proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by 
things that are more known to us, though less known in their 
nature---namely, by effects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To know that God exists in a general and confused way is 
implanted in us by nature, inasmuch as God is man's beatitude. For man 
naturally desires happiness, and what is naturally desired by man must be 
naturally known to him. This, however, is not to know absolutely that God 
exists; just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same as to 
know that Peter is approaching, even though it is Peter who is 
approaching; for many there are who imagine that man's perfect good which 
is happiness, consists in riches, and others in pleasures, and others in 
something else.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Perhaps not everyone who hears this word "God" understands 
it to signify something than which nothing greater can be thought, seeing 
that some have believed God to be a body. Yet,  granted that everyone 
understands that by this word "God" is signified something than which 
nothing greater can be thought, nevertheless, it does not therefore 
follow that he understands that what the word signifies exists actually, 
but only that it exists mentally. Nor can it be argued that it actually 
exists, unless it be admitted that there actually exists something than 
which nothing greater can be thought; and this precisely is not admitted 
by those who hold that God does not exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The existence of truth in general is self-evident but the 
existence of a Primal Truth is not self-evident to us.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it can be demonstrated that God exists?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated. For it 
is an article of faith that God exists. But what is of faith cannot be 
demonstrated, because a demonstration produces scientific knowledge; 
whereas faith is of the unseen (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++11:1">Heb. 11:1</a>). Therefore it cannot be 
demonstrated that God exists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the essence is the middle term of demonstration. But we 
cannot know in what God's essence consists, but solely in what it does 
not consist; as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 4). Therefore we cannot 
demonstrate that God exists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the existence of God were demonstrated, this could 
only be from His effects. But His effects are not proportionate to Him, 
since He is infinite and His effects are finite; and between the finite 
and infinite there is no proportion. Therefore, since a cause cannot be 
demonstrated by an effect not proportionate to it, it seems that the 
existence of God cannot be demonstrated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says: "The invisible things of Him are 
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:20">Rm. 1:20</a>). 
But this would not be unless the existence of God could be demonstrated 
through the things that are made; for the first thing we must know of 
anything is whether it exists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the 
cause, and is called "a priori," and this is to argue from what is prior 
absolutely. The other is through the effect, and is called a 
demonstration "a posteriori"; this is to argue from what is prior 
relatively only to us. When an effect is better known to us than its 
cause, from the effect we proceed to the knowledge of the cause. And from 
every effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated, so 
long as its effects are better known to us; because since every effect 
depends upon its cause, if the effect exists, the cause must pre-exist. 
Hence the existence of God, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, 
can be demonstrated from those of His effects which are known to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The existence of God and other like truths about  God, 
which can be known by natural reason, are not articles of faith, but are 
preambles to the articles; for faith presupposes natural knowledge, even 
as grace presupposes nature, and perfection supposes something that can 
be perfected. Nevertheless, there is nothing to prevent a man, who cannot 
grasp a proof, accepting, as a matter of faith, something which in itself 
is capable of being scientifically known and demonstrated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the existence of a cause is demonstrated from an 
effect, this effect takes the place of the definition of the cause in 
proof of the cause's existence. This is especially the case in regard to 
God, because, in order to prove the existence of anything, it is 
necessary to accept as a middle term the meaning of the word, and not its 
essence, for the question of its essence follows on the question of its 
existence. Now the names given to God are derived from His effects; 
consequently, in demonstrating the existence of God from His effects, we 
may take for the middle term the meaning of the word "God".<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From effects not proportionate to the cause no perfect 
knowledge of that cause can be obtained. Yet from every effect the 
existence of the cause can be clearly demonstrated, and so we can 
demonstrate the existence of God from His effects; though from them we 
cannot perfectly know God as He is in His essence.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God exists?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two 
contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the 
word "God" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God 
existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the 
world. Therefore God does not exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted 
for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that 
everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, 
supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one 
principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one 
principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to 
suppose God's existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in the person of God: "I am Who am." (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++3:14">Ex. 3:14</a>)
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The existence of God can be proved in five ways.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is 
certain, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in 
motion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for 
nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards 
which it is in motion; whereas a thing moves  inasmuch as it is in act. 
For motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from 
potentiality to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality 
to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality. Thus that 
which is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which is potentially hot, to 
be actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible 
that the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in 
the same respect, but only in different respects. For what is actually 
hot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously 
potentially cold. It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and 
in the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it 
should move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in 
motion by another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in 
motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that 
by another again. But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there 
would be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that 
subsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the 
first mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the 
hand. Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion 
by no other; and this everyone understands to be God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world 
of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case 
known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be 
the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which 
is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to 
infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first 
is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause 
of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only 
one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if 
there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no 
ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is 
possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, 
neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient 
causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit 
a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We 
find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be, since they 
are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are 
possible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to 
exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. 
Therefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there 
could have been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now 
there would be nothing in existence, because that which does not exist 
only begins to exist by something already existing. Therefore, if at one 
time nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything 
to have begun to exist; and thus even now nothing would be in 
existence---which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely 
possible, but there must exist something the existence of  which is 
necessary. But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by 
another, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary 
things which have their necessity caused by another, as has been already 
proved in regard to efficient causes. Therefore we cannot but postulate 
the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not 
receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. 
This all men speak of as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among 
beings there are some more and some less good, true, noble and the like. 
But "more" and "less" are predicated of different things, according as 
they resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as 
a thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that 
which is hottest; so that there is something which is truest, something 
best, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost 
being; for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being, 
as it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the maximum in any genus is the cause 
of all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the cause of 
all hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all 
beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; 
and this we call God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that 
things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, 
and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the 
same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not 
fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever 
lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by 
some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot 
to its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by 
whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): "Since God is the 
highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless 
His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of 
evil." This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow 
evil to exist, and out of it produce good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since nature works for a determinate end under the 
direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be 
traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done 
voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than 
human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that 
are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable 
and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the 
Article.<br>
