    THE END OR TERM OF THE PRODUCTION OF MAN (NINE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now treat of the end or term of man's production, inasmuch as he is said
    to be made "to the image and likeness of God." There are under this head
    nine points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the image of God is in
    man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the image of God is in
    irrational creatures?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the image of God is in the
    angels more than in man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the image of God is in
    every man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the image of God is in man
    by comparison with the Essence, or with all the Divine Persons, or with one
    of them?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the image of God is in
    man, as to his mind only?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the image of God is in
    man's power or in his habits and acts?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the image of God is in man
    by comparison with every object?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A9THEP1">(9)</a> Of the difference between "image"
    and "likeness."

  <h3 align="left">Whether the image of God is in man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God is not in
    man. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++40%3A18"
      >Is. 40:18</a
    >): "To whom have you likened God? or what image will you make for Him?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to be the image of God is the property
    of the First-Begotten, of Whom the Apostle says (Col. 1:15): "Who is the
    image of the invisible God, the First-Born of every creature." Therefore the
    image of God is not to be found in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Hilary says (De Synod [*Super i can.
    Synod. Ancyr.]) that "an image is of the same species as that which it
    represents"; and he also says that "an image is the undivided and united
    likeness of one thing adequately representing another." But there is no
    species common to both God and man; nor can there be a comparison of
    equality between God and man. Therefore there can be no image of God in
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A26"
      >Gn. 1:26</a
    >): "Let Us make man to Our own image and likeness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 74):
    "Where an image exists, there forthwith is likeness; but where there is
    likeness, there is not necessarily an image." Hence it is clear that
    likeness is essential to an image; and that an image adds something to
    likeness---namely, that it is copied from something else. For an "image" is
    so called because it is produced as an imitation of something else;
    wherefore, for instance, an egg, however much like and equal to another egg,
    is not called an image of the other egg, because it is not copied from
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But equality does not belong to the essence of an image; for as Augustine
    says (Questions. 83, qu. 74): "Where there is an image there is not
    necessarily equality," as we see in a person's image reflected in a glass.
    Yet this is of the essence of a perfect image; for in a perfect image
    nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a copy. Now it
    is manifest that in man there is some likeness to God, copied from God as
    from an exemplar; yet this likeness is not one of equality, for such an
    exemplar infinitely excels its copy. Therefore there is in man a likeness to
    God; not, indeed, a perfect likeness, but imperfect. And Scripture implies
    the same when it says that man was made "to" God's likeness; for the
    preposition "to" signifies a certain approach, as of something at a
    distance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Prophet speaks of bodily images made
    by man. Therefore he says pointedly: "What image will you make for Him?" But
    God made a spiritual image to Himself in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The First-Born of creatures is the
    perfect Image of God, reflecting perfectly that of which He is the Image,
    and so He is said to be the "Image," and never "to the image." But man is
    said to be both "image" by reason of the likeness; and "to the image" by
    reason of the imperfect likeness. And since the perfect likeness to God
    cannot be except in an identical nature, the Image of God exists in His
    first-born Son; as the image of the king is in his son, who is of the same
    nature as himself: whereas it exists in man as in an alien nature, as the
    image of the king is in a silver coin, as Augustine says explains in De
    decem Chordis (Serm. ix, al, xcvi, De Tempore).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As unity means absence of division, a
    species is said to be the same as far as it is one. Now a thing is said to
    be one not only numerically, specifically, or generically, but also
    according to a certain analogy or proportion. In this sense a creature is
    one with God, or like to Him; but when Hilary says "of a thing which
    adequately represents another," this is to be understood of a perfect
    image.<br />

    Whether the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God is to be
    found in irrational creatures. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): "Effects
    are contingent images of their causes." But God is the cause not only of
    rational, but also of irrational creatures. Therefore the image of God is to
    be found in irrational creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more distinct a likeness is, the
    nearer it approaches to the nature of an image. But Dionysius says (Div.
    Nom. iv) that "the solar ray has a very great similitude to the Divine
    goodness." Therefore it is made to the image of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more perfect anything is in
    goodness, the more it is like God. But the whole universe is more perfect in
    goodness than man; for though each individual thing is good, all things
    together are called "very good" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A31"
      >Gn. 1:31</a
    >). Therefore the whole universe is to the image of God, and not only
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Boethius (De Consol. iii) says of God:
    "Holding the world in His mind, and forming it into His image." Therefore
    the whole world is to the image of God, and not only the rational
    creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. vi, 12): "Man's
    excellence consists in the fact that God made him to His own image by giving
    him an intellectual soul, which raises him above the beasts of the field."
    Therefore things without intellect are not made to God's image.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Not every likeness, not even what is copied
    from something else, is sufficient to make an image; for if the likeness be
    only generic, or existing by virtue of some common accident, this does not
    suffice for one thing to be the image of another. For instance, a worm,
    though from man it may originate, cannot be called man's image, merely
    because of the generic likeness. Nor, if anything is made white like
    something else, can we say that it is the image of that thing; for whiteness
    is an accident belonging to many species. But the nature of an image
    requires likeness in species; thus the image of the king exists in his son:
    or, at least, in some specific accident, and chiefly in the shape; thus, we
    speak of a man's image in copper. Whence Hilary says pointedly that "an
    image is of the same species."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is manifest that specific likeness follows the ultimate difference.
    But some things are like to God first and most commonly because they exist;
    secondly, because they live; and thirdly because they know or understand;
    and these last, as Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 51) "approach so near
    to God in likeness, that among all creatures nothing comes nearer to Him."
    It is clear, therefore, that intellectual creatures alone, properly
    speaking, are made to God's image.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Everything imperfect is a participation
    of what is perfect. Therefore even what falls short of the nature of an
    image, so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to God, participates in
    some degree the nature of an image. So Dionysius says that effects are
    "contingent images of their causes"; that is, as much as they happen
    [contingit] to be so, but not absolutely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dionysius compares the solar ray to
    Divine goodness, as regards its causality; not as regards its natural
    dignity which is involved in the idea of an image.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The universe is more perfect in goodness
    than the intellectual creature as regards extension and diffusion; but
    intensively and collectively the likeness to the Divine goodness is found
    rather in the intellectual creature, which has a capacity for the highest
    good. Or else we may say that a part is not rightly divided against the
    whole, but only against another part. Wherefore, when we say that the
    intellectual nature alone is to the image of God, we do not mean that the
    universe in any part is not to God's image, but that the other parts are
    excluded.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Boethius here uses the word "image" to
    express the likeness which the product of an art bears to the artistic
    species in the mind of the artist. Thus every creature is an image of the
    exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind. We are not, however, using the
    word "image" in this sense; but as it implies a likeness in nature, that is,
    inasmuch as all things, as being, are like to the First Being; as living,
    like to the First Life; and as intelligent, like to the Supreme Wisdom.<br />

    Whether the angels are more to the image of God than man is?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels are not more to the
    image of God than man is. For Augustine says in a sermon de Imagine xliii
    (de verbis Apost. xxvii) that God granted to no other creature besides man
    to be to His image. Therefore it is not true to say that the angels are more
    than man to the image of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Questions. 83,
    qu. 51), "man is so much to God's image that God did not make any creature
    to be between Him and man: and therefore nothing is more akin to Him." But a
    creature is called God's image so far as it is akin to God. Therefore the
    angels are not more to the image of God than man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a creature is said to be to God's image
    so far as it is of an intellectual nature. But the intellectual nature does
    not admit of intensity or remissness; for it is not an accidental thing,
    since it is a substance. Therefore the angels are not more to the image of
    God than man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv): "The
    angel is called a "seal of resemblance" [Ezech. 28:12] because in him the
    resemblance of the Divine image is wrought with greater expression."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of God's image in two ways. First,
    we may consider in it that in which the image chiefly consists, that is, the
    intellectual nature. Thus the image of God is more perfect in the angels
    than in man, because their intellectual nature is more perfect, as is clear
    from what has been said (<a href="FP058.html#FPQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="FP058.html#FPQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>,
    <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Secondly, we may
    consider the image of God in man as regards its accidental qualities, so far
    as to observe in man a certain imitation of God, consisting in the fact that
    man proceeds from man, as God from God; and also in the fact that the whole
    human soul is in the whole body, as God from God; and also in the fact that
    the whole human soul is in the whole body, and again, in every part, as God
    is in regard to the whole world. In these and the like things the image of
    God is more perfect in man than it is in the angels. But these do not of
    themselves belong to the nature of the Divine image in man, unless we
    presuppose the first likeness, which is in the intellectual nature;
    otherwise even brute animals would be to God's image. Therefore, as in their
    intellectual nature, the angels are more to the image of God than man is, we
    must grant that, absolutely speaking, the angels are more to the image of
    God than man is, but that in some respects man is more like to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine excludes the inferior
    creatures bereft of reason from the image of God; but not the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As fire is said to be specifically the
    most subtle of bodies, while, nevertheless, one kind of fire is more subtle
    than another; so we say that nothing is more like to God than the human soul
    in its generic and intellectual nature, because as Augustine had said
    previously, "things which have knowledge, are so near to Him in likeness
    that of all creatures none are nearer." Wherefore this does not mean that
    the angels are not more to God's image.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When we say that substance does not
    admit of more or less, we do not mean that one species of substance is not
    more perfect than another; but that one and the same individual does not
    participate in its specific nature at one time more than at another; nor do
    we mean that a species of substance is shared among different individuals in
    a greater or lesser degree.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the image of God is found in every man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God is not found
    in every man. For the Apostle says that "man is the image of God, but woman
    is the image [Vulg. glory] of man" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++11%3A7"
      >1 Cor. 11:7</a
    >). Therefore, as woman is an individual of the human species, it is clear
    that every individual is not an image of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A29"
      >Rm. 8:29</a
    >): "Whom God foreknew, He also predestined to be made conformable to the
    image of His Son." But all men are not predestined. Therefore all men have
    not the conformity of image.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, likeness belongs to the nature of the
    image, as above explained (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a
    >). But by sin man becomes unlike God. Therefore he loses the image of
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++38%3A7"
      >Ps. 38:7</a
    >): "Surely man passeth as an image."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since man is said to be the image of God by
    reason of his intellectual nature, he is the most perfectly like God
    according to that in which he can best imitate God in his intellectual
    nature. Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God
    understands and loves Himself. Wherefore we see that the image of God is in
    man in three ways. First, inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for
    understanding and loving God; and this aptitude consists in the very nature
    of the mind, which is common to all men. Secondly, inasmuch as man actually
    and habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly; and this image
    consists in the conformity of grace. Thirdly, inasmuch as man knows and
    loves God perfectly; and this image consists in the likeness of glory.
    Wherefore on the words, "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed
    upon us" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++4%3A7"
      >Ps. 4:7</a
    >), the gloss distinguishes a threefold image of "creation," of
    "re-creation," and of "likeness." The first is found in all men, the second
    only in the just, the third only in the blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The image of God, in its principal
    signification, namely the intellectual nature, is found both in man and in
    woman. Hence after the words, "To the image of God He created him," it is
    added, "Male and female He created them" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A27"
      >Gn. 1:27</a
    >). Moreover it is said "them" in the plural, as Augustine (Gen. ad lit.
    iii, 22) remarks, lest it should be thought that both sexes were united in
    one individual. But in a secondary sense the image of God is found in man,
    and not in woman: for man is the beginning and end of woman; as God is the
    beginning and end of every creature. So when the Apostle had said that "man
    is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man," he adds his
    reason for saying this: "For man is not of woman, but woman of man; and man
    was not created for woman, but woman for man."<br />

    Whether the image of God is in man according to the Trinity of Persons?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God does not
    exist in man as to the Trinity of Persons. For Augustine says (Fulgentius De
    Fide ad Petrum i): "One in essence is the Godhead of the Holy Trinity; and
    one is the image to which man was made." And Hilary (De Trin. v) says: "Man
    is made to the image of that which is common in the Trinity." Therefore the
    image of God in man is of the Divine Essence, and not of the Trinity of
    Persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is said (De Eccl. Dogmat.) that the
    image of God in man is to be referred to eternity. Damascene also says (De
    Fide Orth. ii, 12) that the image of God in man belongs to him as "an
    intelligent being endowed with free-will and self-movement." Gregory of
    Nyssa (De Homin. Opificio xvi) also asserts that, when Scripture says that
    "man was made to the image of God, it means that human nature was made a
    participator of all good: for the Godhead is the fulness of goodness." Now
    all these things belong more to the unity of the Essence than to the
    distinction of the Persons. Therefore the image of God in man regards, not
    the Trinity of Persons, but the unity of the Essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an image leads to the knowledge of that
    of which it is the image. Therefore, if there is in man the image of God as
    to the Trinity of Persons; since man can know himself by his natural reason,
    it follows that by his natural knowledge man could know the Trinity of the
    Divine Persons; which is untrue, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1"
      >Question [32]</a
    >, <a href="FP032.html#FPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the name of Image is not applicable to
    any of the Three Persons, but only to the Son; for Augustine says (De Trin.
    vi, 2) that "the Son alone is the image of the Father." Therefore, if in man
    there were an image of God as regards the Person, this would not be an image
    of the Trinity, but only of the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. iv): "The plurality of
    the Divine Persons is proved from the fact that man is said to have been
    made to the image of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> as we have seen (<a
      href="FP040.html#FPQ40OUTP1"
      >Question [40]</a
    >, <a href="FP040.html#FPQ40A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the distinction of
    the Divine Persons is only according to origin, or, rather, relations of
    origin. Now the mode of origin is not the same in all things, but in each
    thing is adapted to the nature thereof; animated things being produced in
    one way, and inanimate in another; animals in one way, and plants in
    another. Wherefore it is manifest that the distinction of the Divine Persons
    is suitable to the Divine Nature; and therefore to be to the image of God by
    imitation of the Divine Nature does not exclude being to the same image by
    the representation of the Divine Persons: but rather one follows from the
    other. We must, therefore, say that in man there exists the image of God,
    both as regards the Divine Nature and as regards the Trinity of Persons; for
    also in God Himself there is one Nature in Three Persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Thus it is clear how to solve the first two objections.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument would avail if the image
    of God in man represented God in a perfect manner. But, as Augustine says
    (De Trin. xv, 6), there is a great difference between the trinity within
    ourselves and the Divine Trinity. Therefore, as he there says: "We see,
    rather than believe, the trinity which is in ourselves; whereas we believe
    rather than see that God is Trinity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some have said that in man there is an
    image of the Son only. Augustine rejects this opinion (De Trin. xii, 5,6).
    First, because as the Son is like to the Father by a likeness of essence, it
    would follow of necessity if man were made in likeness to the Son, that he
    is made to the likeness of the Father. Secondly, because if man were made
    only to the image of the Son, the Father would not have said, "Let Us make
    man to Our own image and likeness"; but "to Thy image." When, therefore, it
    is written, "He made him to the image of God," the sense is not that the
    Father made man to the image of the Son only, Who is God, as some explained
    it, but that the Divine Trinity made man to Its image, that is, of the whole
    Trinity. When it is said that God "made man to His image," this can be
    understood in two ways: first, so that this preposition "to" points to the
    term of the making, and then the sense is, "Let Us make man in such a way
    that Our image may be in him." Secondly, this preposition 'to' may point to
    the exemplar cause, as when we say, "This book is made (like) to that one."
    Thus the image of God is the very Essence of God, Which is incorrectly
    called an image forasmuch as image is put for the exemplar. Or, as some say,
    the Divine Essence is called an image because thereby one Person imitates
    another.<br />

    Whether the image of God is in man as regards the mind only?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God is not only
    in man's mind. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++11%3A7"
      >1 Cor. 11:7</a
    >) that "the man is the image... of God." But man is not only mind.
    Therefore the image of God is to be observed not only in his mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A27"
      >Gn. 1:27</a
    >): "God created man to His own image; to the image of God He created him;
    male and female He created them." But the distinction of male and female is
    in the body. Therefore the image of God is also in the body, and not only in
    the mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an image seems to apply principally to
    the shape of a thing. But shape belongs to the body. Therefore the image of
    God is to be seen in man's body also, and not in his mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit.
    xii, 7,24) there is a threefold vision in us, "corporeal," "spiritual," or
    imaginary, and "intellectual." Therefore, if in the intellectual vision that
    belongs to the mind there exists in us a trinity by reason of which we are
    made to the image of God, for the like reason there must be another trinity
    in the others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A23,24"
      >Eph. 4:23,24</a
    >): "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man." Whence
    we are given to understand that our renewal which consists in putting on the
    new man, belongs to the mind. Now, he says (Col. 3:10): "Putting on the new"
    man; "him who is renewed unto knowledge" of God, "according to the image of
    Him that created him," where the renewal which consists in putting on the
    new man is ascribed to the image of God. Therefore to be to the image of God
    belongs to the mind only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> While in all creatures there is some kind of
    likeness to God, in the rational creature alone we find a likeness of
    "image" as we have explained above (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2); whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a "trace." Now
    the intellect or mind is that whereby the rational creature excels other
    creatures; wherefore this image of God is not found even in the rational
    creature except in the mind; while in the other parts, which the rational
    creature may happen to possess, we find the likeness of a "trace," as in
    other creatures to which, in reference to such parts, the rational creature
    can be likened. We may easily understand the reason of this if we consider
    the way in which a "trace," and the way in which an "image," represents
    anything. An "image" represents something by likeness in species, as we have
    said; while a "trace" represents something by way of an effect, which
    represents the cause in such a way as not to attain to the likeness of
    species. For imprints which are left by the movements of animals are called
    "traces": so also ashes are a trace of fire, and desolation of the land a
    trace of a hostile army.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we may observe this difference between rational creatures and
    others, both as to the representation of the likeness of the Divine Nature
    in creatures, and as to the representation in them of the uncreated Trinity.
    For as to the likeness of the Divine Nature, rational creatures seem to
    attain, after a fashion, to the representation of the species, inasmuch as
    they imitate God, not only in being and life, but also in intelligence, as
    above explained (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); whereas
    other creatures do not understand, although we observe in them a certain
    trace of the Intellect that created them, if we consider their disposition.
    Likewise as the uncreated Trinity is distinguished by the procession of the
    Word from the Speaker, and of Love from both of these, as we have seen (<a
      href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1"
      >Question [28]</a
    >, <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>); so we may say that in
    rational creatures wherein we find a procession of the word in the
    intellect, and a procession of the love in the will, there exists an image
    of the uncreated Trinity, by a certain representation of the species. In
    other creatures, however, we do not find the principle of the word, and the
    word and love; but we do see in them a certain trace of the existence of
    these in the Cause that produced them. For in the fact that a creature has a
    modified and finite nature, proves that it proceeds from a principle; while
    its species points to the (mental) word of the maker, just as the shape of a
    house points to the idea of the architect; and order points to the maker's
    love by reason of which he directs the effect to a good end; as also the use
    of the house points to the will of the architect. So we find in man a
    likeness to God by way of an "image" in his mind; but in the other parts of
    his being by way of a "trace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man is called to the image of God; not
    that he is essentially an image; but that the image of God is impressed on
    his mind; as a coin is an image of the king, as having the image of the
    king. Wherefore there is no need to consider the image of God as existing in
    every part of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 5),
    some have thought that the image of God was not in man individually, but
    severally. They held that "the man represents the Person of the Father;
    those born of man denote the person of the Son; and that the woman is a
    third person in likeness to the Holy Ghost, since she so proceeded from man
    as not to be his son or daughter." All of this is manifestly absurd; first,
    because it would follow that the Holy Ghost is the principle of the Son, as
    the woman is the principle of the man's offspring; secondly, because one man
    would be only the image of one Person; thirdly, because in that case
    Scripture should not have mentioned the image of God in man until after the
    birth of the offspring. Therefore we must understand that when Scripture had
    said, "to the image of God He created him," it added, "male and female He
    created them," not to imply that the image of God came through the
    distinction of sex, but that the image of God belongs to both sexes, since
    it is in the mind, wherein there is no sexual distinction of sex, but that
    the image of God belongs to both sexes, since it is in the mind, wherein
    there is no sexual distinction. Wherefore the Apostle (Col. 3:10), after
    saying, "According to the image of Him that created him," added, "Where
    there is neither male nor female" [*these words are in reality from Gal.
    3:28] (Vulg. "neither Gentile nor Jew").<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the image of God in man is not
    to be found in his bodily shape, yet because "the body of man alone among
    terrestrial animals is not inclined prone to the ground, but is adapted to
    look upward to heaven, for this reason we may rightly say that it is made to
    God's image and likeness, rather than the bodies of other animals," as
    Augustine remarks (Questions. 83, qu. 51). But this is not to be understood
    as though the image of God were in man's body; but in the sense that the
    very shape of the human body represents the image of God in the soul by way
    of a trace.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Both in the corporeal and in the
    imaginary vision we may find a trinity, as Augustine says (De Trin. xi, 2).
    For in corporeal vision there is first the species of the exterior body;
    secondly, the act of vision, which occurs by the impression on the sight of
    a certain likeness of the said species; thirdly, the intention of the will
    applying the sight to see, and to rest on what is seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, in the imaginary vision we find first the species kept in the
    memory; secondly, the vision itself, which is caused by the penetrative
    power of the soul, that is, the faculty of imagination, informed by the
    species; and thirdly, we find the intention of the will joining both
    together. But each of these trinities falls short of the Divine image. For
    the species of the external body is extrinsic to the essence of the soul;
    while the species in the memory, though not extrinsic to the soul, is
    adventitious to it; and thus in both cases the species falls short of
    representing the connaturality and co-eternity of the Divine Persons. The
    corporeal vision, too, does not proceed only from the species of the
    external body, but from this, and at the same time from the sense of the
    seer; in like manner imaginary vision is not from the species only which is
    preserved in the memory, but also from the imagination. For these reasons
    the procession of the Son from the Father alone is not suitably represented.
    Lastly the intention of the will joining the two together, does not proceed
    from them either in corporeal or spiritual vision. Wherefore the procession
    of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son is not thus properly
    represented.<br />

    Whether the image of God is to be found in the acts of the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of God is not found
    in the acts of the soul. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 26), that "man
    was made to God's image, inasmuch as we exist and know that we exist, and
    love this existence and knowledge." But to exist does not signify an act.
    Therefore the image of God is not to be found in the soul's acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Trin. ix, 4) assigns God's
    image in the soul to these three things---mind, knowledge, and love. But
    mind does not signify an act, but rather the power or the essence of the
    intellectual soul. Therefore the image of God does not extend to the acts of
    the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Trin. x, 11) assigns the
    image of the Trinity in the soul to "memory, understanding, and will." But
    these three are "natural powers of the soul," as the Master of the Sentences
    says (1 Sent. D iii). Therefore the image of God is in the powers, and does
    not extend to the acts of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the image of the Trinity always remains
    in the soul. But an act does not always remain. Therefore the image of God
    does not extend to the acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Trin. xi, 2 seqq.) assigns the
    trinity in the lower part of the soul, in relation to the actual vision,
    whether sensible or imaginative. Therefore, also, the trinity in the mind,
    by reason of which man is like to God's image, must be referred to actual
    vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As above explained (<a
      href="FP093.html#FPQ93A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), a certain representation of the species belongs to the nature of an
    image. Hence, if the image of the Divine Trinity is to be found in the soul,
    we must look for it where the soul approaches the nearest to a
    representation of the species of the Divine Persons. Now the Divine Persons
    are distinct from each other by reason of the procession of the Word from
    the Speaker, and the procession of Love connecting Both. But in our soul
    word "cannot exist without actual thought," as Augustine says (De Trin. xiv,
    7). Therefore, first and chiefly, the image of the Trinity is to be found in
    the acts of the soul, that is, inasmuch as from the knowledge which we
    possess, by actual thought we form an internal word; and thence break forth
    into love. But, since the principles of acts are the habits and powers, and
    everything exists virtually in its principle, therefore, secondarily and
    consequently, the image of the Trinity may be considered as existing in the
    powers, and still more in the habits, forasmuch as the acts virtually exist
    therein.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our being bears the image of God so far
    as if is proper to us, and excels that of the other animals, that is to say,
    in so far as we are endowed with a mind. Therefore, this trinity is the same
    as that which Augustine mentions (De Trin. ix, 4), and which consists in
    mind, knowledge, and love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine observed this trinity, first,
    as existing in the mind. But because the mind, though it knows itself
    entirely in a certain degree, yet also in a way does not know
    itself---namely, as being distinct from others (and thus also it searches
    itself, as Augustine subsequently proves---De Trin. x, 3,4); therefore, as
    though knowledge were not in equal proportion to mind, he takes three things
    in the soul which are proper to the mind, namely, memory, understanding, and
    will; which everyone is conscious of possessing; and assigns the image of
    the Trinity pre-eminently to these three, as though the first assignation
    were in part deficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine proves (De Trin. xiv, 7),
    we may be said to understand, will, and to love certain things, both when we
    actually consider them, and when we do not thing of them. When they are not
    under our actual consideration, they are objects of our memory only, which,
    in his opinion, is nothing else than habitual retention of knowledge and
    love [*Cf. Question [79], Article [7], ad 1]. "But since," as he says, "a
    word cannot be there without actual thought (for we think everything that we
    say, even if we speak with that interior word belonging to no nation's
    tongue), this image chiefly consists in these three things, memory,
    understanding, and will. And by understanding I mean here that whereby we
    understand with actual thought; and by will, love, or dilection I mean that
    which unites this child with its parent." From which it is clear that he
    places the image of the Divine Trinity more in actual understanding and
    will, than in these as existing in the habitual retention of the memory;
    although even thus the image of the Trinity exists in the soul in a certain
    degree, as he says in the same place. Thus it is clear that memory,
    understanding, and will are not three powers as stated in the Sentences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Someone might answer by referring to
    Augustine's statement (De Trin. xiv, 6), that "the mind ever remembers
    itself, ever understands itself, ever loves itself"; which some take to mean
    that the soul ever actually understands, and loves itself. But he excludes
    this interpretation by adding that "it does not always think of itself as
    actually distinct from other things." Thus it is clear that the soul always
    understands and loves itself, not actually but habitually; though we might
    say that by perceiving its own act, it understands itself whenever it
    understands anything. But since it is not always actually understanding, as
    in the case of sleep, we must say that these acts, although not always
    actually existing, yet ever exist in their principles, the habits and
    powers. Wherefore, Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 4): "If the rational soul
    is made to the image of God in the sense that it can make use of reason and
    intellect to understand and consider God, then the image of God was in the
    soul from the beginning of its existence."<br />

    Whether the image of the Divine Trinity is in the soul only by comparison
    with God as its object?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the image of the Divine
    Trinity is in the soul not only by comparison with God as its object. For
    the image of the Divine Trinity is to be found in the soul, as shown above
    (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), according as the word
    in us proceeds from the speaker; and love from both. But this is to be found
    in us as regards any object. Therefore the image of the Divine Trinity is in
    our mind as regards any object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 4) that
    "when we seek trinity in the soul, we seek it in the whole of the soul,
    without separating the process of reasoning in temporal matters from the
    consideration of things eternal." Therefore the image of the Trinity is to
    be found in the soul, even as regards temporal objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is by grace that we can know and love
    God. If, therefore, the image of the Trinity is found in the soul by reason
    of the memory, understanding, and will or love of God, this image is not in
    man by nature but by grace, and thus is not common to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the saints in heaven are most perfectly
    conformed to the image of God by the beatific vision; wherefore it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3%3A18"
      >2 Cor. 3:18</a
    >): "We... are transformed into the same image from glory to glory." But
    temporal things are known by the beatific vision. Therefore the image of God
    exists in us even according to temporal things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 12): "The image
    of God exists in the mind, not because it has a remembrance of itself, loves
    itself, and understands itself; but because it can also remember,
    understand, and love God by Whom it was made." Much less, therefore, is the
    image of God in the soul, in respect of other objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As above explained (<a
      href="FP093.html#FPQ93ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,7), image means a likeness which in some degree, however small, attains to
    a representation of the species. Wherefore we need to seek in the image of
    the Divine Trinity in the soul some kind of representation of species of the
    Divine Persons, so far as this is possible to a creature. Now the Divine
    Persons, as above stated (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a
    >,7), are distinguished from each other according to the procession of the
    word from the speaker, and the procession of love from both. Moreover the
    Word of God is born of God by the knowledge of Himself; and Love proceeds
    from God according as He loves Himself. But it is clear that diversity of
    objects diversifies the species of word and love; for in the human mind the
    species of a stone is specifically different from that of a horse, which
    also the love regarding each of them is specifically different. Hence we
    refer the Divine image in man to the verbal concept born of the knowledge of
    God, and to the love derived therefrom. Thus the image of God is found in
    the soul according as the soul turns to God, or possesses a nature that
    enables it to turn to God. Now the mind may turn towards an object in two
    ways: directly and immediately, or indirectly and mediately; as, for
    instance, when anyone sees a man reflected in a looking-glass he may be said
    to be turned towards that man. So Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 8), the "the
    mind remembers itself, understands itself, and loves itself. If we perceive
    this, we perceive a trinity, not, indeed, God, but, nevertheless, rightly
    called the image of God." But this is due to the fact, not that the mind
    reflects on itself absolutely, but that thereby it can furthermore turn to
    God, as appears from the authority quoted above (Arg. On the contrary).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> For the notion of an image it is not
    enough that something proceed from another, but it is also necessary to
    observe what proceeds and whence it proceeds; namely, that what is Word of
    God proceeds from knowledge of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In all the soul we may see a kind of
    trinity, not, however, as though besides the action of temporal things and
    the contemplation of eternal things, "any third thing should be required to
    make up the trinity," as he adds in the same passage. But in that part of
    the reason which is concerned with temporal things, "although a trinity may
    be found; yet the image of God is not to be seen there," as he says farther
    on; forasmuch as this knowledge of temporal things is adventitious to the
    soul. Moreover even the habits whereby temporal things are known are not
    always present; but sometimes they are actually present, and sometimes
    present only in memory even after they begin to exist in the soul. Such is
    clearly the case with faith, which comes to us temporally for this present
    life; while in the future life faith will no longer exist, but only the
    remembrance of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The meritorious knowledge and love of
    God can be in us only by grace. Yet there is a certain natural knowledge and
    love as seen above (<a href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>,
    <a href="FP012.html#FPQ12A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="FP056.html#FPQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FP056.html#FPQ56A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FP060.html#FPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="FP060.html#FPQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). This, too, is natural
    that the mind, in order to understand God, can make use of reason, in which
    sense we have already said that the image of God abides ever in the soul;
    "whether this image of God be so obsolete," as it were clouded, "as almost
    to amount to nothing," as in those who have not the use of reason; "or
    obscured and disfigured," as in sinners; or "clear and beautiful," as in the
    just; as Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 6).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> By the vision of glory temporal things
    will be seen in God Himself; and such a vision of things temporal will
    belong to the image of God. This is what Augustine means (De Trin. xiv, 6),
    when he says that "in that nature to which the mind will blissfully adhere,
    whatever it sees it will see as unchangeable"; for in the Uncreated Word are
    the types of all creatures.<br />

    Whether "likeness" is properly distinguished from "image"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "likeness" is not properly
    distinguished from "image." For "genus" is not properly distinguished from
    "species." Now, "likeness" is to "image" as genus to species: because,
    "where there is image, forthwith there is likeness, but not conversely" as
    Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 74). Therefore "likeness" is not properly
    to be distinguished from "image."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the nature of the image consists not
    only in the representation of the Divine Persons, but also in the
    representation of the Divine Essence, to which representation belong
    immortality and indivisibility. So it is not true to say that the "likeness
    is in the essence because it is immortal and indivisible; whereas the image
    is in other things" (Sent. ii, D, xvi).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the image of God in man is
    threefold---the image of nature, of grace, and of glory, as above explained
    (<a href="FP093.html#FPQ93A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But innocence and
    righteousness belong to grace. Therefore it is incorrectly said (Sent. ii,
    D, xvi) "that the image is taken from the memory, the understanding and the
    will, while the likeness is from innocence and righteousness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, knowledge of truth belongs to the
    intellect, and love of virtue to the will; which two things are parts of the
    image. Therefore it is incorrect to say (Sent. ii, D, xvi) that "the image
    consists in the knowledge of truth, and the likeness in the love of
    virtue."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 51): "Some
    consider that these two were mentioned not without reason, namely "image"
    and "likeness," since, if they meant the same, one would have sufficed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Likeness is a kind of unity, for oneness in
    quality causes likeness, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, Did. iv, 15).
    Now, since "one" is a transcendental, it is both common to all, and adapted
    to each single thing, just as the good and the true. Wherefore, as the good
    can be compared to each individual thing both as its preamble, and as
    subsequent to it, as signifying some perfection in it, so also in the same
    way there exists a kind of comparison between "likeness" and "image." For
    the good is a preamble to man, inasmuch as man is an individual good; and,
    again, the good is subsequent to man, inasmuch as we may say of a certain
    man that he is good, by reason of his perfect virtue. In like manner,
    likeness may be considered in the light of a preamble to image, inasmuch as
    it is something more general than image, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP093.html#FPQ93A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >): and, again, it may be considered as subsequent to image, inasmuch as it
    signifies a certain perfection of image. For we say that an image is like or
    unlike what it represents, according as the representation is perfect or
    imperfect. Thus likeness may be distinguished from image in two ways: first
    as its preamble and existing in more things, and in this sense likeness
    regards things which are more common than the intellectual properties,
    wherein the image is properly to be seen. In this sense it is stated
    (Questions. 83, qu. 51) that "the spirit" (namely, the mind) without doubt
    was made to the image of God. "But the other parts of man," belonging to the
    soul's inferior faculties, or even to the body, "are in the opinion of some
    made to God's likeness." In this sense he says (De Quant. Animae ii) that
    the likeness of God is found in the soul's incorruptibility; for corruptible
    and incorruptible are differences of universal beings. But likeness may be
    considered in another way, as signifying the expression and perfection of
    the image. In this sense Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that the
    image implies "an intelligent being, endowed with free-will and
    self-movement, whereas likeness implies a likeness of power, as far as this
    may be possible in man." In the same sense "likeness" is said to belong to
    "the love of virtue": for there is no virtue without love of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Likeness" is not distinct from "image"
    in the general notion of "likeness" (for thus it is included in "image");
    but so far as any "likeness" falls short of "image," or again, as it
    perfects the idea of "image."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The soul's essence belongs to the
    "image," as representing the Divine Essence in those things which belong to
    the intellectual nature; but not in those conditions subsequent to general
    notions of being, such as simplicity and indissolubility.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even certain virtues are natural to the
    soul, at least, in their seeds, by reason of which we may say that a natural
    "likeness" exists in the soul. Nor it is unfitting to us the term "image"
    from one point of view and from another the term "likeness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Love of the word, which is knowledge
    loved, belongs to the nature of "image"; but love of virtue belongs to
    "likeness," as virtue itself belongs to likeness.<br />
