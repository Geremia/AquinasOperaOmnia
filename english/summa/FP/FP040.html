<H3 Align="Center">OF THE PERSONS AS COMPARED TO THE RELATIONS OR PROPERTIES (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now consider the persons in connection with the relations, or 
properties; and there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether relation is the same as person?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the relations distinguish and constitute the persons?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether mental abstraction of the relations from the persons leaves 
the hypostases distinct?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the relations, according to our mode of understanding, 
presuppose the acts of the persons, or contrariwise?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in God relation is not the same as person. For 
when things are identical, if one is multiplied the others are 
multiplied. But in one person there are several relations; as in the 
person of the Father there is paternity and common spiration. Again, one 
relation exists in two person, as common spiration in the Father and in 
the Son. Therefore relation is not the same as person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv, text. 24), 
nothing is contained by itself. But relation is in the person; nor can it 
be said that this occurs because they are identical, for otherwise 
relation would be also in the essence. Therefore relation, or property, 
is not the same as person in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when several things are identical, what is predicated of 
one is predicated of the others. But all that is predicated of a Person 
is not predicated of His property. For we  say that the Father begets; 
but not that the paternity is begetting. Therefore property is not the 
same as person in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> in God "what is" and "whereby it is" are the same, 
according to Boethius (De Hebdom.). But the Father is Father by 
paternity. In the same way, the other properties are the same as the 
persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Different opinions have been held on this point. Some 
have said that the properties are not the persons, nor in the persons; 
and these have thought thus owing to the mode of signification of the 
relations, which do not indeed signify existence "in" something, but 
rather existence "towards" something. Whence, they styled the relations 
"assistant," as above explained (<A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But since relation, 
considered as really existing in God, is the divine essence Itself, and 
the essence is the same as person, as appears from what was said above 
(<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), relation must necessarily be the same as person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others, therefore, considering this identity, said that the properties 
were indeed the persons; but not "in" the persons; for, they said, there 
are no properties in God except in our way of speaking, as stated above 
(<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). We must, however, say that there are properties in God; as 
we have shown (<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). These are designated by abstract terms, 
being forms, as it were, of the persons. So, since the nature of a form 
requires it to be "in" that of which it is the form, we must say that the 
properties are in the persons, and yet that they are the persons; as we 
say that the essence is in God, and yet is God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Person and property are really the same, but differ in 
concept. Consequently, it does not follow that if one is multiplied, the 
other must also be multiplied. We must, however, consider that in God, by 
reason of the divine simplicity, a twofold real identity exists as 
regards what in creatures are distinct. For, since the divine simplicity 
excludes the composition of matter and form, it follows that in God the 
abstract is the same as the concrete, as "Godhead" and "God." And as the 
divine simplicity excludes the composition of subject and accident, it 
follows that whatever is attributed to God, is His essence Itself; and 
so, wisdom and power are the same in God, because they are both in the 
divine essence. According to this twofold identity, property in God is 
the same person. For personal properties are the same as the persons 
because the abstract and the concrete are the same in God; since they are 
the subsisting persons themselves, as paternity is the Father Himself, 
and filiation is the Son, and procession is the Holy Ghost. But the 
non-personal properties are the same as the persons according to the 
other reason of identity, whereby whatever is attributed to God is His 
own essence. Thus, common spiration is the same as the person of the 
Father, and the person of the Son; not that it is one self-subsisting 
person; but that as there is one essence in the two persons, so also 
there is one property in the two persons, as above explained (<A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The properties are said to be in the essence, only by mode 
of identity; but in the persons they exist by mode of identity, not 
merely in reality, but also in the mode of signification; as the form 
exists in its subject. Thus the properties determine and distinguish the 
persons, but not the essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Notional participles and verbs signify the notional acts: 
and acts belong to a "suppositum." Now, properties are not designated as 
"supposita," but as forms of "supposita." And so their mode of 
signification is against notional participles and verbs being predicated 
of the properties.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the persons are distinguished by the relations?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the persons are not distinguished by the 
relations. For simple things are distinct by themselves. But the persons 
are supremely simple. Therefore they are distinguished by themselves, and 
not by the relation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a form is distinguished only in relation to its genus. 
For white is distinguished from black only by quality. But "hypostasis" 
signifies an individual in the genus of substance. Therefore the 
hypostases cannot be distinguished by relations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is absolute comes before what is relative. But the 
distinction of the divine persons is the primary distinction. Therefore 
the divine persons are not distinguished by the relations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whatever presupposes distinction cannot be the first 
principle of distinction. But relation presupposes distinction, which 
comes into its definition; for a relation is essentially what is towards 
another. Therefore the first distinctive principle in God cannot be 
relation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Trin.): "Relation alone multiplies 
the Trinity of the divine persons."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In whatever multitude of things is to be found something 
common to all, it is necessary to seek out the principle of distinction. 
So, as the three persons agree in the unity of essence, we must seek to 
know the principle of distinction whereby they are several. Now, there 
are two principles of difference between the divine persons, and these 
are "origin" and "relation." Although these do not really differ, yet 
they differ in the mode of signification; for "origin" is signified by 
way of act, as "generation"; and "relation" by way of the form, as 
"paternity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, then, considering that relation follows upon act, have said that 
the divine hypostases are distinguished by origin, so that we may say 
that the Father is distinguished from the Son, inasmuch as the former 
begets and the latter is begotten. Further,  that the relations, or the 
properties, make known the distinctions of the hypostases or persons as 
resulting therefrom; as also in creatures the properties manifest the 
distinctions of individuals, which distinctions are caused by the 
material principles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This opinion, however, cannot stand---for two reasons. Firstly, because, 
in order that two things be understood as distinct, their distinction 
must be understood as resulting from something intrinsic to both; thus in 
things created it results from their matter or their form. Now origin of 
a thing does not designate anything intrinsic, but means the way from 
something, or to something; as generation signifies the way to a thing 
generated, and as proceeding from the generator. Hence it is not possible 
that what is generated and the generator should be distinguished by 
generation alone; but in the generator and in the thing generated we must 
presuppose whatever makes them to be distinguished from each other. In a 
divine person there is nothing to presuppose but essence, and relation or 
property. Whence, since the persons agree in essence, it only remains to 
be said that the persons are distinguished from each other by the 
relations. Secondly: because the distinction of the divine persons is not 
to be so understood as if what is common to them all is divided, because 
the common essence remains undivided; but the distinguishing principles 
themselves must constitute the things which are distinct. Now the 
relations or the properties distinguish or constitute the hypostases or 
persons, inasmuch as they are themselves the subsisting persons; as 
paternity is the Father, and filiation is the Son, because in God the 
abstract and the concrete do not differ. But it is against the nature of 
origin that it should constitute hypostasis or person. For origin taken 
in an active sense signifies proceeding from a subsisting person, so that 
it presupposes the latter; while in a passive sense origin, as 
"nativity," signifies the way to a subsisting person, and as not yet 
constituting the person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore better to say that the persons or hypostases are 
distinguished rather by relations than by origin. For, although in both 
ways they are distinguished, nevertheless in our mode of understanding 
they are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations; whence this name 
"Father" signifies not only a property, but also the hypostasis; whereas 
this term "Begetter" or "Begetting" signifies property only; forasmuch as 
this name "Father" signifies the relation which is distinctive and 
constitutive of the hypostasis; and this term "Begetter" or "Begotten" 
signifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the 
hypostasis.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The persons are the subsisting relations themselves. Hence 
it is not against the simplicity of the divine persons for them to be 
distinguished by the relations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The divine persons are not distinguished as regards being, 
in which they subsist, nor in anything absolute, but only as regards 
something relative. Hence relation suffices for  their distinction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The more prior a distinction is, the nearer it approaches 
to unity; and so it must be the least possible distinction. So the 
distinction of the persons must be by that which distinguishes the least 
possible; and this is by relation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Relation presupposes the distinction of the subjects, when 
it is an accident; but when the relation is subsistent, it does not 
presuppose, but brings about distinction. For when it is said that 
relation is by nature to be towards another, the word "another" signifies 
the correlative which is not prior, but simultaneous in the order of 
nature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the hypostases remain if the relations are mentally abstracted from the persons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the hypostases remain if the properties or 
relations are mentally abstracted from the persons. For that to which 
something is added, may be understood when the addition is taken away; as 
man is something added to animal which can be understood if rational be 
taken away. But person is something added to hypostasis; for person is "a 
hypostasis distinguished by a property of dignity." Therefore, if a 
personal property be taken away from a person, the hypostasis remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that the Father is Father, and that He is someone, are 
not due to the same reason. For as He is the Father by paternity, 
supposing He is some one by paternity, it would follow that the Son, in 
Whom there is not paternity, would not be "someone." So when paternity is 
mentally abstracted from the Father, He still remains "someone"---that 
is, a hypostasis. Therefore, if property be removed from person, the 
hypostasis remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. v, 6): "Unbegotten is not the 
same as Father; for if the Father had not begotten the Son, nothing would 
prevent Him being called unbegotten." But if He had not begotten the Son, 
there would be no paternity in Him. Therefore, if paternity be removed, 
there still remains the hypostasis of the Father as unbegotten.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. iv): "The Son has nothing else 
than birth." But He is Son by "birth." Therefore, if filiation be 
removed, the Son's hypostasis no more remains; and the same holds as 
regards the other persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Abstraction by the intellect is twofold---when the 
universal is abstracted from the particular, as animal abstracted from 
man; and when the form is abstracted from the matter, as the form of a 
circle is abstracted by the intellect from any sensible matter. The 
difference between these two abstractions consists in the fact that in 
the abstraction of the universal from  the particular, that from which 
the abstraction is made does not remain; for when the difference of 
rationality is removed from man, the man no longer remains in the 
intellect, but animal alone remains. But in the abstraction of the form 
from the matter, both the form and the matter remain in the intellect; 
as, for instance, if we abstract the form of a circle from brass, there 
remains in our intellect separately the understanding both of a circle, 
and of brass. Now, although there is no universal nor particular in God, 
nor form and matter, in reality; nevertheless, as regards the mode of 
signification there is a certain likeness of these things in God; and 
thus Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that "substance is common and 
hypostasis is particular." So, if we speak of the abstraction of the 
universal from the particular, the common universal essence remains in 
the intellect if the properties are removed; but not the hypostasis of 
the Father, which is, as it were, a particular.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as regards the abstraction of the form from the matter, if the 
non-personal properties are removed, then the idea of the hypostases and 
persons remains; as, for instance, if the fact of the Father's being 
unbegotten or spirating be mentally abstracted from the Father, the 
Father's hypostasis or person remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, the personal property be mentally abstracted, the idea of 
the hypostasis no longer remains. For the personal properties are not to 
be understood as added to the divine hypostases, as a form is added to a 
pre-existing subject: but they carry with them their own "supposita," 
inasmuch as they are themselves subsisting persons; thus paternity is the 
Father Himself. For hypostasis signifies something distinct in God, since 
hypostasis means an individual substance. So, as relation distinguishes 
and constitutes the hypostases, as above explained (<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows 
that if the personal relations are mentally abstracted, the hypostases no 
longer remain. Some, however, think, as above noted, that the divine 
hypostases are not distinguished by the relations, but only by origin; so 
that the Father is a hypostasis as not from another, and the Son is a 
hypostasis as from another by generation. And that the consequent 
relations which are to be regarded as properties of dignity, constitute 
the notion of a person, and are thus called "personal properties." Hence, 
if these relations are mentally abstracted, the hypostasis, but not the 
persons, remain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is impossible, for two reasons: first, because the relations 
distinguish and constitute the hypostases, as shown above (<A Href="FP040.html#FPQ40A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); 
secondly, because every hypostasis of a rational nature is a person, as 
appears from the definition of Boethius (De Duab. Nat.) that, "person is 
the individual substance of a rational nature." Hence, to have hypostasis 
and not person, it would be necessary to abstract the rationality from 
the nature, but not the property from the person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Person does not add to hypostasis a distinguishing property 
absolutely, but a distinguishing property  of dignity, all of which must 
be taken as the difference. Now, this distinguishing property is one of 
dignity precisely because it is understood as subsisting in a rational 
nature. Hence, if the distinguishing property be removed from the person, 
the hypostasis no longer remains; whereas it would remain were the 
rationality of the nature removed; for both person and hypostasis are 
individual substances. Consequently, in God the distinguishing relation 
belongs essentially to both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By paternity the Father is not only Father, but is a 
person, and is "someone," or a hypostasis. It does not follow, however, 
that the Son is not "someone" or a hypostasis; just as it does not follow 
that He is not a person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine does not mean to say that the hypostasis of the 
Father would remain as unbegotten, if His paternity were removed, as if 
innascibility constituted and distinguished the hypostasis of the Father; 
for this would be impossible, since "being unbegotten" says nothing 
positive and is only a negation, as he himself says. But he speaks in a 
general sense, forasmuch as not every unbegotten being is the Father. So, 
if paternity be removed, the hypostasis of the Father does not remain in 
God, as distinguished from the other persons, but only as distinguished 
from creatures; as the Jews understand it.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the notional acts are understood before the 
properties. For the Master of the Sentences says (Sent. i, D, xxvii) that 
"the Father always is, because He is ever begetting the Son." So it seems 
that generation precedes paternity in the order of intelligence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the order of intelligence every relation presupposes 
that on which it is founded; as equality presupposes quantity. But 
paternity is a relation founded on the action of generation. Therefore 
paternity presupposes generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, active generation is to paternity as nativity is to 
filiation. But filiation presupposes nativity; for the Son is so called 
because He is born. Therefore paternity also presupposes generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Generation is the operation of the person of the 
Father. But paternity constitutes the person of the Father. Therefore in 
the order of intelligence, paternity is prior to generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the opinion that the properties do not 
distinguish and constitute the hypostases in God, but only manifest them 
as already distinct and constituted, we must absolutely say that the 
relations in our mode of understanding follow upon the notional acts, so 
that we can say, without  qualifying the phrase, that "because He begets, 
He is the Father." A distinction, however, is needed if we suppose that 
the relations distinguish and constitute the divine hypostases. For 
origin has in God an active and passive signification---active, as 
generation is attributed to the Father, and spiration, taken for the 
notional act, is attributed to the Father and the Son; passive, as 
nativity is attributed to the Son, and procession to the Holy Ghost. For, 
in the order of intelligence, origin, in the passive sense, simply 
precedes the personal properties of the person proceeding; because 
origin, as passively understood, signifies the way to a person 
constituted by the property. Likewise, origin signified actively is prior 
in the order of intelligence to the non-personal relation of the person 
originating; as the notional act of spiration precedes, in the order of 
intelligence, the unnamed relative property common to the Father and the 
Son. The personal property of the Father can be considered in a twofold 
sense: firstly, as a relation; and thus again in the order of 
intelligence it presupposes the notional act, for relation, as such, is 
founded upon an act: secondly, according as it constitutes the person; 
and thus the notional act presupposes the relation, as an action 
presupposes a person acting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the Master says that "because He begets, He is 
Father," the term "Father" is taken as meaning relation only, but not as 
signifying the subsisting person; for then it would be necessary to say 
conversely that because He is Father He begets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection avails of paternity as a relation, but not 
as constituting a person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nativity is the way to the person of the Son; and so, in 
the order of intelligence, it precedes filiation, even as constituting 
the person of the Son. But active generation signifies a proceeding from 
the person of the Father; wherefore it presupposes the personal property 
of the Father.<br>
