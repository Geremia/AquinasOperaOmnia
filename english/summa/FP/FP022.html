</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having considered all that relates to the will absolutely, we must now 
proceed to those things which have relation to both the intellect and the 
will, namely providence, in respect to all created things; predestination 
and reprobation and all that is connected with these acts in respect 
especially of man as regards his eternal salvation. For in the science of 
morals, after the moral virtues themselves, comes the consideration of 
prudence, to which providence would seem to belong. Concerning God's 
providence there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP022.html#FPQ22A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether providence is suitably assigned to God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP022.html#FPQ22A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether everything comes under divine providence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP022.html#FPQ22A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether divine providence is immediately concerned with all things?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP022.html#FPQ22A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether divine providence imposes any necessity upon things foreseen?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that providence is not becoming to God. For providence, 
according to Tully (De Invent. ii), is a part of prudence. But prudence, 
since, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 5,9,18), it gives good 
counsel, cannot belong to God, Who never has any doubt for which He 
should take counsel. Therefore  providence cannot belong to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is in God, is eternal. But providence is not 
anything eternal, for it is concerned with existing things that are not 
eternal, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 29). Therefore there 
is no providence in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is nothing composite in God. But providence seems 
to be something composite, because it includes both the intellect and the 
will. Therefore providence is not in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (Wis. 14:3): "But Thou, Father, governest 
all things by providence [*Vulg. But 'Thy providence, O Father, governeth 
it.']."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is necessary to attribute providence to God. For all 
the good that is in created things has been created by God, as was shown 
above (<A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). In created things good is found not only as regards 
their substance, but also as regards their order towards an end and 
especially their last end, which, as was said above, is the divine 
goodness (<A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). This good of order existing in things created, is 
itself created by God. Since, however, God is the cause of things by His 
intellect, and thus it behooves that the type of every effect should 
pre-exist in Him, as is clear from what has gone before (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it 
is necessary that the type of the order of things towards their end 
should pre-exist in the divine mind: and the type of things ordered 
towards an end is, properly speaking, providence. For it is the chief 
part of prudence, to which two other parts are directed---namely, 
remembrance of the past, and understanding of the present; inasmuch as 
from the remembrance of what is past and the understanding of what is 
present, we gather how to provide for the future. Now it belongs to 
prudence, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 12), to direct other 
things towards an end whether in regard to oneself---as for instance, a 
man is said to be prudent, who orders well his acts towards the end of 
life--or in regard to others subject to him, in a family, city or 
kingdom; in which sense it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++24%3A45">Mt. 24:45</a>), "a faithful and wise 
servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family." In this way 
prudence or providence may suitably be attributed to God. For in God 
Himself there can be nothing ordered towards an end, since He is the last 
end. This type of order in things towards an end is therefore in God 
called providence. Whence Boethius says (De Consol. iv, 6) that 
"Providence is the divine type itself, seated in the Supreme Ruler; which 
disposeth all things": which disposition may refer either to the type of 
the order of things towards an end, or to the type of the order of parts 
in the whole.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 9,10), "Prudence 
is what, strictly speaking, commands all that 'ebulia' has rightly 
counselled and 'synesis' rightly judged" [*Cf. FS, Question [57], Article [6]]. Whence, 
though to take counsel may not be fitting to God, from the fact that 
counsel is an inquiry into matters that are doubtful,  nevertheless to 
give a command as to the ordering of things towards an end, the right 
reason of which He possesses, does belong to God, according to Ps. 148:6: 
"He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away." In this manner both 
prudence and providence belong to God. Although at the same time it may 
be said that the very reason of things to be done is called counsel in 
God; not because of any inquiry necessitated, but from the certitude of 
the knowledge, to which those who take counsel come by inquiry. Whence it 
is said: "Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His will" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++1%3A11">Eph. 1:11</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Two things pertain to the care of providence---namely, the 
"reason of order," which is called providence and disposition; and the 
execution of order, which is termed government. Of these, the first is 
eternal, and the second is temporal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Providence resides in the intellect; but presupposes the 
act of willing the end. Nobody gives a precept about things done for an 
end; unless he will that end. Hence prudence presupposes the moral 
virtues, by means of which the appetitive faculty is directed towards 
good, as the Philosopher says. Even if Providence has to do with the 
divine will and intellect equally, this would not affect the divine 
simplicity, since in God both the will and intellect are one and the same 
thing, as we have said above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>).<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that everything is not subject to divine providence. For 
nothing foreseen can happen by chance. If then everything was foreseen by 
God, nothing would happen by chance. And thus hazard and luck would 
disappear; which is against common opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a wise provider excludes any defect or evil, as far as 
he can, from those over whom he has a care. But we see many evils 
existing. Either, then, God cannot hinder these, and thus is not 
omnipotent; or else He does not have care for everything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever happens of necessity does not require 
providence or prudence. Hence, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 
5,9, 10,11): "Prudence is the right reason of things contingent 
concerning which there is counsel and choice." Since, then, many things 
happen from necessity, everything cannot be subject to providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whatsoever is left to itself cannot be subject to the 
providence of a governor. But men are left to themselves by God in 
accordance with the words: "God made man from the beginning, and left him 
in the hand of his own counsel" (Ecclus. 15:14). And particularly in 
reference to the wicked: "I let them go according  to the desires of 
their heart" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++80%3A13">Ps. 80:13</a>). Everything, therefore, cannot be subject to 
divine providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9%3A9">1 Cor. 9:9</a>): "God doth not care for 
oxen [*Vulg. 'Doth God take care for oxen?']": and we may say the same of 
other irrational creatures. Thus everything cannot be under the care of 
divine providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of Divine Wisdom: "She reacheth from end to 
end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly" (Wis. 8:1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Certain persons totally denied the existence of 
providence, as Democritus and the Epicureans, maintaining that the world 
was made by chance. Others taught that incorruptible things only were 
subject to providence and corruptible things not in their individual 
selves, but only according to their species; for in this respect they are 
incorruptible. They are represented as saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+22%3A14">Job 22:14</a>): "The clouds 
are His covert; and He doth not consider our things; and He walketh about 
the poles of heaven." Rabbi Moses, however, excluded men from the 
generality of things corruptible, on account of the excellence of the 
intellect which they possess, but in reference to all else that suffers 
corruption he adhered to the opinion of the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must say, however, that all things are subject to divine providence, 
not only in general, but even in their own individual selves. This is mad 
evident thus. For since every agent acts for an end, the ordering of 
effects towards that end extends as far as the causality of the first 
agent extends. Whence it happens that in the effects of an agent 
something takes place which has no reference towards the end, because the 
effect comes from a cause other than, and outside the intention of the 
agent. But the causality of God, Who is the first agent, extends to all 
being, not only as to constituent principles of species, but also as to 
the individualizing principles; not only of things incorruptible, but 
also of things corruptible. Hence all things that exist in whatsoever 
manner are necessarily directed by God towards some end; as the Apostle 
says: "Those things that are of God are well ordered [*Vulg.'Those powers 
that are, are ordained of God': 'Quae autem sunt, a Deo ordinatae sunt.' 
St. Thomas often quotes this passage, and invariably reads: 'Quae a Deo 
sunt, ordinata sunt.']" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13%3A1">Rm. 13:1</a>). Since, therefore, as the providence 
of God is nothing less than the type of the order of things towards an 
end, as we have said; it necessarily follows that all things, inasmuch as 
they participate in existence, must likewise be subject to divine 
providence. It has also been shown (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a>,11) that God knows all 
things, both universal and particular. And since His knowledge may be 
compared to the things themselves, as the knowledge of art to the objects 
of art, all things must of necessity come under His ordering; as all 
things wrought by art are subject to the ordering of that art.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is a difference between universal and  particular 
causes. A thing can escape the order of a particular cause; but not the 
order of a universal cause. For nothing escapes the order of a particular 
cause, except through the intervention and hindrance of some other 
particular cause; as, for instance, wood may be prevented from burning, 
by the action of water. Since then, all particular causes are included 
under the universal cause, it could not be that any effect should take 
place outside the range of that universal cause. So far then as an effect 
escapes the order of a particular cause, it is said to be casual or 
fortuitous in respect to that cause; but if we regard the universal 
cause, outside whose range no effect can happen, it is said to be 
foreseen. Thus, for instance, the meeting of two servants, although to 
them it appears a chance circumstance, has been fully foreseen by their 
master, who has purposely sent to meet at the one place, in such a way 
that the one knows not about the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is otherwise with one who has care of a particular 
thing, and one whose providence is universal, because a particular 
provider excludes all defects from what is subject to his care as far as 
he can; whereas, one who provides universally allows some little defect 
to remain, lest the good of the whole should be hindered. Hence, 
corruption and defects in natural things are said to be contrary to some 
particular nature; yet they are in keeping with the plan of universal 
nature; inasmuch as the defect in one thing yields to the good of 
another, or even to the universal good: for the corruption of one is the 
generation of another, and through this it is that a species is kept in 
existence. Since God, then, provides universally for all being, it 
belongs to His providence to permit certain defects in particular 
effects, that the perfect good of the universe may not be hindered, for 
if all evil were prevented, much good would be absent from the universe. 
A lion would cease to live, if there were no slaying of animals; and 
there would be no patience of martyrs if there were no tyrannical 
persecution. Thus Augustine says (Enchiridion 2): "Almighty God would in 
no wise permit evil to exist in His works, unless He were so almighty and 
so good as to produce good even from evil." It would appear that it was 
on account of these two arguments to which we have just replied, that 
some were persuaded to consider corruptible things---e.g. casual and evil 
things---as removed from the care of divine providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is not the author of nature; but he uses natural things 
in applying art and virtue to his own use. Hence human providence does 
not reach to that which takes place in nature from necessity; but divine 
providence extends thus far, since God is the author of nature. 
Apparently it was this argument that moved those who withdrew the course 
of nature from the care of divine providence, attributing it rather to 
the necessity of matter, as Democritus, and others of the ancients.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When it is said that God left man to himself, this does not 
mean that man is exempt from divine providence; but merely that he has 
not a prefixed operating force determined to only the one effect; as in 
the case of natural things, which are  only acted upon as though directed 
by another towards an end; and do not act of themselves, as if they 
directed themselves towards an end, like rational creatures, through the 
possession of free will, by which these are able to take counsel and make 
a choice. Hence it is significantly said: "In the hand of his own 
counsel." But since the very act of free will is traced to God as to a 
cause, it necessarily follows that everything happening from the exercise 
of free will must be subject to divine providence. For human providence 
is included under the providence of God, as a particular under a 
universal cause. God, however, extends His providence over the just in a 
certain more excellent way than over the wicked; inasmuch as He prevents 
anything happening which would impede their final salvation. For "to them 
that love God, all things work together unto good" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A28">Rm. 8:28</a>). But from 
the fact that He does not restrain the wicked from the evil of sin, He is 
said to abandon them: not that He altogether withdraws His providence 
from them; otherwise they would return to nothing, if they were not 
preserved in existence by His providence. This was the reason that had 
weight with Tully, who withdrew from the care of divine providence human 
affairs concerning which we take counsel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Since a rational creature has, through its free will, 
control over its actions, as was said above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>), it is subject 
to divine providence in an especial manner, so that something is imputed 
to it as a fault, or as a merit; and there is given it accordingly 
something by way of punishment or reward. In this way, the Apostle 
withdraws oxen from the care of God: not, however, that individual 
irrational creatures escape the care of divine providence; as was the 
opinion of the Rabbi Moses.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God has immediate providence over everything?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God has not immediate providence over all things. 
For whatever is contained in the notion of dignity, must be attributed to 
God. But it belongs to the dignity of a king, that he should have 
ministers; through whose mediation he provides for his subjects. 
Therefore much less has God Himself immediate providence over all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to providence to order all things to an end. 
Now the end of everything is its perfection and its good. But it 
appertains to every cause to direct its effect to good; wherefore every 
active cause is a cause of the effect of providence. If therefore God 
were to have immediate providence over all things, all secondary causes 
would be withdrawn.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Enchiridion 17) that, "It is better to 
be ignorant of some things than to know them, for example, vile things": 
and the Philosopher says the same (Metaph. xii, 51). But whatever is 
better must be assigned to God. Therefore He has not immediate providence 
over bad and vile things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+34%3A13">Job 34:13</a>): "What other hath He  appointed 
over the earth? or whom hath He set over the world which He made?" On 
which passage Gregory says (Moral. xxiv, 20): "Himself He ruleth the 
world which He Himself hath made."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things belong to providence---namely, the type of the 
order of things foreordained towards an end; and the execution of this 
order, which is called government. As regards the first of these, God has 
immediate providence over everything, because He has in His intellect the 
types of everything, even the smallest; and whatsoever causes He assigns 
to certain effects, He gives them the power to produce those effects. 
Whence it must be that He has beforehand the type of those effects in His 
mind. As to the second, there are certain intermediaries of God's 
providence; for He governs things inferior by superior, not on account of 
any defect in His power, but by reason of the abundance of His goodness; 
so that the dignity of causality is imparted even to creatures. Thus 
Plato's opinion, as narrated by Gregory of Nyssa (De Provid. viii, 3), is 
exploded. He taught a threefold providence. First, one which belongs to 
the supreme Deity, Who first and foremost has provision over spiritual 
things, and thus over the whole world as regards genus, species, and 
universal causes. The second providence, which is over the individuals of 
all that can be generated and corrupted, he attributed to the divinities 
who circulate in the heavens; that is, certain separate substances, which 
move corporeal things in a circular direction. The third providence, over 
human affairs, he assigned to demons, whom the Platonic philosophers 
placed between us and the gods, as Augustine tells us (De Civ. Dei, 1, 2: 
viii, 14).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It pertains to a king's dignity to have ministers who 
execute his providence. But the fact that he has not the plan of those 
things which are done by them arises from a deficiency in himself. For 
every operative science is the more perfect, the more it considers the 
particular things with which its action is concerned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's immediate provision over everything does not exclude 
the action of secondary causes; which are the executors of His order, as 
was said above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,8).<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is better for us not to know low and vile things, 
because by them we are impeded in our knowledge of what is better and 
higher; for we cannot understand many things simultaneously; because the 
thought of evil sometimes perverts the will towards evil. This does not 
hold with God, Who sees everything simultaneously at one glance, and 
whose will cannot turn in the direction of evil.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether providence imposes any necessity on things foreseen?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that divine providence imposes necessity upon things 
foreseen. For every effect that has a "per se" cause, either present or 
past, which it necessarily follows, happens from necessity; as the 
Philosopher proves (Metaph. vi, 7). But the  providence of God, since it 
is eternal, pre-exists; and the effect flows from it of necessity, for 
divine providence cannot be frustrated. Therefore divine providence 
imposes a necessity upon things foreseen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every provider makes his work as stable as he can, lest 
it should fail. But God is most powerful. Therefore He assigns the 
stability of necessity to things provided.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iv, 6): "Fate from the 
immutable source of providence binds together human acts and fortunes by 
the indissoluble connection of causes." It seems therefore that 
providence imposes necessity upon things foreseen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says that (Div. Nom. iv, 23) "to corrupt 
nature is not the work of providence." But it is in the nature of some 
things to be contingent. Divine providence does not therefore impose any 
necessity upon things so as to destroy their contingency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Divine providence imposes necessity upon some things; not 
upon all, as some formerly believed. For to providence it belongs to 
order things towards an end. Now after the divine goodness, which is an 
extrinsic end to all things, the principal good in things themselves is 
the perfection of the universe; which would not be, were not all grades 
of being found in things. Whence it pertains to divine providence to 
produce every grade of being. And thus it has prepared for some things 
necessary causes, so that they happen of necessity; for others contingent 
causes, that they may happen by contingency, according to the nature of 
their proximate causes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The effect of divine providence is not only that things 
should happen somehow; but that they should happen either by necessity or 
by contingency. Therefore whatsoever divine providence ordains to happen 
infallibly and of necessity happens infallibly and of necessity; and that 
happens from contingency, which the plan of divine providence conceives 
to happen from contingency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The order of divine providence is unchangeable and certain, 
so far as all things foreseen happen as they have been foreseen, whether 
from necessity or from contingency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[22] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That indissolubility and unchangeableness of which Boethius 
speaks, pertain to the certainty of providence, which fails not to 
produce its effect, and that in the way foreseen; but they do not pertain 
to the necessity of the effects. We must remember that properly speaking 
'necessary' and "contingent" are consequent upon being, as such. Hence 
the mode both of necessity and of contingency falls under the foresight 
of God, who provides universally for all being; not under the foresight 
of causes that provide only for some particular order of things.<br>
