<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider what belongs to the preservation of the species; and, 
first, of generation; secondly, of the state of the offspring. Under the 
first head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP098.html#FPQ98A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in the state of innocence there would have been generation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP098.html#FPQ98A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether generation would have been through coition?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem there would have been no generation in the state of 
innocence. For, as stated in Phys. v, 5, "corruption is contrary to 
generation." But contraries affect the same subject: also there would 
have been no corruption in the state of innocence. Therefore neither 
would there have been generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object of generation is the preservation  in the 
species of that which is corruptible in the individual. Wherefore there 
is no generation in those individual things which last for ever. But in 
the state of innocence man would have lived for ever. Therefore in the 
state of innocence there would have been no generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by generation man is multiplied. But the multiplication 
of masters requires the division of property, to avoid confusion of 
mastership. Therefore, since man was made master of the animals, it would 
have been necessary to make a division of rights when the human race 
increased by generation. This is against the natural law, according to 
which all things are in common, as Isidore says (Etym. v, 4). Therefore 
there would have been no generation in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1%3A28">Gn. 1:28</a>): "Increase and multiply, and 
fill the earth." But this increase could not come about save by 
generation, since the original number of mankind was two only. Therefore 
there would have been generation in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the state of innocence there would have been 
generation of offspring for the multiplication of the human race; 
otherwise man's sin would have been very necessary, for such a great 
blessing to be its result. We must, therefore, observe that man, by his 
nature, is established, as it were, midway between corruptible and 
incorruptible creatures, his soul being naturally incorruptible, while 
his body is naturally corruptible. We must also observe that nature's 
purpose appears to be different as regards corruptible and incorruptible 
things. For that seems to be the direct purpose of nature, which is 
invariable and perpetual; while what is only for a time is seemingly not 
the chief purpose of nature, but as it were, subordinate to something 
else; otherwise, when it ceased to exist, nature's purpose would become 
void.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, since in things corruptible none is everlasting and permanent 
except the species, it follows that the chief purpose of nature is the 
good of the species; for the preservation of which natural generation is 
ordained. On the other hand, incorruptible substances survive, not only 
in the species, but also in the individual; wherefore even the 
individuals are included in the chief purpose of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it belongs to man to beget offspring, on the part of the naturally 
corruptible body. But on the part of the soul, which is incorruptible, it 
is fitting that the multitude of individuals should be the direct purpose 
of nature, or rather of the Author of nature, Who alone is the Creator of 
the human soul. Wherefore, to provide for the multiplication of the human 
race, He established the begetting of offspring even in the state of 
innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the state of innocence the human body was in itself 
corruptible, but it could be preserved from corruption by the soul. 
Therefore, since generation belongs to things  corruptible, man was not 
to be deprived thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although generation in the state of innocence might not 
have been required for the preservation of the species, yet it would have 
been required for the multiplication of the individual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In our present state a division of possessions is necessary 
on account of the multiplicity of masters, inasmuch as community of 
possession is a source of strife, as the Philosopher says (Politic. ii, 
5). In the state of innocence, however, the will of men would have been 
so ordered that without any danger of strife they would have used in 
common, according to each one's need, those things of which they were 
masters---a state of things to be observed even now among many good men.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence there would have been generation by coition?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that generation by coition would not have existed 
in the state of innocence. For, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11; 
iv, 25), the first man in the terrestrial Paradise was "like an angel." 
But in the future state of the resurrection, when men will be like the 
angels, "they shall neither marry nor be married," as is written Mt. 
22:30. Therefore neither in paradise would there have been generation by 
coition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our first parents were created at the age of perfect 
development. Therefore, if generation by coition had existed before sin, 
they would have had intercourse while still in paradise: which was not 
the case according to Scripture (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++4%3A1">Gn. 4:1</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in carnal intercourse, more than at any other time, man 
becomes like the beasts, on account of the vehement delight which he 
takes therein; whence contingency is praiseworthy, whereby man refrains 
from such pleasures. But man is compared to beasts by reason of sin, 
according to Ps. 48:13: "Man, when he was in honor, did not understand; 
he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them." 
Therefore, before sin, there would have been no such intercourse of man 
and woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in the state of innocence there would have been no 
corruption. But virginal integrity is corrupted by intercourse. Therefore 
there would have been no such thing in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> God made man and woman before sin (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1,2">Gn. 1,2</a>). But 
nothing is void in God's works. Therefore, even if man had not sinned, 
there would have been such intercourse, to which the distinction of sex 
is ordained. Moreover, we are told that woman was made to be a help to 
man (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A18,20">Gn. 2:18,20</a>). But she is not fitted to help man except in 
generation, because another man would have proved a more effective help 
in anything else. Therefore there  would have been such generation also 
in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some of the earlier doctors, considering the nature of 
concupiscence as regards generation in our present state, concluded that 
in the state of innocence generation would not have been effected in the 
same way. Thus Gregory of Nyssa says (De Hom. Opif. xvii) that in 
paradise the human race would have been multiplied by some other means, 
as the angels were multiplied without coition by the operation of the 
Divine Power. He adds that God made man male and female before sin, 
because He foreknew the mode of generation which would take place after 
sin, which He foresaw. But this is unreasonable. For what is natural to 
man was neither acquired nor forfeited by sin. Now it is clear that 
generation by coition is natural to man by reason of his animal life, 
which he possessed even before sin, as above explained (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), 
just as it is natural to other perfect animals, as the corporeal members 
make it clear. So we cannot allow that these members would not have had a 
natural use, as other members had, before sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, as regards generation by coition, there are, in the present state 
of life, two things to be considered. One, which comes from nature, is 
the union of man and woman; for in every act of generation there is an 
active and a passive principle. Wherefore, since wherever there is 
distinction of sex, the active principle is male and the passive is 
female; the order of nature demands that for the purpose of generation 
there should be concurrence of male and female. The second thing to be 
observed is a certain deformity of excessive concupiscence, which in the 
state of innocence would not have existed, when the lower powers were 
entirely subject to reason. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 
26): "We must be far from supposing that offspring could not be begotten 
without concupiscence. All the bodily members would have been equally 
moved by the will, without ardent or wanton incentive, with calmness of 
soul and body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In paradise man would have been like an angel in his 
spirituality of mind, yet with an animal life in his body. After the 
resurrection man will be like an angel, spiritualized in soul and body. 
Wherefore there is no parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 4), our first parents 
did not come together in paradise, because on account of sin they were 
ejected from paradise shortly after the creation of the woman; or 
because, having received the general Divine command relative to 
generation, they awaited the special command relative to time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Beasts are without reason. In this way man becomes, as it 
were, like them in coition, because he cannot moderate concupiscence. In 
the state of innocence nothing of this kind would have happened that was 
not regulated by reason, not because delight of sense was less, as some 
say (rather indeed would sensible delight have been the greater in 
proportion to the greater  purity of nature and the greater sensibility 
of the body), but because the force of concupiscence would not have so 
inordinately thrown itself into such pleasure, being curbed by reason, 
whose place it is not to lessen sensual pleasure, but to prevent the 
force of concupiscence from cleaving to it immoderately. By 
"immoderately" I mean going beyond the bounds of reason, as a sober 
person does not take less pleasure in food taken in moderation than the 
glutton, but his concupiscence lingers less in such pleasures. This is 
what Augustine means by the words quoted, which do not exclude intensity 
of pleasure from the state of innocence, but ardor of desire and 
restlessness of the mind. Therefore continence would not have been 
praiseworthy in the state of innocence, whereas it is praiseworthy in our 
present state, not because it removes fecundity, but because it excludes 
inordinate desire. In that state fecundity would have been without lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[98] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): In that state 
"intercourse would have been without prejudice to virginal integrity; 
this would have remained intact, as it does in the menses. And just as in 
giving birth the mother was then relieved, not by groans of pain, but by 
the instigations of maturity; so in conceiving, the union was one, not of 
lustful desire, but of deliberate action."<br>
