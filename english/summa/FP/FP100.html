</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have to consider the condition of the offspring as to 
righteousness. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP100.html#FPQ100A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether men would have been born in a state of righteousness?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP100.html#FPQ100A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they would have been born confirmed in righteousness?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence men would not have 
been born in a state of righteousness. For Hugh of St. Victor says (De 
Sacram. i): "Before sin the first man would have begotten children 
sinless; but not heirs to their father's righteousness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, righteousness is effected by grace, as the Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A16,21">Rm. 5:16,21</a>). Now grace is not transfused from one to another, for thus 
it would be natural; but is infused by God alone. Therefore children 
would not have been born righteous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, righteousness is in the soul. But the soul is not 
transmitted from the parent. Therefore neither would righteousness have 
been transmitted from parents, to the children.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Anselm says (De Concep. Virg. x): "As long as man did 
not sin, he would have begotten children endowed with righteousness 
together with the rational soul."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man naturally begets a specific likeness to himself. 
Hence whatever accidental qualities result from the nature of the 
species, must be alike in parent and child, unless nature fails in its 
operation, which would not have occurred in the state of innocence. But 
individual accidents do not necessarily exist  alike in parent and child. 
Now original righteousness, in which the first man was created, was an 
accident pertaining to the nature of the species, not as caused by the 
principles of the species, but as a gift conferred by God on the entire 
human nature. This is clear from the fact that opposites are of the same 
genus; and original sin, which is opposed to original righteousness, is 
called the sin of nature, wherefore it is transmitted from the parent to 
the offspring; and for this reason also, the children would have been 
assimilated to their parents as regards original righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These words of Hugh are to be understood as referring, not 
to the habit of righteousness, but to the execution of the act thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some say that children would have been born, not with the 
righteousness of grace, which is the principle of merit, but with 
original righteousness. But since the root of original righteousness, 
which conferred righteousness on the first man when he was made, consists 
in the supernatural subjection of the reason to God, which subjection 
results from sanctifying grace, as above explained (<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>, <A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), we must 
conclude that if children were born in original righteousness, they would 
also have been born in grace; thus we have said above that the first man 
was created in grace (<A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>, <A Href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). This grace, however, would not have 
been natural, for it would not have been transfused by virtue of the 
semen; but would have been conferred on man immediately on his receiving 
a rational soul. In the same way the rational soul, which is not 
transmitted by the parent, is infused by God as soon as the human body is 
apt to receive it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this the reply to the third objection is clear.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have 
been born confirmed in righteousness. For Gregory says (Moral. iv) on the 
words of Job 3:13: "For now I should have been asleep, etc.: If no sinful 
corruption had infected our first parent, he would not have begotten 
"children of hell"; no children would have been born of him but such as 
were destined to be saved by the Redeemer." Therefore all would have been 
born confirmed in righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Anselm says (Cur Deus Homo i, 18): "If our first parents 
had lived so as not to yield to temptation, they would have been 
confirmed in grace, so that with their offspring they would have been 
unable to sin any more." Therefore the children would have been born 
confirmed in righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, good is stronger than evil. But by the sin of the first 
man there resulted, in those born of him, the necessity of sin. 
Therefore, if the first man had persevered in  righteousness, his 
descendants would have derived from him the necessity of preserving 
righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the angels who remained faithful to God, while the 
others sinned, were at once confirmed in grace, so as to be unable 
henceforth to sin. In like manner, therefore, man would have been 
confirmed in grace if he had persevered. But he would have begotten 
children like himself. Therefore they also would have been born confirmed 
in righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): "Happy would have 
been the whole human race if neither they---that is our first 
parents---had committed any evil to be transmitted to their descendants, 
nor any of their race had committed any sin for which they would have 
been condemned." From which words we gather that even if our first 
parents had not sinned, any of their descendants might have done evil; 
and therefore they would not have been born confirmed in righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It does not seem possible that in the state of innocence 
children would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For it is clear 
that at their birth they would not have had greater perfection than their 
parents at the time of begetting. Now the parents, as long as they begot 
children, would not have been confirmed in righteousness. For the 
rational creature is confirmed in righteousness through the beatitude 
given by the clear vision of God; and when once it has seen God, it 
cannot but cleave to Him Who is the essence of goodness, wherefrom no one 
can turn away, since nothing is desired or loved but under the aspect of 
good. I say this according to the general law; for it may be otherwise in 
the case of special privilege, such as we believe was granted to the 
Virgin Mother of God. And as soon as Adam had attained to that happy 
state of seeing God in His Essence, he would have become spiritual in 
soul and body; and his animal life would have ceased, wherein alone there 
is generation. Hence it is clear that children would not have been born 
confirmed in righteousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If Adam had not sinned, he would not have begotten 
"children of hell" in the sense that they would contract from him sin 
which is the cause of hell: yet by sinning of their own free-will they 
could have become "children of hell." If, however, they did not become 
"children of hell" by falling into sin, this would not have been owing to 
their being confirmed in righteousness, but to Divine Providence 
preserving them free from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anselm does not say this by way of assertion, but only as 
an opinion, which is clear from his mode of expression as follows: "It 
seems that if they had lived, etc."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is not conclusive, though Anselm seems to 
have been influenced by it, as appears from his words above quoted. For 
the necessity of sin incurred by the descendants would not have been such 
that they could not return to  righteousness, which is the case only with 
the damned. Wherefore neither would the parents have transmitted to their 
descendants the necessity of not sinning, which is only in the blessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[100] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There is no comparison between man and the angels; for 
man's free-will is changeable, both before and after choice; whereas the 
angel's is not changeable, as we have said above in treating of the 
angels (<A Href="FP064.html#FPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="FP064.html#FPQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
