    OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS REGARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now have to consider the condition of the offspring as to righteousness.
    Under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP100.html#FPQ100A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether men would have been born
    in a state of righteousness?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP100.html#FPQ100A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they would have been born
    confirmed in righteousness?

    Whether men would have been born in a state of righteousness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence men
    would not have been born in a state of righteousness. For Hugh of St. Victor
    says (De Sacram. i): "Before sin the first man would have begotten children
    sinless; but not heirs to their father's righteousness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, righteousness is effected by grace, as
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A16,21"
      >Rm. 5:16,21</a
    >). Now grace is not transfused from one to another, for thus it would be
    natural; but is infused by God alone. Therefore children would not have been
    born righteous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, righteousness is in the soul. But the
    soul is not transmitted from the parent. Therefore neither would
    righteousness have been transmitted from parents, to the children.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Anselm says (De Concep. Virg. x): "As long as
    man did not sin, he would have begotten children endowed with righteousness
    together with the rational soul."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man naturally begets a specific likeness to
    himself. Hence whatever accidental qualities result from the nature of the
    species, must be alike in parent and child, unless nature fails in its
    operation, which would not have occurred in the state of innocence. But
    individual accidents do not necessarily exist alike in parent and child. Now
    original righteousness, in which the first man was created, was an accident
    pertaining to the nature of the species, not as caused by the principles of
    the species, but as a gift conferred by God on the entire human nature. This
    is clear from the fact that opposites are of the same genus; and original
    sin, which is opposed to original righteousness, is called the sin of
    nature, wherefore it is transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and
    for this reason also, the children would have been assimilated to their
    parents as regards original righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These words of Hugh are to be understood
    as referring, not to the habit of righteousness, but to the execution of the
    act thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some say that children would have been
    born, not with the righteousness of grace, which is the principle of merit,
    but with original righteousness. But since the root of original
    righteousness, which conferred righteousness on the first man when he was
    made, consists in the supernatural subjection of the reason to God, which
    subjection results from sanctifying grace, as above explained (<a
      href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1"
      >Question [95]</a
    >, <a href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), we must conclude that
    if children were born in original righteousness, they would also have been
    born in grace; thus we have said above that the first man was created in
    grace (<a href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>,
    <a href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). This grace, however,
    would not have been natural, for it would not have been transfused by virtue
    of the semen; but would have been conferred on man immediately on his
    receiving a rational soul. In the same way the rational soul, which is not
    transmitted by the parent, is infused by God as soon as the human body is
    apt to receive it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From this the reply to the third objection is clear.</p>

    Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born confirmed in
    righteousness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence
    children would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For Gregory says
    (Moral. iv) on the words of Job 3:13: "For now I should have been asleep,
    etc.: If no sinful corruption had infected our first parent, he would not
    have begotten "children of hell"; no children would have been born of him
    but such as were destined to be saved by the Redeemer." Therefore all would
    have been born confirmed in righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Anselm says (Cur Deus Homo i, 18): "If
    our first parents had lived so as not to yield to temptation, they would
    have been confirmed in grace, so that with their offspring they would have
    been unable to sin any more." Therefore the children would have been born
    confirmed in righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, good is stronger than evil. But by the
    sin of the first man there resulted, in those born of him, the necessity of
    sin. Therefore, if the first man had persevered in righteousness, his
    descendants would have derived from him the necessity of preserving
    righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the angels who remained faithful to God,
    while the others sinned, were at once confirmed in grace, so as to be unable
    henceforth to sin. In like manner, therefore, man would have been confirmed
    in grace if he had persevered. But he would have begotten children like
    himself. Therefore they also would have been born confirmed in
    righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): "Happy
    would have been the whole human race if neither they---that is our first
    parents---had committed any evil to be transmitted to their descendants, nor
    any of their race had committed any sin for which they would have been
    condemned." From which words we gather that even if our first parents had
    not sinned, any of their descendants might have done evil; and therefore
    they would not have been born confirmed in righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It does not seem possible that in the state of
    innocence children would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For it
    is clear that at their birth they would not have had greater perfection than
    their parents at the time of begetting. Now the parents, as long as they
    begot children, would not have been confirmed in righteousness. For the
    rational creature is confirmed in righteousness through the beatitude given
    by the clear vision of God; and when once it has seen God, it cannot but
    cleave to Him Who is the essence of goodness, wherefrom no one can turn
    away, since nothing is desired or loved but under the aspect of good. I say
    this according to the general law; for it may be otherwise in the case of
    special privilege, such as we believe was granted to the Virgin Mother of
    God. And as soon as Adam had attained to that happy state of seeing God in
    His Essence, he would have become spiritual in soul and body; and his animal
    life would have ceased, wherein alone there is generation. Hence it is clear
    that children would not have been born confirmed in righteousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If Adam had not sinned, he would not
    have begotten "children of hell" in the sense that they would contract from
    him sin which is the cause of hell: yet by sinning of their own free-will
    they could have become "children of hell." If, however, they did not become
    "children of hell" by falling into sin, this would not have been owing to
    their being confirmed in righteousness, but to Divine Providence preserving
    them free from sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anselm does not say this by way of
    assertion, but only as an opinion, which is clear from his mode of
    expression as follows: "It seems that if they had lived, etc."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is not conclusive, though
    Anselm seems to have been influenced by it, as appears from his words above
    quoted. For the necessity of sin incurred by the descendants would not have
    been such that they could not return to righteousness, which is the case
    only with the damned. Wherefore neither would the parents have transmitted
    to their descendants the necessity of not sinning, which is only in the
    blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There is no comparison between man and
    the angels; for man's free-will is changeable, both before and after choice;
    whereas the angel's is not changeable, as we have said above in treating of
    the angels (<a href="FP064.html#FPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="FP064.html#FPQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
