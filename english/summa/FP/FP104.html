<H3 Align="Left">Whether creatures need to be kept in being by God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that creatures do not need to be kept in being by 
God. For what cannot not-be, does not need to be kept in being; just as 
that which cannot depart, does not need to be kept from departing. But 
some creatures by their very nature cannot not-be. Therefore not all 
creatures need to be kept in being by God. The middle proposition is 
proved thus. That which is included in the nature of a thing is 
necessarily in that thing, and its contrary cannot be in it; thus a 
multiple of two must necessarily be even, and cannot possibly be an odd 
number. Now form brings being with itself, because everything is actually 
in being, so far as it has form. But some creatures are subsistent forms, 
as we have said of the angels (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5): and thus to be is in them 
of themselves. The same reasoning applies to those creatures whose matter 
is in potentiality to one form only, as above explained of heavenly 
bodies (<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore such creatures as these have in their 
nature to be necessarily, and cannot not-be; for there can be no 
potentiality to not-being, either in the form which has being of itself, 
or in matter existing under a form which it cannot lose, since it is not 
in potentiality to any other form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God is more powerful than any created agent. But a 
created agent, even after ceasing to act, can cause its effect to be 
preserved in being; thus the house continues to stand after the builder 
has ceased to build; and water remains hot for some time after the fire 
has ceased to heat. Much more, therefore, can God cause His creature to 
be kept in being, after He has ceased to create it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing violent can occur, except there be some active 
cause thereof. But tendency to not-being is unnatural  and violent to any 
creature, since all creatures naturally desire to be. Therefore no 
creature can tend to not-being, except through some active cause of 
corruption. Now there are creatures of such a nature that nothing can 
cause them to corrupt; such are spiritual substances and heavenly bodies. 
Therefore such creatures cannot tend to not-being, even if God were to 
withdraw His action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if God keeps creatures in being, this is done by some 
action. Now every action of an agent, if that action be efficacious, 
produces something in the effect. Therefore the preserving power of God 
must produce something in the creature. But this is not so; because this 
action does not give being to the creature, since being is not given to 
that which already is: nor does it add anything new to the creature; 
because either God would not keep the creature in being continually, or 
He would be continually adding something new to the creature; either of 
which is unreasonable. Therefore creatures are not kept in being by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++1%3A3">Heb. 1:3</a>): "Upholding all things by the 
word of His power."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Both reason and faith bind us to say that creatures are 
kept in being by God. To make this clear, we must consider that a thing 
is preserved by another in two ways. First, indirectly, and accidentally; 
thus a person is said to preserve anything by removing the cause of its 
corruption, as a man may be said to preserve a child, whom he guards from 
falling into the fire. In this way God preserves some things, but not 
all, for there are some things of such a nature that nothing can corrupt 
them, so that it is not necessary to keep them from corruption. Secondly, 
a thing is said to preserve another 'per se' and directly, namely, when 
what is preserved depends on the preserver in such a way that it cannot 
exist without it. In this manner all creatures need to be preserved by 
God. For the being of every creature depends on God, so that not for a 
moment could it subsist, but would fall into nothingness were it not kept 
in being by the operation of the Divine power, as Gregory says (Moral. 
xvi).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is made clear as follows: Every effect depends on its cause, so far 
as it is its cause. But we must observe that an agent may be the cause of 
the "becoming" of its effect, but not directly of its "being." This may 
be seen both in artificial and in natural beings: for the builder causes 
the house in its "becoming," but he is not the direct cause of its 
"being." For it is clear that the "being" of the house is a result of its 
form, which consists in the putting together and arrangement of the 
materials, and results from the natural qualities of certain things. Thus 
a cook dresses the food by applying the natural activity of fire; thus a 
builder constructs a house, by making use of cement, stones, and wood 
which are able to be put together in a certain order and to preserve it. 
Therefore the "being" of a house depends on the nature of these 
materials, just as its "becoming" depends on the action of the builder. 
The same principle applies to natural things. For if an agent is not the 
cause of a form as such, neither will it be  directly the cause of 
"being" which results from that form; but it will be the cause of the 
effect, in its "becoming" only.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is clear that of two things in the same species one cannot 
directly cause the other's form as such, since it would then be the cause 
of its own form, which is essentially the same as the form of the other; 
but it can be the cause of this form for as much as it is in matter---in 
other words, it may be the cause that "this matter" receives "this form." 
And this is to be the cause of "becoming," as when man begets man, and 
fire causes fire. Thus whenever a natural effect is such that it has an 
aptitude to receive from its active cause an impression specifically the 
same as in that active cause, then the "becoming" of the effect, but not 
its "being," depends on the agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the effect has not this aptitude to receive the 
impression of its cause, in the same way as it exists in the agent: as 
may be seen clearly in all agents which do not produce an effect of the 
same species as themselves: thus the heavenly bodies cause the generation 
of inferior bodies which differ from them in species. Such an agent can 
be the cause of a form as such, and not merely as existing in this 
matter, consequently it is not merely the cause of "becoming" but also 
the cause of "being."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore as the becoming of a thing cannot continue when that action of 
the agent ceases which causes the "becoming" of the effect: so neither 
can the "being" of a thing continue after that action of the agent has 
ceased, which is the cause of the effect not only in "becoming" but also 
in "being." This is why hot water retains heat after the cessation of the 
fire's action; while, on the contrary, the air does not continue to be 
lit up, even for a moment, when the sun ceases to act upon it, because 
water is a matter susceptive of the fire's heat in the same way as it 
exists in the fire. Wherefore if it were to be reduced to the perfect 
form of fire, it would retain that form always; whereas if it has the 
form of fire imperfectly and inchoately, the heat will remain for a time 
only, by reason of the imperfect participation of the principle of heat. 
On the other hand, air is not of such a nature as to receive light in the 
same way as it exists in the sun, which is the principle of light. 
Therefore, since it has not root in the air, the light ceases with the 
action of the sun.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now every creature may be compared to God, as the air is to the sun 
which enlightens it. For as the sun possesses light by its nature, and as 
the air is enlightened by sharing the sun's nature; so God alone is Being 
in virtue of His own Essence, since His Essence is His existence; whereas 
every creature has being by participation, so that its essence is not its 
existence. Therefore, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 12): "If the 
ruling power of God were withdrawn from His creatures, their nature would 
at once cease, and all nature would collapse." In the same work (Gen. ad 
lit. viii, 12) he says: "As the air becomes light by the presence of the 
sun, so is man enlightened by the presence of God, and in  His absence 
returns at once to darkness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Being" naturally results from the form of a creature, 
given the influence of the Divine action; just as light results from the 
diaphanous nature of the air, given the action of the sun. Wherefore the 
potentiality to not-being in spiritual creatures and heavenly bodies is 
rather something in God, Who can withdraw His influence, than in the form 
or matter of those creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God cannot grant to a creature to be preserved in being 
after the cessation of the Divine influence: as neither can He make it 
not to have received its being from Himself. For the creature needs to be 
preserved by God in so far as the being of an effect depends on the cause 
of its being. So that there is no comparison with an agent that is not 
the cause of 'being' but only of "becoming."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument holds in regard to that preservation which 
consists in the removal of corruption: but all creatures do not need to 
be preserved thus, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The preservation of things by God is a continuation of that 
action whereby He gives existence, which action is without either motion 
or time; so also the preservation of light in the air is by the continual 
influence of the sun.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God preserves every creature immediately?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God preserves every creature immediately. For 
God creates and preserves things by the same action, as above stated 
(<A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4). But God created all things immediately. Therefore He 
preserves all things immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing is nearer to itself than to another. But it 
cannot be given to a creature to preserve itself; much less therefore can 
it be given to a creature to preserve another. Therefore God preserves 
all things without any intermediate cause preserving them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an effect is kept in being by the cause, not only of its 
"becoming," but also of its being. But all created causes do not seem to 
cause their effects except in their "becoming," for they cause only by 
moving, as above stated (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore they do not cause so as 
to keep their effects in being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A thing is kept in being by that which gives it being. 
But God gives being by means of certain intermediate causes. Therefore He 
also keeps things in being by means of certain causes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a thing keeps another in  being 
in two ways; first, indirectly and accidentally, by removing or hindering 
the action of a corrupting cause; secondly, directly and "per se," by the 
fact that that on it depends the other's being, as the being of the 
effect depends on the cause. And in both ways a created thing keeps 
another in being. For it is clear that even in corporeal things there are 
many causes which hinder the action of corrupting agents, and for that 
reason are called preservatives; just as salt preserves meat from 
putrefaction; and in like manner with many other things. It happens also 
that an effect depends on a creature as to its being. For when we have a 
series of causes depending on one another, it necessarily follows that, 
while the effect depends first and principally on the first cause, it 
also depends in a secondary way on all the middle causes. Therefore the 
first cause is the principal cause of the preservation of the effect 
which is to be referred to the middle causes in a secondary way; and all 
the more so, as the middle cause is higher and nearer to the first cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, even in things corporeal, the preservation and 
continuation of things is ascribed to the higher causes: thus the 
Philosopher says (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 6), that the first, namely the 
diurnal movement is the cause of the continuation of things generated; 
whereas the second movement, which is from the zodiac, is the cause of 
diversity owing to generation and corruption. In like manner astrologers 
ascribe to Saturn, the highest of the planets, those things which are 
permanent and fixed. So we conclude that God keeps certain things in 
being, by means of certain causes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God created all things immediately, but in the creation 
itself He established an order among things, so that some depend on 
others, by which they are preserved in being, though He remains the 
principal cause of their preservation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since an effect is preserved by its proper cause on which 
it depends; just as no effect can be its own cause, but can only produce 
another effect, so no effect can be endowed with the power of 
self-preservation, but only with the power of preserving another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No created nature can be the cause of another, as regards 
the latter acquiring a new form, or disposition, except by virtue of some 
change; for the created nature acts always on something presupposed. But 
after causing the form or disposition in the effect, without any fresh 
change in the effect, the cause preserves that form or disposition; as in 
the air, when it is lit up anew, we must allow some change to have taken 
place, while the preservation of the light is without any further change 
in the air due to the presence of the source of light.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God can annihilate anything?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot annihilate anything. For  Augustine 
says (Questions. 83, qu. 21) that "God is not the cause of anything tending to 
non-existence." But He would be such a cause if He were to annihilate 
anything. Therefore He cannot annihilate anything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by His goodness God is the cause why things exist, 
since, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32): "Because God is good, 
we exist." But God cannot cease to be good. Therefore He cannot cause 
things to cease to exist; which would be the case were He to annihilate 
anything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if God were to annihilate anything it would be by His 
action. But this cannot be; because the term of every action is 
existence. Hence even the action of a corrupting cause has its term in 
something generated; for when one thing is generated another undergoes 
corruption. Therefore God cannot annihilate anything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++10%3A24">Jer. 10:24</a>): "Correct me, O Lord, but 
yet with judgment; and not in Thy fury, lest Thou bring me to nothing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that God, in giving existence to 
creatures, acted from natural necessity. Were this true, God could not 
annihilate anything, since His nature cannot change. But, as we have said 
above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), such an opinion is entirely false, and absolutely 
contrary to the Catholic faith, which confesses that God created things 
of His own free-will, according to Ps. 134:6: "Whatsoever the Lord 
pleased, He hath done." Therefore that God gives existence to a creature 
depends on His will; nor does He preserve things in existence otherwise 
than by continually pouring out existence into them, as we have said. 
Therefore, just as before things existed, God was free not to give them 
existence, and not to make them; so after they are made, He is free not 
to continue their existence; and thus they would cease to exist; and this 
would be to annihilate them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Non-existence has no direct cause; for nothing is a cause 
except inasmuch as it has existence, and a being essentially as such is a 
cause of something existing. Therefore God cannot cause a thing to tend 
to non-existence, whereas a creature has this tendency of itself, since 
it is produced from nothing. But indirectly God can be the cause of 
things being reduced to non-existence, by withdrawing His action 
therefrom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's goodness is the cause of things, not as though by 
natural necessity, because the Divine goodness does not depend on 
creatures; but by His free-will. Wherefore, as without prejudice to His 
goodness, He might not have produced things into existence, so, without 
prejudice to His goodness, He might not preserve things in existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If God were to annihilate anything, this would not imply an 
action on God's part; but a mere cessation of His  action.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that something is annihilated. For the end 
corresponds to the beginning. But in the beginning there was nothing but 
God. Therefore all things must tend to this end, that there shall be 
nothing but God. Therefore creatures will be reduced to nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every creature has a finite power. But no finite power 
extends to the infinite. Wherefore the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 
10) that, "a finite power cannot move in infinite time." Therefore a 
creature cannot last for an infinite duration; and so at some time it 
will be reduced to nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, forms and accidents have no matter as part of 
themselves. But at some time they cease to exist. Therefore they are 
reduced to nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++3%3A14">Eccles. 3:14</a>): "I have learned that all 
the works that God hath made continue for ever."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some of those things which God does in creatures occur in 
accordance with the natural course of things; others happen miraculously, 
and not in accordance with the natural order, as will be explained 
(<A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>, <A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Now whatever God wills to do according to the natural 
order of things may be observed from their nature; but those things which 
occur miraculously, are ordered for the manifestation of grace, according 
to the Apostle, "To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit, 
unto profit" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++12%3A7">1 Cor. 12:7</a>); and subsequently he mentions, among others, 
the working of miracles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the nature of creatures shows that none of them is annihilated. For, 
either they are immaterial, and therefore have no potentiality to 
non-existence; or they are material, and then they continue to exist, at 
least in matter, which is incorruptible, since it is the subject of 
generation and corruption. Moreover, the annihilation of things does not 
pertain to the manifestation of grace; since rather the power and 
goodness of God are manifested by the preservation of things in 
existence. Wherefore we must conclude by denying absolutely that anything 
at all will be annihilated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That things are brought into existence from a state of 
non-existence, clearly shows the power of Him Who made them; but that 
they should be reduced to nothing would hinder that manifestation, since 
the power of God is conspicuously shown in His preserving all things in 
existence, according to the Apostle: "Upholding all things by the word of 
His power" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++1%3A3">Heb. 1:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A creature's potentiality to existence is merely receptive; 
the active power belongs to God Himself, from Whom existence is derived. 
Wherefore the infinite duration of things is  a consequence of the 
infinity of the Divine power. To some things, however, is given a 
determinate power of duration for a certain time, so far as they may be 
hindered by some contrary agent from receiving the influx of existence 
which comes from Him Whom finite power cannot resist, for an infinite, 
but only for a fixed time. So things which have no contrary, although 
they have a finite power, continue to exist for ever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[104] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Forms and accidents are not complete beings, since they do 
not subsist: but each one of them is something "of a being"; for it is 
called a being, because something is by it. Yet so far as their mode of 
existence is concerned, they are not entirely reduced to nothingness; not 
that any part of them survives, but that they remain in the potentiality 
of the matter, or of the subject.<br>
