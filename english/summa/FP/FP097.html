    OF THE PRESERVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE (FOUR
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next consider what belongs to the bodily state of the first man: first,
    as regards the preservation of the individual; secondly, as regards the
    preservation of the species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP097.html#FPQ97A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man in the state of
    innocence was immortal?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP097.html#FPQ97A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether he was impassible?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP097.html#FPQ97A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether he stood in need of food?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP097.html#FPQ97A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he would have obtained
    immortality by the tree of life?<br />

    Whether in the state of innocence man would have been immortal?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man
    was not immortal. For the term "mortal" belongs to the definition of man.
    But if you take away the definition, you take away the thing defined.
    Therefore as long as man was man he could not be immortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, corruptible and incorruptible are
    generically distinct, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. x, Did. ix, 10). But
    there can be no passing from one genus to another. Therefore if the first
    man was incorruptible, man could not be corruptible in the present state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if man were immortal in the state of
    innocence, this would have been due either to nature or to grace. Not to
    nature, for since nature does not change within the same species, he would
    also have been immortal now. Likewise neither would this be owing to grace;
    for the first man recovered grace by repentance, according to Wis. 10:2: "He
    brought him out of his sins." Hence he would have regained his immortality;
    which is clearly not the case. Therefore man was not immortal in the state
    of innocence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, immortality is promised to man as a
    reward, according to Apoc. 21:4: "Death shall be no more." But man was not
    created in the state of reward, but that he might deserve the reward.
    Therefore man was not immortal in the state of innocence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A12"
      >Rm. 5:12</a
    >): "By sin death came into the world." Therefore man was immortal before
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be incorruptible in three ways.
    First, on the part of matter---that is to say, either because it possesses
    no matter, like an angel; or because it possesses matter that is in
    potentiality to one form only, like the heavenly bodies. Such things as
    these are incorruptible by their very nature. Secondly, a thing is
    incorruptible in its form, inasmuch as being by nature corruptible, yet it
    has an inherent disposition which preserves it wholly from corruption; and
    this is called incorruptibility of glory; because as Augustine says (Ep. ad
    Dioscor.): "God made man's soul of such a powerful nature, that from its
    fulness of beatitude, there redounds to the body a fulness of health, with
    the vigor of incorruption." Thirdly, a thing may be incorruptible on the
    part of its efficient cause; in this sense man was incorruptible and
    immortal in the state of innocence. For, as Augustine says (Questions. Vet.
    et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious
    works of St. Augustine]): "God made man immortal as long as he did not sin;
    so that he might achieve for himself life or death." For man's body was
    indissoluble not by reason of any intrinsic vigor of immortality, but by
    reason of a supernatural force given by God to the soul, whereby it was
    enabled to preserve the body from all corruption so long as it remained
    itself subject to God. This entirely agrees with reason; for since the
    rational soul surpasses the capacity of corporeal matter, as above explained
    (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it was most properly
    endowed at the beginning with the power of preserving the body in a manner
    surpassing the capacity of corporeal matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> and 2: These objections are founded on
    natural incorruptibility and immortality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This power of preserving the body was
    not natural to the soul, but was the gift of grace. And though man recovered
    grace as regards remission of guilt and the merit of glory; yet he did not
    recover immortality, the loss of which was an effect of sin; for this was
    reserved for Christ to accomplish, by Whom the defect of nature was to be
    restored into something better, as we shall explain further on (<a
      href="../TP.html"
      >TP</a
    >, <a href="../TP/TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP014.html#TPQ14A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The promised reward of the immortality
    of glory differs from the immortality which was bestowed on man in the state
    of innocence.<br />

    Whether in the state of innocence man would have been passible?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man
    was passible. For "sensation is a kind of passion." But in the state of
    innocence man would have been sensitive. Therefore he would have been
    passible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sleep is a kind of passion. Now, man
    slept in the state of innocence, according to Gn. 2:21, "God cast a deep
    sleep upon Adam." Therefore he would have been passible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same passage goes on to say that "He
    took a rib out of Adam." Therefore he was passible even to the degree of the
    cutting out of part of his body.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man's body was soft. But a soft body is
    naturally passible as regards a hard body; therefore if a hard body had come
    in contact with the soft body of the first man, the latter would have
    suffered from the impact. Therefore the first man was passible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Had man been passible, he would have been
    also corruptible, because, as the Philosopher says (Top. vi, 3): "Excessive
    suffering wastes the very substance."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "Passion" may be taken in two senses. First, in
    its proper sense, and thus a thing is said to suffer when changed from its
    natural disposition. For passion is the effect of action; and in nature
    contraries are mutually active or passive, according as one thing changes
    another from its natural disposition. Secondly, "passion" can be taken in a
    general sense for any kind of change, even if belonging to the perfecting
    process of nature. Thus understanding and sensation are said to be passions.
    In this second sense, man was passible in the state of innocence, and was
    passive both in soul and body. In the first sense, man was impassible, both
    in soul and body, as he was likewise immortal; for he could curb his
    passion, as he could avoid death, so long as he refrained from sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus it is clear how to reply to the first two objections; since sensation
    and sleep do not remove from man his natural disposition, but are ordered to
    his natural welfare.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As already explained (<a
      href="FP092.html#FPQ92OUTP1"
      >Question [92]</a
    >, <a href="FP092.html#FPQ92A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), the rib was in
    Adam as the principle of the human race, as the semen in man, who is a
    principle through generation. Hence as man does not suffer any natural
    deterioration by seminal issue; so neither did he through the separation of
    the rib.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Man's body in the state of innocence
    could be preserved from suffering injury from a hard body; partly by the use
    of his reason, whereby he could avoid what was harmful; and partly also by
    Divine Providence, so preserving him, that nothing of a harmful nature could
    come upon him unawares.<br />

    Whether in the state of innocence man had need of food?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man
    did not require food. For food is necessary for man to restore what he has
    lost. But Adam's body suffered no loss, as being incorruptible. Therefore he
    had no need of food.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, food is needed for nourishment. But
    nourishment involves passibility. Since, then, man's body was impassible; it
    does not appear how food could be needful to him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we need food for the preservation of
    life. But Adam could preserve his life otherwise; for had he not sinned, he
    would not have died. Therefore he did not require food.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the consumption of food involves voiding
    of the surplus, which seems unsuitable to the state of innocence. Therefore
    it seems that man did not take food in the primitive state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A16"
      >Gn. 2:16</a
    >): "Of every tree in paradise ye shall [Vulg. 'thou shalt'] eat."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the state of innocence man had an animal
    life requiring food; but after the resurrection he will have a spiritual
    life needing no food. In order to make this clear, we must observe that the
    rational soul is both soul and spirit. It is called a soul by reason of what
    it possesses in common with other souls---that is, as giving life to the
    body; whence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A7"
      >Gn. 2:7</a
    >): "Man was made into a living soul"; that is, a soul giving life to the
    body. But the soul is called a spirit according to what properly belongs to
    itself, and not to other souls, as possessing an intellectual immaterial
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus in the primitive state, the rational soul communicated to the body what
    belonged to itself as a soul; and so the body was called "animal" [*From
    'anima', a soul; Cf. 1 Cor. 15:44 seqq.], through having its life from the
    soul. Now the first principle of life in these inferior creatures as the
    Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 4) is the vegetative soul: the operations of
    which are the use of food, generation, and growth. Wherefore such operations
    befitted man in the state of innocence. But in the final state, after the
    resurrection, the soul will, to a certain extent, communicate to the body
    what properly belongs to itself as a spirit; immortality to everyone;
    impassibility, glory, and power to the good, whose bodies will be called
    "spiritual." So, after the resurrection, man will not require food; whereas
    he required it in the state of innocence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et
    Nov. Test. qu. 19 [*Works of an anonymous author, among the supposititious
    works of St. Augustine]): "How could man have an immortal body, which was
    sustained by food? Since an immortal being needs neither food nor drink."
    For we have explained (<a href="FP097.html#FPQ97A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>)
    that the immortality of the primitive state was based on a supernatural
    force in the soul, and not on any intrinsic disposition of the body: so that
    by the action of heat, the body might lose part of its humid qualities; and
    to prevent the entire consumption of the humor, man was obliged to take
    food.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A certain passion and alteration attends
    nutriment, on the part of the food changed into the substance of the thing
    nourished. So we cannot thence conclude that man's body was passible, but
    that the food taken was passible; although this kind of passion conduced to
    the perfection of the nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If man had not taken food he would have
    sinned; as he also sinned by taking the forbidden fruit. For he was told at
    the same time, to abstain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and
    to eat of every other tree of Paradise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some say that in the state of innocence
    man would not have taken more than necessary food, so that there would have
    been nothing superfluous; which, however, is unreasonable to suppose, as
    implying that there would have been no faecal matter. Wherefore there was
    need for voiding the surplus, yet so disposed by God as to be decorous and
    suitable to the state.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether in the state of innocence man would have acquired immortality by the
    tree of life?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the tree of life could not be
    the cause of immortality. For nothing can act beyond its own species; as an
    effect does not exceed its cause. But the tree of life was corruptible,
    otherwise it could not be taken as food; since food is changed into the
    substance of the thing nourished. Therefore the tree of life could not give
    incorruptibility or immortality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, effects caused by the forces of plants
    and other natural agencies are natural. If therefore the tree of life caused
    immortality, this would have been natural immortality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this would seem to be reduced to the
    ancient fable, that the gods, by eating a certain food, became immortal;
    which the Philosopher ridicules (Metaph. iii, Did. ii, 4).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A22"
      >Gn. 3:22</a
    >): "Lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take of the tree of life, and
    eat, and live for ever." Further, Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov.
    Test. qu. 19 [*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works
    of St. Augustine]): "A taste of the tree of life warded off corruption of
    the body; and even after sin man would have remained immortal, had he been
    allowed to eat of the tree of life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The tree of life in a certain degree was the
    cause of immortality, but not absolutely. To understand this, we must
    observe that in the primitive state man possessed, for the preservation of
    life, two remedies, against two defects. One of these defects was the lost
    of humidity by the action of natural heat, which acts as the soul's
    instrument: as a remedy against such loss man was provided with food, taken
    from the other trees of paradise, as now we are provided with the food,
    which we take for the same purpose. The second defect, as the Philosopher
    says (De Gener. i, 5), arises from the fact that the humor which is caused
    from extraneous sources, being added to the humor already existing, lessens
    the specific active power: as water added to wine takes at first the taste
    of wine, then, as more water is added, the strength of the wine is
    diminished, till the wine becomes watery. In like manner, we may observe
    that at first the active force of the species is so strong that it is able
    to transform so much of the food as is required to replace the lost tissue,
    as well as what suffices for growth; later on, however, the assimilated food
    does not suffice for growth, but only replaces what is lost. Last of all, in
    old age, it does not suffice even for this purpose; whereupon the body
    declines, and finally dies from natural causes. Against this defect man was
    provided with a remedy in the tree of life; for its effect was to strengthen
    the force of the species against the weakness resulting from the admixture
    of extraneous nutriment. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26):
    "Man had food to appease his hunger, drink to slake his thirst; and the tree
    of life to banish the breaking up of old age"; and (Questions. Vet. et Nov.
    Test. qu. 19 [*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works
    of St. Augustine]) "The tree of life, like a drug, warded off all bodily
    corruption."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet it did not absolutely cause immortality; for neither was the soul's
    intrinsic power of preserving the body due to the tree of life, nor was it
    of such efficiency as to give the body a disposition to immortality, whereby
    it might become indissoluble; which is clear from the fact that every bodily
    power is finite; so the power of the tree of life could not go so far as to
    give the body the prerogative of living for an infinite time, but only for a
    definite time. For it is manifest that the greater a force is, the more
    durable is its effect; therefore, since the power of the tree of life was
    finite, man's life was to be preserved for a definite time by partaking of
    it once; and when that time had elapsed, man was to be either transferred to
    a spiritual life, or had need to eat once more of the tree of life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From this the replies to the objections clearly appear. For the first proves
    that the tree of life did not absolutely cause immortality; while the others
    show that it caused incorruption by warding off corruption, according to the
    explanation above given.<br />
