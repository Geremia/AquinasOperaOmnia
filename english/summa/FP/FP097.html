<H3 Align="Center">OF THE PRESERVATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider what belongs to the bodily state of the first man: 
first, as regards the preservation of the individual; secondly, as 
regards the preservation of the species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man in the state of innocence was immortal?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether he was impassible?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether he stood in need of food?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he would have obtained immortality by the tree of life?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man was not 
immortal. For the term "mortal" belongs to the definition of man. But if 
you take away the definition, you take away the thing defined. Therefore 
as long as man was man he could not be immortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, corruptible and incorruptible are generically distinct, 
as the Philosopher says (Metaph. x, Did. ix, 10). But there can be no 
passing from one genus to another. Therefore if the first man was 
incorruptible, man could not be corruptible in the present state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if man were immortal in the state of innocence, this 
would have been due either to nature or to grace. Not to nature, for 
since nature does not change within the same species, he would also have 
been immortal now. Likewise neither would this be owing to grace; for the 
first man recovered grace by repentance, according to Wis. 10:2: "He 
brought him out of his sins." Hence he would have regained his 
immortality; which is clearly not the case. Therefore man was not 
immortal in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, immortality is promised to man as a reward, according to 
Apoc. 21:4: "Death shall be no more." But man was not created in the 
state of reward, but that he might deserve the reward. Therefore man was 
not immortal in the state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A12">Rm. 5:12</a>): "By sin death came into the 
world." Therefore man was immortal before sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be incorruptible in three ways. First, on the 
part of matter---that is to say, either because it possesses no matter, 
like an angel; or because it possesses matter that is in potentiality to 
one form only, like the heavenly bodies.  Such things as these are 
incorruptible by their very nature. Secondly, a thing is incorruptible in 
its form, inasmuch as being by nature corruptible, yet it has an inherent 
disposition which preserves it wholly from corruption; and this is called 
incorruptibility of glory; because as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor.): 
"God made man's soul of such a powerful nature, that from its fulness of 
beatitude, there redounds to the body a fulness of health, with the vigor 
of incorruption." Thirdly, a thing may be incorruptible on the part of 
its efficient cause; in this sense man was incorruptible and immortal in 
the state of innocence. For, as Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. 
qu. 19 [*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of 
St. Augustine]): "God made man immortal as long as he did not sin; so 
that he might achieve for himself life or death." For man's body was 
indissoluble not by reason of any intrinsic vigor of immortality, but by 
reason of a supernatural force given by God to the soul, whereby it was 
enabled to preserve the body from all corruption so long as it remained 
itself subject to God. This entirely agrees with reason; for since the 
rational soul surpasses the capacity of corporeal matter, as above 
explained (<A Href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it was most properly endowed at the beginning 
with the power of preserving the body in a manner surpassing the capacity 
of corporeal matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>and 2: These objections are founded on natural 
incorruptibility and immortality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This power of preserving the body was not natural to the 
soul, but was the gift of grace. And though man recovered grace as 
regards remission of guilt and the merit of glory; yet he did not recover 
immortality, the loss of which was an effect of sin; for this was 
reserved for Christ to accomplish, by Whom the defect of nature was to be 
restored into something better, as we shall explain further on (<A Href="../TP.html">TP</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP014.html#TPQ14A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The promised reward of the immortality of glory differs 
from the immortality which was bestowed on man in the state of innocence.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence man would have been passible?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man was passible. 
For "sensation is a kind of passion." But in the state of innocence man 
would have been sensitive. Therefore he would have been passible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sleep is a kind of passion. Now, man slept in the state 
of innocence, according to Gn. 2:21, "God cast a deep sleep upon Adam." 
Therefore he would have been passible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same passage goes on to say that "He took a rib out 
of Adam." Therefore he was passible even to the degree of the cutting out 
of part of his body. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man's body was soft. But a soft body is naturally 
passible as regards a hard body; therefore if a hard body had come in 
contact with the soft body of the first man, the latter would have 
suffered from the impact. Therefore the first man was passible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Had man been passible, he would have been also 
corruptible, because, as the Philosopher says (Top. vi, 3): "Excessive 
suffering wastes the very substance."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> "Passion" may be taken in two senses. First, in its 
proper sense, and thus a thing is said to suffer when changed from its 
natural disposition. For passion is the effect of action; and in nature 
contraries are mutually active or passive, according as one thing changes 
another from its natural disposition. Secondly, "passion" can be taken in 
a general sense for any kind of change, even if belonging to the 
perfecting process of nature. Thus understanding and sensation are said 
to be passions. In this second sense, man was passible in the state of 
innocence, and was passive both in soul and body. In the first sense, man 
was impassible, both in soul and body, as he was likewise immortal; for 
he could curb his passion, as he could avoid death, so long as he 
refrained from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is clear how to reply to the first two objections; since 
sensation and sleep do not remove from man his natural disposition, but 
are ordered to his natural welfare.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As already explained (<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), the rib was in 
Adam as the principle of the human race, as the semen in man, who is a 
principle through generation. Hence as man does not suffer any natural 
deterioration by seminal issue; so neither did he through the separation 
of the rib.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Man's body in the state of innocence could be preserved 
from suffering injury from a hard body; partly by the use of his reason, 
whereby he could avoid what was harmful; and partly also by Divine 
Providence, so preserving him, that nothing of a harmful nature could 
come upon him unawares.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence man had need of food?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence man did not require 
food. For food is necessary for man to restore what he has lost. But 
Adam's body suffered no loss, as being incorruptible. Therefore he had no 
need of food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, food is needed for nourishment. But nourishment involves 
passibility. Since, then, man's body was impassible; it does not appear 
how food could be needful to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we need food for the preservation of life. But  Adam 
could preserve his life otherwise; for had he not sinned, he would not 
have died. Therefore he did not require food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the consumption of food involves voiding of the surplus, 
which seems unsuitable to the state of innocence. Therefore it seems that 
man did not take food in the primitive state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A16">Gn. 2:16</a>): "Of every tree in paradise ye 
shall [Vulg. 'thou shalt'] eat."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the state of innocence man had an animal life 
requiring food; but after the resurrection he will have a spiritual life 
needing no food. In order to make this clear, we must observe that the 
rational soul is both soul and spirit. It is called a soul by reason of 
what it possesses in common with other souls---that is, as giving life to 
the body; whence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A7">Gn. 2:7</a>): "Man was made into a living 
soul"; that is, a soul giving life to the body. But the soul is called a 
spirit according to what properly belongs to itself, and not to other 
souls, as possessing an intellectual immaterial power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in the primitive state, the rational soul communicated to the body 
what belonged to itself as a soul; and so the body was called "animal" 
[*From 'anima', a soul; Cf. 1 Cor. 15:44 seqq.], through having its life 
from the soul. Now the first principle of life in these inferior 
creatures as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 4) is the vegetative 
soul: the operations of which are the use of food, generation, and 
growth. Wherefore such operations befitted man in the state of innocence. 
But in the final state, after the resurrection, the soul will, to a 
certain extent, communicate to the body what properly belongs to itself 
as a spirit; immortality to everyone; impassibility, glory, and power to 
the good, whose bodies will be called "spiritual." So, after the 
resurrection, man will not require food; whereas he required it in the 
state of innocence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [*Works of 
an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of St. Augustine]): 
"How could man have an immortal body, which was sustained by food? Since 
an immortal being needs neither food nor drink." For we have explained 
(<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that the immortality of the primitive state was based on a 
supernatural force in the soul, and not on any intrinsic disposition of 
the body: so that by the action of heat, the body might lose part of its 
humid qualities; and to prevent the entire consumption of the humor, man 
was obliged to take food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A certain passion and alteration attends nutriment, on the 
part of the food changed into the substance of the thing nourished. So we 
cannot thence conclude that man's body was passible, but that the food 
taken was passible; although this kind of passion conduced to the 
perfection of the nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If man had not taken food he would have sinned; as he also 
sinned by taking the forbidden fruit. For he was told at the same time, 
to abstain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and to eat of 
every other tree of Paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some say that in the state of innocence man would not have 
taken more than necessary food, so that there would have been nothing 
superfluous; which, however, is unreasonable to suppose, as implying that 
there would have been no faecal matter. Wherefore there was need for 
voiding the surplus, yet so disposed by God as to be decorous and 
suitable to the state.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence man would have acquired immortality by the tree of life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the tree of life could not be the cause of 
immortality. For nothing can act beyond its own species; as an effect 
does not exceed its cause. But the tree of life was corruptible, 
otherwise it could not be taken as food; since food is changed into the 
substance of the thing nourished. Therefore the tree of life could not 
give incorruptibility or immortality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, effects caused by the forces of plants and other natural 
agencies are natural. If therefore the tree of life caused immortality, 
this would have been natural immortality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this would seem to be reduced to the ancient fable, that 
the gods, by eating a certain food, became immortal; which the 
Philosopher ridicules (Metaph. iii, Did. ii, 4).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++3%3A22">Gn. 3:22</a>): "Lest perhaps he put forth 
his hand, and take of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." 
Further, Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 [*Work of an 
anonymous author, among the supposititious works of St. Augustine]): "A 
taste of the tree of life warded off corruption of the body; and even 
after sin man would have remained immortal, had he been allowed to eat of 
the tree of life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The tree of life in a certain degree was the cause of 
immortality, but not absolutely. To understand this, we must observe that 
in the primitive state man possessed, for the preservation of life, two 
remedies, against two defects. One of these defects was the lost of 
humidity by the action of natural heat, which acts as the soul's 
instrument: as a remedy against such loss man was provided with food, 
taken from the other trees of paradise, as now we are provided with the 
food, which we take for the same purpose. The second defect, as the 
Philosopher says (De Gener. i, 5), arises from the fact that the humor 
which is caused from extraneous sources, being added to the humor already 
existing, lessens the specific active power: as water added to wine takes 
at first the taste of wine, then, as more water is added, the strength of 
the wine is diminished, till the wine becomes watery. In like manner, we 
may observe that at first the active force of the  species is so strong 
that it is able to transform so much of the food as is required to 
replace the lost tissue, as well as what suffices for growth; later on, 
however, the assimilated food does not suffice for growth, but only 
replaces what is lost. Last of all, in old age, it does not suffice even 
for this purpose; whereupon the body declines, and finally dies from 
natural causes. Against this defect man was provided with a remedy in the 
tree of life; for its effect was to strengthen the force of the species 
against the weakness resulting from the admixture of extraneous 
nutriment. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): "Man had food 
to appease his hunger, drink to slake his thirst; and the tree of life to 
banish the breaking up of old age"; and (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19 
[*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of St. 
Augustine]) "The tree of life, like a drug, warded off all bodily 
corruption."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it did not absolutely cause immortality; for neither was the soul's 
intrinsic power of preserving the body due to the tree of life, nor was 
it of such efficiency as to give the body a disposition to immortality, 
whereby it might become indissoluble; which is clear from the fact that 
every bodily power is finite; so the power of the tree of life could not 
go so far as to give the body the prerogative of living for an infinite 
time, but only for a definite time. For it is manifest that the greater a 
force is, the more durable is its effect; therefore, since the power of 
the tree of life was finite, man's life was to be preserved for a 
definite time by partaking of it once; and when that time had elapsed, 
man was to be either transferred to a spiritual life, or had need to eat 
once more of the tree of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[97] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this the replies to the objections clearly appear. For the first 
proves that the tree of life did not absolutely cause immortality; while 
the others show that it caused incorruption by warding off corruption, 
according to the explanation above given.<br>
