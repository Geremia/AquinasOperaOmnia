</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider the work of distinction; first, the ordering of 
creation towards distinction; secondly, the distinction itself. Under the 
first head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether formlessness of created matter preceded in time its 
formation?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the matter of all corporeal things is the same?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the empyrean heaven was created contemporaneously with 
formless matter?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether time was created simultaneously with it?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that formlessness of matter preceded in time its 
formation. For it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1%3A2">Gn. 1:2</a>): "The earth was void and empty," or 
"invisible and shapeless," according to another version [*Septuagint]; by 
which is understood the formlessness of matter, as Augustine says 
(Confess. xii, 12). Therefore matter was  formless until it received its 
form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nature in its working imitates the working of God, as a 
secondary cause imitates a first cause. But in the working of nature 
formlessness precedes form in time. It does so, therefore, in the Divine 
working.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matter is higher than accident, for matter is part of 
substance. But God can effect that accident exist without substance, as 
in the Sacrament of the Altar. He could, therefore, cause matter to exist 
without form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> An imperfect effect proves imperfection in the agent. 
But God is an agent absolutely perfect; wherefore it is said of Him (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++32%3A4">Dt. 32:4</a>): "The works of God are perfect." Therefore the work of His creation 
was at no time formless. Further, the formation of corporeal creatures 
was effected by the work of distinction. But confusion is opposed to 
distinction, as formlessness to form. It, therefore, formlessness 
preceded in time the formation of matter, it follows that at the 
beginning confusion, called by the ancients chaos, existed in the 
corporeal creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> On this point holy men differ in opinion. Augustine for 
instance (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), believes that the formlessness of matter 
was not prior in time to its formation, but only in origin or the order 
of nature, whereas others, as Basil (Hom. ii In Hexaem.), Ambrose (In 
Hexaem. i), and Chrysostom (Hom. ii In Gen.), hold that formlessness of 
matter preceded in time its formation. And although these opinions seem 
mutually contradictory, in reality they differ but little; for Augustine 
takes the formlessness of matter in a different sense from the others. In 
his sense it means the absence of all form, and if we thus understand it 
we cannot say that the formlessness of matter was prior in time either to 
its formation or to its distinction. As to formation, the argument is 
clear. For if formless matter preceded in duration, it already existed; 
for this is implied by duration, since the end of creation is being in 
act: and act itself is a form. To say, then, that matter preceded, but 
without form, is to say that being existed actually, yet without act, 
which is a contradiction in terms. Nor can it be said that it possessed 
some common form, on which afterwards supervened the different forms that 
distinguish it. For this would be to hold the opinion of the ancient 
natural philosophers, who maintained that primary matter was some 
corporeal thing in act, as fire, air, water, or some intermediate 
substance. Hence, it followed that to be made means merely to be changed; 
for since that preceding form bestowed actual substantial being, and made 
some particular thing to be, it would result that the supervening form 
would not simply make an actual being, but 'this' actual being; which is 
the proper effect of an accidental form. Thus the consequent forms would 
be merely accidents, implying not generation, but alteration. Hence we 
must assert that primary matter was not created altogether formless, nor 
under any one common form, but under distinct forms. And so, if the 
formlessness  of matter be taken as referring to the condition of primary 
matter, which in itself is formless, this formlessness did not precede in 
time its formation or distinction, but only in origin and nature, as 
Augustine says; in the same way as potentiality is prior to act, and the 
part to the whole. But the other holy writers understand by formlessness, 
not the exclusion of all form, but the absence of that beauty and 
comeliness which are now apparent in the corporeal creation. Accordingly 
they say that the formlessness of corporeal matter preceded its form in 
duration. And so, when this is considered, it appears that Augustine 
agrees with them in some respects, and in others disagrees, as will be 
shown later (<A Href="FP069.html#FPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP074.html#FPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="FP074.html#FPQ74A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as may be gathered from the text of Genesis a threefold beauty 
was wanting to corporeal creatures, for which reason they are said to be 
without form. For the beauty of light was wanting to all that transparent 
body which we call the heavens, whence it is said that "darkness was upon 
the fact of the deep." And the earth lacked beauty in two ways: first, 
that beauty which it acquired when its watery veil was withdrawn, and so 
we read that "the earth was void," or "invisible," inasmuch as the waters 
covered and concealed it from view; secondly, that which it derives from 
being adorned by herbs and plants, for which reason it is called "empty," 
or, according to another reading [*Septuagint], "shapeless"---that is, 
unadorned. Thus after mention of two created natures, the heaven and the 
earth, the formlessness of the heaven is indicated by the words, 
"darkness was upon the face of the deep," since the air is included under 
heaven; and the formlessness of the earth, by the words, "the earth was 
void and empty."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word earth is taken differently in this passage by 
Augustine, and by other writers. Augustine holds that by the words 
"earth" and "water," in this passage. primary matter itself is signified 
on account of its being impossible for Moses to make the idea of such 
matter intelligible to an ignorant people, except under the similitude of 
well-known objects. Hence he uses a variety of figures in speaking of it, 
calling it not water only, nor earth only, lest they should think it to 
be in very truth water or earth. At the same time it has so far a 
likeness to earth, in that it is susceptible of form, and to water in its 
adaptability to a variety of forms. In this respect, then, the earth is 
said to be "void and empty," or "invisible and shapeless," that matter is 
known by means of form. Hence, considered in itself, it is called 
"invisible" or "void," and its potentiality is completed by form; thus 
Plato says that matter is "place" [*Timaeus, quoted by Aristotle, Phys. 
iv, text. 15]. But other holy writers understand by earth the element of 
earth, and we have said (<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) how, in this sense, the earth was, 
according to them, without form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nature produces effect in act from being in potentiality; 
and consequently in the operations of nature potentiality must precede 
act in time, and formlessness precede form. But God produces being in act 
out of nothing, and can, therefore, produce a perfect thing in an 
instant, according to the  greatness of His power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Accident, inasmuch as it is a form, is a kind of act; 
whereas matter, as such, is essentially being in potentiality. Hence it 
is more repugnant that matter should be in act without form, than for 
accident to be without subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to the first argument in the contrary sense, we say that if, 
according to some holy writers, formlessness was prior in time to the 
informing of matter, this arose, not from want of power on God's part, 
but from His wisdom, and from the design of preserving due order in the 
disposition of creatures by developing perfection from imperfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to the second argument, we say that certain of the ancient 
natural philosophers maintained confusion devoid of all distinction; 
except Anaxagoras, who taught that the intellect alone was distinct and 
without admixture. But previous to the work of distinction Holy Scripture 
enumerates several kinds of differentiation, the first being that of the 
heaven from the earth, in which even a material distinction is expressed, 
as will be shown later (<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP068.html#FPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FP068.html#FPQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). This is signified by the 
words, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." The second 
distinction mentioned is that of the elements according to their forms, 
since both earth and water are named. That air and fire are not mentioned 
by name is due to the fact that the corporeal nature of these would not 
be so evident as that of earth and water, to the ignorant people to whom 
Moses spoke. Plato (Timaeus xxvi), nevertheless, understood air to be 
signified by the words, "Spirit of God," since spirit is another name for 
air, and considered that by the word heaven is meant fire, for he held 
heaven to be composed of fire, as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei viii, 
11). But Rabbi Moses (Perplex. ii), though otherwise agreeing with Plato, 
says that fire is signified by the word darkness, since, said he, fire 
does not shine in its own sphere. However, it seems more reasonable to 
hold to what we stated above; because by the words "Spirit of God" 
Scripture usually means the Holy Ghost, Who is said to "move over the 
waters," not, indeed, in bodily shape, but as the craftsman's will may be 
said to move over the material to which he intends to give a form. The 
third distinction is that of place; since the earth is said to be under 
the waters that rendered it invisible, whilst the air, the subject of 
darkness, is described as being above the waters, in the words: "Darkness 
was upon the face of the deep." The remaining distinctions will appear 
from what follows (<A Href="FP071.html#FPQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the formless matter of all corporeal things is the same?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the formless matter of all corporeal things is 
the same. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12): "I find two things Thou 
hast made, one formed, the other formless," and he says that the latter 
was the earth invisible and shapeless, whereby, he says, the matter of 
all corporeal things is designated.  Therefore the matter of all 
corporeal things is the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 10): "Things that 
are one in genus are one in matter." But all corporeal things are in the 
same genus of body. Therefore the matter of all bodies is the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different acts befit different potentialities, and the 
same act befits the same potentiality. But all bodies have the same form, 
corporeity. Therefore all bodies have the same matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, matter, considered in itself, is only in potentiality. 
But distinction is due to form. Therefore matter considered in itself is 
the same in all corporeal things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things of which the matter is the same are mutually 
interchangeable and mutually active or passive, as is said (De Gener. i, 
text. 50). But heavenly and earthly bodies do not act upon each other 
mutually. Therefore their matter is not the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> On this question the opinions of philosophers have 
differed. Plato and all who preceded Aristotle held that all bodies are 
of the nature of the four elements. Hence because the four elements have 
one common matter, as their mutual generation and corruption prove, it 
followed that the matter of all bodies is the same. But the fact of the 
incorruptibility of some bodies was ascribed by Plato, not to the 
condition of matter, but to the will of the artificer, God, Whom he 
represents as saying to the heavenly bodies: "By your own nature you are 
subject to dissolution, but by My will you are indissoluble, for My will 
is more powerful than the link that binds you together." But this theory 
Aristotle (De Caelo i, text. 5) disproves by the natural movements of 
bodies. For since, he says, the heavenly bodies have a natural movement, 
different from that of the elements, it follows that they have a 
different nature from them. For movement in a circle, which is proper to 
the heavenly bodies, is not by contraries, whereas the movements of the 
elements are mutually opposite, one tending upwards, another downwards: 
so, therefore, the heavenly body is without contrariety, whereas the 
elemental bodies have contrariety in their nature. And as generation and 
corruption are from contraries, it follows that, whereas the elements are 
corruptible, the heavenly bodies are incorruptible. But in spite of this 
difference of natural corruption and incorruption, Avicebron taught unity 
of matter in all bodies, arguing from their unity of form. And, indeed, 
if corporeity were one form in itself, on which the other forms that 
distinguish bodies from each other supervene, this argument would 
necessarily be true; for this form of corporeity would inhere in matter 
immutably and so far all bodies would be incorruptible. But corruption 
would then be merely accidental through the disappearance of successive 
forms---that is to say, it would be corruption, not pure and simple, but 
partial, since a being in act would subsist under the transient form. 
Thus the ancient natural philosophers taught that the substratum of 
bodies  was some actual being, such as air or fire. But supposing that no 
form exists in corruptible bodies which remains subsisting beneath 
generation and corruption, it follows necessarily that the matter of 
corruptible and incorruptible bodies is not the same. For matter, as it 
is in itself, is in potentiality to form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Considered in itself, then, it is in potentiality in respect to all 
those forms to which it is common, and in receiving any one form it is in 
act only as regards that form. Hence it remains in potentiality to all 
other forms. And this is the case even where some forms are more perfect 
than others, and contain these others virtually in themselves. For 
potentiality in itself is indifferent with respect to perfection and 
imperfection, so that under an imperfect form it is in potentiality to a 
perfect form, and "vice versa." Matter, therefore, whilst existing under 
the form of an incorruptible body, would be in potentiality to the form 
of a corruptible body; and as it does not actually possess the latter, it 
has both form and the privation of form; for want of a form in that which 
is in potentiality thereto is privation. But this condition implies 
corruptibility. It is therefore impossible that bodies by nature 
corruptible, and those by nature incorruptible, should possess the same 
matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither can we say, as Averroes [*De Substantia Orbis ii.] imagines, 
that a heavenly body itself is the matter of the heaven---beings in 
potentiality with regard to place, though not to being, and that its form 
is a separate substance united to it as its motive force. For it is 
impossible to suppose any being in act, unless in its totality it be act 
and form, or be something which has act or form. Setting aside, then, in 
thought, the separate substance stated to be endowed with motive power, 
if the heavenly body is not something having form---that is, something 
composed of a form and the subject of that form---it follows that in its 
totality it is form and act. But every such thing is something actually 
understood, which the heavenly bodies are not, being sensible. It 
follows, then, that the matter of the heavenly bodies, considered in 
itself, is in potentiality to that form alone which it actually 
possesses. Nor does it concern the point at issue to inquire whether this 
is a soul or any other thing. Hence this form perfects this matter in 
such a way that there remains in it no potentiality with respect to 
being, but only to place, as Aristotle [*De Coelo i, text. 20] says. So, 
then, the matter of the heavenly bodies and of the elements is not the 
same, except by analogy, in so far as they agree in the character of 
potentiality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine follows in this the opinion of Plato, who does 
not admit a fifth essence. Or we may say that formless matter is one with 
the unity of order, as all bodies are one in the order of corporeal 
creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If genus is taken in a physical sense, corruptible and 
incorruptible things are not in the same genus, on account of their 
different modes of potentiality, as is said in Metaph. x, text. 26. 
Logically considered, however, there is but  one genus of all bodies, 
since they are all included in the one notion of corporeity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The form of corporeity is not one and the same in all 
bodies, being no other than the various forms by which bodies are 
distinguished, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As potentiality is directed towards act, potential beings 
are differentiated by their different acts, as sight is by color, hearing 
by sound. Therefore for this reason the matter of the celestial bodies is 
different from that of the elemental, because the matter of the celestial 
is not in potentiality to an elemental form.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the empyrean heaven was created at the same time as formless matter?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the empyrean heaven was not created at the 
same time as formless matter. For the empyrean, if it is anything at all, 
must be a sensible body. But all sensible bodies are movable, and the 
empyrean heaven is not movable. For if it were so, its movement would be 
ascertained by the movement of some visible body, which is not the case. 
The empyrean heaven, then, was not created contemporaneously with 
formless matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4) that "the lower bodies 
are governed by the higher in a certain order." If, therefore, the 
empyrean heaven is the highest of bodies, it must necessarily exercise 
some influence on bodies below it. But this does not seem to be the case, 
especially as it is presumed to be without movement; for one body cannot 
move another unless itself also be moved. Therefore the empyrean heaven 
was not created together with formless matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it is held that the empyrean heaven is the place of 
contemplation, and not ordained to natural effects; on the contrary, 
Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): "In so far as we mentally apprehend 
eternal things, so far are we not of this world"; from which it is clear 
that contemplation lifts the mind above the things of this world. 
Corporeal place, therefore, cannot be the seat of contemplation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, among the heavenly bodies exists a body, partly 
transparent and partly luminous, which we call the sidereal heaven. There 
exists also a heaven wholly transparent, called by some the aqueous or 
crystalline heaven. If, then, there exists a still higher heaven, it must 
be wholly luminous. But this cannot be, for then the air would be 
constantly illuminated, and there would be no night. Therefore the 
empyrean heaven was not created together with formless matter.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Strabus says that in the passage, "In the beginning God 
created heaven and earth," heaven denotes not the  visible firmament, but 
the empyrean or fiery heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The empyrean heaven rests only on the authority of 
Strabus and Bede, and also of Basil; all of whom agree in one respect, 
namely, in holding it to be the place of the blessed. Strabus and Bede 
say that as soon as created it was filled with angels; and Basil [*Hom. 
ii. in Hexaem.] says: "Just as the lost are driven into the lowest 
darkness, so the reward for worthy deeds is laid up in the light beyond 
this world, where the just shall obtain the abode of rest." But they 
differ in the reasons on which they base their statement. Strabus and 
Bede teach that there is an empyrean heaven, because the firmament, which 
they take to mean the sidereal heaven, is said to have been made, not in 
the beginning, but on the second day: whereas the reason given by Basil 
is that otherwise God would seem to have made darkness His first work, as 
the Manicheans falsely assert, when they call the God of the Old 
Testament the God of darkness. These reasons, however, are not very 
cogent. For the question of the firmament, said to have been made on the 
second day, is solved in one way by Augustine, and in another by other 
holy writers. But the question of the darkness is explained according to 
Augustine [*Gen. ad lit. i; vii.], by supposing that formlessness, 
signified by darkness, preceded form not by duration, but by origin. 
According to others, however, since darkness is no creature, but a 
privation of light, it is a proof of Divine wisdom, that the things it 
created from nothing it produced first of all in an imperfect state, and 
afterwards brought them to perfection. But a better reason can be drawn 
from the state of glory itself. For in the reward to come a two-fold 
glory is looked for, spiritual and corporeal, not only in the human body 
to be glorified, but in the whole world which is to be made new. Now the 
spiritual glory began with the beginning of the world, in the blessedness 
of the angels, equality with whom is promised to the saints. It was 
fitting, then, that even from the beginning, there should be made some 
beginning of bodily glory in something corporeal, free at the very outset 
from the servitude of corruption and change, and wholly luminous, even as 
the whole bodily creation, after the Resurrection, is expected to be. So, 
then, that heaven is called the empyrean, i.e. fiery, not from its heat, 
but from its brightness. It is to be noticed, however, that Augustine (De 
Civ. Dei x, 9,27) says that Porphyry sets the demons apart from the 
angels by supposing that the former inhabit the air, the latter the 
ether, or empyrean. But Porphyry, as a Platonist, held the heaven, known 
as sidereal, to be fiery, and therefore called it empyrean or ethereal, 
taking ethereal to denote the burning of flame, and not as Aristotle 
understands it, swiftness of movement (De Coel. i, text. 22). This much 
has been said to prevent anyone from supposing that Augustine maintained 
an empyrean heaven in the sense understood by modern writers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sensible corporeal things are movable in the present state 
of the world, for by the movement of corporeal creatures is secured by 
the multiplication of the elements. But when glory is finally 
consummated, the movement of bodies will cease. And such must have been 
from the beginning the condition of  the empyrean.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is sufficiently probable, as some assert, that the 
empyrean heaven, having the state of glory for its ordained end, does not 
influence inferior bodies of another order---those, namely, that are 
directed only to natural ends. Yet it seems still more probable that it 
does influence bodies that are moved, though itself motionless, just as 
angels of the highest rank, who assist [*Infra, Question [112], Article [3]], influence 
those of lower degree who act as messengers, though they themselves are 
not sent, as Dionysius teaches (Coel. Hier. xii). For this reason it may 
be said that the influence of the empyrean upon that which is called the 
first heaven, and is moved, produces therein not something that comes and 
goes as a result of movement, but something of a fixed and stable nature, 
as the power of conservation or causation, or something of the kind 
pertaining to dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Corporeal place is assigned to contemplation, not as 
necessary, but as congruous, that the splendor without may correspond to 
that which is within. Hence Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) says: "The 
ministering spirit could not live in darkness, but made his habitual 
dwelling in light and joy."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.): "It is certain that the 
heaven was created spherical in shape, of dense body, and sufficiently 
strong to separate what is outside it from what it encloses. On this 
account it darkens the region external to it, the light by which itself 
is lit up being shut out from that region. "But since the body of the 
firmament, though solid, is transparent, for that it does not exclude 
light (as is clear from the fact that we can see the stars through the 
intervening heavens), we may also say that the empyrean has light, not 
condensed so as to emit rays, as the sun does, but of a more subtle 
nature. Or it may have the brightness of glory which differs from mere 
natural brightness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether time was created simultaneously with formless matter?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that time was not created simultaneously with 
formless matter. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12): "I find two 
things that Thou didst create before time was, the primary corporeal 
matter, and the angelic nature. "Therefore time was not created with 
formless matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, time is divided by day and night. But in the beginning 
there was neither day nor night, for these began when "God divided the 
light from the darkness. "Therefore in the beginning time was not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, time is the measure of the firmament's movement; and the 
firmament is said to have been made on the second day. Therefore in the 
beginning time was not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, movement precedes time, and therefore should be reckoned 
among the first things created, rather than time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as time is the extrinsic measure of created things, so 
is place. Place, then, as truly as time, must be reckoned among the 
things first created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. i, 3): "Both spiritual and 
corporeal creatures were created at the beginning of time."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is commonly said that the first things created were 
these four---the angelic nature, the empyrean heaven, formless corporeal 
matter, and time. It must be observed, however, that this is not the 
opinion of Augustine. For he (Confess. xii, 12) specifies only two things 
as first created---the angelic nature and corporeal matter---making no 
mention of the empyrean heaven. But these two, namely, the angelic nature 
and formless matter, precede the formation, by nature only, and not by 
duration; and therefore, as they precede formation, so do they precede 
movement and time. Time, therefore, cannot be included among them. But 
the enumeration above given is that of other holy writers, who hold that 
the formlessness of matter preceded by duration its form, and this view 
postulates the existence of time as the measure of duration: for 
otherwise there would be no such measure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The teaching of Augustine rests on the opinion that the 
angelic nature and formless matter precede time by origin or nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As in the opinion of some holy writers matter was in some 
measure formless before it received its full form, so time was in a 
manner formless before it was fully formed and distinguished into day and 
night.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the movement of the firmament did not begin immediately 
from the beginning, then the time that preceded was the measure, not of 
the firmament's movement, but of the first movement of whatsoever kind. 
For it is accidental to time to be the measure of the firmament's 
movement, in so far as this is the first movement. But if the first 
movement was another than this, time would have been its measure, for 
everything is measured by the first of its kind. And it must be granted 
that forthwith from the beginning, there was movement of some kind, at 
least in the succession of concepts and affections in the angelic mind: 
while movement without time cannot be conceived, since time is nothing 
else than "the measure of priority and succession in movement."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Among the first created things are to be reckoned those 
which have a general relationship to things. And, therefore, among these 
time must be included, as having the nature of a common measure; but not 
movement, which is related only to the movable subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[66] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Place is implied as existing in the empyrean heaven, this 
being the boundary of the universe. And since place has reference to 
things permanent, it was created at once in its totality. But time, as 
not being permanent, was created in its beginning: even as actually we 
cannot lay hold of any part of time save the "now."<br>
