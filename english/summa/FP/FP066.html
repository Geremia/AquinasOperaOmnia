    ON THE ORDER OF CREATION TOWARDS DISTINCTION (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the work of distinction; first, the ordering of
    creation towards distinction; secondly, the distinction itself. Under the
    first head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether formlessness of created
    matter preceded in time its formation?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the matter of all
    corporeal things is the same?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the empyrean heaven was
    created contemporaneously with formless matter?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether time was created
    simultaneously with it?

    Whether formlessness of created matter preceded in time its formation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that formlessness of matter
    preceded in time its formation. For it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A2"
      >Gn. 1:2</a
    >): "The earth was void and empty," or "invisible and shapeless," according
    to another version [*Septuagint]; by which is understood the formlessness of
    matter, as Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12). Therefore matter was formless
    until it received its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nature in its working imitates the
    working of God, as a secondary cause imitates a first cause. But in the
    working of nature formlessness precedes form in time. It does so, therefore,
    in the Divine working.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matter is higher than accident, for
    matter is part of substance. But God can effect that accident exist without
    substance, as in the Sacrament of the Altar. He could, therefore, cause
    matter to exist without form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> An imperfect effect proves imperfection in
    the agent. But God is an agent absolutely perfect; wherefore it is said of
    Him (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++32%3A4">Dt. 32:4</a
    >): "The works of God are perfect." Therefore the work of His creation was
    at no time formless. Further, the formation of corporeal creatures was
    effected by the work of distinction. But confusion is opposed to
    distinction, as formlessness to form. It, therefore, formlessness preceded
    in time the formation of matter, it follows that at the beginning confusion,
    called by the ancients chaos, existed in the corporeal creation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> On this point holy men differ in opinion.
    Augustine for instance (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), believes that the formlessness
    of matter was not prior in time to its formation, but only in origin or the
    order of nature, whereas others, as Basil (Hom. ii In Hexaem.), Ambrose (In
    Hexaem. i), and Chrysostom (Hom. ii In Gen.), hold that formlessness of
    matter preceded in time its formation. And although these opinions seem
    mutually contradictory, in reality they differ but little; for Augustine
    takes the formlessness of matter in a different sense from the others. In
    his sense it means the absence of all form, and if we thus understand it we
    cannot say that the formlessness of matter was prior in time either to its
    formation or to its distinction. As to formation, the argument is clear. For
    if formless matter preceded in duration, it already existed; for this is
    implied by duration, since the end of creation is being in act: and act
    itself is a form. To say, then, that matter preceded, but without form, is
    to say that being existed actually, yet without act, which is a
    contradiction in terms. Nor can it be said that it possessed some common
    form, on which afterwards supervened the different forms that distinguish
    it. For this would be to hold the opinion of the ancient natural
    philosophers, who maintained that primary matter was some corporeal thing in
    act, as fire, air, water, or some intermediate substance. Hence, it followed
    that to be made means merely to be changed; for since that preceding form
    bestowed actual substantial being, and made some particular thing to be, it
    would result that the supervening form would not simply make an actual
    being, but 'this' actual being; which is the proper effect of an accidental
    form. Thus the consequent forms would be merely accidents, implying not
    generation, but alteration. Hence we must assert that primary matter was not
    created altogether formless, nor under any one common form, but under
    distinct forms. And so, if the formlessness of matter be taken as referring
    to the condition of primary matter, which in itself is formless, this
    formlessness did not precede in time its formation or distinction, but only
    in origin and nature, as Augustine says; in the same way as potentiality is
    prior to act, and the part to the whole. But the other holy writers
    understand by formlessness, not the exclusion of all form, but the absence
    of that beauty and comeliness which are now apparent in the corporeal
    creation. Accordingly they say that the formlessness of corporeal matter
    preceded its form in duration. And so, when this is considered, it appears
    that Augustine agrees with them in some respects, and in others disagrees,
    as will be shown later (<a href="FP069.html#FPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>,
    <a href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FP074.html#FPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>,
    <a href="FP074.html#FPQ74A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As far as may be gathered from the text of Genesis a threefold beauty was
    wanting to corporeal creatures, for which reason they are said to be without
    form. For the beauty of light was wanting to all that transparent body which
    we call the heavens, whence it is said that "darkness was upon the fact of
    the deep." And the earth lacked beauty in two ways: first, that beauty which
    it acquired when its watery veil was withdrawn, and so we read that "the
    earth was void," or "invisible," inasmuch as the waters covered and
    concealed it from view; secondly, that which it derives from being adorned
    by herbs and plants, for which reason it is called "empty," or, according to
    another reading [*Septuagint], "shapeless"---that is, unadorned. Thus after
    mention of two created natures, the heaven and the earth, the formlessness
    of the heaven is indicated by the words, "darkness was upon the face of the
    deep," since the air is included under heaven; and the formlessness of the
    earth, by the words, "the earth was void and empty."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word earth is taken differently in
    this passage by Augustine, and by other writers. Augustine holds that by the
    words "earth" and "water," in this passage. primary matter itself is
    signified on account of its being impossible for Moses to make the idea of
    such matter intelligible to an ignorant people, except under the similitude
    of well-known objects. Hence he uses a variety of figures in speaking of it,
    calling it not water only, nor earth only, lest they should think it to be
    in very truth water or earth. At the same time it has so far a likeness to
    earth, in that it is susceptible of form, and to water in its adaptability
    to a variety of forms. In this respect, then, the earth is said to be "void
    and empty," or "invisible and shapeless," that matter is known by means of
    form. Hence, considered in itself, it is called "invisible" or "void," and
    its potentiality is completed by form; thus Plato says that matter is
    "place" [*Timaeus, quoted by Aristotle, Phys. iv, text. 15]. But other holy
    writers understand by earth the element of earth, and we have said (<a
      href="FP066.html#FPQ66A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) how, in this sense, the earth was, according to them, without form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nature produces effect in act from being
    in potentiality; and consequently in the operations of nature potentiality
    must precede act in time, and formlessness precede form. But God produces
    being in act out of nothing, and can, therefore, produce a perfect thing in
    an instant, according to the greatness of His power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Accident, inasmuch as it is a form, is a
    kind of act; whereas matter, as such, is essentially being in potentiality.
    Hence it is more repugnant that matter should be in act without form, than
    for accident to be without subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In reply to the first argument in the contrary sense, we say that if,
    according to some holy writers, formlessness was prior in time to the
    informing of matter, this arose, not from want of power on God's part, but
    from His wisdom, and from the design of preserving due order in the
    disposition of creatures by developing perfection from imperfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In reply to the second argument, we say that certain of the ancient natural
    philosophers maintained confusion devoid of all distinction; except
    Anaxagoras, who taught that the intellect alone was distinct and without
    admixture. But previous to the work of distinction Holy Scripture enumerates
    several kinds of differentiation, the first being that of the heaven from
    the earth, in which even a material distinction is expressed, as will be
    shown later (<a href="FP066.html#FPQ66A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FP068.html#FPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="FP068.html#FPQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). This is signified by the
    words, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." The second
    distinction mentioned is that of the elements according to their forms,
    since both earth and water are named. That air and fire are not mentioned by
    name is due to the fact that the corporeal nature of these would not be so
    evident as that of earth and water, to the ignorant people to whom Moses
    spoke. Plato (Timaeus xxvi), nevertheless, understood air to be signified by
    the words, "Spirit of God," since spirit is another name for air, and
    considered that by the word heaven is meant fire, for he held heaven to be
    composed of fire, as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei viii, 11). But Rabbi
    Moses (Perplex. ii), though otherwise agreeing with Plato, says that fire is
    signified by the word darkness, since, said he, fire does not shine in its
    own sphere. However, it seems more reasonable to hold to what we stated
    above; because by the words "Spirit of God" Scripture usually means the Holy
    Ghost, Who is said to "move over the waters," not, indeed, in bodily shape,
    but as the craftsman's will may be said to move over the material to which
    he intends to give a form. The third distinction is that of place; since the
    earth is said to be under the waters that rendered it invisible, whilst the
    air, the subject of darkness, is described as being above the waters, in the
    words: "Darkness was upon the face of the deep." The remaining distinctions
    will appear from what follows (<a href="FP071.html#FPQ71OUTP1"

    Whether the formless matter of all corporeal things is the same?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the formless matter of all
    corporeal things is the same. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12): "I find
    two things Thou hast made, one formed, the other formless," and he says that
    the latter was the earth invisible and shapeless, whereby, he says, the
    matter of all corporeal things is designated. Therefore the matter of all
    corporeal things is the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text.
    10): "Things that are one in genus are one in matter." But all corporeal
    things are in the same genus of body. Therefore the matter of all bodies is
    the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different acts befit different
    potentialities, and the same act befits the same potentiality. But all
    bodies have the same form, corporeity. Therefore all bodies have the same
    matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, matter, considered in itself, is only in
    potentiality. But distinction is due to form. Therefore matter considered in
    itself is the same in all corporeal things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things of which the matter is the same are
    mutually interchangeable and mutually active or passive, as is said (De
    Gener. i, text. 50). But heavenly and earthly bodies do not act upon each
    other mutually. Therefore their matter is not the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> On this question the opinions of philosophers
    have differed. Plato and all who preceded Aristotle held that all bodies are
    of the nature of the four elements. Hence because the four elements have one
    common matter, as their mutual generation and corruption prove, it followed
    that the matter of all bodies is the same. But the fact of the
    incorruptibility of some bodies was ascribed by Plato, not to the condition
    of matter, but to the will of the artificer, God, Whom he represents as
    saying to the heavenly bodies: "By your own nature you are subject to
    dissolution, but by My will you are indissoluble, for My will is more
    powerful than the link that binds you together." But this theory Aristotle
    (De Caelo i, text. 5) disproves by the natural movements of bodies. For
    since, he says, the heavenly bodies have a natural movement, different from
    that of the elements, it follows that they have a different nature from
    them. For movement in a circle, which is proper to the heavenly bodies, is
    not by contraries, whereas the movements of the elements are mutually
    opposite, one tending upwards, another downwards: so, therefore, the
    heavenly body is without contrariety, whereas the elemental bodies have
    contrariety in their nature. And as generation and corruption are from
    contraries, it follows that, whereas the elements are corruptible, the
    heavenly bodies are incorruptible. But in spite of this difference of
    natural corruption and incorruption, Avicebron taught unity of matter in all
    bodies, arguing from their unity of form. And, indeed, if corporeity were
    one form in itself, on which the other forms that distinguish bodies from
    each other supervene, this argument would necessarily be true; for this form
    of corporeity would inhere in matter immutably and so far all bodies would
    be incorruptible. But corruption would then be merely accidental through the
    disappearance of successive forms---that is to say, it would be corruption,
    not pure and simple, but partial, since a being in act would subsist under
    the transient form. Thus the ancient natural philosophers taught that the
    substratum of bodies was some actual being, such as air or fire. But
    supposing that no form exists in corruptible bodies which remains subsisting
    beneath generation and corruption, it follows necessarily that the matter of
    corruptible and incorruptible bodies is not the same. For matter, as it is
    in itself, is in potentiality to form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Considered in itself, then, it is in potentiality in respect to all those
    forms to which it is common, and in receiving any one form it is in act only
    as regards that form. Hence it remains in potentiality to all other forms.
    And this is the case even where some forms are more perfect than others, and
    contain these others virtually in themselves. For potentiality in itself is
    indifferent with respect to perfection and imperfection, so that under an
    imperfect form it is in potentiality to a perfect form, and "vice versa."
    Matter, therefore, whilst existing under the form of an incorruptible body,
    would be in potentiality to the form of a corruptible body; and as it does
    not actually possess the latter, it has both form and the privation of form;
    for want of a form in that which is in potentiality thereto is privation.
    But this condition implies corruptibility. It is therefore impossible that
    bodies by nature corruptible, and those by nature incorruptible, should
    possess the same matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Neither can we say, as Averroes [*De Substantia Orbis ii.] imagines, that a
    heavenly body itself is the matter of the heaven---beings in potentiality
    with regard to place, though not to being, and that its form is a separate
    substance united to it as its motive force. For it is impossible to suppose
    any being in act, unless in its totality it be act and form, or be something
    which has act or form. Setting aside, then, in thought, the separate
    substance stated to be endowed with motive power, if the heavenly body is
    not something having form---that is, something composed of a form and the
    subject of that form---it follows that in its totality it is form and act.
    But every such thing is something actually understood, which the heavenly
    bodies are not, being sensible. It follows, then, that the matter of the
    heavenly bodies, considered in itself, is in potentiality to that form alone
    which it actually possesses. Nor does it concern the point at issue to
    inquire whether this is a soul or any other thing. Hence this form perfects
    this matter in such a way that there remains in it no potentiality with
    respect to being, but only to place, as Aristotle [*De Coelo i, text. 20]
    says. So, then, the matter of the heavenly bodies and of the elements is not
    the same, except by analogy, in so far as they agree in the character of
    potentiality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine follows in this the opinion of
    Plato, who does not admit a fifth essence. Or we may say that formless
    matter is one with the unity of order, as all bodies are one in the order of
    corporeal creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If genus is taken in a physical sense,
    corruptible and incorruptible things are not in the same genus, on account
    of their different modes of potentiality, as is said in Metaph. x, text. 26.
    Logically considered, however, there is but one genus of all bodies, since
    they are all included in the one notion of corporeity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The form of corporeity is not one and
    the same in all bodies, being no other than the various forms by which
    bodies are distinguished, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As potentiality is directed towards act,
    potential beings are differentiated by their different acts, as sight is by
    color, hearing by sound. Therefore for this reason the matter of the
    celestial bodies is different from that of the elemental, because the matter
    of the celestial is not in potentiality to an elemental form.<br />

    Whether the empyrean heaven was created at the same time as formless
    matter?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the empyrean heaven was not
    created at the same time as formless matter. For the empyrean, if it is
    anything at all, must be a sensible body. But all sensible bodies are
    movable, and the empyrean heaven is not movable. For if it were so, its
    movement would be ascertained by the movement of some visible body, which is
    not the case. The empyrean heaven, then, was not created contemporaneously
    with formless matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4) that
    "the lower bodies are governed by the higher in a certain order." If,
    therefore, the empyrean heaven is the highest of bodies, it must necessarily
    exercise some influence on bodies below it. But this does not seem to be the
    case, especially as it is presumed to be without movement; for one body
    cannot move another unless itself also be moved. Therefore the empyrean
    heaven was not created together with formless matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it is held that the empyrean heaven
    is the place of contemplation, and not ordained to natural effects; on the
    contrary, Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): "In so far as we mentally
    apprehend eternal things, so far are we not of this world"; from which it is
    clear that contemplation lifts the mind above the things of this world.
    Corporeal place, therefore, cannot be the seat of contemplation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, among the heavenly bodies exists a body,
    partly transparent and partly luminous, which we call the sidereal heaven.
    There exists also a heaven wholly transparent, called by some the aqueous or
    crystalline heaven. If, then, there exists a still higher heaven, it must be
    wholly luminous. But this cannot be, for then the air would be constantly
    illuminated, and there would be no night. Therefore the empyrean heaven was
    not created together with formless matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Strabus says that in the passage, "In the
    beginning God created heaven and earth," heaven denotes not the visible
    firmament, but the empyrean or fiery heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The empyrean heaven rests only on the authority
    of Strabus and Bede, and also of Basil; all of whom agree in one respect,
    namely, in holding it to be the place of the blessed. Strabus and Bede say
    that as soon as created it was filled with angels; and Basil [*Hom. ii. in
    Hexaem.] says: "Just as the lost are driven into the lowest darkness, so the
    reward for worthy deeds is laid up in the light beyond this world, where the
    just shall obtain the abode of rest." But they differ in the reasons on
    which they base their statement. Strabus and Bede teach that there is an
    empyrean heaven, because the firmament, which they take to mean the sidereal
    heaven, is said to have been made, not in the beginning, but on the second
    day: whereas the reason given by Basil is that otherwise God would seem to
    have made darkness His first work, as the Manicheans falsely assert, when
    they call the God of the Old Testament the God of darkness. These reasons,
    however, are not very cogent. For the question of the firmament, said to
    have been made on the second day, is solved in one way by Augustine, and in
    another by other holy writers. But the question of the darkness is explained
    according to Augustine [*Gen. ad lit. i; vii.], by supposing that
    formlessness, signified by darkness, preceded form not by duration, but by
    origin. According to others, however, since darkness is no creature, but a
    privation of light, it is a proof of Divine wisdom, that the things it
    created from nothing it produced first of all in an imperfect state, and
    afterwards brought them to perfection. But a better reason can be drawn from
    the state of glory itself. For in the reward to come a two-fold glory is
    looked for, spiritual and corporeal, not only in the human body to be
    glorified, but in the whole world which is to be made new. Now the spiritual
    glory began with the beginning of the world, in the blessedness of the
    angels, equality with whom is promised to the saints. It was fitting, then,
    that even from the beginning, there should be made some beginning of bodily
    glory in something corporeal, free at the very outset from the servitude of
    corruption and change, and wholly luminous, even as the whole bodily
    creation, after the Resurrection, is expected to be. So, then, that heaven
    is called the empyrean, i.e. fiery, not from its heat, but from its
    brightness. It is to be noticed, however, that Augustine (De Civ. Dei x,
    9,27) says that Porphyry sets the demons apart from the angels by supposing
    that the former inhabit the air, the latter the ether, or empyrean. But
    Porphyry, as a Platonist, held the heaven, known as sidereal, to be fiery,
    and therefore called it empyrean or ethereal, taking ethereal to denote the
    burning of flame, and not as Aristotle understands it, swiftness of movement
    (De Coel. i, text. 22). This much has been said to prevent anyone from
    supposing that Augustine maintained an empyrean heaven in the sense
    understood by modern writers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sensible corporeal things are movable in
    the present state of the world, for by the movement of corporeal creatures
    is secured by the multiplication of the elements. But when glory is finally
    consummated, the movement of bodies will cease. And such must have been from
    the beginning the condition of the empyrean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is sufficiently probable, as some
    assert, that the empyrean heaven, having the state of glory for its ordained
    end, does not influence inferior bodies of another order---those, namely,
    that are directed only to natural ends. Yet it seems still more probable
    that it does influence bodies that are moved, though itself motionless, just
    as angels of the highest rank, who assist [*Infra, Question [112], Article
    [3]], influence those of lower degree who act as messengers, though they
    themselves are not sent, as Dionysius teaches (Coel. Hier. xii). For this
    reason it may be said that the influence of the empyrean upon that which is
    called the first heaven, and is moved, produces therein not something that
    comes and goes as a result of movement, but something of a fixed and stable
    nature, as the power of conservation or causation, or something of the kind
    pertaining to dignity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Corporeal place is assigned to
    contemplation, not as necessary, but as congruous, that the splendor without
    may correspond to that which is within. Hence Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.)
    says: "The ministering spirit could not live in darkness, but made his
    habitual dwelling in light and joy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.): "It
    is certain that the heaven was created spherical in shape, of dense body,
    and sufficiently strong to separate what is outside it from what it
    encloses. On this account it darkens the region external to it, the light by
    which itself is lit up being shut out from that region. "But since the body
    of the firmament, though solid, is transparent, for that it does not exclude
    light (as is clear from the fact that we can see the stars through the
    intervening heavens), we may also say that the empyrean has light, not
    condensed so as to emit rays, as the sun does, but of a more subtle nature.
    Or it may have the brightness of glory which differs from mere natural
    brightness.<br />

    Whether time was created simultaneously with formless matter?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that time was not created
    simultaneously with formless matter. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12):
    "I find two things that Thou didst create before time was, the primary
    corporeal matter, and the angelic nature. "Therefore time was not created
    with formless matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, time is divided by day and night. But in
    the beginning there was neither day nor night, for these began when "God
    divided the light from the darkness. "Therefore in the beginning time was
    not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, time is the measure of the firmament's
    movement; and the firmament is said to have been made on the second day.
    Therefore in the beginning time was not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, movement precedes time, and therefore
    should be reckoned among the first things created, rather than time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as time is the extrinsic measure of
    created things, so is place. Place, then, as truly as time, must be reckoned
    among the things first created.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. i, 3): "Both
    spiritual and corporeal creatures were created at the beginning of time."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is commonly said that the first things
    created were these four---the angelic nature, the empyrean heaven, formless
    corporeal matter, and time. It must be observed, however, that this is not
    the opinion of Augustine. For he (Confess. xii, 12) specifies only two
    things as first created---the angelic nature and corporeal matter---making
    no mention of the empyrean heaven. But these two, namely, the angelic nature
    and formless matter, precede the formation, by nature only, and not by
    duration; and therefore, as they precede formation, so do they precede
    movement and time. Time, therefore, cannot be included among them. But the
    enumeration above given is that of other holy writers, who hold that the
    formlessness of matter preceded by duration its form, and this view
    postulates the existence of time as the measure of duration: for otherwise
    there would be no such measure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The teaching of Augustine rests on the
    opinion that the angelic nature and formless matter precede time by origin
    or nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As in the opinion of some holy writers
    matter was in some measure formless before it received its full form, so
    time was in a manner formless before it was fully formed and distinguished
    into day and night.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the movement of the firmament did not
    begin immediately from the beginning, then the time that preceded was the
    measure, not of the firmament's movement, but of the first movement of
    whatsoever kind. For it is accidental to time to be the measure of the
    firmament's movement, in so far as this is the first movement. But if the
    first movement was another than this, time would have been its measure, for
    everything is measured by the first of its kind. And it must be granted that
    forthwith from the beginning, there was movement of some kind, at least in
    the succession of concepts and affections in the angelic mind: while
    movement without time cannot be conceived, since time is nothing else than
    "the measure of priority and succession in movement."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Among the first created things are to be
    reckoned those which have a general relationship to things. And, therefore,
    among these time must be included, as having the nature of a common measure;
    but not movement, which is related only to the movable subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Place is implied as existing in the
    empyrean heaven, this being the boundary of the universe. And since place
    has reference to things permanent, it was created at once in its totality.
    But time, as not being permanent, was created in its beginning: even as
    actually we cannot lay hold of any part of time save the "now."<br />
