<H3 Align="Center">OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS REGARDS KNOWLEDGE (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider the condition of the offspring as to knowledge. Under 
this head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP101.html#FPQ101A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born with 
perfect knowledge?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP101.html#FPQ101A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they would have had perfect use of reason at the moment of 
birth?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have 
been born with perfect knowledge. For Adam would have begotten children 
like himself. But Adam was gifted with perfect knowledge (<A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>, <A Href="FP094.html#FPQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). 
Therefore children would have been born of him with perfect knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, ignorance is a result of sin, as Bede says (Cf. FS, 
Question [85], Article [3]). But ignorance is privation of knowledge. Therefore before 
sin children would have had perfect knowledge as soon as they were born.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, children would have been gifted with righteousness from 
birth. But knowledge is required for righteousness, since it directs our 
actions. Therefore they would also have been gifted with knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The human soul is naturally "like a blank tablet on 
which nothing is written," as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 4). But 
the nature of the soul is the same now as it would have been in the state 
of innocence. Therefore the souls of children would have been without 
knowledge at birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), as regards belief in 
matters which are above nature, we rely on authority alone; and so, when 
authority is wanting, we must be guided by the ordinary course of nature. 
Now it is natural for man to acquire knowledge through the senses, as 
above explained (<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>); and for this reason is the 
soul united to the body, that it needs it for its proper operation; and 
this would not be so if the soul were endowed at birth with knowledge not 
acquired through the sensitive powers. We must conclude then, that, in 
the state of innocence, children  would not have been born with perfect 
knowledge; but in course of time they would have acquired knowledge 
without difficulty by discovery or learning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The perfection of knowledge was an individual accident of 
our first parent, so far as he was established as the father and 
instructor of the whole human race. Therefore he begot children like 
himself, not in that respect, but only in those accidents which were 
natural or conferred gratuitously on the whole nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ignorance is privation of knowledge due at some particular 
time; and this would not have been in children from their birth, for they 
would have possessed the knowledge due to them at that time. Hence, no 
ignorance would have been in them, but only nescience in regard to 
certain matters. Such nescience was even in the holy angels, according to 
Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Children would have had sufficient knowledge to direct them 
to deeds of righteousness, in which men are guided by universal 
principles of right; and this knowledge of theirs would have been much 
more complete than what we have now by nature, as likewise their 
knowledge of other universal principles.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that children would have had perfect use of reason 
at birth. For that children have not perfect use of reason in our present 
state, is due to the soul being weighed down by the body; which was not 
the case in paradise, because, as it is written, "The corruptible body is 
a load upon the soul" (Wis. 9:15). Therefore, before sin and the 
corruption which resulted therefrom, children would have had the perfect 
use of reason at birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some animals at birth have the use of their natural 
powers, as the lamb at once flees from the wolf. Much more, therefore, 
would men in the state of innocence have had perfect use of reason at 
birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In all things produced by generation nature proceeds 
from the imperfect to the perfect. Therefore children would not have had 
the perfect use of reason from the very outset.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the use of reason depends 
in a certain manner on the use of the sensitive powers; wherefore, while 
the senses are tired and the interior sensitive powers hampered, man has 
not the perfect use of reason, as we see in those who are asleep or 
delirious. Now the sensitive powers are situate in corporeal organs; and 
therefore, so long as the latter are hindered, the action of the former 
is of necessity hindered also; and likewise, consequently, the use of 
reason. Now children are hindered in the use of these powers on account 
of the humidity  of the brain; wherefore they have perfect use neither of 
these powers nor of reason. Therefore, in the state of innocence, 
children would not have had the perfect use of reason, which they would 
have enjoyed later on in life. Yet they would have had a more perfect use 
than they have now, as to matters regarding that particular state, as 
explained above regarding the use of their limbs (<A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The corruptible body is a load upon the soul, because it 
hinders the use of reason even in those matters which belong to man at 
all ages.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[101] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even other animals have not at birth such a perfect use of 
their natural powers as they have later on. This is clear from the fact 
that birds teach their young to fly; and the like may be observed in 
other animals. Moreover a special impediment exists in man from the 
humidity of the brain, as we have said above (<A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
