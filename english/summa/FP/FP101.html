    OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS REGARDS KNOWLEDGE (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next consider the condition of the offspring as to knowledge. Under this
    head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP101.html#FPQ101A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in the state of innocence
    children would have been born with perfect knowledge?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP101.html#FPQ101A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they would have had
    perfect use of reason at the moment of birth?<br />

    Whether in the state of innocence children would have been born with perfect
    knowledge?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence
    children would have been born with perfect knowledge. For Adam would have
    begotten children like himself. But Adam was gifted with perfect knowledge
    (<a href="FP094.html#FPQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>,
    <a href="FP094.html#FPQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore children would
    have been born of him with perfect knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, ignorance is a result of sin, as Bede
    says (Cf. FS, Question [85], Article [3]). But ignorance is privation of
    knowledge. Therefore before sin children would have had perfect knowledge as
    soon as they were born.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, children would have been gifted with
    righteousness from birth. But knowledge is required for righteousness, since
    it directs our actions. Therefore they would also have been gifted with
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The human soul is naturally "like a blank
    tablet on which nothing is written," as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii,
    4). But the nature of the soul is the same now as it would have been in the
    state of innocence. Therefore the souls of children would have been without
    knowledge at birth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<a
      href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1"
      >Question [99]</a
    >, <a href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), as regards belief in
    matters which are above nature, we rely on authority alone; and so, when
    authority is wanting, we must be guided by the ordinary course of nature.
    Now it is natural for man to acquire knowledge through the senses, as above
    explained (<a href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>); and for this reason is
    the soul united to the body, that it needs it for its proper operation; and
    this would not be so if the soul were endowed at birth with knowledge not
    acquired through the sensitive powers. We must conclude then, that, in the
    state of innocence, children would not have been born with perfect
    knowledge; but in course of time they would have acquired knowledge without
    difficulty by discovery or learning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The perfection of knowledge was an
    individual accident of our first parent, so far as he was established as the
    father and instructor of the whole human race. Therefore he begot children
    like himself, not in that respect, but only in those accidents which were
    natural or conferred gratuitously on the whole nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ignorance is privation of knowledge due
    at some particular time; and this would not have been in children from their
    birth, for they would have possessed the knowledge due to them at that time.
    Hence, no ignorance would have been in them, but only nescience in regard to
    certain matters. Such nescience was even in the holy angels, according to
    Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Children would have had sufficient
    knowledge to direct them to deeds of righteousness, in which men are guided
    by universal principles of right; and this knowledge of theirs would have
    been much more complete than what we have now by nature, as likewise their
    knowledge of other universal principles.<br />

    Whether children would have had perfect use of reason at birth?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that children would have had
    perfect use of reason at birth. For that children have not perfect use of
    reason in our present state, is due to the soul being weighed down by the
    body; which was not the case in paradise, because, as it is written, "The
    corruptible body is a load upon the soul" (Wis. 9:15). Therefore, before sin
    and the corruption which resulted therefrom, children would have had the
    perfect use of reason at birth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some animals at birth have the use of
    their natural powers, as the lamb at once flees from the wolf. Much more,
    therefore, would men in the state of innocence have had perfect use of
    reason at birth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In all things produced by generation nature
    proceeds from the imperfect to the perfect. Therefore children would not
    have had the perfect use of reason from the very outset.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<a
      href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1"
      >Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the use of reason
    depends in a certain manner on the use of the sensitive powers; wherefore,
    while the senses are tired and the interior sensitive powers hampered, man
    has not the perfect use of reason, as we see in those who are asleep or
    delirious. Now the sensitive powers are situate in corporeal organs; and
    therefore, so long as the latter are hindered, the action of the former is
    of necessity hindered also; and likewise, consequently, the use of reason.
    Now children are hindered in the use of these powers on account of the
    humidity of the brain; wherefore they have perfect use neither of these
    powers nor of reason. Therefore, in the state of innocence, children would
    not have had the perfect use of reason, which they would have enjoyed later
    on in life. Yet they would have had a more perfect use than they have now,
    as to matters regarding that particular state, as explained above regarding
    the use of their limbs (<a href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>,
    <a href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The corruptible body is a load upon the
    soul, because it hinders the use of reason even in those matters which
    belong to man at all ages.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even other animals have not at birth
    such a perfect use of their natural powers as they have later on. This is
    clear from the fact that birds teach their young to fly; and the like may be
    observed in other animals. Moreover a special impediment exists in man from
    the humidity of the brain, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP099.html#FPQ99OUTP1"
      >Question [99]</a
    >, <a href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
