<H3 Align="Left">Whether the word "light" is used in its proper sense in speaking of spiritual things?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "light" is used in its proper sense in 
spiritual things. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 28) that "in 
spiritual things light is better and surer: and that Christ is not called 
Light in the same sense as He is called the Stone; the former is to be 
taken literally, and the latter metaphorically."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) includes Light among the 
intellectual names of God. But such names are used in their proper sense 
in spiritual things. Therefore light is used in its proper sense in 
spiritual matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5:13">Eph. 5:13</a>): "All that is made manifest 
is light." But to be made manifest belongs more properly to spiritual 
things than to corporeal. Therefore also does light.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Fide ii) that "Splendor" is among 
those things which are said of God metaphorically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Any word may be used in two ways---that is to say, either 
in its original application or in its more extended meaning. This is 
clearly shown in the word "sight," originally applied to the act of the 
sense, and then, as sight is the noblest and most trustworthy of the 
senses, extended in common speech to all knowledge obtained through the 
other senses. Thus we say, "Seeing how it tastes," or "smells," or 
"burns. "Further, sight is applied to knowledge obtained through the 
intellect, as in those words: "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they 
shall see God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5:8">Mt. 5:8</a>). And thus it is with the word light. In its 
primary meaning it signifies that which makes manifest to the sense of  
sight; afterwards it was extended to that which makes manifest to 
cognition of any kind. If, then, the word is taken in its strict and 
primary meaning, it is to be understood metaphorically when applied to 
spiritual things, as Ambrose says (De Fide ii). But if taken in its 
common and extended use, as applied to manifestation of every kind, it 
may properly be applied to spiritual things.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to the objections will sufficiently appear from what has been

<H3 Align="Left">Whether light is a body?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that light is a body. For Augustine says (De Lib. 
Arb. iii, 5) that "light takes the first place among bodies."Therefore 
light is a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Topic. v, 2) that "light is a 
species of fire." But fire is a body, and therefore so is light.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the powers of movement, intersection, reflection, belong 
properly to bodies; and all these are attributes of light and its rays. 
Moreover, different rays of light, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii) are 
united and separated, which seems impossible unless they are bodies. 
Therefore light is a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Two bodies cannot occupy the same place simultaneously. 
But this is the case with light and air. Therefore light is not a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Light cannot be a body, for three evident reasons. First, 
on the part of place. For the place of any one body is different from 
that of any other, nor is it possible, naturally speaking, for any two 
bodies of whatever nature, to exist simultaneously in the same place; 
since contiguity requires distinction of place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason is from movement. For if light were a body, its 
diffusion would be the local movement of a body. Now no local movement of 
a body can be instantaneous, as everything that moves from one place to 
another must pass through the intervening space before reaching the end: 
whereas the diffusion of light is instantaneous. Nor can it be argued 
that the time required is too short to be perceived; for though this may 
be the case in short distances, it cannot be so in distances so great as 
that which separates the East from the West. Yet as soon as the sun is at 
the horizon, the whole hemisphere is illuminated from end to end. It must 
also be borne in mind on the part of movement that whereas all bodies 
have their natural determinate movement, that of light is indifferent as 
regards direction, working equally in a circle as in a straight line. 
Hence it appears that the diffusion of light is not the local movement of 
a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Body Para. 3/4 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third reason is from generation and corruption. For if light were a 
body, it would follow that whenever the air is darkened by the absence of 
the luminary, the body of light would be corrupted, and its matter would 
receive a new form. But unless we are to say that darkness is a body, 
this does not appear to be the case. Neither does it appear from what 
matter a body can be daily generated large enough to fill the intervening 
hemisphere. Also it would be absurd to say that a body of so great a bulk 
is corrupted by the mere absence of the luminary. And should anyone reply 
that it is not corrupted, but approaches and moves around with the sun, 
we may ask why it is that when a lighted candle is obscured by the 
intervening object the whole room is darkened? It is not that the light 
is condensed round the candle when this is done, since it burns no more 
brightly then than it burned before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, therefore, these things are repugnant, not only to reason, but to 
common sense, we must conclude that light cannot be a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine takes light to be a luminous body in act---in 
other words, to be fire, the noblest of the four elements.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Aristotle pronounces light to be fire existing in its own 
proper matter: just as fire in aerial matter is "flame," or in earthly 
matter is "burning coal." Nor must too much attention be paid to the 
instances adduced by Aristotle in his works on logic, as he merely 
mentions them as the more or less probable opinions of various writers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All these properties are assigned to light metaphorically, 
and might in the same way be attributed to heat. For because movement 
from place to place is naturally first in the order of movement as is 
proved Phys. viii, text. 55, we use terms belonging to local movement in 
speaking of alteration and movement of all kinds. For even the word 
distance is derived from the idea of remoteness of place, to that of all 
contraries, as is said Metaph. x, text. 13.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether light is a quality?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that light is not a quality. For every quality 
remains in its subject, though the active cause of the quality be 
removed, as heat remains in water removed from the fire. But light does 
not remain in the air when the source of light is withdrawn. Therefore 
light is not a quality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sensible quality has its opposite, as cold is 
opposed to heat, blackness to whiteness. But this is not the case with 
light since darkness is merely a privation of light. Light therefore is 
not a sensible quality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a cause is more potent than its effect. But the light of 
the heavenly bodies is a cause of substantial forms of  earthly bodies, 
and also gives to colors their immaterial being, by making them actually 
visible. Light, then, is not a sensible quality, but rather a substantial 
or spiritual form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene (De Fide Orth. i) says that light is a 
species of quality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some writers have said that the light in the air has not 
a natural being such as the color on a wall has, but only an intentional 
being, as a similitude of color in the air. But this cannot be the case 
for two reasons. First, because light gives a name to the air, since by 
it the air becomes actually luminous. But color does not do this, for we 
do not speak of the air as colored. Secondly, because light produces 
natural effects, for by the rays of the sun bodies are warmed, and 
natural changes cannot be brought about by mere intentions. Others have 
said that light is the sun's substantial form, but this also seems 
impossible for two reasons. First, because substantial forms are not of 
themselves objects of the senses; for the object of the intellect is what 
a thing is, as is said De Anima iii, text. 26: whereas light is visible 
of itself. In the second place, because it is impossible that what is the 
substantial form of one thing should be the accidental form of another; 
since substantial forms of their very nature constitute species: 
wherefore the substantial form always and everywhere accompanies the 
species. But light is not the substantial form of air, for if it were, 
the air would be destroyed when light is withdrawn. Hence it cannot be 
the substantial form of the sun.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must say, then, that as heat is an active quality consequent on the 
substantial form of fire, so light is an active quality consequent on the 
substantial form of the sun, or of another body that is of itself 
luminous, if there is any such body. A proof of this is that the rays of 
different stars produce different effects according to the diverse 
natures of bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since quality is consequent upon substantial form, the mode 
in which the subject receives a quality differs as the mode differs in 
which a subject receives a substantial form. For when matter receives its 
form perfectly, the qualities consequent upon the form are firm and 
enduring; as when, for instance, water is converted into fire. When, 
however, substantial form is received imperfectly, so as to be, as it 
were, in process of being received, rather than fully impressed, the 
consequent quality lasts for a time but is not permanent; as may be seen 
when water which has been heated returns in time to its natural state. 
But light is not produced by the transmutation of matter, as though 
matter were in receipt of a substantial form, and light were a certain 
inception of substantial form. For this reason light disappears on the 
disappearance of its active cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is accidental to light not to have a contrary, forasmuch 
as it is the natural quality of the first corporeal cause of change, 
which is itself removed from contrariety. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As heat acts towards perfecting the form of fire, as an 
instrumental cause, by virtue of the substantial form, so does light act 
instrumentally, by virtue of the heavenly bodies, towards producing 
substantial forms; and towards rendering colors actually visible, 
inasmuch as it is a quality of the first sensible body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the production of light is fittingly assigned to the first day?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the production of light is not fittingly 
assigned to the first day. For light, as stated above (<A Href="FP067.html#FPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), is a 
quality. But qualities are accidents, and as such should have, not the 
first, but a subordinate place. The production of light, then, ought not 
to be assigned to the first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is light that distinguishes night from day, and this 
is effected by the sun, which is recorded as having been made on the 
fourth day. Therefore the production of light could not have been on the 
first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, night and day are brought about by the circular movement 
of a luminous body. But movement of this kind is an attribute of the 
firmament, and we read that the firmament was made on the second day. 
Therefore the production of light, dividing night from day, ought not to 
be assigned to the first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if it be said that spiritual light is here spoken of, it 
may be replied that the light made on the first day dispels the darkness. 
But in the beginning spiritual darkness was not, for even the demons were 
in the beginning good, as has been shown (<A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore the 
production of light ought not to be assigned to the first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That without which there could not be day, must have 
been made on the first day. But there can be no day without light. 
Therefore light must have been made on the first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two opinions as to the production of light. 
Augustine seems to say (De Civ. Dei xi, 9,33) that Moses could not have 
fittingly passed over the production of the spiritual creature, and 
therefore when we read, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth," 
a spiritual nature as yet formless is to be understood by the word 
"heaven," and formless matter of the corporeal creature by the word 
"earth." And spiritual nature was formed first, as being of higher 
dignity than corporeal. The forming, therefore, of this spiritual nature 
is signified by the production of light, that is to say, of spiritual 
light. For a spiritual nature receives its form by the enlightenment 
whereby it is led to adhere to the Word of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 2/5 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other writers think that the production of spiritual creatures was 
purposely omitted by Moses, and give various reasons. Basil [*Hom. i in 
Hexaem.] says that Moses begins his narrative from the beginning of time 
which belongs to sensible things; but that the spiritual or angelic 
creation is passed over, as created beforehand.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chrysostom [*Hom. ii in Genes.] gives as a reason for the omission that 
Moses was addressing an ignorant people, to whom material things alone 
appealed, and whom he was endeavoring to withdraw from the service of 
idols. It would have been to them a pretext for idolatry if he had spoken 
to them of natures spiritual in substance and nobler than all corporeal 
creatures; for they would have paid them Divine worship, since they were 
prone to worship as gods even the sun, moon, and stars, which was 
forbidden them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++4">Dt. 4</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But mention is made of several kinds of formlessness, in regard to the 
corporeal creature. One is where we read that "the earth was void and 
empty," and another where it is said that "darkness was upon the face of 
the deep." Now it seems to be required, for two reasons, that the 
formlessness of darkness should be removed first of all by the production 
of light. In the first place because light is a quality of the first 
body, as was stated (<A Href="FP067.html#FPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), and thus by means of light it was fitting 
that the world should first receive its form. The second reason is 
because light is a common quality. For light is common to terrestrial and 
celestial bodies. But as in knowledge we proceed from general principles, 
so do we in work of every kind. For the living thing is generated before 
the animal, and the animal before the man, as is shown in De Gener. Anim. 
ii, 3. It was fitting, then, as an evidence of the Divine wisdom, that 
among the works of distinction the production of light should take first 
place, since light is a form of the primary body, and because it is more 
common quality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Basil [*Hom. ii in Hexaem.], indeed, adds a third reason: that all other 
things are made manifest by light. And there is yet a fourth, already 
touched upon in the objections; that day cannot be unless light exists, 
which was made therefore on the first day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the opinion of those who hold that the 
formlessness of matter preceded its form in duration, matter must be held 
to have been created at the beginning with substantial forms, afterwards 
receiving those that are accidental, among which light holds the first 
place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the opinion of some the light here spoken of was a kind 
of luminous nebula, and that on the making of the sun this returned to 
the matter of which it had been formed. But this cannot well be 
maintained, as in the beginning of Genesis Holy Scripture records the 
institution of that order of nature which henceforth is to endure. We 
cannot, then, say that what was made at that time afterwards ceased to 
exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[67] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others, therefore, held that this luminous nebula continues in 
existence, but so closely attached to the sun as to be indistinguishable. 
But this is as much as to say that it is superfluous, whereas none of 
God's works have been made in vain. On this account it is held by some 
that the sun's body was made out of this nebula. This, too, is impossible 
to those at least who believe that the sun is different in its nature 
from the four elements, and naturally incorruptible. For in that case its 
matter cannot take on another form.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I answer, then, with Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv), that the light was the 
sun's light, formless as yet, being already the solar substance, and 
possessing illuminative power in a general way, to which was afterwards 
added the special and determinative power required to produce determinate 
effects. Thus, then, in the production of this light a triple distinction 
was made between light and darkness. First, as to the cause, forasmuch as 
in the substance of the sun we have the cause of light, and in the opaque 
nature of the earth the cause of darkness. Secondly, as to place, for in 
one hemisphere there was light, in the other darkness. Thirdly, as to 
time; because there was light for one and darkness for another in the 
same hemisphere; and this is signified by the words, "He called the light 
day, and the darkness night."<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) that day and night were 
then caused by expansion and contraction of light, rather than by 
movement. But Augustine objects to this (Gen. ad lit. i), that there was 
no reason for this vicissitude of expansion and contraction since there 
were neither men nor animals on the earth at that time, for whose service 
this was required. Nor does the nature of a luminous body seem to admit 
of the withdrawal of light, so long as the body is actually present; 
though this might be effected by a miracle. As to this, however, 
Augustine remarks (Gen. ad lit. i) that in the first founding of the 
order of nature we must not look for miracles, but for what is in 
accordance with nature. We hold, then, that the movement of the heavens 
is twofold. Of these movements, one is common to the entire heaven, and 
is the cause of day and night. This, as it seems, had its beginning on 
the first day. The other varies in proportion as it affects various 
bodies, and by its variations is the cause of the succession of days, 
months, and years. Thus it is, that in the account of the first day the 
distinction between day and night alone is mentioned; this distinction 
being brought about by the common movement of the heavens. The further 
distinction into successive days, seasons, and years recorded as begun on 
the fourth day, in the words, "let them be for seasons, and for days, and 
years" is due to proper movements.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine teaches (Confess. xii; Gen. ad lit. 1,15), 
formlessness did not precede forms in duration; and so we must understand 
the production of light to signify the formation of spiritual creatures, 
not, indeed, with the perfection of glory, in which they were not 
created, but with the perfection of grace, which they possessed from 
their creation as said above (<A Href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FP062.html#FPQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).  Thus the division of light 
from darkness will denote the distinction of the spiritual creature from 
other created things as yet without form. But if all created things 
received their form at the same time, the darkness must be held to mean 
the spiritual darkness of the wicked, not as existing from the beginning 
but such as God foresaw would exist.<br>
