<H3 Align="Center">ON THE WORK OF THE SIXTH DAY (ONE ARTICLE)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the work of the sixth day.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this work is not fittingly described. For as 
birds and fishes have a living soul, so also have land animals. But these 
animals are not themselves living souls.  Therefore the words, "Let the 
earth bring forth the living creature," should rather have been, "Let the 
earth bring forth the living four-footed creatures."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a genus ought not to be opposed to its species. But 
beasts and cattle are quadrupeds. Therefore quadrupeds ought not to be 
enumerated as a class with beasts and cattle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as animals belong to a determinate genus and species, so 
also does man. But in the making of man nothing is said of his genus and 
species, and therefore nothing ought to have been said about them in the 
production of other animals, whereas it is said "according to its genus" 
and "in its species."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, land animals are more like man, whom God is recorded to 
have blessed, than are birds and fishes. But as birds and fishes are said 
to be blessed, this should have been said, with much more reason, of the 
other animals as well.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, certain animals are generated from putrefaction, which 
is a kind of corruption. But corruption is repugnant to the first 
founding of the world. Therefore such animals should not have been 
produced at that time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, certain animals are poisonous, and injurious to man. But 
there ought to have been nothing injurious to man before man sinned. 
Therefore such animals ought not to have been made by God at all, since 
He is the Author of good; or at least not until man had sinned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Suffices the authority of Scripture.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As on the fifth day the intermediate body, namely, the 
water, is adorned, and thus that day corresponds to the second day; so 
the sixth day, on which the lowest body, or the earth, is adorned by the 
production of land animals, corresponds to the third day. Hence the earth 
is mentioned in both places. And here again Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. 
v) that the production was potential, and other holy writers that it was 
actual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The different grades of life which are found in different 
living creatures can be discovered from the various ways in which 
Scripture speaks of them, as Basil says (Hom. viii in Hexaem.). The life 
of plants, for instance, is very imperfect and difficult to discern, and 
hence, in speaking of their production, nothing is said of their life, 
but only their generation is mentioned, since only in generation is a 
vital act observed in them. For the powers of nutrition and growth are 
subordinate to the generative life, as will be shown later on (<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78OUTP1">Question [78]</a>, <A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But amongst animals, those that live on land are, generally 
speaking, more perfect than birds and fishes, not because the fish is 
devoid of memory, as Basil upholds (Hom. viii in Hexaem.) and Augustine 
rejects (Gen. ad lit. iii), but because their limbs are more distinct and 
their generation of a higher order, (yet some  imperfect animals, such as 
bees and ants, are more intelligent in certain ways). Scripture, 
therefore, does not call fishes "living creatures," but "creeping 
creatures having life"; whereas it does call land animals "living 
creatures" on account of their more perfect life, and seems to imply that 
fishes are merely bodies having in them something of a soul, whilst land 
animals, from the higher perfection of their life, are, as it were, 
living souls with bodies subject to them. But the life of man, as being 
the most perfect grade, is not said to be produced, like the life of 
other animals, by earth or water, but immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By "cattle," domestic animals are signified, which in any 
way are of service to man: but by "beasts," wild animals such as bears 
and lions are designated. By "creeping things" those animals are meant 
which either have no feet and cannot rise from the earth, as serpents, or 
those whose feet are too short to life them far from the ground, as the 
lizard and tortoise. But since certain animals, as deer and goats, seem 
to fall under none of these classes, the word "quadrupeds" is added. Or 
perhaps the word "quadruped" is used first as being the genus, to which 
the others are added as species, for even some reptiles, such as lizards 
and tortoises, are four-footed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In other animals, and in plants, mention is made of genus 
and species, to denote the generation of like from like. But it was 
unnecessary to do so in the case of man, as what had already been said of 
other creatures might be understood of him. Again, animals and plants may 
be said to be produced according to their kinds, to signify their 
remoteness from the Divine image and likeness, whereas man is said to be 
made "to the image and likeness of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The blessing of God gives power to multiply by generation, 
and, having been mentioned in the preceding account of the making of 
birds and fishes, could be understood of the beasts of the earth, without 
requiring to be repeated. The blessing, however, is repeated in the case 
of man, since in him generation of children has a special relation to the 
number of the elect [*Cf. Augustine, Gen. ad lit. iii, 12], and to 
prevent anyone from saying that there was any sin whatever in the act of 
begetting children. As to plants, since they experience neither desire of 
propagation, nor sensation in generating, they are deemed unworthy of a 
formal blessing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of 
another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that 
from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be 
generated. Hence animals generated from the corruption of inanimate 
things, or of plants, may have been generated then. But those generated 
from corruption of animals could not have been produced then otherwise 
than potentially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[72] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> In the words of Augustine (Super. Gen. contr. Manich. i): 
"If an unskilled person enters the workshop of an  artificer he sees in 
it many appliances of which he does not understand the use, and which, if 
he is a foolish fellow, he considers unnecessary. Moreover, should he 
carelessly fall into the fire, or wound himself with a sharp-edged tool, 
he is under the impression that many of the things there are hurtful; 
whereas the craftsman, knowing their use, laughs at his folly. And thus 
some people presume to find fault with many things in this world, through 
not seeing the reasons for their existence. For though not required for 
the furnishing of our house, these things are necessary for the 
perfection of the universe." And, since man before he sinned would have 
used the things of this world conformably to the order designed, 
poisonous animals would not have injured him.<br>
