  <h3 align="center">OF GOD'S KNOWLEDGE (SIXTEEN ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Having considered what belongs to the divine substance, we have now to treat
    of God's operation. And since one kind of operation is immanent, and another
    kind of operation proceeds to the exterior effect, we treat first of
    knowledge and of will (for understanding abides in the intelligent agent,
    and will is in the one who wills); and afterwards of the power of God, the
    principle of the divine operation as proceeding to the exterior effect. Now
    because to understand is a kind of life, after treating of the divine
    knowledge, we consider truth and falsehood. Further, as everything known is
    in the knower, and the types of things as existing in the knowledge of God
    are called ideas, to the consideration of knowledge will be added the
    treatment of ideas.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning knowledge, there are sixteen points for inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is knowledge in God?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether God understands Himself?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He comprehends Himself?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether His understanding is His
    substance?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether He understands other
    things besides Himself?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether He has a proper knowledge
    of them?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the knowledge of God is
    discursive?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the knowledge of God is
    the cause of things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether God has knowledge of
    non-existing things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether He has knowledge of
    evil?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether He has knowledge of
    individual things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A12THEP1">(12)</a> Whether He knows the infinite?
  </p>
  <p>

    things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A15THEP1">(15)</a> Whether the knowledge of God is
    variable?
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is knowledge [*Scientia]?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that in God there is not knowledge. For
    knowledge is a habit; and habit does not belong to God, since it is the mean
    between potentiality and act. Therefore knowledge is not in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since science is about conclusions, it
    is a kind of knowledge caused by something else which is the knowledge of
    principles. But nothing is caused in God; therefore science is not in
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all knowledge is universal, or
    particular. But in God there is no universal or particular (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore in God there
    is not knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says, "O the depth of the riches
    of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++11%3A33"
      >Rm. 11:33</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In God there exists the most perfect knowledge.
    To prove this, we must note that intelligent beings are distinguished from
    non-intelligent beings in that the latter possess only their own form;
    whereas the intelligent being is naturally adapted to have also the form of
    some other thing; for the idea of the thing known is in the knower. Hence it
    is manifest that the nature of a non-intelligent being is more contracted
    and limited; whereas the nature of intelligent beings has a greater
    amplitude and extension; therefore the Philosopher says (De Anima iii) that
    "the soul is in a sense all things." Now the contraction of the form comes
    from the matter. Hence, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) forms according as they
    are the more immaterial, approach more nearly to a kind of infinity.
    Therefore it is clear that the immateriality of a thing is the reason why it
    is cognitive; and according to the mode of immateriality is the mode of
    knowledge. Hence it is said in De Anima ii that plants do not know, because
    they are wholly material. But sense is cognitive because it can receive
    images free from matter, and the intellect is still further cognitive,
    because it is more separated from matter and unmixed, as said in De Anima
    iii. Since therefore God is in the highest degree of immateriality as stated
    above (<a href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>,
    <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it follows that He
    occupies the highest place in knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Because perfections flowing from God to
    creatures exist in a higher state in God Himself (<a
      href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1"
      >Question [4]</a
    >, <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), whenever a name taken
    from any created perfection is attributed to God, it must be separated in
    its signification from anything that belongs to that imperfect mode proper
    to creatures. Hence knowledge is not a quality of God, nor a habit; but
    substance and pure act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Whatever is divided and multiplied in
    creatures exists in God simply and unitedly (<a href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="FP013.html#FPQ13A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now man has different
    kinds of knowledge, according to the different objects of His knowledge. He
    has "intelligence" as regards the knowledge of principles; he has "science"
    as regards knowledge of conclusions; he has "wisdom," according as he knows
    the highest cause; he has "counsel" or "prudence," according as he knows
    what is to be done. But God knows all these by one simple act of knowledge,
    as will be shown (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Hence
    the simple knowledge of God can be named by all these names; in such a way,
    however, that there must be removed from each of them, so far as they enter
    into divine predication, everything that savors of imperfection; and
    everything that expresses perfection is to be retained in them. Hence it is
    said, "With Him is wisdom and strength, He hath counsel and understanding"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+12%3A13">Job 12:13</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Knowledge is according to the mode of
    the one who knows; for the thing known is in the knower according to the
    mode of the knower. Now since the mode of the divine essence is higher than
    that of creatures, divine knowledge does not exist in God after the mode of
    created knowledge, so as to be universal or particular, or habitual, or
    potential, or existing according to any such mode.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God understands Himself?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not understand Himself.
    For it is said by the Philosopher (De Causis), "Every knower who knows his
    own essence, returns completely to his own essence." But God does not go out
    from His own essence, nor is He moved at all; thus He cannot return to His
    own essence. Therefore He does not know His own essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to understand is a kind of passion and
    movement, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii); and knowledge also is a
    kind of assimilation to the object known; and the thing known is the
    perfection of the knower. But nothing is moved, or suffers, or is made
    perfect by itself, "nor," as Hilary says (De Trin. iii), "is a thing its own
    likeness." Therefore God does not understand Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we are like to God chiefly in our
    intellect, because we are the image of God in our mind, as Augustine says
    (Gen. ad lit. vi). But our intellect understands itself, only as it
    understands other things, as is said in De Anima iii. Therefore God
    understands Himself only so far perchance as He understands other things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "The things that are of God no
    man knoweth, but the Spirit of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A11"
      >1 Cor. 2:11</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God understands Himself through Himself. In
    proof whereof it must be known that although in operations which pass to an
    external effect, the object of the operation, which is taken as the term,
    exists outside the operator; nevertheless in operations that remain in the
    operator, the object signified as the term of operation, resides in the
    operator; and accordingly as it is in the operator, the operation is actual.
    Hence the Philosopher says (De Anima iii) that "the sensible in act is sense
    in act, and the intelligible in act is intellect in act." For the reason why
    we actually feel or know a thing is because our intellect or sense is
    actually informed by the sensible or intelligible species. And because of
    this only, it follows that sense or intellect is distinct from the sensible
    or intelligible object, since both are in potentiality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since therefore God has nothing in Him of potentiality, but is pure act, His
    intellect and its object are altogether the same; so that He neither is
    without the intelligible species, as is the case with our intellect when it
    understands potentially; nor does the intelligible species differ from the
    substance of the divine intellect, as it differs in our intellect when it
    understands actually; but the intelligible species itself is the divine
    intellect itself, and thus God understands Himself through Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Return to its own essence means only
    that a thing subsists in itself. Inasmuch as the form perfects the matter by
    giving it existence, it is in a certain way diffused in it; and it returns
    to itself inasmuch as it has existence in itself. Therefore those cognitive
    faculties which are not subsisting, but are the acts of organs, do not know
    themselves, as in the case of each of the senses; whereas those cognitive
    faculties which are subsisting, know themselves; hence it is said in De
    Causis that, "whoever knows his essence returns to it." Now it supremely
    belongs to God to be self-subsisting. Hence according to this mode of
    speaking, He supremely returns to His own essence, and knows Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Movement and passion are taken
    equivocally, according as to understand is described as a kind of movement
    or passion, as stated in De Anima iii. For to understand is not a movement
    that is an act of something imperfect passing from one to another, but it is
    an act, existing in the agent itself, of something perfect. Likewise that
    the intellect is perfected by the intelligible object, i.e. is assimilated
    to it, this belongs to an intellect which is sometimes in potentiality;
    because the fact of its being in a state of potentiality makes it differ
    from the intelligible object and assimilates it thereto through the
    intelligible species, which is the likeness of the thing understood, and
    makes it to be perfected thereby, as potentiality is perfected by act. On
    the other hand, the divine intellect, which is no way in potentiality, is
    not perfected by the intelligible object, nor is it assimilated thereto, but
    is its own perfection, and its own intelligible object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Existence in nature does not belong to
    primary matter, which is a potentiality, unless it is reduced to act by a
    form. Now our passive intellect has the same relation to intelligible
    objects as primary matter has to natural things; for it is in potentiality
    as regards intelligible objects, just as primary matter is to natural
    things. Hence our passive intellect can be exercised concerning intelligible
    objects only so far as it is perfected by the intelligible species of
    something; and in that way it understands itself by an intelligible species,
    as it understands other things: for it is manifest that by knowing the
    intelligible object it understands also its own act of understanding, and by
    this act knows the intellectual faculty. But God is a pure act in the order
    of existence, as also in the order of intelligible objects; therefore He
    understands Himself through Himself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God comprehends Himself?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not comprehend Himself.
    For Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. xv), that "whatever comprehends
    itself is finite as regards itself." But God is in all ways infinite.
    Therefore He does not comprehend Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> If it is said that God is infinite to us, and
    finite to Himself, it can be urged to the contrary, that everything in God
    is truer than it is in us. If therefore God is finite to Himself, but
    infinite to us, then God is more truly finite than infinite; which is
    against what was laid down above (<a href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore God does not
    comprehend Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. xv), that
    "Everything that understands itself, comprehends itself." But God
    understands Himself. Therefore He comprehends Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God perfectly comprehends Himself, as can be
    thus proved. A thing is said to be comprehended when the end of the
    knowledge of it is attained, and this is accomplished when it is known as
    perfectly as it is knowable; as, for instance, a demonstrable proposition is
    comprehended when known by demonstration, not, however, when it is known by
    some probable reason. Now it is manifest that God knows Himself as perfectly
    as He is perfectly knowable. For everything is knowable according to the
    mode of its own actuality; since a thing is not known according as it is in
    potentiality, but in so far as it is in actuality, as said in Metaph. ix.
    Now the power of God in knowing is as great as His actuality in existing;
    because it is from the fact that He is in act and free from all matter and
    potentiality, that God is cognitive, as shown above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2). Whence it is manifest that He knows Himself as much as He is knowable;
    and for that reason He perfectly comprehends Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The strict meaning of "comprehension"
    signifies that one thing holds and includes another; and in this sense
    everything comprehended is finite, as also is everything included in
    another. But God is not said to be comprehended by Himself in this sense, as
    if His intellect were a faculty apart from Himself, and as if it held and
    included Himself; for these modes of speaking are to be taken by way of
    negation. But as God is said to be in Himself, forasmuch as He is not
    contained by anything outside of Himself; so He is said to be comprehended
    by Himself, forasmuch as nothing in Himself is hidden from Himself. For
    Augustine says (De Vid. Deum. ep. cxii), "The whole is comprehended when
    seen, if it is seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the
    seer."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When it is said, "God is finite to
    Himself," this is to be understood according to a certain similitude of
    proportion, because He has the same relation in not exceeding His intellect,
    as anything finite has in not exceeding finite intellect. But God is not to
    be called finite to Himself in this sense, as if He understood Himself to be
    something finite.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the act of God's intellect is His substance?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the act of God's intellect is not
    His substance. For to understand is an operation. But an operation signifies
    something proceeding from the operator. Therefore the act of God's intellect
    is not His substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to understand one's act of
    understanding, is to understand something that is neither great nor chiefly
    understood, and but secondary and accessory. If therefore God be his own act
    of understanding, His act of understanding will be as when we understand our
    act of understanding: and thus God's act of understanding will not be
    something great.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every act of understanding means
    understanding something. When therefore God understands Himself, if He
    Himself is not distinct from this act of understanding, He understands that
    He understands Himself; and so on to infinity. Therefore the act of God's
    intellect is not His substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vii), "In God to be
    is the same as to be wise." But to be wise is the same thing as to
    understand. Therefore in God to be is the same thing as to understand. But
    God's existence is His substance, as shown above (<a

      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore the act of
    God's intellect is His substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It must be said that the act of God's intellect
    is His substance. For if His act of understanding were other than His
    substance, then something else, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. xii), would
    be the act and perfection of the divine substance, to which the divine
    substance would be related, as potentiality is to act, which is altogether
    impossible; because the act of understanding is the perfection and act of
    the one understanding. Let us now consider how this is. As was laid down
    above (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), to understand is
    not an act passing to anything extrinsic; for it remains in the operator as
    his own act and perfection; as existence is the perfection of the one
    existing: just as existence follows on the form, so in like manner to
    understand follows on the intelligible species. Now in God there is no form
    which is something other than His existence, as shown above (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >). Hence as His essence itself is also His intelligible species, it
    necessarily follows that His act of understanding must be His essence and
    His existence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus it follows from all the foregoing that in God, intellect, and the
    object understood, and the intelligible species, and His act of
    understanding are entirely one and the same. Hence when God is said to be
    understanding, no kind of multiplicity is attached to His substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To understand is not an operation
    proceeding out of the operator, but remaining in him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When that act of understanding which is
    not subsistent is understood, something not great is understood; as when we
    understand our act of understanding; and so this cannot be likened to the
    act of the divine understanding which is subsistent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus appears the Reply to the Third Objection. For the act of divine
    understanding subsists in itself, and belongs to its very self and is not
    another's; hence it need not proceed to infinity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God knows things other than Himself?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not know things besides
    Himself. For all other things but God are outside of God. But Augustine says
    (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi) that "God does not behold anything out of
    Himself." Therefore He does not know things other than Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object understood is the perfection
    of the one who understands. If therefore God understands other things
    besides Himself, something else will be the perfection of God, and will be
    nobler than He; which is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the act of understanding is specified by
    the intelligible object, as is every other act from its own object. Hence
    the intellectual act is so much the nobler, the nobler the object
    understood. But God is His own intellectual act. If therefore God
    understands anything other than Himself, then God Himself is specified by
    something else than Himself; which cannot be. Therefore He does not
    understand things other than Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "All things are naked and open
    to His eyes" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++4%3A13"
      >Heb. 4:13</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God necessarily knows things other than
    Himself. For it is manifest that He perfectly understands Himself; otherwise
    His existence would not be perfect, since His existence is His act of
    understanding. Now if anything is perfectly known, it follows of necessity
    that its power is perfectly known. But the power of anything can be
    perfectly known only by knowing to what its power extends. Since therefore
    the divine power extends to other things by the very fact that it is the
    first effective cause of all things, as is clear from the aforesaid (<a
      href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), God must necessarily
    know things other than Himself. And this appears still more plainly if we
    add that the every existence of the first effective cause---viz. God---is
    His own act of understanding. Hence whatever effects pre-exist in God, as in
    the first cause, must be in His act of understanding, and all things must be
    in Him according to an intelligible mode: for everything which is in
    another, is in it according to the mode of that in which it is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in order to know how God knows things other than Himself, we must
    consider that a thing is known in two ways: in itself, and in another. A
    thing is known in itself when it is known by the proper species adequate to
    the knowable object; as when the eye sees a man through the image of a man.
    A thing is seen in another through the image of that which contains it; as
    when a part is seen in the whole by the image of the whole; or when a man is
    seen in a mirror by the image in the mirror, or by any other mode by which
    one thing is seen in another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    So we say that God sees Himself in Himself, because He sees Himself through
    His essence; and He sees other things not in themselves, but in Himself;
    inasmuch as His essence contains the similitude of things other than
    Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage of Augustine in which it is
    said that God "sees nothing outside Himself" is not to be taken in such a
    way, as if God saw nothing outside Himself, but in the sense that what is
    outside Himself He does not see except in Himself, as above explained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The object understood is a perfection of
    the one understanding not by its substance, but by its image, according to
    which it is in the intellect, as its form and perfection, as is said in De
    Anima iii. For "a stone is not in the soul, but its image." Now those things
    which are other than God are understood by God, inasmuch as the essence of
    God contains their images as above explained; hence it does not follow that
    there is any perfection in the divine intellect other than the divine
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellectual act is not specified by
    what is understood in another, but by the principal object understood in
    which other things are understood. For the intellectual act is specified by
    its object, inasmuch as the intelligible form is the principle of the
    intellectual operation: since every operation is specified by the form which
    is its principle of operation; as heating by heat. Hence the intellectual
    operation is specified by that intelligible form which makes the intellect
    in act. And this is the image of the principal thing understood, which in
    God is nothing but His own essence in which all images of things are
    comprehended. Hence it does not follow that the divine intellectual act, or
    rather God Himself, is specified by anything else than the divine essence
    itself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether God knows things other than Himself by proper knowledge?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not know things other than
    Himself by proper knowledge. For, as was shown (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), God knows things other than Himself, according as they are in Himself.
    But other things are in Him as in their common and universal cause, and are
    known by God as in their first and universal cause. This is to know them by
    general, and not by proper knowledge. Therefore God knows things besides
    Himself by general, and not by proper knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the created essence is as distant from
    the divine essence, as the divine essence is distant from the created
    essence. But the divine essence cannot be known by the created essence, as
    said above (<a href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a> /
    <a href="FP012.html#FPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore neither can
    the created essence be known by the divine essence. Thus as God knows only
    by His essence, it follows that He does not know what the creature is in its
    essence, so as to know "what it is," which is to have proper knowledge of
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, proper knowledge of a thing can come
    only through its proper ratio. But as God knows all things by His essence,
    it seems that He does not know each thing by its proper ratio; for one thing
    cannot be the proper ratio of many and diverse things. Therefore God has not
    a proper knowledge of things, but a general knowledge; for to know things
    otherwise than by their proper ratio is to have only a common and general
    knowledge of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> To have a proper knowledge of things is to
    know them not only in general, but as they are distinct from each other. Now
    God knows things in that manner. Hence it is written that He reaches "even
    to the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the
    marrow, and is a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart; neither is
    there any creature invisible in His sight" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++4%3A12,13"
      >Heb. 4:12,13</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have erred on this point, saying that God
    knows things other than Himself only in general, that is, only as beings.
    For as fire, if it knew the nature of heat, and all things else in so far as
    they are hot; so God, through knowing Himself as the principle of being,
    knows the nature of being, and all other things in so far as they are
    beings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this cannot be. For to know a thing in general and not in particular, is
    to have an imperfect knowledge. Hence our intellect, when it is reduced from
    potentiality to act, acquires first a universal and confused knowledge of
    things, before it knows them in particular; as proceeding from the imperfect
    to the perfect, as is clear from Phys. i. If therefore the knowledge of God
    regarding things other than Himself is only universal and not special, it
    would follow that His understanding would not be absolutely perfect;
    therefore neither would His being be perfect; and this is against what was
    said above (<a href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). We must therefore hold
    that God knows things other than Himself with a proper knowledge; not only
    in so far as being is common to them, but in so far as one is distinguished
    from the other. In proof thereof we may observe that some wishing to show
    that God knows many things by one, bring forward some examples, as, for
    instance, that if the centre knew itself, it would know all lines that
    proceed from the centre; or if light knew itself, it would know all
    colors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now these examples although they are similar in part, namely, as regards
    universal causality, nevertheless they fail in this respect, that multitude
    and diversity are caused by the one universal principle, not as regards that
    which is the principle of distinction, but only as regards that in which
    they communicate. For the diversity of colors is not caused by the light
    only, but by the different disposition of the diaphanous medium which
    receives it; and likewise, the diversity of the lines is caused by their
    different position. Hence it is that this kind of diversity and multitude
    cannot be known in its principle by proper knowledge, but only in a general
    way. In God, however, it is otherwise. For it was shown above (<a
      href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1"
      >Question [4]</a
    >, <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that whatever
    perfection exists in any creature, wholly pre-exists and is contained in God
    in an excelling manner. Now not only what is common to creatures--viz.
    being---belongs to their perfection, but also what makes them distinguished
    from each other; as living and understanding, and the like, whereby living
    beings are distinguished from the non-living, and the intelligent from the
    non-intelligent. Likewise every form whereby each thing is constituted in
    its own species, is a perfection; and thus all things pre-exist in God, not
    only as regards what is common to all, but also as regards what
    distinguishes one thing from another. And therefore as God contains all
    perfections in Himself, the essence of God is compared to all other essences
    of things, not as the common to the proper, as unity is to numbers, or as
    the centre (of a circle) to the (radiating) lines; but as perfect acts to
    imperfect; as if I were to compare man to animal; or six, a perfect number,
    to the imperfect numbers contained under it. Now it is manifest that by a
    perfect act imperfect acts can be known not only in general, but also by
    proper knowledge; thus, for example, whoever knows a man, knows an animal by
    proper knowledge; and whoever knows the number six, knows the number three
    also by proper knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As therefore the essence of God contains in itself all the perfection
    contained in the essence of any other being, and far more, God can know in
    Himself all of them with proper knowledge. For the nature proper to each
    thing consists in some degree of participation in the divine perfection. Now
    God could not be said to know Himself perfectly unless He knew all the ways
    in which His own perfection can be shared by others. Neither could He know
    the very nature of being perfectly, unless He knew all modes of being. Hence
    it is manifest that God knows all things with proper knowledge, in their
    distinction from each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> So to know a thing as it is in the
    knower, may be understood in two ways. In one way this adverb "so" imports
    the mode of knowledge on the part of the thing known; and in that sense it
    is false. For the knower does not always know the object known according to
    the existence it has in the knower; since the eye does not know a stone
    according to the existence it has in the eye; but by the image of the stone
    which is in the eye, the eye knows the stone according to its existence
    outside the eye. And if any knower has a knowledge of the object known
    according to the (mode of) existence it has in the knower, the knower
    nevertheless knows it according to its (mode of) existence outside the
    knower; thus the intellect knows a stone according to the intelligible
    existence it has in the intellect, inasmuch as it knows that it understands;
    while nevertheless it knows what a stone is in its own nature. If however
    the adverb 'so' be understood to import the mode (of knowledge) on the part
    of the knower, in that sense it is true that only the knower has knowledge
    of the object known as it is in the knower; for the more perfectly the thing
    known is in the knower, the more perfect is the mode of knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must say therefore that God not only knows that all things are in
    Himself; but by the fact that they are in Him, He knows them in their own
    nature and all the more perfectly, the more perfectly each one is in Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The created essence is compared to the
    essence of God as the imperfect to the perfect act. Therefore the created
    essence cannot sufficiently lead us to the knowledge of the divine essence,
    but rather the converse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same thing cannot be taken in an
    equal manner as the ratio of different things. But the divine essence excels
    all creatures. Hence it can be taken as the proper ration of each thing
    according to the diverse ways in which diverse creatures participate in, and
    imitate it.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the knowledge of God is discursive?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the knowledge of God is discursive.
    For the knowledge of God is not habitual knowledge, but actual knowledge.
    Now the Philosopher says (Topic. ii): "The habit of knowledge may regard
    many things at once; but actual understanding regards only one thing at a
    time." Therefore as God knows many things, Himself and others, as shown
    above (Articles 2,5), it seems that He does not understand all at once, but
    discourses from one to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, discursive knowledge is to know the
    effect through its cause. But God knows things through Himself; as an effect
    (is known) through its cause. Therefore His knowledge is discursive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God knows each creature more perfectly
    than we know it. But we know the effects in their created causes; and thus
    we go discursively from causes to things caused. Therefore it seems that the
    same applies to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xv), "God does not
    see all things in their particularity or separately, as if He saw
    alternately here and there; but He sees all things together at once."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the divine knowledge there is no discursion;
    the proof of which is as follows. In our knowledge there is a twofold
    discursion: one is according to succession only, as when we have actually
    understood anything, we turn ourselves to understand something else; while
    the other mode of discursion is according to causality, as when through
    principles we arrive at the knowledge of conclusions. The first kind of
    discursion cannot belong to God. For many things, which we understand in
    succession if each is considered in itself, we understand simultaneously if
    we see them in some one thing; if, for instance, we understand the parts in
    the whole, or see different things in a mirror. Now God sees all things in
    one (thing), which is Himself. Therefore God sees all things together, and
    not successively. Likewise the second mode of discursion cannot be applied
    to God. First, because this second mode of discursion presupposes the first
    mode; for whosoever proceeds from principles to conclusions does not
    consider both at once; secondly, because to discourse thus is to proceed
    from the known to the unknown. Hence it is manifest that when the first is
    known, the second is still unknown; and thus the second is known not in the
    first, but from the first. Now the term discursive reasoning is attained
    when the second is seen in the first, by resolving the effects into their
    causes; and then the discursion ceases. Hence as God sees His effects in
    Himself as their cause, His knowledge is not discursive.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Altogether there is only one act of
    understanding in itself, nevertheless many things may be understood in one
    (medium), as shown above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God does not know by their cause, known,
    as it were previously, effects unknown; but He knows the effects in the
    cause; and hence His knowledge is not discursive, as was shown above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God sees the effects of created causes
    in the causes themselves, much better than we can; but still not in such a
    manner that the knowledge of the effects is caused in Him by the knowledge
    of the created causes, as is the case with us; and hence His knowledge is
    not discursive.<br />

    Whether the knowledge of God is the cause of things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the knowledge of God is not the
    cause of things. For Origen says, on Rm. 8:30, "Whom He called, them He also
    justified," etc.: "A thing will happen not because God knows it as future;
    but because it is future, it is on that account known by God, before it
    exists."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, given the cause, the effect follows. But
    the knowledge of God is eternal. Therefore if the knowledge of God is the
    cause of things created, it seems that creatures are eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "The thing known is prior to knowledge,
    and is its measure," as the Philosopher says (Metaph. x). But what is
    posterior and measured cannot be a cause. Therefore the knowledge of God is
    not the cause of things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xv), "Not because
    they are, does God know all creatures spiritual and temporal, but because He
    knows them, therefore they are."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The knowledge of God is the cause of things.
    For the knowledge of God is to all creatures what the knowledge of the
    artificer is to things made by his art. Now the knowledge of the artificer
    is the cause of the things made by his art from the fact that the artificer
    works by his intellect. Hence the form of the intellect must be the
    principle of action; as heat is the principle of heating. Nevertheless, we
    must observe that a natural form, being a form that remains in that to which
    it gives existence, denotes a principle of action according only as it has
    an inclination to an effect; and likewise, the intelligible form does not
    denote a principle of action in so far as it resides in the one who
    understands unless there is added to it the inclination to an effect, which
    inclination is through the will. For since the intelligible form has a
    relation to opposite things (inasmuch as the same knowledge relates to
    opposites), it would not produce a determinate effect unless it were
    determined to one thing by the appetite, as the Philosopher says (Metaph.
    ix). Now it is manifest that God causes things by His intellect, since His
    being is His act of understanding; and hence His knowledge must be the cause
    of things, in so far as His will is joined to it. Hence the knowledge of God
    as the cause of things is usually called the "knowledge of approbation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Origen spoke in reference to that aspect
    of knowledge to which the idea of causality does not belong unless the will
    is joined to it, as is said above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But when he says the reason why God foreknows some things is because they
    are future, this must be understood according to the cause of consequence,
    and not according to the cause of essence. For if things are in the future,
    it follows that God knows them; but not that the futurity of things is the
    cause why God knows them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The knowledge of God is the cause of
    things according as things are in His knowledge. Now that things should be
    eternal was not in the knowledge of God; hence although the knowledge of God
    is eternal, it does not follow that creatures are eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Natural things are midway between the
    knowledge of God and our knowledge: for we receive knowledge from natural
    things, of which God is the cause by His knowledge. Hence, as the natural
    objects of knowledge are prior to our knowledge, and are its measure, so,
    the knowledge of God is prior to natural things, and is the measure of them;
    as, for instance, a house is midway between the knowledge of the builder who
    made it, and the knowledge of the one who gathers his knowledge of the house
    from the house already built.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God has knowledge of things that are not?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God has not knowledge of things
    that are not. For the knowledge of God is of true things. But "truth" and
    "being" are convertible terms. Therefore the knowledge of God is not of
    things that are not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, knowledge requires likeness between the
    knower and the thing known. But those things that are not cannot have any
    likeness to God, Who is very being. Therefore what is not, cannot be known
    by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the knowledge of God is the cause of
    what is known by Him. But it is not the cause of things that are not,
    because a thing that is not, has no cause. Therefore God has no knowledge of
    things that are not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says: "Who... calleth those
    things that are not as those that are" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A17"
      >Rm. 4:17</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God knows all things whatsoever that in any way
    are. Now it is possible that things that are not absolutely, should be in a
    certain sense. For things absolutely are which are actual; whereas things
    which are not actual, are in the power either of God Himself or of a
    creature, whether in active power, or passive; whether in power of thought
    or of imagination, or of any other manner of meaning whatsoever. Whatever
    therefore can be made, or thought, or said by the creature, as also whatever
    He Himself can do, all are known to God, although they are not actual. And
    in so far it can be said that He has knowledge even of things that are
    not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now a certain difference is to be noted in the consideration of those things
    that are not actual. For though some of them may not be in act now, still
    they were, or they will be; and God is said to know all these with the
    knowledge of vision: for since God's act of understanding, which is His
    being, is measured by eternity; and since eternity is without succession,
    comprehending all time, the present glance of God extends over all time, and
    to all things which exist in any time, as to objects present to Him. But
    there are other things in God's power, or the creature's, which nevertheless
    are not, nor will be, nor were; and as regards these He is said to have
    knowledge, not of vision, but of simple intelligence. This is so called
    because the things we see around us have distinct being outside the seer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those things that are not actual are
    true in so far as they are in potentiality; for it is true that they are in
    potentiality; and as such they are known by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since God is very being everything is,
    in so far as it participates in the likeness of God; as everything is hot in
    so far as it participates in heat. So, things in potentiality are known by
    God, although they are not in act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The knowledge of God, joined to His will
    is the cause of things. Hence it is not necessary that what ever God knows,
    is, or was, or will be; but only is this necessary as regards what He wills
    to be, or permits to be. Further, it is in the knowledge of God not that
    they be, but that they be possible.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God knows evil things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not know evil things. For
    the Philosopher (De Anima iii) says that the intellect which is not in
    potentiality does not know privation. But "evil is the privation of good,"
    as Augustine says (Confess. iii, 7). Therefore, as the intellect of God is
    never in potentiality, but is always in act, as is clear from the foregoing
    (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it seems that God does
    not know evil things.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all knowledge is either the cause of the
    thing known, or is caused by it. But the knowledge of God is not the cause
    of evil, nor is it caused by evil. Therefore God does not know evil
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything known is known either by its
    likeness, or by its opposite. But whatever God knows, He knows through His
    essence, as is clear from the foregoing (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >). Now the divine essence neither is the likeness of evil, nor is evil
    contrary to it; for to the divine essence there is no contrary, as Augustine
    says (De Civ. Dei xii). Therefore God does not know evil things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is known through another and not
    through itself, is imperfectly known. But evil is not known by God; for the
    thing known must be in the knower. Therefore if evil is known through
    another, namely, through good, it would be known by Him imperfectly; which
    cannot be, for the knowledge of God is not imperfect. Therefore God does not
    know evil things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++15%3A11"
      >Prov. 15:11</a
    >), "Hell and destruction are before God [Vulg: 'the Lord']."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whoever knows a thing perfectly, must know all
    that can be accidental to it. Now there are some good things to which
    corruption by evil may be accidental. Hence God would not know good things
    perfectly, unless He also knew evil things. Now a thing is knowable in the
    degree in which it is; hence since this is the essence of evil that it is
    the privation of good, by the fact that God knows good things, He knows evil
    things also; as by light is known darkness. Hence Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
    vii): "God through Himself receives the vision of darkness, not otherwise
    seeing darkness except through light."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of the Philosopher must be
    understood as meaning that the intellect which is not in potentiality, does
    not know privation by privation existing in it; and this agrees with what he
    said previously, that a point and every indivisible thing are known by
    privation of division. This is because simple and indivisible forms are in
    our intellect not actually, but only potentially; for were they actually in
    our intellect, they would not be known by privation. It is thus that simple
    things are known by separate substances. God therefore knows evil, not by
    privation existing in Himself, but by the opposite good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The knowledge of God is not the cause of
    evil; but is the cause of the good whereby evil is known.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although evil is not opposed to the
    divine essence, which is not corruptible by evil; it is opposed to the
    effects of God, which He knows by His essence; and knowing them, He knows
    the opposite evils.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> To know a thing by something else only,
    belongs to imperfect knowledge, if that thing is of itself knowable; but
    evil is not of itself knowable, forasmuch as the very nature of evil means
    the privation of good; therefore evil can neither be defined nor known
    except by good.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God knows singular things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not know singular things.
    For the divine intellect is more immaterial than the human intellect. Now
    the human intellect by reason of its immateriality does not know singular
    things; but as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii), "reason has to do with
    universals, sense with singular things." Therefore God does not know
    singular things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in us those faculties alone know the
    singular, which receive the species not abstracted from material conditions.
    But in God things are in the highest degree abstracted from all materiality.
    Therefore God does not know singular things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all knowledge comes about through the
    medium of some likeness. But the likeness of singular things in so far as
    they are singular, does not seem to be in God; for the principle of
    singularity is matter, which, since it is in potentiality only, is
    altogether unlike God, Who is pure act. Therefore God cannot know singular
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++16%3A2"
      >Prov. 16:2</a
    >), "All the ways of a man are open to His eyes."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God knows singular things. For all perfections
    found in creatures pre-exist in God in a higher way, as is clear from the
    foregoing (<a href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now to know singular
    things is part of our perfection. Hence God must know singular things. Even
    the Philosopher considers it incongruous that anything known by us should be
    unknown to God; and thus against Empedocles he argues (De Anima i and
    Metaph. iii) that God would be most ignorant if He did not know discord. Now
    the perfections which are divided among inferior beings, exist simply and
    unitedly in God; hence, although by one faculty we know the universal and
    immaterial, and by another we know singular and material things,
    nevertheless God knows both by His simple intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now some, wishing to show how this can be, said that God knows singular
    things by universal causes. For nothing exists in any singular thing, that
    does not arise from some universal cause. They give the example of an
    astrologer who knows all the universal movements of the heavens, and can
    thence foretell all eclipses that are to come. This, however, is not enough;
    for singular things from universal causes attain to certain forms and powers
    which, however they may be joined together, are not individualized except by
    individual matter. Hence he who knows Socrates because he is white, or
    because he is the son of Sophroniscus, or because of something of that kind,
    would not know him in so far as he is this particular man. Hence according
    to the aforesaid mode, God would not know
  </p>
  <p>singular things in their singularity.</p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, others have said that God knows singular things by the
    application of universal causes to particular effects. But this will not
    hold; forasmuch as no one can apply a thing to another unless he first knows
    that thing; hence the said application cannot be the reason of knowing the
    particular, for it presupposes the knowledge of singular things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it must be said otherwise, that, since God is the cause of things
    by His knowledge, as stated above (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1"
      >Article [8]</a
    >), His knowledge extends as far as His causality extends. Hence as the
    active power of God extends not only to forms, which are the source of
    universality, but also to matter, as we shall prove further on (<a
      href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the knowledge of God
    must extend to singular things, which are individualized by matter. For
    since He knows things other than Himself by His essence, as being the
    likeness of things, or as their active principle, His essence must be the
    sufficing principle of knowing all things made by Him, not only in the
    universal, but also in the singular. The same would apply to the knowledge
    of the artificer, if it were productive of the whole thing, and not only of
    the form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our intellect abstracts the intelligible
    species from the individualizing principles; hence the intelligible species
    in our intellect cannot be the likeness of the individual principles; and on
    that account our intellect does not know the singular. But the intelligible
    species in the divine intellect, which is the essence of God, is immaterial
    not by abstraction, but of itself, being the principle of all the principles
    which enter into the composition of things, whether principles of the
    species or principles of the individual; hence by it God knows not only
    universal, but also singular things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although as regards the species in the
    divine intellect its being has no material conditions like the images
    received in the imagination and sense, yet its power extends to both
    immaterial and material things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although matter as regards its
    potentiality recedes from likeness to God, yet, even in so far as it has
    being in this wise, it retains a certain likeness to the divine being.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God can know infinite things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God cannot know infinite things.
    For the infinite, as such, is unknown; since the infinite is that which, "to
    those who measure it, leaves always something more to be measured," as the
    Philosopher says (Phys. iii). Moreover, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii)
    that "whatever is comprehended by knowledge, is bounded by the comprehension
    of the knower." Now infinite things have no boundary. Therefore they cannot
    be comprehended by the knowledge of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if we say that things infinite in
    themselves are finite in God's knowledge, against this it may be urged that
    the essence of the infinite is that it is untraversable, and the finite that
    it is traversable, as said in Phys. iii. But the infinite is not traversable
    either by the finite or by the infinite, as is proved in Phys. vi. Therefore
    the infinite cannot be bounded by the finite, nor even by the infinite; and
    so the infinite cannot be finite in God's knowledge, which is infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the knowledge of God is the measure of
    what is known. But it is contrary to the essence of the infinite that it be
    measured. Therefore infinite things cannot be known by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii), "Although
    we cannot number the infinite, nevertheless it can be comprehended by Him
    whose knowledge has no bounds."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since God knows not only things actual but also
    things possible to Himself or to created things, as shown above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >), and as these must be infinite, it must be held that He knows infinite
    things. Although the knowledge of vision which has relation only to things
    that are, or will be, or were, is not of infinite things, as some say, for
    we do not say that the world is eternal, nor that generation and movement
    will go on for ever, so that individuals be infinitely multiplied; yet, if
    we consider more attentively, we must hold that God knows infinite things
    even by the knowledge of vision. For God knows even the thoughts and
    affections of hearts, which will be multiplied to infinity as rational
    creatures go on for ever.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the knowledge of every
    knower is measured by the mode of the form which is the principle of
    knowledge. For the sensible image in sense is the likeness of only one
    individual thing, and can give the knowledge of only one individual. But the
    intelligible species of our intellect is the likeness of the thing as
    regards its specific nature, which is participable by infinite particulars;
    hence our intellect by the intelligible species of man in a certain way
    knows infinite men; not however as distinguished from each other, but as
    communicating in the nature of the species; and the reason is because the
    intelligible species of our intellect is the likeness of man not as to the
    individual principles, but as to the principles of the species. On the other
    hand, the divine essence, whereby the divine intellect understands, is a
    sufficing likeness of all things that are, or can be, not only as regards
    the universal principles, but also as regards the principles proper to each
    one, as shown above. Hence it follows that the knowledge of God extends to
    infinite things, even as distinct from each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The idea of the infinite pertains to
    quantity, as the Philosopher says (Phys. i). But the idea of quantity
    implies the order of parts. Therefore to know the infinite according to the
    mode of the infinite is to know part after part; and in this way the
    infinite cannot be known; for whatever quantity of parts be taken, there
    will always remain something else outside. But God does not know the
    infinite or infinite things, as if He enumerated part after part; since He
    knows all things simultaneously, and not successively, as said above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >). Hence there is nothing to prevent Him from knowing infinite things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Transition imports a certain succession
    of parts; and hence it is that the infinite cannot be traversed by the
    finite, nor by the infinite. But equality suffices for comprehension,
    because that is said to be comprehended which has nothing outside the
    comprehender. Hence it is not against the idea of the infinite to be
    comprehended by the infinite. And so, what is infinite in itself can be
    called finite to the knowledge of God as comprehended; but not as if it were
    traversable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The knowledge of God is the measure of
    things, not quantitatively, for the infinite is not subject to this kind of
    measure; but it is the measure of the essence and truth of things. For
    everything has truth of nature according to the degree in which it imitates
    the knowledge of God, as the thing made by art agrees with the art. Granted,
    however, an actually infinite number of things, for instance, an infinitude
    of men, or an infinitude in continuous quantity, as an infinitude of air, as
    some of the ancients held; yet it is manifest that these would have a
    determinate and finite being, because their being would be limited to some
    determinate nature. Hence they would be measurable as regards the knowledge
    of God.<br />

    Whether the knowledge of God is of future contingent things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the knowledge of God is not of
    future contingent things. For from a necessary cause proceeds a necessary
    effect. But the knowledge of God is the cause of things known, as said above
    (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Since therefore that
    knowledge is necessary, what He knows must also be necessary. Therefore the
    knowledge of God is not of contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every conditional proposition of which
    the antecedent is absolutely necessary must have an absolutely necessary
    consequent. For the antecedent is to the consequent as principles are to the
    conclusion: and from necessary principles only a necessary conclusion can
    follow, as is proved in Poster. i. But this is a true conditional
    proposition, "If God knew that this thing will be, it will be," for the
    knowledge of God is only of true things. Now the antecedent conditional of
    this is absolutely necessary, because it is eternal, and because it is
    signified as past. Therefore the consequent is also absolutely necessary.
    Therefore whatever God knows, is necessary; and so the knowledge of God is
    not of contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything known by God must necessarily
    be, because even what we ourselves know, must necessarily be; and, of
    course, the knowledge of God is much more certain than ours. But no future
    contingent things must necessarily be. Therefore no contingent future thing
    is known by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++32%3A15"
      >Ps. 32:15</a
    >), "He Who hath made the hearts of every one of them; Who understandeth all
    their works," i.e. of men. Now the works of men are contingent, being
    subject to free will. Therefore God knows future contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since as was shown above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >), God knows all things; not only things actual but also things possible to
    Him and creature; and since some of these are future contingent to us, it
    follows that God knows future contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In evidence of this, we must consider that a contingent thing can be
    considered in two ways; first, in itself, in so far as it is now in act: and
    in this sense it is not considered as future, but as present; neither is it
    considered as contingent (as having reference) to one of two terms, but as
    determined to one; and on account of this it can be infallibly the object of
    certain knowledge, for instance to the sense of sight, as when I see that
    Socrates is sitting down. In another way a contingent thing can be
    considered as it is in its cause; and in this way it is considered as
    future, and as a contingent thing not yet determined to one; forasmuch as a
    contingent cause has relation to opposite things: and in this sense a
    contingent thing is not subject to any certain knowledge. Hence, whoever
    knows a contingent effect in its cause only, has merely a conjectural
    knowledge of it. Now God knows all contingent things not only as they are in
    their causes, but also as each one of them is actually in itself. And
    although contingent things become actual successively, nevertheless God
    knows contingent things not successively, as they are in their own being, as
    we do but simultaneously. The reason is because His knowledge is measured by
    eternity, as is also His being; and eternity being simultaneously whole
    comprises all time, as said above (<a href="FP010.html#FPQ10OUTP1"
      >Question [10]</a
    >, <a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence all things that
    are in time are present to God from eternity, not only because He has the
    types of things present within Him, as some say; but because His glance is
    carried from eternity over all things as they are in their presentiality.
    Hence it is manifest that contingent things are infallibly known by God,
    inasmuch as they are subject to the divine sight in their presentiality; yet
    they are future contingent things in relation to their own causes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the supreme cause is necessary,
    the effect may be contingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause;
    just as the germination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate
    contingent cause, although the movement of the sun which is the first cause,
    is necessary. So likewise things known by God are contingent on account of
    their proximate causes, while the knowledge of God, which is the first
    cause, is necessary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some say that this antecedent, "God knew
    this contingent to be future," is not necessary, but contingent; because,
    although it is past, still it imports relation to the future. This however
    does not remove necessity from it; for whatever has had relation to the
    future, must have had it, although the future sometimes does not follow. On
    the other hand some say that this antecedent is contingent, because it is a
    compound of necessary and contingent; as this saying is contingent,
    "Socrates is a white man." But this also is to no purpose; for when we say,
    "God knew this contingent to be future," contingent is used here only as the
    matter of the word, and not as the chief part of the proposition. Hence its
    contingency or necessity has no reference to the necessity or contingency of
    the proposition, or to its being true or false. For it may be just as true
    that I said a man is an ass, as that I said Socrates runs, or God is: and
    the same applies to necessary and contingent. Hence it must be said that
    this antecedent is absolutely necessary. Nor does it follow, as some say,
    that the consequent is absolutely necessary, because the antecedent is the
    remote cause of the consequent, which is contingent by reason of the
    proximate cause. But this is to no purpose. For the conditional would be
    false were its antecedent the remote necessary cause, and the consequent a
    contingent effect; as, for example, if I said, "if the sun moves, the grass
    will grow."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we must reply otherwise; that when the antecedent contains
    anything belonging to an act of the soul, the consequent must be taken not
    as it is in itself, but as it is in the soul: for the existence of a thing
    in itself is different from the existence of a thing in the soul. For
    example, when I say, "What the soul understands is immaterial," this is to
    be understood that it is immaterial as it is in the intellect, not as it is
    in itself. Likewise if I say, "If God knew anything, it will be," the
    consequent must be understood as it is subject to the divine knowledge, i.e.
    as it is in its presentiality. And thus it is necessary, as also is the
    antecedent: "For everything that is, while it is, must be necessarily be,"
    as the Philosopher says in Peri Herm. i.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Things reduced to act in time, as known
    by us successively in time, but by God (are known) in eternity, which is
    above time. Whence to us they cannot be certain, forasmuch as we know future
    contingent things as such; but (they are certain) to God alone, whose
    understanding is in eternity above time. Just as he who goes along the road,
    does not see those who come after him; whereas he who sees the whole road
    from a height, sees at once all travelling by the way. Hence what is known
    by us must be necessary, even as it is in itself; for what is future
    contingent in itself, cannot be known by us. Whereas what is known by God
    must be necessary according to the mode in which they are subject to the
    divine knowledge, as already stated, but not absolutely as considered in
    their own causes. Hence also this proposition, "Everything known by God must
    necessarily be," is usually distinguished; for this may refer to the thing,
    or to the saying. If it refers to the thing, it is divided and false; for
    the sense is, "Everything which God knows is necessary." If understood of
    the saying, it is composite and true; for the sense is, "This proposition,
    'that which is known by God is' is necessary."
  </p>
  <p>
    Now some urge an objection and say that this distinction holds good with
    regard to forms that are separable from the subject; thus if I said, "It is
    possible for a white thing to be black," it is false as applied to the
    saying, and true as applied to the thing: for a thing which is white, can
    become black; whereas this saying, " a white thing is black" can never be
    true. But in forms that are inseparable from the subject, this distinction
    does not hold, for instance, if I said, "A black crow can be white"; for in
    both senses it is false. Now to be known by God is inseparable from the
    thing; for what is known by God cannot be not known. This objection,
    however, would hold if these words "that which is known" implied any
    disposition inherent to the subject; but since they import an act of the
    knower, something can be attributed to the thing known, in itself (even if
    it always be known), which is not attributed to it in so far as it stands
    under actual knowledge; thus material existence is attributed to a stone in
    itself, which is not attributed to it inasmuch as it is known.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God knows enunciable things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God does not know enunciable
    things. For to know enunciable things belongs to our intellect as it
    composes and divides. But in the divine intellect, there is no composition.
    Therefore God does not know enunciable things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every kind of knowledge is made through
    some likeness. But in God there is no likeness of enunciable things, since
    He is altogether simple. Therefore God does not know enunciable things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "The Lord knoweth the thoughts
    of men" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++93%3A11"
      >Ps. 93:11</a
    >). But enunciable things are contained in the thoughts of men. Therefore
    God knows enunciable things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since it is in the power of our intellect to
    form enunciations, and since God knows whatever is in His own power or in
    that of creatures, as said above (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >), it follows of necessity that God knows all enunciations that can be
    formed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now just as He knows material things immaterially, and composite things
    simply, so likewise He knows enunciable things not after the manner of
    enunciable things, as if in His intellect there were composition or division
    of enunciations; for He knows each thing by simple intelligence, by
    understanding the essence of each thing; as if we by the very fact that we
    understand what man is, were to understand all that can be predicated of
    man. This, however, does not happen in our intellect, which discourses from
    one thing to another, forasmuch as the intelligible species represents one
    thing in such a way as not to represent another. Hence when we understand
    what man is, we do not forthwith understand other things which belong to
    him, but we understand them one by one, according to a certain succession.
    On this account the things we understand as separated, we must reduce to one
    by way of composition or division, by forming an enunciation. Now the
    species of the divine intellect, which is God's essence, suffices to
    represent all things. Hence by understanding His essence, God knows the
    essences of all things, and also whatever can be accidental to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection would avail if God knew
    enunciable things after the manner of enunciable things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Enunciatory composition signifies some
    existence of a thing; and thus God by His existence, which is His essence,
    is the similitude of all those things which are signified by enunciation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the knowledge of God is variable?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the knowledge of God is variable.
    For knowledge is related to what is knowable. But whatever imports relation
    to the creature is applied to God from time, and varies according to the
    variation of creatures. Therefore the knowledge of God is variable according
    to the variation of creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever God can make, He can know. But
    God can make more than He does. Therefore He can know more than He knows.
    Thus His knowledge can vary according to increase and diminution.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God knew that Christ would be born. But
    He does not know now that Christ will be born; because Christ is not to be
    born in the future. Therefore God does not know everything He once knew; and
    thus the knowledge of God is variable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said, that in God "there is no change
    nor shadow of alteration" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A17"
      >James 1:17</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the knowledge of God is His substance, as
    is clear from the foregoing (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), just as His substance is altogether immutable, as shown above (<a
      href="FP009.html#FPQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FP009.html#FPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), so His knowledge
    likewise must be altogether invariable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Lord", "Creator" and the like, import
    relations to creatures in so far as they are in themselves. But the
    knowledge of God imports relation to creatures in so far as they are in God;
    because everything is actually understood according as it is in the one who
    understands. Now created things are in God in an invariable manner; while
    they exist variably in themselves. We may also say that "Lord", "Creator"
    and the like, import the relations consequent upon the acts which are
    understood as terminating in the creatures themselves, as they are in
    themselves; and thus these relations are attributed to God variously,
    according to the variation of creatures. But "knowledge" and "love," and the
    like, import relations consequent upon the acts which are understood to be
    in God; and therefore these are predicated of God in an invariable
    manner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God knows also what He can make, and
    does not make. Hence from the fact that He can make more than He makes, it
    does not follow that He can know more than He knows, unless this be referred
    to the knowledge of vision, according to which He is said to know those
    things which are in act in some period of time. But from the fact that He
    knows some things might be which are not, or that some things might not be
    which are, it does not follow that His knowledge is variable, but rather
    that He knows the variability of things. If, however, anything existed which
    God did not previously know, and afterwards knew, then His knowledge would
    be variable. But this could not be; for whatever is, or can be in any period
    of time, is known by God in His eternity. Therefore from the fact that a
    thing exists in some period of time, it follows that it is known by God from
    eternity. Therefore it cannot be granted that God can know more than He
    knows; because such a proposition implies that first of all He did not know,
    and then afterwards knew.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The ancient Nominalists said that it was
    the same thing to say "Christ is born" and "will be born" and "was born";
    because the same thing is signified by these three---viz. the nativity of
    Christ. Therefore it follows, they said, that whatever God knew, He knows;
    because now He knows that Christ is born, which means the same thing as that
    Christ will be born. This opinion, however, is false; both because the
    diversity in the parts of a sentence causes a diversity of enunciations; and
    because it would follow that a proposition which is true once would be
    always true; which is contrary to what the Philosopher lays down (Categor.
    iii) when he says that this sentence, "Socrates sits," is true when he is
    sitting, and false when he rises up. Therefore, it must be conceded that
    this proposition is not true, "Whatever God knew He knows," if referred to
    enunciable propositions. But because of this, it does not follow that the
    knowledge of God is variable. For as it is without variation in the divine
    knowledge that God knows one and the same thing sometime to be, and sometime
    not to be, so it is without variation in the divine knowledge that God knows
    an enunciable proposition is sometime true, and sometime false. The
    knowledge of God, however, would be variable if He knew enunciable things by
    way of enunciation, by composition and division, as occurs in our intellect.
    Hence our knowledge varies either as regards truth and falsity, for example,
    if when either as regards truth and falsity, for example, if when a thing
    suffers change we retained the same opinion about it; or as regards diverse
    opinions, as if we first thought that anyone was sitting, and afterwards
    thought that he was not sitting; neither of which can be in God.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God has a speculative knowledge of things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God has not a speculative knowledge
    of things. For the knowledge of God is the cause of things, as shown above
    (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But speculative
    knowledge is not the cause of the things known. Therefore the knowledge of
    God is not speculative.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, speculative knowledge comes by
    abstraction from things; which does not belong to the divine knowledge.
    Therefore the knowledge of God is not speculative.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is the more excellent must be
    attributed to God. But speculative knowledge is more excellent than
    practical knowledge, as the Philosopher says in the beginning of
    Metaphysics. Therefore God has a speculative knowledge of things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some knowledge is speculative only; some is
    practical only; and some is partly speculative and partly practical. In
    proof whereof it must be observed that knowledge can be called speculative
    in three ways: first, on the part of the things known, which are not
    operable by the knower; such is the knowledge of man about natural or divine
    thing. Secondly, as regards the manner of knowing---as, for instance, if a
    builder consider a house by defining and dividing, and considering what
    belongs to it in general: for this is to consider operable things in a
    speculative manner, and not as practically operable; for operable means the
    application of form to matter, and not the resolution of the composite into
    its universal formal principles. Thirdly, as regards the end; "for the
    practical intellect differs in its end from the speculative," as the
    Philosopher says (De Anima iii). For the practical intellect is ordered to
    the end of the operation; whereas the end of the speculative intellect is
    the consideration of truth. Hence if a builder should consider how a house
    can be made, not ordering this to the end of operation, but only to know
    (how to do it), this would be only a speculative considerations as regards
    the end, although it concerns an operable thing. Therefore knowledge which
    is speculative by reason of the thing itself known, is merely speculative.
    But that which is speculative either in its mode or as to its end is partly
    speculative and partly practical: and when it is ordained to an operative
    end it is simply practical.<br />
  </p>

    In accordance with this, therefore, it must be said that God has of Himself
    a speculative knowledge only; for He Himself is not operable. But of all
    other things He has both speculative and practical knowledge. He has
    speculative knowledge as regards the mode; for whatever we know
    speculatively in things by defining and dividing, God knows all this much
    more perfectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now of things which He can make, but does not make at any time, He has not a
    practical knowledge, according as knowledge is called practical from the
    end. But He has a practical knowledge of what He makes in some period of
    time. And, as regards evil things, although they are not operable by Him,
    yet they fall under His practical knowledge, like good things, inasmuch as
    He permits, or impedes, or directs them; as also sicknesses fall under the
    practical knowledge of the physician, inasmuch as he cures them by his
    art.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The knowledge of God is the cause, not
    indeed of Himself, but of other things. He is actually the cause of some,
    that is, of things that come to be in some period of time; and He is
    virtually the cause of others, that is, of things which He can make, and
    which nevertheless are never made.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fact that knowledge is derived from
    things known does not essentially belong to speculative knowledge, but only
    accidentally in so far as it is human.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In answer to what is objected on the contrary, we must say that perfect
    knowledge of operable things is obtainable only if they are known in so far
    as they are operable. Therefore, since the knowledge of God is in every way
    perfect, He must know what is operable by Him, formally as such, and not
    only in so far as they are speculative. Nevertheless this does not impair
    the nobility of His speculative knowledge, forasmuch as He sees all things
    other than Himself in Himself, and He knows Himself speculatively; and so in
    the speculative knowledge of Himself, he possesses both speculative and
    practical knowledge of all other things.<br />
