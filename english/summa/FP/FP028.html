  <br />
  <p>
    The divine relations are next to be considered, in four points of
    inquiry:<br />

    in God?
  </p>

    <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether those relations are the
    divine essence itself, or are extrinsic to it?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether in God there can be
    several relations distinct from each other?<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are real relations in God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are no real relations in
    God. For Boethius says (De Trin. iv), "All possible predicaments used as
    regards the Godhead refer to the substance; for nothing can be predicated
    relatively." But whatever really exists in God can be predicated of Him.
    Therefore no real relation exists in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Trin. iv) that,
    "Relation in the Trinity of the Father to the Son, and of both to the Holy
    Ghost, is the relation of the same to the same." But a relation of this kind
    is only a logical one; for every real relation requires and implies in
    reality two terms. Therefore the divine relations are not real relations,
    but are formed only by the mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the relation of paternity is the
    relation of a principle. But to say that God is the principle of creatures
    does not import any real relation, but only a logical one. Therefore
    paternity in God is not a real relation; while the same applies for the same
    reason to the other relations in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the divine generation proceeds by way of
    an intelligible word. But the relations following upon the operation of the
    intellect are logical relations. Therefore paternity and filiation in God,
    consequent upon generation, are only logical relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Father is denominated only from
    paternity; and the Son only from filiation. Therefore, if no real paternity
    or filiation existed in God, it would follow that God is not really Father
    or Son, but only in our manner of understanding; and this is the Sabellian
    heresy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> relations exist in God really; in proof whereof
    we may consider that in relations alone is found something which is only in
    the apprehension and not in reality. This is not found in any other genus;
    forasmuch as other genera, as quantity and quality, in their strict and
    proper meaning, signify something inherent in a subject. But relation in its
    own proper meaning signifies only what refers to another. Such regard to
    another exists sometimes in the nature of things, as in those things which
    by their own very nature are ordered to each other, and have a mutual
    inclination; and such relations are necessarily real relations; as in a
    heavy body is found an inclination and order to the centre; and hence there
    exists in the heavy body a certain respect in regard to the centre and the
    same applies to other things. Sometimes, however, this regard to another,
    signified by relation, is to be found only in the apprehension of reason
    comparing one thing to another, and this is a logical relation only; as, for
    instance, when reason compares man to animal as the species to the genus.
    But when something proceeds from a principle of the same nature, then both
    the one proceeding and the source of procession, agree in the same order;
    and then they have real relations to each other. Therefore as the divine
    processions are in the identity of the same nature, as above explained (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), these relations,
    according to the divine processions, are necessarily real relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Relationship is not predicated of God
    according to its proper and formal meaning, that is to say, in so far as its
    proper meaning denotes comparison to that in which relation is inherent, but
    only as denoting regard to another. Nevertheless Boethius did not wish to
    exclude relation in God; but he wished to show that it was not to be
    predicated of Him as regards the mode of inherence in Himself in the strict
    meaning of relation; but rather by way of relation to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The relation signified by the term "the
    same" is a logical relation only, if in regard to absolutely the same thing;
    because such a relation can exist only in a certain order observed by reason
    as regards the order of anything to itself, according to some two aspects
    thereof. The case is otherwise, however, when things are called the same,
    not numerically, but generically or specifically. Thus Boethius likens the
    divine relations to a relation of identity, not in every respect, but only
    as regards the fact that the substance is not diversified by these
    relations, as neither is it by relation of identity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the creature proceeds from God in
    diversity of nature, God is outside the order of the whole creation, nor
    does any relation to the creature arise from His nature; for He does not
    produce the creature by necessity of His nature, but by His intellect and
    will, as is above explained (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4;
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore there is no
    real relation in God to the creature; whereas in creatures there is a real
    relation to God; because creatures are contained under the divine order, and
    their very nature entails dependence on God. On the other hand, the divine
    processions are in one and the same nature. Hence no parallel exists.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Relations which result from the mental
    operation alone in the objects understood are logical relations only,
    inasmuch as reason observes them as existing between two objects perceived
    by the mind. Those relations, however, which follow the operation of the
    intellect, and which exist between the word intellectually proceeding and
    the source whence it proceeds, are not logical relations only, but are real
    relations; inasmuch as the intellect and the reason are real things, and are
    really related to that which proceeds from them intelligibly; as a corporeal
    thing is related to that which proceeds from it corporeally. Thus paternity
    and filiation are real relations in God.<br />

    Whether relation in God is the same as His essence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the divine relation is not the
    same as the divine essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. v) that "not all
    that is said of God is said of His substance, for we say some things
    relatively, as Father in respect of the Son: but such things do not refer to
    the substance." Therefore the relation is not the divine essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. vii) that,
    "every relative expression is something besides the relation expressed, as
    master is a man, and slave is a man." Therefore, if relations exist in God,
    there must be something else besides relation in God. This can only be His
    essence. Therefore essence differs from relation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the essence of relation is the being
    referred to another, as the Philosopher says (Praedic. v). So if relation is
    the divine essence, it follows that the divine essence is essentially itself
    a relation to something else; whereas this is repugnant to the perfection of
    the divine essence, which is supremely absolute and self-subsisting (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore relation is
    not the divine essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Everything which is not the divine essence is
    a creature. But relation really belongs to God; and if it is not the divine
    essence, it is a creature; and it cannot claim the adoration of latria;
    contrary to what is sung in the Preface: "Let us adore the distinction of
    the Persons, and the equality of their Majesty."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is reported that Gilbert de la Porree erred
    on this point, but revoked his error later at the council of Rheims. For he
    said that the divine relations are assistant, or externally affixed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To perceive the error here expressed, we must consider that in each of the
    nine genera of accidents there are two points for remark. One is the nature
    belonging to each one of them considered as an accident; which commonly
    applies to each of them as inherent in a subject, for the essence of an
    accident is to inhere. The other point of remark is the proper nature of
    each one of these genera. In the genera, apart from that of "relation," as
    in quantity and quality, even the true idea of the genus itself is derived
    from a respect to the subject; for quantity is called the measure of
    substance, and quality is the disposition of substance. But the true idea of
    relation is not taken from its respect to that in which it is, but from its
    respect to something outside. So if we consider even in creatures, relations
    formally as such, in that aspect they are said to be "assistant," and not
    intrinsically affixed, for, in this way, they signify a respect which
    affects a thing related and tends from that thing to something else;
    whereas, if relation is considered as an accident, it inheres in a subject,
    and has an accidental existence in it. Gilbert de la Porree considered
    relation in the former mode only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now whatever has an accidental existence in creatures, when considered as
    transferred to God, has a substantial existence; for there is no accident in
    God; since all in Him is His essence. So, in so far as relation has an
    accidental existence in creatures, relation really existing in God has the
    existence of the divine essence in no way distinct therefrom. But in so far
    as relation implies respect to something else, no respect to the essence is
    signified, but rather to its opposite term.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus it is manifest that relation really existing in God is really the same
    as His essence and only differs in its mode of intelligibility; as in
    relation is meant that regard to its opposite which is not expressed in the
    name of essence. Thus it is clear that in God relation and essence do not
    differ from each other, but are one and the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These words of Augustine do not imply
    that paternity or any other relation which is in God is not in its very
    being the same as the divine essence; but that it is not predicated under
    the mode of substance, as existing in Him to Whom it is applied; but as a
    relation. So there are said to be two predicaments only in God, since other
    predicaments import habitude to that of which they are spoken, both in their
    generic and in their specific nature; but nothing that exists in God can
    have any relation to that wherein it exists or of whom it is spoken, except
    the relation of identity; and this by reason of God's supreme simplicity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the relation which exists in
    creatures involves not only a regard to another, but also something
    absolute, so the same applies to God, yet not in the same way. What is
    contained in the creature above and beyond what is contained in the meaning
    of relation, is something else besides that relation; whereas in God there
    is no distinction, but both are one and the same; and this is not perfectly
    expressed by the word "relation," as if it were comprehended in the ordinary
    meaning of that term. For it was above explained (<a
      href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="FP013.html#FPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), in treating of the
    divine names, that more is contained in the perfection of the divine essence
    than can be signified by any name. Hence it does not follow that there
    exists in God anything besides relation in reality; but only in the various
    names imposed by us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the divine perfection contained only
    what is signified by relative names, it would follow that it is imperfect,
    being thus related to something else; as in the same way, if nothing more
    were contained in it than what is signified by the word "wisdom," it would
    not in that case be a subsistence. But as the perfection of the divine
    essence is greater than can be included in any name, it does not follow, if
    a relative term or any other name applied to God signify something
    imperfect, that the divine essence is in any way imperfect; for the divine
    essence comprehends within itself the perfection of every genus (<a

    Whether the relations in God are really distinguished from each other?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the divine relations are not
    really distinguished from each other. For things which are identified with
    the same, are identified with each other. But every relation in God is
    really the same as the divine essence. Therefore the relations are not
    really distinguished from each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as paternity and filiation are by name
    distinguished from the divine essence, so likewise are goodness and power.
    But this kind of distinction does not make any real distinction of the
    divine goodness and power. Therefore neither does it make any real
    distinction of paternity and filiation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in God there is no real distinction but
    that of origin. But one relation does not seem to arise from another.
    Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Trin.) that in God "the
    substance contains the unity; and relation multiplies the trinity."
    Therefore, if the relations were not really distinguished from each other,
    there would be no real trinity in God, but only an ideal trinity, which is
    the error of Sabellius.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The attributing of anything to another involves
    the attribution likewise of whatever is contained in it. So when "man" is
    attributed to anyone, a rational nature is likewise attributed to him. The
    idea of relation, however, necessarily means regard of one to another,
    according as one is relatively opposed to another. So as in God there is a
    real relation (<a href="FP028.html#FPQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), there
    must also be a real opposition. The very nature of relative opposition
    includes distinction. Hence, there must be real distinction in God, not,
    indeed, according to that which is absolute---namely, essence, wherein there
    is supreme unity and simplicity---but according to that which is
    relative.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Phys.
    iii), this argument holds, that whatever things are identified with the same
    thing are identified with each other, if the identity be real and logical;
    as, for instance, a tunic and a garment; but not if they differ logically.
    Hence in the same place he says that although action is the same as motion,
    and likewise passion; still it does not follow that action and passion are
    the same; because action implies reference as of something "from which"
    there is motion in the thing moved; whereas passion implies reference as of
    something "which is from" another. Likewise, although paternity, just as
    filiation, is really the same as the divine essence; nevertheless these two
    in their own proper idea and definitions import opposite respects. Hence
    they are distinguished from each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Power and goodness do not import any
    opposition in their respective natures; and hence there is no parallel
    argument.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although relations, properly speaking,
    do not arise or proceed from each other, nevertheless they are considered as
    opposed according to the procession of one from another.<br />

    Whether in God there are only four real relations---paternity, filiation,
    spiration, and procession?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in God there are not only four
    real relations---paternity, filiation, spiration and procession. For it must
    be observed that in God there exist the relations of the intelligent agent
    to the object understood; and of the one willing to the object willed; which
    are real relations not comprised under those above specified. Therefore
    there are not only four real relations in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, real relations in God are understood as
    coming from the intelligible procession of the Word. But intelligible
    relations are infinitely multiplied, as Avicenna says. Therefore in God
    there exists an infinite series of real relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, ideas in God are eternal (<a
      href="FP015.html#FPQ15OUTP1"
      >Question [15]</a
    >, <a href="FP015.html#FPQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); and are only
    distinguished from each other by reason of their regard to things, as above
    stated. Therefore in God there are many more eternal relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, equality, and likeness, and identity are
    relations: and they are in God from eternity. Therefore several more
    relations are eternal in God than the above named.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it may also contrariwise be said that
    there are fewer relations in God than those above named. For, according to
    the Philosopher (Phys. iii text 24), "It is the same way from Athens to
    Thebes, as from Thebes to Athens." By the same way of reasoning there is the
    same relation from the Father to the Son, that of paternity, and from the
    Son to the Father, that of filiation; and thus there are not four relations
    in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Metaph. v), every
    relation is based either on quantity, as double and half; or on action and
    passion, as the doer and the deed, the father and the son, the master and
    the servant, and the like. Now as there is no quantity in God, for He is
    great without quantity, as Augustine says (De Trin. i, 1) it follows that a
    real relation in God can be based only on action. Such relations are not
    based on the actions of God according to any extrinsic procession, forasmuch
    as the relations of God to creatures are not real in Him (<a
      href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="FP013.html#FPQ13A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Hence, it follows
    that real relations in God can be understood only in regard to those actions
    according to which there are internal, and not external, processions in God.
    These processions are two only, as above explained (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), one derived from the
    action of the intellect, the procession of the Word; and the other from the
    action of the will, the procession of love. In respect of each of these
    processions two opposite relations arise; one of which is the relation of
    the person proceeding from the principle; the other is the relation of the
    principle Himself. The procession of the Word is called generation in the
    proper sense of the term, whereby it is applied to living things. Now the
    relation of the principle of generation in perfect living beings is called
    paternity; and the relation of the one proceeding from the principle is
    called filiation. But the procession of Love has no proper name of its own
    (<a href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>); and so neither have the
    ensuing relations a proper name of their own. The relation of the principle
    of this procession is called spiration; and the relation of the person
    proceeding is called procession: although these two names belong to the
    processions or origins themselves, and not to the relations.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In those things in which there is a
    difference between the intellect and its object, and the will and its
    object, there can be a real relation, both of science to its object, and of
    the willer to the object willed. In God, however, the intellect and its
    object are one and the same; because by understanding Himself, God
    understands all other things; and the same applies to His will and the
    object that He wills. Hence it follows that in God these kinds of relations
    are not real; as neither is the relation of a thing to itself. Nevertheless,
    the relation to the word is a real relation; because the word is understood
    as proceeding by an intelligible action; and not as a thing understood. For
    when we understand a stone; that which the intellect conceives from the
    thing understood, is called the word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Intelligible relations in ourselves are
    infinitely multiplied, because a man understands a stone by one act, and by
    another act understands that he understands the stone, and again by another,
    understands that he understands this; thus the acts of understanding are
    infinitely multiplied, and consequently also the relations understood. This
    does not apply to God, inasmuch as He understands all things by one act
    alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Ideal relations exist as understood by
    God. Hence it does not follow from their plurality that there are many
    relations in God; but that God knows these many relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Equality and similitude in God are not
    real relations; but are only logical relations (<a
      href="FP042.html#FPQ42OUTP1"
      >Question [42]</a
    >, <a href="FP042.html#FPQ42A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The way from one term to another and
    conversely is the same; nevertheless the mutual relations are not the same.
    Hence, we cannot conclude that the relation of the father to the son is the
    same as that of the son to the father; but we could conclude this of
    something absolute, if there were such between them.<br />
