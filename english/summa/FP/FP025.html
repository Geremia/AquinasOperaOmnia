  <h3 align="center">THE POWER OF GOD (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After considering the divine foreknowledge and will, and other things
    pertaining thereto, it remains for us to consider the power of God. About
    this are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is power in God?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether His power is infinite?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He is almighty?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He could make the past not
    to have been?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether He could do what He does
    not, or not do what He does?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether what He makes He could
    make better?

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is power in God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that power is not in God. For as primary
    matter is to power, so God, who is the first agent, is to act. But primary
    matter, considered in itself, is devoid of all act. Therefore, the first
    agent---namely, God---is devoid of power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph.
    vi, 19), better than every power is its act. For form is better than matter;
    and action than active power, since it is its end. But nothing is better
    than what is in God; because whatsoever is in God, is God, as was shown
    above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, there is no
    power in God.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Power is the principle of operation. But
    the divine power is God's essence, since there is nothing accidental in God:
    and of the essence of God there is no principle. Therefore there is no power
    in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it was shown above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>;
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that God's knowledge and
    will are the cause of things. But the cause and principle of a thing are
    identical. We ought not, therefore, to assign power to God; but only
    knowledge and will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "Thou art mighty, O Lord, and Thy
    truth is round about Thee" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++88%3A9"
      >Ps. 88:9</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Power is twofold---namely, passive, which
    exists not at all in God; and active, which we must assign to Him in the
    highest degree. For it is manifest that everything, according as it is in
    act and is perfect, is the active principle of something: whereas everything
    is passive according as it is deficient and imperfect. Now it was shown
    above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 2), that God is pure act,
    simply and in all ways perfect, nor in Him does any imperfection find place.
    Whence it most fittingly belongs to Him to be an active principle, and in no
    way whatsoever to be passive. On the other hand, the notion of active
    principle is consistent with active power. For active power is the principle
    of acting upon something else; whereas passive power is the principle of
    being acted upon by something else, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, 17).
    It remains, therefore, that in God there is active power in the highest
    degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Active power is not contrary to act, but
    is founded upon it, for everything acts according as it is actual: but
    passive power is contrary to act; for a thing is passive according as it is
    potential. Whence this potentiality is not in God, but only active power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Whenever act is distinct from power, act
    must be nobler than power. But God's action is not distinct from His power,
    for both are His divine essence; neither is His existence distinct from His
    essence. Hence it does not follow that there should be anything in God
    nobler than His power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In creatures, power is the principle not
    only of action, but likewise of effect. Thus in God the idea of power is
    retained, inasmuch as it is the principle of an effect; not, however, as it
    is a principle of action, for this is the divine essence itself; except,
    perchance, after our manner of understanding, inasmuch as the divine
    essence, which pre-contains in itself all perfection that exists in created
    things, can be understood either under the notion of action, or under that
    of power; as also it is understood under the notion of "suppositum"
    possessing nature, and under that of nature. Accordingly the notion of power
    is retained in God in so far as it is the principle of an effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Power is predicated of God not as
    something really distinct from His knowledge and will, but as differing from
    them logically; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting
    into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which
    three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the knowledge or
    will of God, according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of
    power contained in it. Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of
    God precedes the consideration of His power, as the cause precedes the
    operation and effect.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the power of God is infinite?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the power of God is not infinite.
    For everything that is infinite is imperfect according to the Philosopher
    (Phys. iii, 6). But the power of God is far from imperfect. Therefore it is
    not infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every power is made known by its effect;
    otherwise it would be ineffectual. If, then, the power of God were infinite,
    it could produce an infinite effect, but this is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 79)
    that if the power of any corporeal thing were infinite, it would cause
    instantaneous movement. God, however, does not cause instantaneous movement,
    but moves the spiritual creature in time, and the corporeal creature in
    place and time, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. 20,22,23). Therefore, His
    power is not infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. viii), that "God's
    power is immeasurable. He is the living mighty one." Now everything that is
    immeasurable is infinite. Therefore the power of God is infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), active power exists in God according to the measure in which He is
    actual. Now His existence is infinite, inasmuch as it is not limited by
    anything that receives it, as is clear from what has been said, when we
    discussed the infinity of the divine essence (<a href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore, it is
    necessary that the active power in God should be infinite. For in every
    agent is it found that the more perfectly an agent has the form by which it
    acts the greater its power to act. For instance, the hotter a thing is, the
    greater the power has it to give heat; and it would have infinite power to
    give heat, were its own heat infinite. Whence, since the divine essence,
    through which God acts, is infinite, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) it follows that His
    power likewise is infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is here speaking of an
    infinity in regard to matter not limited by any form; and such infinity
    belongs to quantity. But the divine essence is otherwise, as was shown above
    (<a href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>,
    <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); and consequently so also
    His power. It does not follow, therefore, that it is imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The power of a univocal agent is wholly
    manifested in its effect. The generative power of man, for example, is not
    able to do more than beget man. But the power of a non-univocal agent does
    not wholly manifest itself in the production of its effect: as, for example,
    the power of the sun does not wholly manifest itself in the production of an
    animal generated from putrefaction. Now it is clear that God is not a
    univocal agent. For nothing agrees with Him either in species or in genus,
    as was shown above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>;
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Whence it follows that
    His effect is always less than His power. It is not necessary, therefore,
    that the infinite power of God should be manifested so as to produce an
    infinite effect. Yet even if it were to produce no effect, the power of God
    would not be ineffectual; because a thing is ineffectual which is ordained
    towards an end to which it does not attain. But the power of God is not
    ordered toward its effect as towards an end; rather, it is the end of the
    effect produced by it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher (Phys. viii, 79) proves
    that if a body had infinite power, it would cause a non-temporal movement.
    And he shows that the power of the mover of heaven is infinite, because it
    can move in an infinite time. It remains, therefore, according to his
    reckoning, that the infinite power of a body, if such existed, would move
    without time; not, however, the power of an incorporeal mover. The reason of
    this is that one body moving another is a univocal agent; wherefore it
    follows that the whole power of the agent is made known in its motion. Since
    then the greater the power of a moving body, the more quickly does it move;
    the necessary conclusion is that if its power were infinite, it would move
    beyond comparison faster, and this is to move without time. An incorporeal
    mover, however, is not a univocal agent; whence it is not necessary that the
    whole of its power should be manifested in motion, so as to move without
    time; and especially since it moves in accordance with the disposition of
    its will.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is omnipotent?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not omnipotent. For movement
    and passiveness belong to everything. But this is impossible with God, for
    He is immovable, as was said above (<a href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore He is not
    omnipotent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin is an act of some kind. But God
    cannot sin, nor "deny Himself" as it is said in 2 Tim. 2:13. Therefore He is
    not omnipotent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is said of God that He manifests His
    omnipotence "especially by sparing and having mercy" [*Collect, 10th Sunday
    after Pentecost]. Therefore the greatest act possible to the divine power is
    to spare and have mercy. There are things much greater, however, than
    sparing and having mercy; for example, to create another world, and the
    like. Therefore God is not omnipotent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, upon the text, "God hath made foolish
    the wisdom of this world" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A20"
      >1 Cor. 1:20</a
    >), a gloss says: "God hath made the wisdom of this world foolish [*Vulg.:
    'Hath not God', etc.] by showing those things to be possible which it judges
    to be impossible." Whence it would seem that nothing is to be judged
    possible or impossible in reference to inferior causes, as the wisdom of
    this world judges them; but in reference to the divine power. If God, then,
    were omnipotent, all things would be possible; nothing, therefore
    impossible. But if we take away the impossible, then we destroy also the
    necessary; for what necessarily exists is impossible not to exist. Therefore
    there would be nothing at all that is necessary in things if God were
    omnipotent. But this is an impossibility. Therefore God is not
    omnipotent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "No word shall be impossible with
    God" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A37">Lk. 1:37</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All confess that God is omnipotent; but it
    seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for
    there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we say
    that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter aright,
    since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, "God can
    do all things," is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things
    that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent. Now
    according to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, 17), a thing is said to be possible
    in two ways. First in relation to some power, thus whatever is subject to
    human power is said to be possible to man. Secondly absolutely, on account
    of the relation in which the very terms stand to each other. Now God cannot
    be said to be omnipotent through being able to do all things that are
    possible to created nature; for the divine power extends farther than that.
    If, however, we were to say that God is omnipotent because He can do all
    things that are possible to His power, there would be a vicious circle in
    explaining the nature of His power. For this would be saying nothing else
    but that God is omnipotent, because He can do all that He is able to do.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It remains therefore, that God is called omnipotent because He can do all
    things that are possible absolutely; which is the second way of saying a
    thing is possible. For a thing is said to be possible or impossible
    absolutely, according to the relation in which the very terms stand to one
    another, possible if the predicate is not incompatible with the subject, as
    that Socrates sits; and absolutely impossible when the predicate is
    altogether incompatible with the subject, as, for instance, that a man is a
    donkey.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must, however, be remembered that since every agent produces an effect
    like itself, to each active power there corresponds a thing possible as its
    proper object according to the nature of that act on which its active power
    is founded; for instance, the power of giving warmth is related as to its
    proper object to the being capable of being warmed. The divine existence,
    however, upon which the nature of power in God is founded, is infinite, and
    is not limited to any genus of being; but possesses within itself the
    perfection of all being. Whence, whatsoever has or can have the nature of
    being, is numbered among the absolutely possible things, in respect of which
    God is called omnipotent. Now nothing is opposed to the idea of being except
    non-being. Therefore, that which implies being and non-being at the same
    time is repugnant to the idea of an absolutely possible thing, within the
    scope of the divine omnipotence. For such cannot come under the divine
    omnipotence, not because of any defect in the power of God, but because it
    has not the nature of a feasible or possible thing. Therefore, everything
    that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those
    possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas
    whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine
    omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is
    better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them.
    Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: "No word shall be
    impossible with God." For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word,
    because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God is said to be omnipotent in respect
    to His active power, not to passive power, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Whence the fact that He is immovable or impassible is not repugnant to
    His omnipotence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To sin is to fall short of a perfect
    action; hence to be able to sin is to be able to fall short in action, which
    is repugnant to omnipotence. Therefore it is that God cannot sin, because of
    His omnipotence. Nevertheless, the Philosopher says (Topic. iv, 3) that God
    can deliberately do what is evil. But this must be understood either on a
    condition, the antecedent of which is impossible---as, for instance, if we
    were to say that God can do evil things if He will. For there is no reason
    why a conditional proposition should not be true, though both the antecedent
    and consequent are impossible: as if one were to say: "If man is a donkey,
    he has four feet." Or he may be understood to mean that God can do some
    things which now seem to be evil: which, however, if He did them, would then
    be good. Or he is, perhaps, speaking after the common manner of the heathen,
    who thought that men became gods, like Jupiter or Mercury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God's omnipotence is particularly shown
    in sparing and having mercy, because in this is it made manifest that God
    has supreme power, that He freely forgives sins. For it is not for one who
    is bound by laws of a superior to forgive sins of his own free will. Or,
    because by sparing and having mercy upon men, He leads them on to the
    participation of an infinite good; which is the ultimate effect of the
    divine power. Or because, as was said above (<a href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1"
      >Question [21]</a
    >, <a href="FP021.html#FPQ21A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the effect of the
    divine mercy is the foundation of all the divine works. For nothing is due
    to anyone, except on account of something already given him gratuitously by
    God. In this way the divine omnipotence is particularly made manifest,
    because to it pertains the first foundation of all good things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The absolute possible is not so called
    in reference either to higher causes, or to inferior causes, but in
    reference to itself. But the possible in reference to some power is named
    possible in reference to its proximate cause. Hence those things which it
    belongs to God alone to do immediately---as, for example, to create, to
    justify, and the like---are said to be possible in reference to a higher
    cause. Those things, however, which are of such kind as to be done by
    inferior causes are said to be possible in reference to those inferior
    causes. For it is according to the condition of the proximate cause that the
    effect has contingency or necessity, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Thus is it that
    the wisdom of the world is deemed foolish, because what is impossible to
    nature, it judges to be impossible to God. So it is clear that the
    omnipotence of God does not take away from things their impossibility and
    necessity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God can make the past not to have been?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God can make the past not to have
    been. For what is impossible in itself is much more impossible than that
    which is only impossible accidentally. But God can do what is impossible in
    itself, as to give sight to the blind, or to raise the dead. Therefore, and
    much more can He do what is only impossible accidentally. Now for the past
    not to have been is impossible accidentally: thus for Socrates not to be
    running is accidentally impossible, from the fact that his running is a
    thing of the past. Therefore God can make the past not to have been.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what God could do, He can do now, since
    His power is not lessened. But God could have effected, before Socrates ran,
    that he should not run. Therefore, when he has run, God could effect that he
    did not run.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a more excellent virtue than
    virginity. But God can supply charity that is lost; therefore also lost
    virginity. Therefore He can so effect that what was corrupt should not have
    been corrupt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ep. 22 ad Eustoch.): "Although
    God can do all things, He cannot make a thing that is corrupt not to have
    been corrupted." Therefore, for the same reason, He cannot effect that
    anything else which is past should not have been.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), there does not fall
    under the scope of God's omnipotence anything that implies a contradiction.
    Now that the past should not have been implies a contradiction. For as it
    implies a contradiction to say that Socrates is sitting, and is not sitting,
    so does it to say that he sat, and did not sit. But to say that he did sit
    is to say that it happened in the past. To say that he did not sit, is to
    say that it did not happen. Whence, that the past should not have been, does
    not come under the scope of divine power. This is what Augustine means when
    he says (Contra Faust. xxix, 5): "Whosoever says, If God is almighty, let
    Him make what is done as if it were not done, does not see that this is to
    say: If God is almighty let Him effect that what is true, by the very fact
    that it is true, be false": and the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 2): "Of
    this one thing alone is God deprived---namely, to make undone the things
    that have been done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although it is impossible accidentally
    for the past not to have been, if one considers the past thing itself, as,
    for instance, the running of Socrates; nevertheless, if the past thing is
    considered as past, that it should not have been is impossible, not only in
    itself, but absolutely since it implies a contradiction. Thus, it is more
    impossible than the raising of the dead; in which there is nothing
    contradictory, because this is reckoned impossible in reference to some
    power, that is to say, some natural power; for such impossible things do
    come beneath the scope of divine power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As God, in accordance with the
    perfection of the divine power, can do all things, and yet some things are
    not subject to His power, because they fall short of being possible; so,
    also, if we regard the immutability of the divine power, whatever God could
    do, He can do now. Some things, however, at one time were in the nature of
    possibility, whilst they were yet to be done, which now fall short of the
    nature of possibility, when they have been done. So is God said not to be
    able to do them, because they themselves cannot be done.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God can remove all corruption of the
    mind and body from a woman who has fallen; but the fact that she had been
    corrupt cannot be removed from her; as also is it impossible that the fact
    of having sinned or having lost charity thereby can be removed from the
    sinner.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God can do what He does not?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God cannot do other than what He
    does. For God cannot do what He has not foreknown and pre-ordained that He
    would do. But He neither foreknew nor pre-ordained that He would do anything
    except what He does. Therefore He cannot do except what He does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God can only do what ought to be done
    and what is right to be done. But God is not bound to do what He does not;
    nor is it right that He should do what He does not. Therefore He cannot do
    except what He does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God cannot do anything that is not good
    and befitting creation. But it is not good for creatures nor befitting them
    to be otherwise than as they are. Therefore God cannot do except what He
    does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "Thinkest thou that I cannot ask
    My Father, and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of
    angels?" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A53"
      >Mt. 26:53</a
    >). But He neither asked for them, nor did His Father show them to refute
    the Jews. Therefore God can do what He does not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In this matter certain persons erred in two
    ways. Some laid it down that God acts from natural necessity in such way
    that as from the action of nature nothing else can happen beyond what
    actually takes place---as, for instance, from the seed of man, a man must
    come, and from that of an olive, an olive; so from the divine operation
    there could not result other things, nor another order of things, than that
    which now is. But we showed above (<a href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that God does not act
    from natural necessity, but that His will is the cause of all things; nor is
    that will naturally and from any necessity determined to those things.
    Whence in no way at all is the present course of events produced by God from
    any necessity, so that other things could not happen. Others, however, said
    that the divine power is restricted to this present course of events through
    the order of the divine wisdom and justice without which God does nothing.
    But since the power of God, which is His essence, is nothing else but His
    wisdom, it can indeed be fittingly said that there is nothing in the divine
    power which is not in the order of the divine wisdom; for the divine wisdom
    includes the whole potency of the divine power. Yet the order placed in
    creation by divine wisdom, in which order the notion of His justice
    consists, as said above (<a href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>,
    <a href="FP021.html#FPQ21A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), is not so adequate to
    the divine wisdom that the divine wisdom should be restricted to this
    present order of things. Now it is clear that the whole idea of order which
    a wise man puts into things made by him is taken from their end. So, when
    the end is proportionate to the things made for that end, the wisdom of the
    maker is restricted to some definite order. But the divine goodness is an
    end exceeding beyond all proportion things created. Whence the divine wisdom
    is not so restricted to any particular order that no other course of events
    could happen. Wherefore we must simply say that God can do other things than
    those He has done.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In ourselves, in whom power and essence
    are distinct from will and intellect, and again intellect from wisdom, and
    will from justice, there can be something in the power which is not in the
    just will nor in the wise intellect. But in God, power and essence, will and
    intellect, wisdom and justice, are one and the same. Whence, there can be
    nothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His just will or in His
    wise intellect. Nevertheless, because His will cannot be determined from
    necessity to this or that order of things, except upon supposition, as was
    said above (<a href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FP019.html#FPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), neither are the wisdom
    and justice of God restricted to this present order, as was shown above; so
    nothing prevents there being something in the divine power which He does not
    will, and which is not included in the order which He has place in things.
    Again, because power is considered as executing, the will as commanding, and
    the intellect and wisdom as directing; what is attributed to His power
    considered in itself, God is said to be able to do in accordance with His
    absolute power. Of such a kind is everything which has the nature of being,
    as was said above (<a href="FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). What
    is, however, attributed to the divine power, according as it carries into
    execution the command of a just will, God is said to be able to do by His
    ordinary power. In this manner, we must say that God can do other things by
    His absolute power than those He has foreknown and pre-ordained He would do.
    But it could not happen that He should do anything which He had not
    foreknown, and had not pre-ordained that He would do, because His actual
    doing is subject to His foreknowledge and pre-ordination, though His power,
    which is His nature, is not so. For God does things because He wills so to
    do; yet the power to do them does not come from His will, but from His
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is bound to nobody but Himself.
    Hence, when it is said that God can only do what He ought, nothing else is
    meant by this than that God can do nothing but what is befitting to Himself,
    and just. But these words "befitting" and "just" may be understood in two
    ways: one, in direct connection with the verb "is"; and thus they would be
    restricted to the present order of things; and would concern His power. Then
    what is said in the objection is false; for the sense is that God can do
    nothing except what is now fitting and just. If, however, they be joined
    directly with the verb "can" (which has the effect of extending the
    meaning), and then secondly with "is," the present will be signified, but in
    a confused and general way. The sentence would then be true in this sense:
    "God cannot do anything except that which, if He did it, would be suitable
    and just."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although this order of things be
    restricted to what now exists, the divine power and wisdom are not thus
    restricted. Whence, although no other order would be suitable and good to
    the things which now are, yet God can do other things and impose upon them
    another order.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God can do better than what He does?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God cannot do better than He does.
    For whatever God does, He does in a most powerful and wise way. But a thing
    is so much the better done as it is more powerfully and wisely done.
    Therefore God cannot do anything better than He does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine thus argues (Contra Maximin.
    iii, 8): "If God could, but would not, beget a Son His equal, He would have
    been envious." For the same reason, if God could have made better things
    than He has done, but was not willing so to do, He would have been envious.
    But envy is far removed from God. Therefore God makes everything of the
    best. He cannot therefore make anything better than He does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is very good and the best of all
    cannot be bettered; because nothing is better than the best. But as
    Augustine says (Enchiridion 10), "each thing that God has made is good, and,
    taken all together they are very good; because in them all consists the
    wondrous beauty of the universe." Therefore the good in the universe could
    not be made better by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Christ as man is full of grace and
    truth, and has the Spirit without measure; and so He cannot be better. Again
    created happiness is described as the highest good, and thus cannot be
    better. And the Blessed Virgin Mary is raised above all the choirs of
    angels, and so cannot be better than she is. God cannot therefore make all
    things better than He has made them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A20"
      >Eph. 3:20</a
    >): "God is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or
    understand."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The goodness of anything is twofold; one, which
    is of the essence of it---thus, for instance, to be rational pertains to the
    essence of man. As regards this good, God cannot make a thing better than it
    is itself; although He can make another thing better than it; even as He
    cannot make the number four greater than it is; because if it were greater
    it would no longer be four, but another number. For the addition of a
    substantial difference in definitions is after the manner of the addition of
    unity of numbers (Metaph. viii, 10). Another kind of goodness is that which
    is over and above the essence; thus, the good of a man is to be virtuous or
    wise. As regards this kind of goodness, God can make better the things He
    has made. Absolutely speaking, however, God can make something else better
    than each thing made by Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When it is said that God can make a
    thing better than He makes it, if "better" is taken substantively, this
    proposition is true. For He can always make something else better than each
    individual thing: and He can make the same thing in one way better than it
    is, and in another way not; as was explained above. If, however, "better" is
    taken as an adverb, implying the manner of the making; thus God cannot make
    anything better than He makes it, because He cannot make it from greater
    wisdom and goodness. But if it implies the manner of the thing done, He can
    make something better; because He can give to things made by Him a better
    manner of existence as regards the accidents, although not as regards the
    substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is of the nature of a son that he
    should be equal to his father, when he comes to maturity. But it is not of
    the nature of anything created, that it should be better than it was made by
    God. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The universe, the present creation being
    supposed, cannot be better, on account of the most beautiful order given to
    things by God; in which the good of the universe consists. For if any one
    thing were bettered, the proportion of order would be destroyed; as if one
    string were stretched more than it ought to be, the melody of the harp would
    be destroyed. Yet God could make other things, or add something to the
    present creation; and then there would be another and a better universe.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The humanity of Christ, from the fact
    that it is united to the Godhead; and created happiness from the fact that
    it is the fruition of God; and the Blessed Virgin from the fact that she is
    the mother of God; have all a certain infinite dignity from the infinite
    good, which is God. And on this account there cannot be anything better than
    these; just as there cannot be anything better than God.<br />
