</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering the divine foreknowledge and will, and other things 
pertaining thereto, it remains for us to consider the power of God. About 
this are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is power in God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether His power is infinite?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He is almighty?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He could make the past not to have been?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether He could do what He does not, or not do what He does?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether what He makes He could make better?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that power is not in God. For as primary matter is to 
power, so God, who is the first agent, is to act. But primary matter, 
considered in itself, is devoid of all act. Therefore, the first 
agent---namely, God---is devoid of power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vi, 19), better 
than every power is its act. For form is better than matter; and action 
than active power, since it is its end. But nothing is better than what 
is in God; because whatsoever is in God, is God, as was shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, there is no power in God.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Power is the principle of operation. But the divine 
power is God's essence, since there is nothing accidental in God: and of 
the essence of God there is no principle. Therefore there is no power in 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it was shown above (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that God's 
knowledge and will are the cause of things. But the cause and principle 
of a thing are identical. We ought not, therefore, to assign power to 
God; but only knowledge and will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "Thou art mighty, O Lord, and Thy truth is 
round about Thee" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++88%3A9">Ps. 88:9</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Power is twofold---namely, passive, which  exists not at 
all in God; and active, which we must assign to Him in the highest 
degree. For it is manifest that everything, according as it is in act and 
is perfect, is the active principle of something: whereas everything is 
passive according as it is deficient and imperfect. Now it was shown 
above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 2), that God is pure act, simply and in 
all ways perfect, nor in Him does any imperfection find place. Whence it 
most fittingly belongs to Him to be an active principle, and in no way 
whatsoever to be passive. On the other hand, the notion of active 
principle is consistent with active power. For active power is the 
principle of acting upon something else; whereas passive power is the 
principle of being acted upon by something else, as the Philosopher says 
(Metaph. v, 17). It remains, therefore, that in God there is active power 
in the highest degree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Active power is not contrary to act, but is founded upon 
it, for everything acts according as it is actual: but passive power is 
contrary to act; for a thing is passive according as it is potential. 
Whence this potentiality is not in God, but only active power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Whenever act is distinct from power, act must be nobler 
than power. But God's action is not distinct from His power, for both are 
His divine essence; neither is His existence distinct from His essence. 
Hence it does not follow that there should be anything in God nobler than 
His power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In creatures, power is the principle not only of action, 
but likewise of effect. Thus in God the idea of power is retained, 
inasmuch as it is the principle of an effect; not, however, as it is a 
principle of action, for this is the divine essence itself; except, 
perchance, after our manner of understanding, inasmuch as the divine 
essence, which pre-contains in itself all perfection that exists in 
created things, can be understood either under the notion of action, or 
under that of power; as also it is understood under the notion of 
"suppositum" possessing nature, and under that of nature. Accordingly the 
notion of power is retained in God in so far as it is the principle of an 
effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Power is predicated of God not as something really distinct 
from His knowledge and will, but as differing from them logically; 
inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution 
what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which three things in 
God are identified. Or we may say, that the knowledge or will of God, 
according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of power 
contained in it. Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of God 
precedes the consideration of His power, as the cause precedes the 
operation and effect.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the power of God is infinite?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the power of God is not infinite. For everything 
that is infinite is imperfect according to the Philosopher (Phys. iii, 
6). But the power of God is far from imperfect. Therefore it is not 
infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every power is made known by its effect; otherwise it 
would be ineffectual. If, then, the power of God were infinite, it could 
produce an infinite effect, but this is impossible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 79) that if the 
power of any corporeal thing were infinite, it would cause instantaneous 
movement. God, however, does not cause instantaneous movement, but moves 
the spiritual creature in time, and the corporeal creature in place and 
time, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. 20,22,23). Therefore, His power is 
not infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. viii), that "God's power is 
immeasurable. He is the living mighty one." Now everything that is 
immeasurable is infinite. Therefore the power of God is infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), active power exists in God 
according to the measure in which He is actual. Now His existence is 
infinite, inasmuch as it is not limited by anything that receives it, as 
is clear from what has been said, when we discussed the infinity of the 
divine essence (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore, it is necessary that the active 
power in God should be infinite. For in every agent is it found that the 
more perfectly an agent has the form by which it acts the greater its 
power to act. For instance, the hotter a thing is, the greater the power 
has it to give heat; and it would have infinite power to give heat, were 
its own heat infinite. Whence, since the divine essence, through which 
God acts, is infinite, as was shown above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) it follows that 
His power likewise is infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is here speaking of an infinity in regard 
to matter not limited by any form; and such infinity belongs to quantity. 
But the divine essence is otherwise, as was shown above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); and 
consequently so also His power. It does not follow, therefore, that it is 
imperfect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The power of a univocal agent is wholly manifested in its 
effect. The generative power of man, for example, is not able to do more 
than beget man. But the power of a non-univocal agent does not wholly 
manifest itself in the production of its effect: as, for example, the 
power of the sun does not wholly manifest itself in the production of an 
animal generated from putrefaction. Now it is clear that God is not a 
univocal agent. For nothing agrees with Him either in species or in 
genus, as was shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Whence it follows 
that His effect is always less than His power. It is not necessary, 
therefore, that the infinite power of God should be manifested so as to 
produce an infinite effect. Yet even if it were to produce no  effect, 
the power of God would not be ineffectual; because a thing is ineffectual 
which is ordained towards an end to which it does not attain. But the 
power of God is not ordered toward its effect as towards an end; rather, 
it is the end of the effect produced by it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher (Phys. viii, 79) proves that if a body had 
infinite power, it would cause a non-temporal movement. And he shows that 
the power of the mover of heaven is infinite, because it can move in an 
infinite time. It remains, therefore, according to his reckoning, that 
the infinite power of a body, if such existed, would move without time; 
not, however, the power of an incorporeal mover. The reason of this is 
that one body moving another is a univocal agent; wherefore it follows 
that the whole power of the agent is made known in its motion. Since then 
the greater the power of a moving body, the more quickly does it move; 
the necessary conclusion is that if its power were infinite, it would 
move beyond comparison faster, and this is to move without time. An 
incorporeal mover, however, is not a univocal agent; whence it is not 
necessary that the whole of its power should be manifested in motion, so 
as to move without time; and especially since it moves in accordance with 
the disposition of its will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is omnipotent?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not omnipotent. For movement and passiveness 
belong to everything. But this is impossible with God, for He is 
immovable, as was said above (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore He is not omnipotent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin is an act of some kind. But God cannot sin, nor 
"deny Himself" as it is said in 2 Tim. 2:13. Therefore He is not 
omnipotent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is said of God that He manifests His omnipotence 
"especially by sparing and having mercy" [*Collect, 10th Sunday after 
Pentecost]. Therefore the greatest act possible to the divine power is to 
spare and have mercy. There are things much greater, however, than 
sparing and having mercy; for example, to create another world, and the 
like. Therefore God is not omnipotent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, upon the text, "God hath made foolish the wisdom of this 
world" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++1%3A20">1 Cor. 1:20</a>), a gloss says: "God hath made the wisdom of this 
world foolish [*Vulg.: 'Hath not God', etc.] by showing those things to 
be possible which it judges to be impossible." Whence it would seem that 
nothing is to be judged possible or impossible in reference to inferior 
causes, as the wisdom of this world judges them; but in reference to the 
divine power. If God, then, were omnipotent, all things would be 
possible; nothing, therefore impossible. But if we take away the 
impossible, then we destroy also the necessary; for what necessarily 
exists is impossible not to exist. Therefore there would be nothing at 
all  that is necessary in things if God were omnipotent. But this is an 
impossibility. Therefore God is not omnipotent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "No word shall be impossible with God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++1%3A37">Lk. 1:37</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems 
difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for 
there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we 
say that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter 
aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, 
"God can do all things," is rightly understood to mean that God can do 
all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be 
omnipotent. Now according to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, 17), a thing is 
said to be possible in two ways. First in relation to some power, thus 
whatever is subject to human power is said to be possible to man. 
Secondly absolutely, on account of the relation in which the very terms 
stand to each other. Now God cannot be said to be omnipotent through 
being able to do all things that are possible to created nature; for the 
divine power extends farther than that. If, however, we were to say that 
God is omnipotent because He can do all things that are possible to His 
power, there would be a vicious circle in explaining the nature of His 
power. For this would be saying nothing else but that God is omnipotent, 
because He can do all that He is able to do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It remains therefore, that God is called omnipotent because He can do 
all things that are possible absolutely; which is the second way of 
saying a thing is possible. For a thing is said to be possible or 
impossible absolutely, according to the relation in which the very terms 
stand to one another, possible if the predicate is not incompatible with 
the subject, as that Socrates sits; and absolutely impossible when the 
predicate is altogether incompatible with the subject, as, for instance, 
that a man is a donkey.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must, however, be remembered that since every agent produces an 
effect like itself, to each active power there corresponds a thing 
possible as its proper object according to the nature of that act on 
which its active power is founded; for instance, the power of giving 
warmth is related as to its proper object to the being capable of being 
warmed. The divine existence, however, upon which the nature of power in 
God is founded, is infinite, and is not limited to any genus of being; 
but possesses within itself the perfection of all being. Whence, 
whatsoever has or can have the nature of being, is numbered among the 
absolutely possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent. 
Now nothing is opposed to the idea of being except non-being. Therefore, 
that which implies being and non-being at the same time is repugnant to 
the idea of an absolutely possible thing, within the scope of the divine 
omnipotence. For such cannot come under the divine omnipotence, not 
because of any defect in the power of God, but because it has not the 
nature of a feasible or possible thing.  Therefore, everything that does 
not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible 
things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever 
implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine 
omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it 
is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do 
them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: "No word 
shall be impossible with God." For whatever implies a contradiction 
cannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God is said to be omnipotent in respect to His active 
power, not to passive power, as was shown above (<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Whence the fact 
that He is immovable or impassible is not repugnant to His omnipotence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To sin is to fall short of a perfect action; hence to be 
able to sin is to be able to fall short in action, which is repugnant to 
omnipotence. Therefore it is that God cannot sin, because of His 
omnipotence. Nevertheless, the Philosopher says (Topic. iv, 3) that God 
can deliberately do what is evil. But this must be understood either on a 
condition, the antecedent of which is impossible---as, for instance, if 
we were to say that God can do evil things if He will. For there is no 
reason why a conditional proposition should not be true, though both the 
antecedent and consequent are impossible: as if one were to say: "If man 
is a donkey, he has four feet." Or he may be understood to mean that God 
can do some things which now seem to be evil: which, however, if He did 
them, would then be good. Or he is, perhaps, speaking after the common 
manner of the heathen, who thought that men became gods, like Jupiter or 
Mercury.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God's omnipotence is particularly shown in sparing and 
having mercy, because in this is it made manifest that God has supreme 
power, that He freely forgives sins. For it is not for one who is bound 
by laws of a superior to forgive sins of his own free will. Or, because 
by sparing and having mercy upon men, He leads them on to the 
participation of an infinite good; which is the ultimate effect of the 
divine power. Or because, as was said above (<A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the effect of 
the divine mercy is the foundation of all the divine works. For nothing 
is due to anyone, except on account of something already given him 
gratuitously by God. In this way the divine omnipotence is particularly 
made manifest, because to it pertains the first foundation of all good 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The absolute possible is not so called in reference either 
to higher causes, or to inferior causes, but in reference to itself. But 
the possible in reference to some power is named possible in reference to 
its proximate cause. Hence those things which it belongs to God alone to 
do immediately---as, for example, to create, to justify, and the 
like---are said to be possible in reference to a higher cause. Those 
things, however, which are of such kind as to be done by inferior causes 
are said to be possible in reference to those inferior causes. For it is 
according to the condition of the proximate cause that the effect  has 
contingency or necessity, as was shown above (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Thus is 
it that the wisdom of the world is deemed foolish, because what is 
impossible to nature, it judges to be impossible to God. So it is clear 
that the omnipotence of God does not take away from things their 
impossibility and necessity.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God can make the past not to have been. For what is 
impossible in itself is much more impossible than that which is only 
impossible accidentally. But God can do what is impossible in itself, as 
to give sight to the blind, or to raise the dead. Therefore, and much 
more can He do what is only impossible accidentally. Now for the past not 
to have been is impossible accidentally: thus for Socrates not to be 
running is accidentally impossible, from the fact that his running is a 
thing of the past. Therefore God can make the past not to have been.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what God could do, He can do now, since His power is not 
lessened. But God could have effected, before Socrates ran, that he 
should not run. Therefore, when he has run, God could effect that he did 
not run.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a more excellent virtue than virginity. But 
God can supply charity that is lost; therefore also lost virginity. 
Therefore He can so effect that what was corrupt should not have been 
corrupt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ep. 22 ad Eustoch.): "Although God can do 
all things, He cannot make a thing that is corrupt not to have been 
corrupted." Therefore, for the same reason, He cannot effect that 
anything else which is past should not have been.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), there does not fall under 
the scope of God's omnipotence anything that implies a contradiction. Now 
that the past should not have been implies a contradiction. For as it 
implies a contradiction to say that Socrates is sitting, and is not 
sitting, so does it to say that he sat, and did not sit. But to say that 
he did sit is to say that it happened in the past. To say that he did not 
sit, is to say that it did not happen. Whence, that the past should not 
have been, does not come under the scope of divine power. This is what 
Augustine means when he says (Contra Faust. xxix, 5): "Whosoever says, If 
God is almighty, let Him make what is done as if it were not done, does 
not see that this is to say: If God is almighty let Him effect that what 
is true, by the very fact that it is true, be false": and the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. vi, 2): "Of this one thing alone is God deprived---namely, 
to make undone the things that have been done."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although it is impossible accidentally for the past not to 
have been, if one considers the past thing itself, as, for instance, the 
running of Socrates; nevertheless, if the past thing is considered as 
past, that it should not have been is  impossible, not only in itself, 
but absolutely since it implies a contradiction. Thus, it is more 
impossible than the raising of the dead; in which there is nothing 
contradictory, because this is reckoned impossible in reference to some 
power, that is to say, some natural power; for such impossible things do 
come beneath the scope of divine power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As God, in accordance with the perfection of the divine 
power, can do all things, and yet some things are not subject to His 
power, because they fall short of being possible; so, also, if we regard 
the immutability of the divine power, whatever God could do, He can do 
now. Some things, however, at one time were in the nature of possibility, 
whilst they were yet to be done, which now fall short of the nature of 
possibility, when they have been done. So is God said not to be able to 
do them, because they themselves cannot be done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God can remove all corruption of the mind and body from a 
woman who has fallen; but the fact that she had been corrupt cannot be 
removed from her; as also is it impossible that the fact of having sinned 
or having lost charity thereby can be removed from the sinner.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God cannot do other than what He does. For God 
cannot do what He has not foreknown and pre-ordained that He would do. 
But He neither foreknew nor pre-ordained that He would do anything except 
what He does. Therefore He cannot do except what He does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God can only do what ought to be done and what is right 
to be done. But God is not bound to do what He does not; nor is it right 
that He should do what He does not. Therefore He cannot do except what He 
does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God cannot do anything that is not good and befitting 
creation. But it is not good for creatures nor befitting them to be 
otherwise than as they are. Therefore God cannot do except what He does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said: "Thinkest thou that I cannot ask My Father, 
and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of angels?" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A53">Mt. 26:53</a>). But He neither asked for them, nor did His Father show them to 
refute the Jews. Therefore God can do what He does not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In this matter certain persons erred in two ways. Some 
laid it down that God acts from natural necessity in such way that as 
from the action of nature nothing else can happen beyond what actually 
takes place---as, for instance, from the seed of man, a man must come, 
and from that of an olive, an olive; so from the divine operation there 
could not result other things, nor  another order of things, than that 
which now is. But we showed above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that God does not act 
from natural necessity, but that His will is the cause of all things; nor 
is that will naturally and from any necessity determined to those things. 
Whence in no way at all is the present course of events produced by God 
from any necessity, so that other things could not happen. Others, 
however, said that the divine power is restricted to this present course 
of events through the order of the divine wisdom and justice without 
which God does nothing. But since the power of God, which is His essence, 
is nothing else but His wisdom, it can indeed be fittingly said that 
there is nothing in the divine power which is not in the order of the 
divine wisdom; for the divine wisdom includes the whole potency of the 
divine power. Yet the order placed in creation by divine wisdom, in which 
order the notion of His justice consists, as said above (<A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="FP021.html#FPQ21A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), is 
not so adequate to the divine wisdom that the divine wisdom should be 
restricted to this present order of things. Now it is clear that the 
whole idea of order which a wise man puts into things made by him is 
taken from their end. So, when the end is proportionate to the things 
made for that end, the wisdom of the maker is restricted to some definite 
order. But the divine goodness is an end exceeding beyond all proportion 
things created. Whence the divine wisdom is not so restricted to any 
particular order that no other course of events could happen. Wherefore 
we must simply say that God can do other things than those He has done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In ourselves, in whom power and essence are distinct from 
will and intellect, and again intellect from wisdom, and will from 
justice, there can be something in the power which is not in the just 
will nor in the wise intellect. But in God, power and essence, will and 
intellect, wisdom and justice, are one and the same. Whence, there can be 
nothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His just will or in 
His wise intellect. Nevertheless, because His will cannot be determined 
from necessity to this or that order of things, except upon supposition, 
as was said above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), neither are the wisdom and justice of 
God restricted to this present order, as was shown above; so nothing 
prevents there being something in the divine power which He does not 
will, and which is not included in the order which He has place in 
things. Again, because power is considered as executing, the will as 
commanding, and the intellect and wisdom as directing; what is attributed 
to His power considered in itself, God is said to be able to do in 
accordance with His absolute power. Of such a kind is everything which 
has the nature of being, as was said above (<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). What is, however, 
attributed to the divine power, according as it carries into execution 
the command of a just will, God is said to be able to do by His ordinary 
power. In this manner, we must say that God can do other things by His 
absolute power than those He has foreknown and pre-ordained He would do. 
But it could not happen that He should do anything which He had not 
foreknown, and had not pre-ordained that He would do, because His actual 
doing is subject to His foreknowledge and pre-ordination, though His 
power, which is His nature, is not so. For God does things because He 
wills so to do; yet the power to do them does not come from His will, but 
from  His nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is bound to nobody but Himself. Hence, when it is said 
that God can only do what He ought, nothing else is meant by this than 
that God can do nothing but what is befitting to Himself, and just. But 
these words "befitting" and "just" may be understood in two ways: one, in 
direct connection with the verb "is"; and thus they would be restricted 
to the present order of things; and would concern His power. Then what is 
said in the objection is false; for the sense is that God can do nothing 
except what is now fitting and just. If, however, they be joined directly 
with the verb "can" (which has the effect of extending the meaning), and 
then secondly with "is," the present will be signified, but in a confused 
and general way. The sentence would then be true in this sense: "God 
cannot do anything except that which, if He did it, would be suitable and 
just."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although this order of things be restricted to what now 
exists, the divine power and wisdom are not thus restricted. Whence, 
although no other order would be suitable and good to the things which 
now are, yet God can do other things and impose upon them another order.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God cannot do better than He does. For whatever God 
does, He does in a most powerful and wise way. But a thing is so much the 
better done as it is more powerfully and wisely done. Therefore God 
cannot do anything better than He does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine thus argues (Contra Maximin. iii, 8): "If God 
could, but would not, beget a Son His equal, He would have been envious." 
For the same reason, if God could have made better things than He has 
done, but was not willing so to do, He would have been envious. But envy 
is far removed from God. Therefore God makes everything of the best. He 
cannot therefore make anything better than He does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is very good and the best of all cannot be 
bettered; because nothing is better than the best. But as Augustine says 
(Enchiridion 10), "each thing that God has made is good, and, taken all 
together they are very good; because in them all consists the wondrous 
beauty of the universe." Therefore the good in the universe could not be 
made better by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Christ as man is full of grace and truth, and has the 
Spirit without measure; and so He cannot be better. Again created 
happiness is described as the highest good, and thus cannot be better. 
And the Blessed Virgin Mary is raised above all the choirs of angels, and 
so cannot be better than she is. God cannot therefore make all things 
better than He has made them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++3%3A20">Eph. 3:20</a>): "God is able to do  all things 
more abundantly than we desire or understand."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The goodness of anything is twofold; one, which is of the 
essence of it---thus, for instance, to be rational pertains to the 
essence of man. As regards this good, God cannot make a thing better than 
it is itself; although He can make another thing better than it; even as 
He cannot make the number four greater than it is; because if it were 
greater it would no longer be four, but another number. For the addition 
of a substantial difference in definitions is after the manner of the 
addition of unity of numbers (Metaph. viii, 10). Another kind of goodness 
is that which is over and above the essence; thus, the good of a man is 
to be virtuous or wise. As regards this kind of goodness, God can make 
better the things He has made. Absolutely speaking, however, God can make 
something else better than each thing made by Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When it is said that God can make a thing better than He 
makes it, if "better" is taken substantively, this proposition is true. 
For He can always make something else better than each individual thing: 
and He can make the same thing in one way better than it is, and in 
another way not; as was explained above. If, however, "better" is taken 
as an adverb, implying the manner of the making; thus God cannot make 
anything better than He makes it, because He cannot make it from greater 
wisdom and goodness. But if it implies the manner of the thing done, He 
can make something better; because He can give to things made by Him a 
better manner of existence as regards the accidents, although not as 
regards the substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is of the nature of a son that he should be equal to his 
father, when he comes to maturity. But it is not of the nature of 
anything created, that it should be better than it was made by God. Hence 
the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The universe, the present creation being supposed, cannot 
be better, on account of the most beautiful order given to things by God; 
in which the good of the universe consists. For if any one thing were 
bettered, the proportion of order would be destroyed; as if one string 
were stretched more than it ought to be, the melody of the harp would be 
destroyed. Yet God could make other things, or add something to the 
present creation; and then there would be another and a better universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[25] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The humanity of Christ, from the fact that it is united to 
the Godhead; and created happiness from the fact that it is the fruition 
of God; and the Blessed Virgin from the fact that she is the mother of 
God; have all a certain infinite dignity from the infinite good, which is 
God. And on this account there cannot be anything better than these; just 
as there cannot be anything better than God.<br>
