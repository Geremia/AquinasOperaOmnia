    ON THE THINGS THAT BELONG TO THE SEVENTH DAY (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the things that belong to the seventh day. Under this
    head there are three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP073.html#FPQ73A1THEP1">(1)</a> About the completion of the works;
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP073.html#FPQ73A2THEP1">(2)</a> About the resting of God;</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP073.html#FPQ73A3THEP1">(3)</a> About the blessing and sanctifying
    of this day.

    Whether the completion of the Divine works ought to be ascribed to the
    seventh day?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the completion of the Divine
    works ought not to be ascribed to the seventh day. For all things that are
    done in this world belong to the Divine works. But the consummation of the
    world will be at the end of the world (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++13%3A39,40"
      >Mt. 13:39,40</a
    >). Moreover, the time of Christ's Incarnation is a time of completion,
    wherefore it is called "the time of fulness [*Vulg.: 'the fulness of time']"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A4">Gal. 4:4</a>).
    And Christ Himself, at the moment of His death, cried out, "It is
    consummated" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A30"
      >Jn. 19:30</a
    >). Hence the completion of the Divine works does not belong to the seventh
    day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the completion of a work is an act in
    itself. But we do not read that God acted at all on the seventh day, but
    rather that He rested from all His work. Therefore the completion of the
    works does not belong to the seventh day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is said to be complete to which
    many things are added, unless they are merely superfluous, for a thing is
    called perfect to which nothing is wanting that it ought to possess. But
    many things were made after the seventh day, as the production of many
    individual beings, and even of certain new species that are frequently
    appearing, especially in the case of animals generated from putrefaction.
    Also, God creates daily new souls. Again, the work of the Incarnation was a
    new work, of which it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++31%3A22"
      >Jer. 31:22</a
    >): "The Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth." Miracles also are
    new works, of which it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++36%3A6"
      >Eccles. 36:6</a
    >): "Renew thy signs, and work new miracles." Moreover, all things will be
    made new when the Saints are glorified, according to Apoc. 21:5: "And He
    that sat on the throne said: Behold I make all things new." Therefore the
    completion of the Divine works ought not to be attributed to the seventh
    day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A2"
      >Gn. 2:2</a
    >): "On the seventh day God ended His work which He had made."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The perfection of a thing is twofold, the first
    perfection and the second perfection. The 'first' perfection is that
    according to which a thing is substantially perfect, and this perfection is
    the form of the whole; which form results from the whole having its parts
    complete. But the 'second' perfection is the end, which is either an
    operation, as the end of the harpist is to play the harp; or something that
    is attained by an operation, as the end of the builder is the house that he
    makes by building. But the first perfection is the cause of the second,
    because the form is the principle of operation. Now the final perfection,
    which is the end of the whole universe, is the perfect beatitude of the
    Saints at the consummation of the world; and the first perfection is the
    completeness of the universe at its first founding, and this is what is
    ascribed to the seventh day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The first perfection is the cause of the
    second, as above said. Now for the attaining of beatitude two things are
    required, nature and grace. Therefore, as said above, the perfection of
    beatitude will be at the end of the world. But this consummation existed
    previously in its causes, as to nature, at the first founding of the world,
    as to grace, in the Incarnation of Christ. For, "Grace and truth came by
    Jesus Christ" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A17"
      >Jn. 1:17</a
    >). So, then, on the seventh day was the consummation of nature, in Christ's
    Incarnation the consummation of grace, and at the end of the world will be
    the consummation of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God did act on the seventh day, not by
    creating new creatures, but by directing and moving His creatures to the
    work proper to them, and thus He made some beginning of the "second"
    perfection. So that, according to our version of the Scripture, the
    completion of the works is attributed to the seventh day, though according
    to another it is assigned to the sixth. Either version, however, may stand,
    since the completion of the universe as to the completeness of its parts
    belongs to the sixth day, but its completion as regards their operation, to
    the seventh. It may also be added that in continuous movement, so long as
    any movement further is possible, movement cannot be called completed till
    it comes to rest, for rest denotes consummation of movement. Now God might
    have made many other creatures besides those which He made in the six days,
    and hence, by the fact that He ceased making them on the seventh day, He is
    said on that day to have consummated His work.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing entirely new was afterwards made
    by God, but all things subsequently made had in a sense been made before in
    the work of the six days. Some things, indeed, had a previous experience
    materially, as the rib from the side of Adam out of which God formed Eve;
    whilst others existed not only in matter but also in their causes, as those
    individual creatures that are now generated existed in the first of their
    kind. Species, also, that are new, if any such appear, existed beforehand in
    various active powers; so that animals, and perhaps even new species of
    animals, are produced by putrefaction by the power which the stars and
    elements received at the beginning. Again, animals of new kinds arise
    occasionally from the connection of individuals belonging to different
    species, as the mule is the offspring of an ass and a mare; but even these
    existed previously in their causes, in the works of the six days. Some also
    existed beforehand by way of similitude, as the souls now created. And the
    work of the Incarnation itself was thus foreshadowed, for as we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A7"
      >Phil. 2:7</a
    >), The Son of God "was made in the likeness of men." And again, the glory
    that is spiritual was anticipated in the angels by way of similitude; and
    that of the body in the heaven, especially the empyrean. Hence it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A10"
      >Eccles. 1:10</a
    >), "Nothing under the sun is new, for it hath already gone before, in the
    ages that were before us."<br />

    Whether God rested on the seventh day from all His work?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God did not rest on the
    seventh day from all His work. For it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A17"
      >Jn. 5:17</a
    >), "My Father worketh until now, and I work." God, then, did not rest on
    the seventh day from all His work.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, rest is opposed to movement, or to
    labor, which movement causes. But, as God produced His work without movement
    and without labor, He cannot be said to have rested on the seventh day from
    His work.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, should it be said that God rested on the
    seventh day by causing man to rest; against this it may be argued that rest
    is set down in contradistinction to His work; now the words "God created" or
    "made" this thing or the other cannot be explained to mean that He made man
    create or make these things. Therefore the resting of God cannot be
    explained as His making man to rest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A2"
      >Gn. 2:2</a
    >): "God rested on the seventh day from all the work which He had done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Rest is, properly speaking, opposed to
    movement, and consequently to the labor that arises from movement. But
    although movement, strictly speaking, is a quality of bodies, yet the word
    is applied also to spiritual things, and in a twofold sense. On the one
    hand, every operation may be called a movement, and thus the Divine goodness
    is said to move and go forth to its object, in communicating itself to that
    object, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii). On the other hand, the desire that
    tends to an object outside itself, is said to move towards it. Hence rest is
    taken in two senses, in one sense meaning a cessation from work, in the
    other, the satisfying of desire. Now, in either sense God is said to have
    rested on the seventh day. First, because He ceased from creating new
    creatures on that day, for, as said above (<a href="FP073.html#FPQ73A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3), He made nothing afterwards that had not existed previously, in
    some degree, in the first works; secondly, because He Himself had no need of
    the things that He had made, but was happy in the fruition of Himself.
    Hence, when all things were made He is not said to have rested "in" His
    works, as though needing them for His own happiness, but to have rested
    "from" them, as in fact resting in Himself, as He suffices for Himself and
    fulfils His own desire. And even though from all eternity He rested in
    Himself, yet the rest in Himself, which He took after He had finished His
    works, is that rest which belongs to the seventh day. And this, says
    Augustine, is the meaning of God's resting from His works on that day (Gen.
    ad lit. iv).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God indeed "worketh until now" by
    preserving and providing for the creatures He has made, but not by the
    making of new ones.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Rest is here not opposed to labor or to
    movement, but to the production of new creatures, and to the desire tending
    to an external object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even as God rests in Himself alone and
    is happy in the enjoyment of Himself, so our own sole happiness lies in the
    enjoyment of God. Thus, also, He makes us find rest in Himself, both from
    His works and our own. It is not, then, unreasonable to say that God rested
    in giving rest to us. Still, this explanation must not be set down as the
    only one, and the other is the first and principal explanation.<br />

    Whether blessing and sanctifying are due to the seventh day?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that blessing and sanctifying are
    not due to the seventh day. For it is usual to call a time blessed or holy
    for that some good thing has happened in it, or some evil been avoided. But
    whether God works or ceases from work nothing accrues to Him or is lost to
    Him. Therefore no special blessing or sanctifying are due to the seventh
    day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Latin "benedictio" [blessing] is
    derived from "bonitas" [goodness]. But it is the nature of good to spread
    and communicate itself, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). The days,
    therefore, in which God produced creatures deserved a blessing rather than
    the day on which He ceased producing them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, over each creature a blessing was
    pronounced, as upon each work it was said, "God saw that it was good."
    Therefore it was not necessary that after all had been produced, the seventh
    day should be blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A3"
      >Gn. 2:3</a
    >), "God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had
    rested from all His work."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As said above (<a
      href="FP073.html#FPQ73A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), God's rest on the seventh day is understood in two ways. First, in that
    He ceased from producing new works, though He still preserves and provides
    for the creatures He has made. Secondly, in that after all His works He
    rested in Himself. According to the first meaning, then, a blessing befits
    the seventh day, since, as we explained (<a href="FP072.html#FPQ72OUTP1"
      >Question [72]</a
    >, ad 4), the blessing referred to the increase by multiplication; for which
    reason God said to the creatures which He blessed: "Increase and multiply."
    Now, this increase is effected through God's Providence over His creatures,
    securing the generation of like from like. And according to the second
    meaning, it is right that the seventh day should have been sanctified, since
    the special sanctification of every creature consists in resting in God. For
    this reason things dedicated to God are said to be sanctified.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The seventh day is said to be sanctified
    not because anything can accrue to God, or be taken from Him, but because
    something is added to creatures by their multiplying, and by their resting
    in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the first six days creatures were
    produced in their first causes, but after being thus produced, they are
    multiplied and preserved, and this work also belongs to the Divine goodness.
    And the perfection of this goodness is made most clear by the knowledge that
    in it alone God finds His own rest, and we may find ours in its fruition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The good mentioned in the works of each
    day belongs to the first institution of nature; but the blessing attached to
    the seventh day, to its propagation.<br />
