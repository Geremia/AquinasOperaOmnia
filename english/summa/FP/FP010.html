<H3 Align="Left">Whether this is a good definition of eternity, "The simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life"?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the definition of eternity given by Boethius (De 
Consol. v) is not a good one: "Eternity is the simultaneously-whole and 
perfect possession of interminable life." For the word "interminable" is 
a negative one. But negation only belongs to what is defective, and this 
does not belong to eternity. Therefore in the definition of eternity the 
word "interminable" ought not to be found.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, eternity signifies a certain kind of duration. But 
duration regards existence rather than life. Therefore the word "life" 
ought not to come into the definition of eternity; but rather the word 
"existence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a whole is what has parts. But this is alien to eternity 
which is simple. Therefore it is improperly said to be "whole."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Many days cannot occur together, nor can many times exist all at 
once. But in eternity, days and times are in the plural, for it is said, 
"His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Micah+5%3A2">Micah 5:2</a>); and also it is said, "According to the revelation of the mystery 
hidden from eternity" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++16%3A25">Rm. 16:25</a>). Therefore eternity is not 
omni-simultaneous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the whole and the perfect are the same thing. Supposing, 
therefore, that it is "whole," it is superfluously described as "perfect."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, duration does not imply "possession." But eternity is a 
kind of duration. Therefore eternity is not possession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As we attain to the knowledge of simple things by way of 
compound things, so must we reach to the knowledge of eternity by means 
of time, which is nothing but the numbering of movement by "before" and 
"after." For since succession occurs in every movement, and one part 
comes after another, the fact that we reckon before and after in 
movement, makes us apprehend time, which is nothing else but the measure 
of before and after in movement.  Now in a thing bereft of movement, 
which is always the same, there is no before or after. As therefore the 
idea of time consists in the numbering of before and after in movement; 
so likewise in the apprehension of the uniformity of what is outside of 
movement, consists the idea of eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, those things are said to be measured by time which have a 
beginning and an end in time, because in everything which is moved there 
is a beginning, and there is an end. But as whatever is wholly immutable 
can have no succession, so it has no beginning, and no end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus eternity is known from two sources: first, because what is eternal 
is interminable---that is, has no beginning nor end (that is, no term 
either way); secondly, because eternity has no succession, being 
simultaneously whole.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Simple things are usually defined by way of negation; as "a 
point is that which has no parts." Yet this is not to be taken as if the 
negation belonged to their essence, but because our intellect which first 
apprehends compound things, cannot attain to the knowledge of simple 
things except by removing the opposite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What is truly eternal, is not only being, but also living; 
and life extends to operation, which is not true of being. Now the 
protraction of duration seems to belong to operation rather than to 
being; hence time is the numbering of movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Eternity is called whole, not because it has parts, but 
because it is wanting in nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As God, although incorporeal, is named in Scripture 
metaphorically by corporeal names, so eternity though simultaneously 
whole, is called by names implying time and succession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Two things are to be considered in time: time itself, which 
is successive; and the "now" of time, which is imperfect. Hence the 
expression "simultaneously-whole" is used to remove the idea of time, and 
the word "perfect" is used to exclude the "now" of time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Whatever is possessed, is held firmly and quietly; 
therefore to designate the immutability and permanence of eternity, we 
use the word "possession."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is eternal?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not eternal. For nothing made can be 
predicated of God; for Boethius says (De Trin. iv) that, "The now that 
flows away makes time, the now that stands still makes eternity;" and 
Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 28) "that God is the author of 
eternity." Therefore God is not eternal. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is before eternity, and after eternity, is not 
measured by eternity. But, as Aristotle says (De Causis), "God is before 
eternity and He is after eternity": for it is written that "the Lord 
shall reign for eternity, and beyond [*Douay: 'for ever and ever']" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++15%3A18">Ex. 15:18</a>). Therefore to be eternal does not belong to God.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, eternity is a kind of measure. But to be measured 
belongs not to God. Therefore it does not belong to Him to be eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in eternity, there is no present, past or future, since 
it is simultaneously whole; as was said in the preceding article. But 
words denoting present, past and future time are applied to God in 
Scripture. Therefore God is not eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Athanasius says in his Creed: "The Father is eternal, 
the Son is eternal, the Holy Ghost is eternal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The idea of eternity follows immutability, as the idea of 
time follows movement, as appears from the preceding article. Hence, as 
God is supremely immutable, it supremely belongs to Him to be eternal. 
Nor is He eternal only; but He is His own eternity; whereas, no other 
being is its own duration, as no other is its own being. Now God is His 
own uniform being; and hence as He is His own essence, so He is His own 
eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The "now" that stands still, is said to make eternity 
according to our apprehension. As the apprehension of time is caused in 
us by the fact that we apprehend the flow of the "now," so the 
apprehension of eternity is caused in us by our apprehending the "now" 
standing still. When Augustine says that "God is the author of eternity," 
this is to be understood of participated eternity. For God communicates 
His eternity to some in the same way as He communicates His immutability.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From this appears the answer to the Second Objection. For 
God is said to be before eternity, according as it is shared by 
immaterial substances. Hence, also, in the same book, it is said that 
"intelligence is equal to eternity." In the words of Exodus, "The Lord 
shall reign for eternity, and beyond," eternity stands for age, as 
another rendering has it. Thus it is said that the Lord will reign beyond 
eternity, inasmuch as He endures beyond every age, i.e. beyond every kind 
of duration. For age is nothing more than the period of each thing, as is 
said in the book De Coelo i. Or to reign beyond eternity can be taken to 
mean that if any other thing were conceived to exist for ever, as the 
movement of the heavens according to some philosophers, then God would 
still reign beyond, inasmuch as His reign is simultaneously whole.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Eternity is nothing else but God Himself. Hence God is not 
called eternal, as if He were in any way measured; but  the idea of 
measurement is there taken according to the apprehension of our mind 
alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Words denoting different times are applied to God, because 
His eternity includes all times; not as if He Himself were altered 
through present, past and future.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to God alone to be eternal. For 
it is written that "those who instruct many to justice," shall be "as 
stars unto perpetual eternities [*Douay: 'for all eternity']" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++12%3A3">Dan. 12:3</a>). Now if God alone were eternal, there could not be many eternities. 
Therefore God alone is not the only eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written "Depart, ye cursed into eternal [Douay: 
'everlasting'] fire" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++25%3A41">Mt. 25:41</a>). Therefore God is not the only eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every necessary thing is eternal. But there are many 
necessary things; as, for instance, all principles of demonstration and 
all demonstrative propositions. Therefore God is not the only eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ep. ad Damasum. xv) that "God is the only 
one who has no beginning." Now whatever has a beginning, is not eternal. 
Therefore God is the only one eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Eternity truly and properly so called is in God alone, 
because eternity follows on immutability; as appears from the first 
article. But God alone is altogether immutable, as was shown above (<A Href="FP009.html#FPQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FP009.html#FPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Accordingly, however, as some receive immutability from Him, they 
share in His eternity. Thus some receive immutability from God in the way 
of never ceasing to exist; in that sense it is said of the earth, "it 
standeth for ever" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++1%3A4">Eccles. 1:4</a>). Again, some things are called eternal 
in Scripture because of the length of their duration, although they are 
in nature corruptible; thus (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++75%3A5">Ps. 75:5</a>) the hills are called "eternal" and 
we read "of the fruits of the eternal hills." (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++33%3A15">Dt. 33:15</a>). Some again, 
share more fully than others in the nature of eternity, inasmuch as they 
possess unchangeableness either in being or further still in operation; 
like the angels, and the blessed, who enjoy the Word, because "as regards 
that vision of the Word, no changing thoughts exist in the Saints," as 
Augustine says (De Trin. xv). Hence those who see God are said to have 
eternal life; according to that text, "This is eternal life, that they 
may know Thee the only true God," etc. (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++17%3A3">Jn. 17:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are said to be many eternities, accordingly as many 
share in eternity, by the contemplation of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fire of hell is called eternal, only because  it never 
ends. Still, there is change in the pains of the lost, according to the 
words "To extreme heat they will pass from snowy waters" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+24%3A19">Job 24:19</a>). 
Hence in hell true eternity does not exist, but rather time; according to 
the text of the Psalm "Their time will be for ever" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++80%3A16">Ps. 80:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Necessary means a certain mode of truth; and truth, 
according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vi), is in the mind. Therefore in 
this sense the true and necessary are eternal, because they are in the 
eternal mind, which is the divine intellect alone; hence it does not 
follow that anything beside God is eternal.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether eternity differs from time?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that eternity does not differ from time. For two 
measures of duration cannot exist together, unless one is part of the 
other; for instance two days or two hours cannot be together; 
nevertheless, we may say that a day or an hour are together, considering 
hour as part of a day. But eternity and time occur together, each of 
which imports a certain measure of duration. Since therefore eternity is 
not a part of time, forasmuch as eternity exceeds time, and includes it, 
it seems that time is a part of eternity, and is not a different thing 
from eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv), the "now" of 
time remains the same in the whole of time. But the nature of eternity 
seems to be that it is the same indivisible thing in the whole space of 
time. Therefore eternity is the "now" of time. But the "now" of time is 
not substantially different from time. Therefore eternity is not 
substantially different from time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the measure of the first movement is the measure of 
every movement, as said in Phys. iv, it thus appears that the measure of 
the first being is that of every being. But eternity is the measure of 
the first being---that is, of the divine being. Therefore eternity is the 
measure of every being. But the being of things corruptible is measured 
by time. Time therefore is either eternity or is a part of eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Eternity is simultaneously whole. But time has a 
"before" and an "after." Therefore time and eternity are not the same 
thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is manifest that time and eternity are not the same. 
Some have founded this difference on the fact that eternity has neither 
beginning nor an end; whereas time has a beginning and an end. This, 
however, makes a merely accidental, and not an absolute difference 
because, granted that time always was and always will be, according to 
the idea of those who think the movement of the heavens goes on for ever, 
there would yet remain a difference between eternity and time, as 
Boethius says (De Consol. v), arising from the fact that eternity is 
simultaneously whole; which cannot be applied to time: for eternity is 
the measure of a  permanent being; while time is a measure of movement. 
Supposing, however, that the aforesaid difference be considered on the 
part of the things measured, and not as regards the measures, then there 
is some reason for it, inasmuch as that alone is measured by time which 
has beginning and end in time. Hence, if the movement of the heavens 
lasted always, time would not be of its measure as regards the whole of 
its duration, since the infinite is not measurable; but it would be the 
measure of that part of its revolution which has beginning and end in 
time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason for the same can be taken from these measures in 
themselves, if we consider the end and the beginning as potentialities; 
because, granted also that time always goes on, yet it is possible to 
note in time both the beginning and the end, by considering its parts: 
thus we speak of the beginning and the end of a day or of a year; which 
cannot be applied to eternity. Still these differences follow upon the 
essential and primary differences, that eternity is simultaneously whole, 
but that time is not so.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such a reason would be a valid one if time and eternity 
were the same kind of measure; but this is seen not to be the case when 
we consider those things of which the respective measures are time and 
eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The "now" of time is the same as regards its subject in the 
whole course of time, but it differs in aspect; for inasmuch as time 
corresponds to movement, its "now" corresponds to what is movable; and 
the thing movable has the same one subject in all time, but differs in 
aspect a being here and there; and such alteration is movement. Likewise 
the flow of the "now" as alternating in aspect is time. But eternity 
remains the same according to both subject and aspect; and hence eternity 
is not the same as the "now" of time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As eternity is the proper measure of permanent being, so 
time is the proper measure of movement; and hence, according as any being 
recedes from permanence of being, and is subject to change, it recedes 
from eternity, and is subject to time. Therefore the being of things 
corruptible, because it is changeable, is not measured by eternity, but 
by time; for time measures not only things actually changed, but also 
things changeable; hence it not only measures movement but it also 
measures repose, which belongs to whatever is naturally movable, but is 
not actually in motion.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that aeviternity is the same as time. For Augustine says 
(Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22,23), that "God moves the spiritual through 
time." But aeviternity is said to be the measure of spiritual substances. 
Therefore time is the same as aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is essential to time to have "before" and "after"; 
but it is essential to eternity to be simultaneously whole, as was shown 
above in the first article. Now aeviternity is not eternity; for it is 
written (Ecclus. 1:1) that eternal "Wisdom is before age." Therefore it 
is not simultaneously whole but has "before" and "after"; and thus it is 
the same as time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there is no "before" and "after" in aeviternity, it 
follows that in aeviternal things there is no difference between being, 
having been, or going to be. Since then it is impossible for aeviternal 
things not to have been, it follows that it is impossible for them not to 
be in the future; which is false, since God can reduce them to nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, since the duration of aeviternal things is infinite as 
to subsequent duration, if aeviternity is simultaneously whole, it 
follows that some creature is actually infinite; which is impossible. 
Therefore aeviternity does not differ from time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. iii) "Who commandest time to 
be separate from aeviternity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Aeviternity differs from time, and from eternity, as the 
mean between them both. This difference is explained by some to consist 
in the fact that eternity has neither beginning nor end, aeviternity, a 
beginning but no end, and time both beginning and end. This difference, 
however, is but an accidental one, as was shown above, in the preceding 
article; because even if aeviternal things had always been, and would 
always be, as some think, and even if they might sometimes fail to be, 
which is possible to God to allow; even granted this, aeviternity would 
still be distinguished from eternity, and from time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others assign the difference between these three to consist in the fact 
that eternity has no "before" and "after"; but that time has both, 
together with innovation and veteration; and that aeviternity has 
"before" and "after" without innovation and veteration. This theory, 
however, involves a contradiction; which manifestly appears if innovation 
and veteration be referred to the measure itself. For since "before" and 
"after" of duration cannot exist together, if aeviternity has "before" 
and "after," it must follow that with the receding of the first part of 
aeviternity, the after part of aeviternity must newly appear; and thus 
innovation would occur in aeviternity itself, as it does in time. And if 
they be referred to the things measured, even then an incongruity would 
follow. For a thing which exists in time grows old with time, because it 
has a changeable existence, and from the changeableness of a thing 
measured, there follows "before" and "after" in the measure, as is clear 
from Phys. iv. Therefore the fact that an aeviternal thing is neither 
inveterate, nor subject to innovation, comes from its changelessness; and 
consequently its measure does not contain "before" and "after." We say 
then that since eternity is the measure of a permanent being, in so far 
as anything recedes  from permanence of being, it recedes from eternity. 
Now some things recede from permanence of being, so that their being is 
subject to change, or consists in change; and these things are measured 
by time, as are all movements, and also the being of all things 
corruptible. But others recede less from permanence of being, forasmuch 
as their being neither consists in change, nor is the subject of change; 
nevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually or 
potentially. This appears in the heavenly bodies, the substantial being 
of which is unchangeable; and yet with unchangeable being they have 
changeableness of place. The same applies to the angels, who have an 
unchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards 
choice; moreover they have changeableness of intelligence, of affections 
and of places in their own degree. Therefore these are measured by 
aeviternity which is a mean between eternity and time. But the being that 
is measured by eternity is not changeable, nor is it annexed to change. 
In this way time has "before" and "after"; aeviternity in itself has no 
"before" and "after," which can, however, be annexed to it; while 
eternity has neither "before" nor "after," nor is it compatible with such 
at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Spiritual creatures as regards successive affections and 
intelligences are measured by time. Hence also Augustine says (Gen. ad 
lit. viii, 20,22,23) that to be moved through time, is to be moved by 
affections. But as regards their nature they are measured by aeviternity; 
whereas as regards the vision of glory, they have a share of eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Aeviternity is simultaneously whole; yet it is not 
eternity, because "before" and "after" are compatible with it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the very being of an angel considered absolutely, there 
is no difference of past and future, but only as regards accidental 
change. Now to say that an angel was, or is, or will be, is to be taken 
in a different sense according to the acceptation of our intellect, which 
apprehends the angelic existence by comparison with different parts of 
time. But when we say that an angel is, or was, we suppose something, 
which being supposed, its opposite is not subject to the divine power. 
Whereas when we say he will be, we do not as yet suppose anything. Hence, 
since the existence and non-existence of an angel considered absolutely 
is subject to the divine power, God can make the existence of an angel 
not future; but He cannot cause him not to be while he is, or not to have 
been, after he has been.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The duration of aeviternity is infinite, forasmuch as it is 
not finished by time. Hence, there is no incongruity in saying that a 
creature is infinite, inasmuch as it is not ended by any other creature.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there is not only one aeviternity; for it  is 
written in the apocryphal books of Esdras: "Majesty and power of ages are 
with Thee, O Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, different genera have different measures. But some 
aeviternal things belong to the corporeal genus, as the heavenly bodies; 
and others are spiritual substances, as are the angels. Therefore there 
is not only one aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since aeviternity is a term of duration, where there is 
one aeviternity, there is also one duration. But not all aeviternal 
things have one duration, for some begin to exist after others; as 
appears in the case especially of human souls. Therefore there is not 
only one aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, things not dependent on each other do not seem to have 
one measure of duration; for there appears to be one time for all 
temporal things; since the first movement, measured by time, is in some 
way the cause of all movement. But aeviternal things do not depend on 
each other, for one angel is not the cause of another angel. Therefore 
there is not only one aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Aeviternity is a more simple thing than time, and is 
nearer to eternity. But time is one only. Therefore much more is 
aeviternity one only.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A twofold opinion exists on this subject. Some say there 
is only one aeviternity; others that there are many aeviternities. Which 
of these is true, may be considered from the cause why time is one; for 
we can rise from corporeal things to the knowledge of spiritual things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now some say that there is only one time for temporal things, forasmuch 
as one number exists for all things numbered; as time is a number, 
according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv). This, however, is not a 
sufficient reason; because time is not a number abstracted from the thing 
numbered, but existing in the thing numbered; otherwise it would not be 
continuous; for ten ells of cloth are continuous not by reason of the 
number, but by reason of the thing numbered. Now number as it exists in 
the thing numbered, is not the same for all; but it is different for 
different things. Hence, others assert that the unity of eternity as the 
principle of all duration is the cause of the unity of time. Thus all 
durations are one in that view, in the light of their principle, but are 
many in the light of the diversity of things receiving duration from the 
influx of the first principle. On the other hand others assign primary 
matter as the cause why time is one; as it is the first subject of 
movement, the measure of which is time. Neither of these reasons, 
however, is sufficient; forasmuch as things which are one in principle, 
or in subject, especially if distant, are not one absolutely, but 
accidentally. Therefore the true reason why time is one, is to be found 
in the oneness of the first movement by which, since it is most simple, 
all other movements are measured. Therefore time is referred to that 
movement, not only as a measure is to the thing measured, but also as 
accident is to subject; and  thus receives unity from it. Whereas to 
other movements it is compared only as the measure is to the thing 
measured. Hence it is not multiplied by their multitude, because by one 
separate measure many things can be measured.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This being established, we must observe that a twofold opinion existed 
concerning spiritual substances. Some said that all proceeded from God in 
a certain equality, as Origen said (Peri Archon. i); or at least many of 
them, as some others thought. Others said that all spiritual substances 
proceeded from God in a certain degree and order; and Dionysius (Coel. 
Hier. x) seems to have thought so, when he said that among spiritual 
substances there are the first, the middle and the last; even in one 
order of angels. Now according to the first opinion, it must be said that 
there are many aeviternities as there are many aeviternal things of first 
degree. But according to the second opinion, it would be necessary to say 
that there is one aeviternity only; because since each thing is measured 
by the most simple element of its genus, it must be that the existence of 
all aeviternal things should be measured by the existence of the first 
aeviternal thing, which is all the more simple the nearer it is to the 
first. Wherefore because the second opinion is truer, as will be shown 
later (<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); we concede at present that there is only one 
aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Aeviternity is sometimes taken for age, that is, a space of 
a thing's duration; and thus we say many aeviternities when we mean ages.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the heavenly bodies and spiritual things differ in 
the genus of their nature, still they agree in having a changeless being, 
and are thus measured by aeviternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All temporal things did not begin together; nevertheless 
there is one time for all of them, by reason of the first measured by 
time; and thus all aeviternal things have one aeviternity by reason of 
the first, though all did not begin together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[10] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> For things to be measured by one, it is not necessary that 
the one should be the cause of all, but that it be more simple than the 
rest.<br>
