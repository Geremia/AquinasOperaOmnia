  <p>
    We must now consider the eternity of God, concerning which arise six points
    of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is eternity?</p>
  <p><a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether God is eternal?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether to be eternal belongs to
    God alone?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether eternity differs from
    time?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP010.html#FPQ10A5THEP1">(5)</a> The difference of aeviternity, as
    there is one time, and one eternity?<br />

    Whether this is a good definition of eternity, "The simultaneously-whole and
    perfect possession of interminable life"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the definition of eternity given by
    Boethius (De Consol. v) is not a good one: "Eternity is the
    simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life." For the
    word "interminable" is a negative one. But negation only belongs to what is
    defective, and this does not belong to eternity. Therefore in the definition
    of eternity the word "interminable" ought not to be found.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, eternity signifies a certain kind of
    duration. But duration regards existence rather than life. Therefore the
    word "life" ought not to come into the definition of eternity; but rather
    the word "existence."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a whole is what has parts. But this is
    alien to eternity which is simple. Therefore it is improperly said to be
    "whole."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Many days cannot occur together, nor can many
    times exist all at once. But in eternity, days and times are in the plural,
    for it is said, "His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of
    eternity" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Micah+5%3A2"
      >Micah 5:2</a
    >); and also it is said, "According to the revelation of the mystery hidden
    from eternity" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++16%3A25"
      >Rm. 16:25</a
    >). Therefore eternity is not omni-simultaneous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the whole and the perfect are the same
    thing. Supposing, therefore, that it is "whole," it is superfluously
    described as "perfect."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, duration does not imply "possession."
    But eternity is a kind of duration. Therefore eternity is not possession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we attain to the knowledge of simple things
    by way of compound things, so must we reach to the knowledge of eternity by
    means of time, which is nothing but the numbering of movement by "before"
    and "after." For since succession occurs in every movement, and one part
    comes after another, the fact that we reckon before and after in movement,
    makes us apprehend time, which is nothing else but the measure of before and
    after in movement. Now in a thing bereft of movement, which is always the
    same, there is no before or after. As therefore the idea of time consists in
    the numbering of before and after in movement; so likewise in the
    apprehension of the uniformity of what is outside of movement, consists the
    idea of eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, those things are said to be measured by time which have a beginning
    and an end in time, because in everything which is moved there is a
    beginning, and there is an end. But as whatever is wholly immutable can have
    no succession, so it has no beginning, and no end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus eternity is known from two sources: first, because what is eternal is
    interminable---that is, has no beginning nor end (that is, no term either
    way); secondly, because eternity has no succession, being simultaneously
    whole.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Simple things are usually defined by way
    of negation; as "a point is that which has no parts." Yet this is not to be
    taken as if the negation belonged to their essence, but because our
    intellect which first apprehends compound things, cannot attain to the
    knowledge of simple things except by removing the opposite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What is truly eternal, is not only
    being, but also living; and life extends to operation, which is not true of
    being. Now the protraction of duration seems to belong to operation rather
    than to being; hence time is the numbering of movement.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Eternity is called whole, not because it
    has parts, but because it is wanting in nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As God, although incorporeal, is named
    in Scripture metaphorically by corporeal names, so eternity though
    simultaneously whole, is called by names implying time and succession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Two things are to be considered in time:
    time itself, which is successive; and the "now" of time, which is imperfect.
    Hence the expression "simultaneously-whole" is used to remove the idea of
    time, and the word "perfect" is used to exclude the "now" of time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Whatever is possessed, is held firmly
    and quietly; therefore to designate the immutability and permanence of
    eternity, we use the word "possession."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is eternal?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not eternal. For nothing
    made can be predicated of God; for Boethius says (De Trin. iv) that, "The
    now that flows away makes time, the now that stands still makes eternity;"
    and Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 28) "that God is the author of
    eternity." Therefore God is not eternal.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is before eternity, and after
    eternity, is not measured by eternity. But, as Aristotle says (De Causis),
    "God is before eternity and He is after eternity": for it is written that
    "the Lord shall reign for eternity, and beyond [*Douay: 'for ever and
    ever']" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++15%3A18"
      >Ex. 15:18</a
    >). Therefore to be eternal does not belong to God.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, eternity is a kind of measure. But to be
    measured belongs not to God. Therefore it does not belong to Him to be
    eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in eternity, there is no present, past
    or future, since it is simultaneously whole; as was said in the preceding
    article. But words denoting present, past and future time are applied to God
    in Scripture. Therefore God is not eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Athanasius says in his Creed: "The Father is
    eternal, the Son is eternal, the Holy Ghost is eternal."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The idea of eternity follows immutability, as
    the idea of time follows movement, as appears from the preceding article.
    Hence, as God is supremely immutable, it supremely belongs to Him to be
    eternal. Nor is He eternal only; but He is His own eternity; whereas, no
    other being is its own duration, as no other is its own being. Now God is
    His own uniform being; and hence as He is His own essence, so He is His own
    eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The "now" that stands still, is said to
    make eternity according to our apprehension. As the apprehension of time is
    caused in us by the fact that we apprehend the flow of the "now," so the
    apprehension of eternity is caused in us by our apprehending the "now"
    standing still. When Augustine says that "God is the author of eternity,"
    this is to be understood of participated eternity. For God communicates His
    eternity to some in the same way as He communicates His immutability.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From this appears the answer to the
    Second Objection. For God is said to be before eternity, according as it is
    shared by immaterial substances. Hence, also, in the same book, it is said
    that "intelligence is equal to eternity." In the words of Exodus, "The Lord
    shall reign for eternity, and beyond," eternity stands for age, as another
    rendering has it. Thus it is said that the Lord will reign beyond eternity,
    inasmuch as He endures beyond every age, i.e. beyond every kind of duration.
    For age is nothing more than the period of each thing, as is said in the
    book De Coelo i. Or to reign beyond eternity can be taken to mean that if
    any other thing were conceived to exist for ever, as the movement of the
    heavens according to some philosophers, then God would still reign beyond,
    inasmuch as His reign is simultaneously whole.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Eternity is nothing else but God
    Himself. Hence God is not called eternal, as if He were in any way measured;
    but the idea of measurement is there taken according to the apprehension of
    our mind alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Words denoting different times are
    applied to God, because His eternity includes all times; not as if He
    Himself were altered through present, past and future.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether to be eternal belongs to God alone?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to God alone to
    be eternal. For it is written that "those who instruct many to justice,"
    shall be "as stars unto perpetual eternities [*Douay: 'for all eternity']"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++12%3A3">Dan. 12:3</a>).
    Now if God alone were eternal, there could not be many eternities. Therefore
    God alone is not the only eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written "Depart, ye cursed into
    eternal [Douay: 'everlasting'] fire" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++25%3A41"
      >Mt. 25:41</a
    >). Therefore God is not the only eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every necessary thing is eternal. But
    there are many necessary things; as, for instance, all principles of
    demonstration and all demonstrative propositions. Therefore God is not the
    only eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ep. ad Damasum. xv) that "God is
    the only one who has no beginning." Now whatever has a beginning, is not
    eternal. Therefore God is the only one eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Eternity truly and properly so called is in God
    alone, because eternity follows on immutability; as appears from the first
    article. But God alone is altogether immutable, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP009.html#FPQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FP009.html#FPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Accordingly, however,
    as some receive immutability from Him, they share in His eternity. Thus some
    receive immutability from God in the way of never ceasing to exist; in that
    sense it is said of the earth, "it standeth for ever" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A4"
      >Eccles. 1:4</a
    >). Again, some things are called eternal in Scripture because of the length
    of their duration, although they are in nature corruptible; thus (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++75%3A5"
      >Ps. 75:5</a
    >) the hills are called "eternal" and we read "of the fruits of the eternal
    hills." (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++33%3A15"
      >Dt. 33:15</a
    >). Some again, share more fully than others in the nature of eternity,
    inasmuch as they possess unchangeableness either in being or further still
    in operation; like the angels, and the blessed, who enjoy the Word, because
    "as regards that vision of the Word, no changing thoughts exist in the
    Saints," as Augustine says (De Trin. xv). Hence those who see God are said
    to have eternal life; according to that text, "This is eternal life, that
    they may know Thee the only true God," etc. (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A3"
      >Jn. 17:3</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are said to be many eternities,
    accordingly as many share in eternity, by the contemplation of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fire of hell is called eternal, only
    because it never ends. Still, there is change in the pains of the lost,
    according to the words "To extreme heat they will pass from snowy waters"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+24%3A19">Job 24:19</a>).
    Hence in hell true eternity does not exist, but rather time; according to
    the text of the Psalm "Their time will be for ever" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++80%3A16"
      >Ps. 80:16</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Necessary means a certain mode of truth;
    and truth, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vi), is in the mind.
    Therefore in this sense the true and necessary are eternal, because they are
    in the eternal mind, which is the divine intellect alone; hence it does not
    follow that anything beside God is eternal.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether eternity differs from time?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that eternity does not differ from time.
    For two measures of duration cannot exist together, unless one is part of
    the other; for instance two days or two hours cannot be together;
    nevertheless, we may say that a day or an hour are together, considering
    hour as part of a day. But eternity and time occur together, each of which
    imports a certain measure of duration. Since therefore eternity is not a
    part of time, forasmuch as eternity exceeds time, and includes it, it seems
    that time is a part of eternity, and is not a different thing from
    eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv),
    the "now" of time remains the same in the whole of time. But the nature of
    eternity seems to be that it is the same indivisible thing in the whole
    space of time. Therefore eternity is the "now" of time. But the "now" of
    time is not substantially different from time. Therefore eternity is not
    substantially different from time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the measure of the first movement is
    the measure of every movement, as said in Phys. iv, it thus appears that the
    measure of the first being is that of every being. But eternity is the
    measure of the first being---that is, of the divine being. Therefore
    eternity is the measure of every being. But the being of things corruptible
    is measured by time. Time therefore is either eternity or is a part of
    eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Eternity is simultaneously whole. But time
    has a "before" and an "after." Therefore time and eternity are not the same
    thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is manifest that time and eternity are not
    the same. Some have founded this difference on the fact that eternity has
    neither beginning nor an end; whereas time has a beginning and an end. This,
    however, makes a merely accidental, and not an absolute difference because,
    granted that time always was and always will be, according to the idea of
    those who think the movement of the heavens goes on for ever, there would
    yet remain a difference between eternity and time, as Boethius says (De
    Consol. v), arising from the fact that eternity is simultaneously whole;
    which cannot be applied to time: for eternity is the measure of a permanent
    being; while time is a measure of movement. Supposing, however, that the
    aforesaid difference be considered on the part of the things measured, and
    not as regards the measures, then there is some reason for it, inasmuch as
    that alone is measured by time which has beginning and end in time. Hence,
    if the movement of the heavens lasted always, time would not be of its
    measure as regards the whole of its duration, since the infinite is not
    measurable; but it would be the measure of that part of its revolution which
    has beginning and end in time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason for the same can be taken from these measures in themselves,
    if we consider the end and the beginning as potentialities; because, granted
    also that time always goes on, yet it is possible to note in time both the
    beginning and the end, by considering its parts: thus we speak of the
    beginning and the end of a day or of a year; which cannot be applied to
    eternity. Still these differences follow upon the essential and primary
    differences, that eternity is simultaneously whole, but that time is not
    so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such a reason would be a valid one if
    time and eternity were the same kind of measure; but this is seen not to be
    the case when we consider those things of which the respective measures are
    time and eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The "now" of time is the same as regards
    its subject in the whole course of time, but it differs in aspect; for
    inasmuch as time corresponds to movement, its "now" corresponds to what is
    movable; and the thing movable has the same one subject in all time, but
    differs in aspect a being here and there; and such alteration is movement.
    Likewise the flow of the "now" as alternating in aspect is time. But
    eternity remains the same according to both subject and aspect; and hence
    eternity is not the same as the "now" of time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As eternity is the proper measure of
    permanent being, so time is the proper measure of movement; and hence,
    according as any being recedes from permanence of being, and is subject to
    change, it recedes from eternity, and is subject to time. Therefore the
    being of things corruptible, because it is changeable, is not measured by
    eternity, but by time; for time measures not only things actually changed,
    but also things changeable; hence it not only measures movement but it also
    measures repose, which belongs to whatever is naturally movable, but is not
    actually in motion.<br />

  <h3 align="left">The difference of aeviternity and time<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that aeviternity is the same as time.
    For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22,23), that "God moves the
    spiritual through time." But aeviternity is said to be the measure of
    spiritual substances. Therefore time is the same as aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is essential to time to have "before"
    and "after"; but it is essential to eternity to be simultaneously whole, as
    was shown above in the first article. Now aeviternity is not eternity; for
    it is written (Ecclus. 1:1) that eternal "Wisdom is before age." Therefore
    it is not simultaneously whole but has "before" and "after"; and thus it is
    the same as time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there is no "before" and "after" in
    aeviternity, it follows that in aeviternal things there is no difference
    between being, having been, or going to be. Since then it is impossible for
    aeviternal things not to have been, it follows that it is impossible for
    them not to be in the future; which is false, since God can reduce them to
    nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, since the duration of aeviternal things
    is infinite as to subsequent duration, if aeviternity is simultaneously
    whole, it follows that some creature is actually infinite; which is
    impossible. Therefore aeviternity does not differ from time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. iii) "Who
    commandest time to be separate from aeviternity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Aeviternity differs from time, and from
    eternity, as the mean between them both. This difference is explained by
    some to consist in the fact that eternity has neither beginning nor end,
    aeviternity, a beginning but no end, and time both beginning and end. This
    difference, however, is but an accidental one, as was shown above, in the
    preceding article; because even if aeviternal things had always been, and
    would always be, as some think, and even if they might sometimes fail to be,
    which is possible to God to allow; even granted this, aeviternity would
    still be distinguished from eternity, and from time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others assign the difference between these three to consist in the fact that
    eternity has no "before" and "after"; but that time has both, together with
    innovation and veteration; and that aeviternity has "before" and "after"
    without innovation and veteration. This theory, however, involves a
    contradiction; which manifestly appears if innovation and veteration be
    referred to the measure itself. For since "before" and "after" of duration
    cannot exist together, if aeviternity has "before" and "after," it must
    follow that with the receding of the first part of aeviternity, the after
    part of aeviternity must newly appear; and thus innovation would occur in
    aeviternity itself, as it does in time. And if they be referred to the
    things measured, even then an incongruity would follow. For a thing which
    exists in time grows old with time, because it has a changeable existence,
    and from the changeableness of a thing measured, there follows "before" and
    "after" in the measure, as is clear from Phys. iv. Therefore the fact that
    an aeviternal thing is neither inveterate, nor subject to innovation, comes
    from its changelessness; and consequently its measure does not contain
    "before" and "after." We say then that since eternity is the measure of a
    permanent being, in so far as anything recedes from permanence of being, it
    recedes from eternity. Now some things recede from permanence of being, so
    that their being is subject to change, or consists in change; and these
    things are measured by time, as are all movements, and also the being of all
    things corruptible. But others recede less from permanence of being,
    forasmuch as their being neither consists in change, nor is the subject of
    change; nevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually or
    potentially. This appears in the heavenly bodies, the substantial being of
    which is unchangeable; and yet with unchangeable being they have
    changeableness of place. The same applies to the angels, who have an
    unchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards
    choice; moreover they have changeableness of intelligence, of affections and
    of places in their own degree. Therefore these are measured by aeviternity
    which is a mean between eternity and time. But the being that is measured by
    eternity is not changeable, nor is it annexed to change. In this way time
    has "before" and "after"; aeviternity in itself has no "before" and "after,"
    which can, however, be annexed to it; while eternity has neither "before"
    nor "after," nor is it compatible with such at all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Spiritual creatures as regards
    successive affections and intelligences are measured by time. Hence also
    Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22,23) that to be moved through time,
    is to be moved by affections. But as regards their nature they are measured
    by aeviternity; whereas as regards the vision of glory, they have a share of
    eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Aeviternity is simultaneously whole; yet
    it is not eternity, because "before" and "after" are compatible with it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the very being of an angel considered
    absolutely, there is no difference of past and future, but only as regards
    accidental change. Now to say that an angel was, or is, or will be, is to be
    taken in a different sense according to the acceptation of our intellect,
    which apprehends the angelic existence by comparison with different parts of
    time. But when we say that an angel is, or was, we suppose something, which
    being supposed, its opposite is not subject to the divine power. Whereas
    when we say he will be, we do not as yet suppose anything. Hence, since the
    existence and non-existence of an angel considered absolutely is subject to
    the divine power, God can make the existence of an angel not future; but He
    cannot cause him not to be while he is, or not to have been, after he has
    been.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The duration of aeviternity is infinite,
    forasmuch as it is not finished by time. Hence, there is no incongruity in
    saying that a creature is infinite, inasmuch as it is not ended by any other
    creature.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is only one aeviternity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there is not only one aeviternity;
    for it is written in the apocryphal books of Esdras: "Majesty and power of
    ages are with Thee, O Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, different genera have different
    measures. But some aeviternal things belong to the corporeal genus, as the
    heavenly bodies; and others are spiritual substances, as are the angels.
    Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since aeviternity is a term of duration,
    where there is one aeviternity, there is also one duration. But not all
    aeviternal things have one duration, for some begin to exist after others;
    as appears in the case especially of human souls. Therefore there is not
    only one aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, things not dependent on each other do
    not seem to have one measure of duration; for there appears to be one time
    for all temporal things; since the first movement, measured by time, is in
    some way the cause of all movement. But aeviternal things do not depend on
    each other, for one angel is not the cause of another angel. Therefore there
    is not only one aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Aeviternity is a more simple thing than time,
    and is nearer to eternity. But time is one only. Therefore much more is
    aeviternity one only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A twofold opinion exists on this subject. Some
    say there is only one aeviternity; others that there are many aeviternities.
    Which of these is true, may be considered from the cause why time is one;
    for we can rise from corporeal things to the knowledge of spiritual
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now some say that there is only one time for temporal things, forasmuch as
    one number exists for all things numbered; as time is a number, according to
    the Philosopher (Phys. iv). This, however, is not a sufficient reason;
    because time is not a number abstracted from the thing numbered, but
    existing in the thing numbered; otherwise it would not be continuous; for
    ten ells of cloth are continuous not by reason of the number, but by reason
    of the thing numbered. Now number as it exists in the thing numbered, is not
    the same for all; but it is different for different things. Hence, others
    assert that the unity of eternity as the principle of all duration is the
    cause of the unity of time. Thus all durations are one in that view, in the
    light of their principle, but are many in the light of the diversity of
    things receiving duration from the influx of the first principle. On the
    other hand others assign primary matter as the cause why time is one; as it
    is the first subject of movement, the measure of which is time. Neither of
    these reasons, however, is sufficient; forasmuch as things which are one in
    principle, or in subject, especially if distant, are not one absolutely, but
    accidentally. Therefore the true reason why time is one, is to be found in
    the oneness of the first movement by which, since it is most simple, all
    other movements are measured. Therefore time is referred to that movement,
    not only as a measure is to the thing measured, but also as accident is to
    subject; and thus receives unity from it. Whereas to other movements it is
    compared only as the measure is to the thing measured. Hence it is not
    multiplied by their multitude, because by one separate measure many things
    can be measured.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This being established, we must observe that a twofold opinion existed
    concerning spiritual substances. Some said that all proceeded from God in a
    certain equality, as Origen said (Peri Archon. i); or at least many of them,
    as some others thought. Others said that all spiritual substances proceeded
    from God in a certain degree and order; and Dionysius (Coel. Hier. x) seems
    to have thought so, when he said that among spiritual substances there are
    the first, the middle and the last; even in one order of angels. Now
    according to the first opinion, it must be said that there are many
    aeviternities as there are many aeviternal things of first degree. But
    according to the second opinion, it would be necessary to say that there is
    one aeviternity only; because since each thing is measured by the most
    simple element of its genus, it must be that the existence of all aeviternal
    things should be measured by the existence of the first aeviternal thing,
    which is all the more simple the nearer it is to the first. Wherefore
    because the second opinion is truer, as will be shown later (<a
      href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); we concede at present
    that there is only one aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Aeviternity is sometimes taken for age,
    that is, a space of a thing's duration; and thus we say many aeviternities
    when we mean ages.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the heavenly bodies and
    spiritual things differ in the genus of their nature, still they agree in
    having a changeless being, and are thus measured by aeviternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All temporal things did not begin
    together; nevertheless there is one time for all of them, by reason of the
    first measured by time; and thus all aeviternal things have one aeviternity
    by reason of the first, though all did not begin together.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> For things to be measured by one, it is
    not necessary that the one should be the cause of all, but that it be more
    simple than the rest.<br />
