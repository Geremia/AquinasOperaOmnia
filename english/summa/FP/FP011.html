  <h3 align="center">THE UNITY OF GOD (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After the foregoing, we consider the divine unity; concerning which there
    are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether "one" adds anything to
    "being"?
  </p>
  <p>

    opposed to each other?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether God is one?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP011.html#FPQ11A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He is in the highest
    degree one?

  <h3 align="left">Whether "one" adds anything to "being"?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that "one" adds something to "being."
    For everything is in a determinate genus by addition to being, which
    penetrates all "genera." But "one" is a determinate genus, for it is the
    principle of number, which is a species of quantity. Therefore "one" adds
    something to "being."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what divides a thing common to all, is
    an addition to it. But "being" is divided by "one" and by "many." Therefore
    "one" is an addition to "being."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if "one" is not an addition to "being,"
    "one" and "being" must have the same meaning. But it would be nugatory to
    call "being" by the name of "being"; therefore it would be equally so to
    call being "one." Now this is false. Therefore "one" is an addition to
    "being."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 5, ult.): "Nothing
    which exists is not in some way one," which would be false if "one" were an
    addition to "being," in the sense of limiting it. Therefore "one" is not an
    addition to "being."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "One" does not add any reality to "being"; but
    is only a negation of division; for "one" means undivided "being." This is
    the very reason why "one" is the same as "being." Now every being is either
    simple or compound. But what is simple is undivided, both actually and
    potentially. Whereas what is compound, has not being whilst its parts are
    divided, but after they make up and compose it. Hence it is manifest that
    the being of anything consists in undivision; and hence it is that
    everything guards its unity as it guards its being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some, thinking that the "one"
    convertible with "being" is the same as the "one" which is the principle of
    number, were divided into contrary opinions. Pythagoras and Plato, seeing
    that the "one" convertible with "being" did not add any reality to "being,"
    but signified the substance of "being" as undivided, thought that the same
    applied to the "one" which is the principle of number. And because number is
    composed of unities, they thought that numbers were the substances of all
    things. Avicenna, however, on the contrary, considering that "one" which is
    the principle of number, added a reality to the substance of "being"
    (otherwise number made of unities would not be a species of quantity),
    thought that the "one" convertible with "being" added a reality to the
    substance of beings; as "white" to "man." This, however, is manifestly
    false, inasmuch as each thing is "one" by its substance. For if a thing were
    "one" by anything else but by its substance, since this again would be
    "one," supposing it were again "one" by another thing, we should be driven
    on to infinity. Hence we must adhere to the former statement; therefore we
    must say that the "one" which is convertible with "being," does not add a
    reality to being; but that the "one" which is the principle of number, does
    add a reality to "being," belonging to the genus of quantity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is nothing to prevent a thing
    which in one way is divided, from being another way undivided; as what is
    divided in number, may be undivided in species; thus it may be that a thing
    is in one way "one," and in another way "many." Still, if it is absolutely
    undivided, either because it is so according to what belongs to its essence,
    though it may be divided as regards what is outside its essence, as what is
    one in subject may have many accidents; or because it is undivided actually,
    and divided potentially, as what is "one" in the whole, and is "many" in
    parts; in such a case a thing will be "one" absolutely and "many"
    accidentally. On the other hand, if it be undivided accidentally, and
    divided absolutely, as if it were divided in essence and undivided in idea
    or in principle or cause, it will be "many" absolutely and "one"
    accidentally; as what are "many" in number and "one" in species or "one" in
    principle. Hence in that way, being is divided by "one" and by "many"; as it
    were by "one" absolutely and by "many" accidentally. For multitude itself
    would not be contained under "being," unless it were in some way contained
    under "one." Thus Dionysius says (Div. Nom. cap. ult.) that "there is no
    kind of multitude that is not in a way one. But what are many in their
    parts, are one in their whole; and what are many in accidents, are one in
    subject; and what are many in number, are one in species; and what are many
    in species, are one in genus; and what are many in processions, are one in
    principle."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It does not follow that it is nugatory
    to say "being" is "one"; forasmuch as "one" adds an idea to "being."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether "one" and "many" are opposed to each other?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that "one" and "many" are not mutually
    opposed. For no opposite thing is predicated of its opposite. But every
    "multitude" is in a certain way "one," as appears from the preceding
    article. Therefore "one" is not opposed to "multitude."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no opposite thing is constituted by its
    opposite. But "multitude" is constituted by "one." Therefore it is not
    opposed to "multitude."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "one" is opposed to "one." But the idea
    of "few" is opposed to "many." Therefore "one" is not opposed to "many."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if "one" is opposed to "multitude," it
    is opposed as the undivided is to the divided; and is thus opposed to it as
    privation is to habit. But this appears to be incongruous; because it would
    follow that "one" comes after "multitude," and is defined by it; whereas, on
    the contrary, "multitude" is defined by "one." Hence there would be a
    vicious circle in the definition; which is inadmissible. Therefore "one" and
    "many" are not opposed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things which are opposed in idea, are
    themselves opposed to each other. But the idea of "one" consists in
    indivisibility; and the idea of "multitude" contains division. Therefore
    "one" and "many" are opposed to each other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "One" is opposed to "many," but in various
    ways. The "one" which is the principle of number is opposed to "multitude"
    which is number, as the measure is to the thing measured. For "one" implies
    the idea of a primary measure; and number is "multitude" measured by "one,"
    as is clear from Metaph. x. But the "one" which convertible with "being" is
    opposed to "multitude" by way of privation; as the undivided is to the thing
    divided.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> No privation entirely takes away the
    being of a thing, inasmuch as privation means "negation in the subject,"
    according to the Philosopher (Categor. viii). Nevertheless every privation
    takes away some being; and so in being, by reason of its universality, the
    privation of being has its foundation in being; which is not the case in
    privations of special forms, as of sight, or of whiteness and the like. And
    what applies to being applies also to one and to good, which are convertible
    with being, for the privation of good is founded in some good; likewise the
    removal of unity is founded in some one thing. Hence it happens that
    multitude is some one thing; and evil is some good thing, and non-being is
    some kind of being. Nevertheless, opposite is not predicated of opposite;
    forasmuch as one is absolute, and the other is relative; for what is
    relative being (as a potentiality) is non-being absolutely, i.e. actually;
    or what is absolute being in the genus of substance is non-being relatively
    as regards some accidental being. In the same way, what is relatively good
    is absolutely bad, or vice versa; likewise what is absolutely "one" is
    relatively "many," and vice versa.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A "whole" is twofold. In one sense it is
    homogeneous, composed of like parts; in another sense it is heterogeneous,
    composed of dissimilar parts. Now in every homogeneous whole, the whole is
    made up of parts having the form of the whole; as, for instance, every part
    of water is water; and such is the constitution of a continuous thing made
    up of its parts. In every heterogeneous whole, however, every part is
    wanting in the form belonging to the whole; as, for instance, no part of a
    house is a house, nor is any part of a man a man. Now multitude is such a
    kind of a whole. Therefore inasmuch as its part has not the form of the
    multitude, the latter is composed of unities, as a house is composed of not
    houses; not, indeed, as if unities constituted multitude so far as they are
    undivided, in which way they are opposed to multitude; but so far as they
    have being, as also the parts of a house make up the house by the fact that
    they are beings, not by the fact that they are not houses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Many" is taken in two ways: absolutely,
    and in that sense it is opposed to "one"; in another way as importing some
    kind of excess, in which sense it is opposed to "few"; hence in the first
    sense two are many but not in the second sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> "One" is opposed to "many" privatively,
    inasmuch as the idea of "many" involves division. Hence division must be
    prior to unity, not absolutely in itself, but according to our way of
    apprehension. For we apprehend simple things by compound things; and hence
    we define a point to be, "what has no part," or "the beginning of a line."
    "Multitude" also, in idea, follows on "one"; because we do not understand
    divided things to convey the idea of multitude except by the fact that we
    attribute unity to every part. Hence "one" is placed in the definition of
    "multitude"; but "multitude" is not placed in the definition of "one." But
    division comes to be understood from the very negation of being: so what
    first comes to mind is being; secondly, that this being is not that being,
    and thus we apprehend division as a consequence; thirdly, comes the notion
    of one; fourthly, the notion of multitude.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is one?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not one. For it is written
    "For there be many gods and many lords" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++8%3A5"
      >1 Cor. 8:5</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "One," as the principle of number,
    cannot be predicated of God, since quantity is not predicated of God;
    likewise, neither can "one" which is convertible with "being" be predicated
    of God, because it imports privation, and every privation is an
    imperfection, which cannot apply to God. Therefore God is not one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our
    God is one Lord" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A4"
      >Dt. 6:4</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It can be shown from these three sources that
    God is one. First from His simplicity. For it is manifest that the reason
    why any singular thing is "this particular thing" is because it cannot be
    communicated to many: since that whereby Socrates is a man, can be
    communicated to many; whereas, what makes him this particular man, is only
    communicable to one. Therefore, if Socrates were a man by what makes him to
    be this particular man, as there cannot be many Socrates, so there could not
    in that way be many men. Now this belongs to God alone; for God Himself is
    His own nature, as was shown above (<a href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, in the very
    same way God is God, and He is this God. Impossible is it therefore that
    many Gods should exist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, this is proved from the infinity of His perfection. For it was
    shown above (<a href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FP004.html#FPQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that God comprehends in
    Himself the whole perfection of being. If then many gods existed, they would
    necessarily differ from each other. Something therefore would belong to one
    which did not belong to another. And if this were a privation, one of them
    would not be absolutely perfect; but if a perfection, one of them would be
    without it. So it is impossible for many gods to exist. Hence also the
    ancient philosophers, constrained as it were by truth, when they asserted an
    infinite principle, asserted likewise that there was only one such
    principle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, this is shown from the unity of the world. For all things that
    exist are seen to be ordered to each other since some serve others. But
    things that are diverse do not harmonize in the same order, unless they are
    ordered thereto by one. For many are reduced into one order by one better
    than by many: because one is the "per se" cause of one, and many are only
    the accidental cause of one, inasmuch as they are in some way one. Since
    therefore what is first is most perfect, and is so "per se" and not
    accidentally, it must be that the first which reduces all into one order
    should be only one. And this one is God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gods are called many by the error of
    some who worshipped many deities, thinking as they did that the planets and
    other stars were gods, and also the separate parts of the world. Hence the
    Apostle adds: "Our God is one," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "One" which is the principle of number
    is not predicated of God, but only of material things. For "one" the
    principle of number belongs to the "genus" of mathematics, which are
    material in being, and abstracted from matter only in idea. But "one" which
    is convertible with being is a metaphysical entity and does not depend on
    matter in its being. And although in God there is no privation, still,
    according to the mode of our apprehension, He is known to us by way only of
    privation and remotion. Thus there is no reason why a certain kind of
    privation should not be predicated of God; for instance, that He is
    incorporeal and infinite; and in the same way it is said of God that He is
    one.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God is supremely one?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not supremely "one." For
    "one" is so called from the privation of division. But privation cannot be
    greater or less. Therefore God is not more "one" than other things which are
    called "one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing seems to be more indivisible
    than what is actually and potentially indivisible; such as a point and
    unity. But a thing is said to be more "one" according as it is indivisible.
    Therefore God is not more "one" than unity is "one" and a point is "one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is essentially good is supremely
    good. Therefore what is essentially "one" is supremely "one." But every
    being is essentially "one," as the Philosopher says (Metaph. iv). Therefore
    every being is supremely "one"; and therefore God is not "one" more than any
    other being is "one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Bernard says (De Consid. v): "Among all
    things called one, the unity of the Divine Trinity holds the first
    place."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since "one" is an undivided being, if anything
    is supremely "one" it must be supremely being, and supremely undivided. Now
    both of these belong to God. For He is supremely being, inasmuch as His
    being is not determined by any nature to which it is adjoined; since He is
    being itself, subsistent, absolutely undetermined. But He is supremely
    undivided inasmuch as He is divided neither actually nor potentially, by any
    mode of division; since He is altogether simple, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FP003.html#FPQ3A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Hence it is manifest
    that God is "one" in the supreme degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although privation considered in itself
    is not susceptive of more or less, still according as its opposite is
    subject to more or less, privation also can be considered itself in the
    light of more and less. Therefore according as a thing is more divided, or
    is divisible, either less or not at all, in the degree it is called more, or
    less, or supremely, "one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A point and unity which is the principle
    of number, are not supremely being, inasmuch as they have being only in some
    subject. Hence neither of them can be supremely "one." For as a subject
    cannot be supremely "one," because of the difference within it of accident
    and subject, so neither can an accident.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although every being is "one" by its
    substance, still every such substance is not equally the cause of unity; for
    the substance of some things is compound and of others simple.<br />
