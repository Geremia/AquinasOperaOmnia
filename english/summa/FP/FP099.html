<H3 Align="Center">OF THE CONDITION OF THE OFFSPRING AS TO THE BODY (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the condition of the offspring---first, as regards 
the body; secondly, as regards virtue; thirdly, in knowledge. Under the 
first head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in the state of innocence children would have had full 
powers of the body immediately after birth?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP099.html#FPQ99A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether all infants would have been of the male sex?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the state of innocence children would have had perfect strength of body as to the use of its members immediately after birth?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the state of innocence children would have 
had perfect strength of the body, as to the use of its members, 
immediately after birth. For Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. 
i, 38): "This weakness of the body befits their weakness of mind." But in 
the state of innocence there would have been no weakness of mind. 
Therefore neither would there have been weakness of body in infants.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some animals at birth have sufficient strength to use 
their members. But man is nobler than other animals. Therefore much more 
is it natural to man to have strength to use his members at birth; and 
thus it appears to be a punishment of sin that he has not that strength.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, inability to secure a proffered pleasure causes 
affliction. But if children had not full strength in the use  of their 
limbs, they would often have been unable to procure something pleasurable 
offered to them; and so they would have been afflicted, which was not 
possible before sin. Therefore, in the state of innocence, children would 
not have been deprived of the use of their limbs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the weakness of old age seems to correspond to that of 
infancy. But in the state of innocence there would have been no weakness 
of old age. Therefore neither would there have been such weakness in 
infancy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Everything generated is first imperfect. But in the 
state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation. 
Therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size 
and power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By faith alone do we hold truths which are above nature, 
and what we believe rests on authority. Wherefore, in making any 
assertion, we must be guided by the nature of things, except in those 
things which are above nature, and are made known to us by Divine 
authority. Now it is clear that it is as natural as it is befitting to 
the principles of human nature that children should not have sufficient 
strength for the use of their limbs immediately after birth. Because in 
proportion to other animals man has naturally a larger brain. Wherefore 
it is natural, on account of the considerable humidity of the brain in 
children, that the nerves which are instruments of movement, should not 
be apt for moving the limbs. On the other hand, no Catholic doubts it 
possible for a child to have, by Divine power, the use of its limbs 
immediately after birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have it on the authority of Scripture that "God made man right" 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++7:30">Eccles. 7:30</a>), which rightness, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 11), 
consists in the perfect subjection of the body to the soul. As, 
therefore, in the primitive state it was impossible to find in the human 
limbs anything repugnant to man's well-ordered will, so was it impossible 
for those limbs to fail in executing the will's commands. Now the human 
will is well ordered when it tends to acts which are befitting to man. 
But the same acts are not befitting to man at every season of life. We 
must, therefore, conclude that children would not have had sufficient 
strength for the use of their limbs for the purpose of performing every 
kind of act; but only for the acts befitting the state of infancy, such 
as suckling, and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of the weakness which we observe in 
children even as regards those acts which befit the state of infancy; as 
is clear from his preceding remark that "even when close to the breast, 
and longing for it, they are more apt to cry than to suckle."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fact that some animals have the use of their limbs 
immediately after birth, is due, not to their superiority, since more 
perfect animals are not so endowed; but to the dryness  of the brain, and 
to the operations proper to such animals being imperfect, so that a small 
amount of strength suffices them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b>is clear from what we have said above. We may add that they 
would have desired nothing except with an ordinate will; and only what 
was befitting to their state of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the state of innocence man would have been born, yet not 
subject to corruption. Therefore in that state there could have been 
certain infantile defects which result from birth; but not senile defects 
leading to corruption.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether, in the primitive state, women would have been born?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the primitive state woman would not have 
been born. For the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal. ii, 3) that woman 
is a "misbegotten male," as though she were a product outside the purpose 
of nature. But in that state nothing would have been unnatural in human 
generation. Therefore in that state women would not have been born.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every agent produces its like, unless prevented by 
insufficient power or ineptness of matter: thus a small fire cannot burn 
green wood. But in generation the active force is in the male. Since, 
therefore, in the state of innocence man's active force was not subject 
to defect, nor was there inept matter on the part of the woman, it seems 
that males would always have been born.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the state of innocence generation is ordered to the 
multiplication of the human race. But the race would have been 
sufficiently multiplied by the first man and woman, from the fact that 
they would have lived for ever. Therefore, in the state of innocence, 
there was no need for women to be born.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nature's process in generation would have been in 
harmony with the manner in which it was established by God. But 
established male and female in human nature, as it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++1,2">Gn. 1,2</a>). 
Therefore also in the state of innocence male and female would have been 
born.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing belonging to the completeness of human nature 
would have been lacking in the state of innocence. And as different 
grades belong to the perfection of the universe, so also diversity of sex 
belongs to the perfection of human nature. Therefore in the state of 
innocence, both sexes would have been begotten.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Woman is said to be a "misbegotten male," as being a 
product outside the purpose of nature considered in the individual case: 
but not against the purpose of universal nature, as above explained 
(<A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="FP092.html#FPQ92A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The generation of woman is not occasioned either by a 
defect of the active force or by inept matter, as the objection proposes; 
but sometimes by an extrinsic accidental cause; thus the Philosopher says 
(De Animal. Histor. vi, 19): "The northern wind favors the generation of 
males, and the southern wind that of females": sometimes also by some 
impression in the soul (of the parents), which may easily have some 
effect on the body (of the child). Especially was this the case in the 
state of innocence, when the body was more subject to the soul; so that 
by the mere will of the parent the sex of the offspring might be 
diversified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[99] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The offspring would have been begotten to an animal life, 
as to the use of food and generation. Hence it was fitting that all 
should generate, and not only the first parents. From this it seems to 
follow that males and females would have been in equal number.<br>
