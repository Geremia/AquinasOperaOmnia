<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angel's intellect is sometimes in potentiality, sometimes in act?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angel's intellect is sometimes in 
potentiality and sometimes in act. For movement is the act of  what is in 
potentiality, as stated in Phys. iii, 6. But the angels' minds are moved 
by understanding, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the angelic 
minds are sometimes in potentiality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since desire is of a thing not possessed but possible to 
have, whoever desires to know anything is in potentiality thereto. But it 
is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++1:12">1 Pt. 1:12</a>): "On Whom the angels desire to look." Therefore the 
angel's intellect is sometimes in potentiality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the book De Causis it is stated that "an intelligence 
understands according to the mode of its substance." But the angel's 
intelligence has some admixture of potentiality. Therefore it sometimes 
understands potentially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii): "Since the angels 
were created, in the eternity of the Word, they enjoy holy and devout 
contemplation." Now a contemplating intellect is not in potentiality, but 
in act. Therefore the intellect of an angel is not in potentiality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher states (De Anima iii, text. 8; Phys. 
viii, 32), the intellect is in potentiality in two ways; first, "as 
before learning or discovering," that is, before it has the habit of 
knowledge; secondly, as "when it possesses the habit of knowledge, but 
does not actually consider." In the first way an angel's intellect is 
never in potentiality with regard to the things to which his natural 
knowledge extends. For, as the higher, namely, the heavenly, bodies have 
no potentiality to existence, which is not fully actuated, in the same 
way the heavenly intellects, the angels, have no intelligible 
potentiality which is not fully completed by connatural intelligible 
species. But with regard to things divinely revealed to them, there is 
nothing to hinder them from being in potentiality: because even the 
heavenly bodies are at times in potentiality to being enlightened by the 
sun.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second way an angel's intellect can be in potentiality with 
regard to things learnt by natural knowledge; for he is not always 
actually considering everything that he knows by natural knowledge. But 
as to the knowledge of the Word, and of the things he beholds in the 
Word, he is never in this way in potentiality; because he is always 
actually beholding the Word, and the things he sees in the Word. For the 
bliss of the angels consists in such vision; and beatitude does not 
consist in habit, but in act, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 8).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Movement is taken there not as the act of something 
imperfect, that is, of something existing in potentiality, but as the act 
of something perfect, that is, of one actually existing. In this way 
understanding and feeling are termed movements, as stated in De Anima 
iii, text. 28.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Such desire on the part of the angels does not  exclude the 
object desired, but weariness thereof. Or they are said to desire the 
vision of God with regard to fresh revelations, which they receive from 
God to fit them for the tasks which they have to perform.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the angel's substance there is no potentiality divested 
of act. In the same way, the angel's intellect is never so in 
potentiality as to be without act.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an angel can understand many things at the same time?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an angel cannot understand many things at the 
same time. For the Philosopher says (Topic. ii, 4) that "it may happen 
that we know many things, but understand only one."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is understood unless the intellect be informed 
by an intelligible species; just at the body is formed by shape. But one 
body cannot be formed into many shapes. Therefore neither can one 
intellect simultaneously understand various intelligible things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to understand is a kind of movement. But no movement 
terminates in various terms. Therefore many things cannot be understood 
altogether.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 32): "The spiritual 
faculty of the angelic mind comprehends most easily at the same time all 
things that it wills."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As unity of term is requisite for unity of movement, so 
is unity of object required for unity of operation. Now it happens that 
several things may be taken as several or as one; like the parts of a 
continuous whole. For if each of the parts be considered severally they 
are many: consequently neither by sense nor by intellect are they grasped 
by one operation, nor all at once. In another way they are taken as 
forming one in the whole; and so they are grasped both by sense and 
intellect all at once and by one operation; as long as the entire 
continuous whole is considered, as is stated in De Anima iii, text. 23. 
In this way our intellect understands together both the subject and the 
predicate, as forming parts of one proposition; and also two things 
compared together, according as they agree in one point of comparison. 
From this it is evident that many things, in so far as they are distinct, 
cannot be understood at once; but in so far as they are comprised under 
one intelligible concept, they can be understood together. Now everything 
is actually intelligible according as its image is in the intellect. All 
things, then, which can be known by one intelligible species, are known 
as one intelligible object, and therefore are understood simultaneously. 
But things known by various intelligible species, are apprehended as 
different intelligible objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, by such knowledge as the angels have of things through the 
Word, they know all things under one intelligible species, which is the 
Divine essence. Therefore, as regards such knowledge, they know all 
things at once: just as in heaven "our thoughts will not be fleeting, 
going and returning from one thing to another, but we shall survey all 
our knowledge at the same time by one glance," as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xv, 16). But by that knowledge wherewith the angels know things by 
innate species, they can at one time know all things which can be 
comprised under one species; but not such as are under various species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To understand many things as one, is, so to speak, to 
understand one thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The intellect is informed by the intelligible species which 
it has within it. So it can behold at the same time many intelligible 
objects under one species; as one body can by one shape be likened to 
many bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the third objection the answer is the same as the first.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an angel's knowledge is discursive?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the knowledge of an angel is discursive. For 
the discursive movement of the mind comes from one thing being known 
through another. But the angels know one thing through another; for they 
know creatures through the Word. Therefore the intellect of an angel 
knows by discursive method.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever a lower power can do, the higher can do. But 
the human intellect can syllogize, and know causes in effects; all of 
which is the discursive method. Therefore the intellect of the angel, 
which is higher in the order of nature, can with greater reason do this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore (De sum. bono i, 10) says that "demons learn 
more things by experience." But experimental knowledge is discursive: 
for, "one experience comes of many remembrances, and one universal from 
many experiences," as Aristotle observes (Poster. ii; Metaph. vii). 
Therefore an angel's knowledge is discursive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that the "angels do not 
acquire Divine knowledge from separate discourses, nor are they led to 
something particular from something common."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As has often been stated (<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the angels 
hold that grade among spiritual substances which the heavenly bodies hold 
among corporeal substances: for Dionysius calls them "heavenly minds" 
(<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now, the difference between heavenly and earthly 
bodies is this, that earthly bodies obtain their last perfection by 
chance and movement: while the heavenly bodies have their last perfection 
at once from their very  nature. So, likewise, the lower, namely, the 
human, intellects obtain their perfection in the knowledge of truth by a 
kind of movement and discursive intellectual operation; that is to say, 
as they advance from one known thing to another. But, if from the 
knowledge of a known principle they were straightway to perceive as known 
all its consequent conclusions, then there would be no discursive process 
at all. Such is the condition of the angels, because in the truths which 
they know naturally, they at once behold all things whatsoever that can 
be known in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore they are called "intellectual beings": because even with 
ourselves the things which are instantly grasped by the mind are said to 
be understood [intelligi]; hence "intellect" is defined as the habit of 
first principles. But human souls which acquire knowledge of truth by the 
discursive method are called "rational"; and this comes of the feebleness 
of their intellectual light. For if they possessed the fulness of 
intellectual light, like the angels, then in the first aspect of 
principles they would at once comprehend their whole range, by perceiving 
whatever could be reasoned out from them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Discursion expresses movement of a kind. Now all movement 
is from something before to something after. Hence discursive knowledge 
comes about according as from something previously known one attains to 
the knowledge of what is afterwards known, and which was previously 
unknown. But if in the thing perceived something else be seen at the same 
time, as an object and its image are seen simultaneously in a mirror, it 
is not discursive knowledge. And in this way the angels know things in 
the Word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angels can syllogize, in the sense of knowing a 
syllogism; and they see effects in causes, and causes in effects: yet 
they do not acquire knowledge of an unknown truth in this way, by 
syllogizing from causes to effect, or from effect to cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Experience is affirmed of angels and demons simply by way 
of similitude, forasmuch as they know sensible things which are present, 
yet without any discursion withal.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels understand by composing and dividing?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels understand by composing and 
dividing. For, where there is multiplicity of things understood, there is 
composition of the same, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 21. But there 
is a multitude of things understood in the angelic mind; because angels 
apprehend different things by various species, and not all at one time. 
Therefore there is composition and division in the angel's mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, negation is far more remote from affirmation than any 
two opposite natures are; because the first of distinctions is that of 
affirmation and negation. But the angel knows certain distant natures not 
by one, but by diverse species,  as is evident from what was said (<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore he must know affirmation and negation by diverse species. And 
so it seems that he understands by composing and dividing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, speech is a sign of the intellect. But in speaking to 
men, angels use affirmative and negative expressions, which are signs of 
composition and of division in the intellect; as is manifest from many 
passages of Sacred Scripture. Therefore it seems that the angel 
understands by composing and dividing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "the intellectual 
power of the angel shines forth with the clear simplicity of divine 
concepts." But a simple intelligence is without composition and division. 
Therefore the angel understands without composition or division.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As in the intellect, when reasoning, the conclusion is 
compared with the principle, so in the intellect composing and dividing, 
the predicate is compared with the subject. For if our intellect were to 
see at once the truth of the conclusion in the principle, it would never 
understand by discursion and reasoning. In like manner, if the intellect 
in apprehending the quiddity of the subject were at once to have 
knowledge of all that can be attributed to, or removed from, the subject, 
it would never understand by composing and dividing, but only by 
understanding the essence. Thus it is evident that for the self-same 
reason our intellect understands by discursion, and by composing and 
dividing, namely, that in the first apprehension of anything newly 
apprehended it does not at once grasp all that is virtually contained in 
it. And this comes from the weakness of the intellectual light within us, 
as has been said (<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence, since the intellectual light is perfect 
in the angel, for he is a pure and most clear mirror, as Dionysius says 
(Div. Nom. iv), it follows that as the angel does not understand by 
reasoning, so neither does he by composing and dividing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, he understands the composition and the division of 
enunciations, just as he apprehends the reasoning of syllogisms: for he 
understands simply, such things as are composite, things movable 
immovably, and material things immaterially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not every multitude of things understood causes 
composition, but a multitude of such things understood that one of them 
is attributed to, or denied of, another. When an angel apprehends the 
nature of anything, he at the same time understands whatever can be 
either attributed to it, or denied of it. Hence, in apprehending a 
nature, he by one simple perception grasps all that we can learn by 
composing and dividing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The various natures of things differ less as to their mode 
of existing than do affirmation and negation. Yet, as to the way in which 
they are known, affirmation and negation have something more in common; 
because directly the truth of an affirmation is known, the falsehood of 
the opposite negation is  known also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact that angels use affirmative and negative forms of 
speech, shows that they know both composition and division: yet not that 
they know by composing and dividing, but by knowing simply the nature of 
a thing.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be falsehood in the angel's 
intellect. For perversity appertains to falsehood. But, as Dionysius says 
(Div. Nom. iv), there is "a perverted fancy" in the demons. Therefore it 
seems that there can be falsehood in the intellect of the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nescience is the cause of estimating falsely. But, as 
Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. vi), there can be nescience in the angels. 
Therefore it seems there can be falsehood in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything which falls short of the truth of wisdom, and 
which has a depraved reason, has falsehood or error in its intellect. But 
Dionysius (Div. Nom. vii) affirms this of the demons. Therefore it seems 
that there can be error in the minds of the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 41) that "the 
intelligence is always true." Augustine likewise says (Questions. 83, qu. 32) 
that "nothing but what is true can be the object of intelligence" 
Therefore there can be neither deception nor falsehood in the angel's 
knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The truth of this question depends partly upon what has 
gone before. For it has been said (<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that an angel understands not by 
composing and dividing, but by understanding what a thing is. Now the 
intellect is always true as regards what a thing is, just as the sense 
regarding its proper object, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 26. But by 
accident, deception and falsehood creep in, when we understand the 
essence of a thing by some kind of composition, and this happens either 
when we take the definition of one thing for another, or when the parts 
of a definition do not hang together, as if we were to accept as the 
definition of some creature, "a four-footed flying beast," for there is 
no such animal. And this comes about in things composite, the definition 
of which is drawn from diverse elements, one of which is as matter to the 
other. But there is no room for error in understanding simple quiddities, 
as is stated in Metaph. ix, text. 22; for either they are not grasped at 
all, and so we know nothing respecting them; or else they are known 
precisely as they exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So therefore, no falsehood, error, or deception can exist of itself in 
the mind of any angel; yet it does so happen accidentally; but very 
differently from the way it befalls us. For we sometimes get at the 
quiddity of a thing by a composing and  dividing process, as when, by 
division and demonstration, we seek out the truth of a definition. Such 
is not the method of the angels; but through the (knowledge of the) 
essence of a thing they know everything that can be said regarding it. 
Now it is quite evident that the quiddity of a thing can be a source of 
knowledge with regard to everything belonging to such thing, or excluded 
from it; but not of what may be dependent on God's supernatural 
ordinance. Consequently, owing to their upright will, from their knowing 
the nature of every creature, the good angels form no judgments as to the 
nature of the qualities therein, save under the Divine ordinance; hence 
there can be no error or falsehood in them. But since the minds of demons 
are utterly perverted from the Divine wisdom, they at times form their 
opinions of things simply according to the natural conditions of the 
same. Nor are they ever deceived as to the natural properties of 
anything; but they can be misled with regard to supernatural matters; for 
example, on seeing a dead man, they may suppose that he will not rise 
again, or, on beholding Christ, they may judge Him not to be God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From all this the answers to the objections of both sides of the 
question are evident. For the perversity of the demons comes of their not 
being subject to the Divine wisdom; while nescience is in the angels as 
regards things knowable, not naturally but supernaturally. It is, 
furthermore, evident that their understanding of what a thing is, is 
always true, save accidentally, according as it is, in an undue manner, 
referred to some composition or division.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there is a "morning" and an "evening" knowledge in the angels?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is neither an evening nor a morning 
knowledge in the angels; because evening and morning have an admixture of 
darkness. But there is no darkness in the knowledge of an angel; since 
there is no error nor falsehood. Therefore the angelic knowledge ought 
not to be termed morning and evening knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, between evening and morning the night intervenes; while 
noonday falls between morning and evening. Consequently, if there be a 
morning and an evening knowledge in the angels, for the same reason it 
appears that there ought to be a noonday and a night knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, knowledge is diversified according to the difference of 
the objects known: hence the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 38), 
"The sciences are divided just as things are." But there is a threefold 
existence of things: to wit, in the Word; in their own natures; and in 
the angelic knowledge, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). If, 
therefore, a morning and an evening knowledge be admitted in the angels, 
because of the existence of things in the Word, and in their own nature, 
then there ought to be admitted a third class of knowledge, on account  
of the existence of things in the angelic mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,31; De Civ. Dei xii, 
7,20) divides the knowledge of the angels into morning and evening 
knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The expression "morning" and "evening" knowledge was 
devised by Augustine; who interprets the six days wherein God made all 
things, not as ordinary days measured by the solar circuit, since the sun 
was only made on the fourth day, but as one day, namely, the day of 
angelic knowledge as directed to six classes of things. As in the 
ordinary day, morning is the beginning, and evening the close of day, so, 
their knowledge of the primordial being of things is called morning 
knowledge; and this is according as things exist in the Word. But their 
knowledge of the very being of the thing created, as it stands in its own 
nature, is termed evening knowledge; because the being of things flows 
from the Word, as from a kind of primordial principle; and this flow is 
terminated in the being which they have in themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Evening and morning knowledge in the angelic knowledge are 
not taken as compared to an admixture of darkness, but as compared to 
beginning and end. Or else it can be said, as Augustine puts it (Gen. ad 
lit. iv, 23), that there is nothing to prevent us from calling something 
light in comparison with one thing, and darkness with respect to another. 
In the same way the life of the faithful and the just is called light in 
comparison with the wicked, according to Eph. 5:8: "You were heretofore 
darkness; but now, light in the Lord": yet this very life of the 
faithful, when set in contrast to the life of glory, is termed darkness, 
according to 2 Pt. 1:19: "You have the firm prophetic word, whereunto you 
do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place." So the 
angel's knowledge by which he knows things in their own nature, is day in 
comparison with ignorance or error; yet it is dark in comparison with the 
vision of the Word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The morning and evening knowledge belong to the day, that 
is, to the enlightened angels, who are quite apart from the darkness, 
that is, from the evil spirits. The good angels, while knowing the 
creature, do not adhere to it, for that would be to turn to darkness and 
to night; but they refer this back to the praise of God, in Whom, as in 
their principle, they know all things. Consequently after "evening" there 
is no night, but "morning"; so that morning is the end of the preceding 
day, and the beginning of the following, in so far as the angels refer to 
God's praise their knowledge of the preceding work. Noonday is comprised 
under the name of day, as the middle between the two extremes. Or else 
the noon can be referred to their knowledge of God Himself, Who has 
neither beginning nor end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The angels themselves are also creatures. Accordingly the 
existence of things in the angelic knowledge is comprised under evening 
knowledge, as also the existence of things in their own nature.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the morning and evening knowledge are one?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the morning and the evening knowledge are one. 
For it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:5">Gn. 1:5</a>): "There was evening and morning, one day." But 
by the expression "day" the knowledge of the angels is to be understood, 
as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 23). Therefore the morning and 
evening knowledge of the angels are one and the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is impossible for one faculty to have two operations 
at the same time. But the angels are always using their morning 
knowledge; because they are always beholding God and things in God, 
according to Mt. 18:10. Therefore, if the evening knowledge were 
different from the morning, the angel could never exercise his evening 
knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13:10">1 Cor. 13:10</a>): "When that which is 
perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." But, if 
the evening knowledge be different from the morning, it is compared to it 
as the less perfect to the perfect. Therefore the evening knowledge 
cannot exist together with the morning knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24): "There is a vast 
difference between knowing anything as it is in the Word of God, and as 
it is in its own nature; so that the former belongs to the day, and the 
latter to the evening."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was observed (<A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), the evening knowledge is that by 
which the angels know things in their proper nature. This cannot be 
understood as if they drew their knowledge from the proper nature of 
things, so that the preposition "in" denotes the form of a principle; 
because, as has been already stated (<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the angels do not draw 
their knowledge from things. It follows, then, that when we say "in their 
proper nature" we refer to the aspect of the thing known in so far as it 
is an object of knowledge; that is to say, that the evening knowledge is 
in the angels in so far as they know the being of things which those 
things have in their own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now they know this through a twofold medium, namely, by innate ideas, or 
by the forms of things existing in the Word. For by beholding the Word, 
they know not merely the being of things as existing in the Word, but the 
being as possessed by the things themselves; as God by contemplating 
Himself sees that being which things have in their own nature. It, 
therefore, it be called evening knowledge, in so far as when the angels 
behold the Word, they know the being which things have in their proper 
nature, then the morning and the evening knowledge are essentially one 
and the same, and only differ as to the things known. If it be called 
evening knowledge, in so far as through innate ideas they know the being 
which things have in their own natures, then the morning and the evening 
knowledge differ. Thus Augustine seems to understand it  when he assigns 
one as inferior to the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The six days, as Augustine understands them, are taken as 
the six classes of things known by the angels; so that the day's unit is 
taken according to the unit of the thing understood; which, nevertheless, 
can be apprehended by various ways of knowing it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There can be two operations of the same faculty at the one 
time, one of which is referred to the other; as is evident when the will 
at the same time wills the end and the means to the end; and the 
intellect at the same instant perceives principles and conclusions 
through those principles, when it has already acquired knowledge. As 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24), the evening knowledge is referred 
to the morning knowledge in the angels; hence there is nothing to hinder 
both from being at the same time in the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[58] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> On the coming of what is perfect, the opposite imperfect is 
done away: just as faith, which is of the things that are not seen, is 
made void when vision succeeds. But the imperfection of the evening 
knowledge is not opposed to the perfection of the morning knowledge. For 
that a thing be known in itself, is not opposite to its being known in 
its cause. Nor, again, is there any inconsistency in knowing a thing 
through two mediums, one of which is more perfect and the other less 
perfect; just as we can have a demonstrative and a probable medium for 
reaching the same conclusion. In like manner a thing can be known by the 
angel through the uncreated Word, and through an innate idea.<br>
