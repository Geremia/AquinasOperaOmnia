    Whether "Love" is the proper name of the Holy Ghost?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "Love" is not the proper name
    of the Holy Ghost. For Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 17): "As the Father, Son
    and Holy Ghost are called Wisdom, and are not three Wisdoms, but one; I know
    not why the Father, Son and Holy Ghost should not be called Charity, and all
    together one Charity." But no name which is predicated in the singular of
    each person and of all together, is a proper name of a person. Therefore
    this name, "Love," is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Holy Ghost is a subsisting person,
    but love is not used to signify a subsisting person, but rather an action
    passing from the lover to the beloved. Therefore Love is not the proper name
    of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Love is the bond between lovers, for as
    Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): "Love is a unitive force." But a bond is a
    medium between what it joins together, not something proceeding from them.
    Therefore, since the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, as was
    shown above (<a href="FP036.html#FPQ36OUTP1">Question [36]</a>,
    <a href="FP036.html#FPQ36A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it seems that He is not
    the Love or bond of the Father and the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Love belongs to every lover. But the
    Holy Ghost is a lover: therefore He has love. So if the Holy Ghost is Love,
    He must be love of love, and spirit from spirit; which is not admissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xxx, in Pentecost.): "The
    Holy Ghost Himself is Love."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The name Love in God can be taken essentially
    and personally. If taken personally it is the proper name of the Holy Ghost;
    as Word is the proper name of the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To see this we must know that since as shown above (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,4,5), there are two
    processions in God, one by way of the intellect, which is the procession of
    the Word, and another by way of the will, which is the procession of Love;
    forasmuch as the former is the more known to us, we have been able to apply
    more suitable names to express our various considerations as regards that
    procession, but not as regards the procession of the will. Hence, we are
    obliged to employ circumlocution as regards the person Who proceeds, and the
    relations following from this procession which are called "procession" and
    "spiration," as stated above (<a href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3), and yet express
    the origin rather than the relation in the strict sense of the term.
    Nevertheless we must consider them in respect of each procession simply. For
    as when a thing is understood by anyone, there results in the one who
    understands a conception of the object understood, which conception we call
    word; so when anyone loves an object, a certain impression results, so to
    speak, of the thing loved in the affection of the lover; by reason of which
    the object loved is said to be in the lover; as also the thing understood is
    in the one who understands; so that when anyone understands and loves
    himself he is in himself, not only by real identity, but also as the object
    understood is in the one who understands, and the thing loved is in the
    lover. As regards the intellect, however, words have been found to describe
    the mutual relation of the one who understands the object understood, as
    appears in the word "to understand"; and other words are used to express the
    procession of the intellectual conception---namely, "to speak," and "word."
    Hence in God, "to understand" is applied only to the essence; because it
    does not import relation to the Word that proceeds; whereas "Word" is said
    personally, because it signifies what proceeds; and the term "to speak" is a
    notional term as importing the relation of the principle of the Word to the
    Word Himself. On the other hand, on the part of the will, with the exception
    of the words "dilection" and "love," which express the relation of the lover
    to the object loved, there are no other terms in use, which express the
    relation of the impression or affection of the object loved, produced in the
    lover by fact that he loves---to the principle of that impression, or "vice
    versa." And therefore, on account of the poverty of our vocabulary, we
    express these relations by the words "love" and "dilection": just as if we
    were to call the Word "intelligence conceived," or "wisdom begotten."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows that so far as love means only the relation of the lover to the
    object loved, "love" and "to love" are said of the essence, as
    "understanding" and "to understand"; but, on the other hand, so far as these
    words are used to express the relation to its principle, of what proceeds by
    way of love, and "vice versa," so that by "love" is understood the "love
    proceeding," and by "to love" is understood "the spiration of the love
    proceeding," in that sense "love" is the name of the person and "to love" is
    a notional term, as "to speak" and "to beget."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is there speaking of charity
    as it means the divine essence, as was said above (here and
    <a href="FP024.html#FPQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="FP024.html#FPQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although to understand, and to will, and
    to love signify actions passing on to their objects, nevertheless they are
    actions that remain in the agents, as stated above (<a
      href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), yet in such a way
    that in the agent itself they import a certain relation to their object.
    Hence, love also in ourselves is something that abides in the lover, and the
    word of the heart is something abiding in the speaker; yet with a relation
    to the thing expressed by word, or loved. But in God, in whom there is
    nothing accidental, there is more than this; because both Word and Love are
    subsistent. Therefore, when we say that the Holy Ghost is the Love of the
    Father for the Son, or for something else; we do not mean anything that
    passes into another, but only the relation of love to the beloved; as also
    in the Word is imported the relation of the Word to the thing expressed by
    the Word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Holy Ghost is said to be the bond of
    the Father and Son, inasmuch as He is Love; because, since the Father loves
    Himself and the Son with one Love, and conversely, there is expressed in the
    Holy Ghost, as Love, the relation of the Father to the Son, and conversely,
    as that of the lover to the beloved. But from the fact that the Father and
    the Son mutually love one another, it necessarily follows that this mutual
    Love, the Holy Ghost, proceeds from both. As regards origin, therefore, the
    Holy Ghost is not the medium, but the third person in the Trinity; whereas
    as regards the aforesaid relation He is the bond between the two persons, as
    proceeding from both.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As it does not belong to the Son, though
    He understands, to produce a word, for it belongs to Him to understand as
    the word proceeding; so in like manner, although the Holy Ghost loves,
    taking Love as an essential term, still it does not belong to Him to spirate
    love, which is to take love as a notional term; because He loves essentially
    as love proceeding; but not as the one whence love proceeds.<br />

    Whether the Father and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Father and the Son do not
    love each other by the Holy Ghost. For Augustine (De Trin. vii, 1) proves
    that the Father is not wise by the Wisdom begotten. But as the Son is Wisdom
    begotten, so the Holy Ghost is the Love proceeding, as explained above (<a
      href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FP027.html#FPQ27A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore the Father
    and the Son do not love Themselves by the Love proceeding, which is the Holy
    Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the proposition, "The Father and the Son
    love each other by the Holy Ghost," this word "love" is to be taken either
    essentially or notionally. But it cannot be true if taken essentially,
    because in the same way we might say that "the Father understands by the
    Son"; nor, again, if it is taken notionally, for then, in like manner, it
    might be said that "the Father and the Son spirate by the Holy Ghost," or
    that "the Father generates by the Son." Therefore in no way is this
    proposition true: "'The Father and the Son love each other by the Holy
    Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by the same love the Father loves the
    Son, and Himself, and us. But the Father does not love Himself by the Holy
    Ghost; for no notional act is reflected back on the principle of the act;
    since it cannot be said that the "Father begets Himself," or that "He
    spirates Himself." Therefore, neither can it be said that "He loves Himself
    by the Holy Ghost," if "to love" is taken in a notional sense. Again, the
    love wherewith He loves us is not the Holy Ghost; because it imports a
    relation to creatures, and this belongs to the essence. Therefore this also
    is false: "The Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 5): "The Holy
    Ghost is He whereby the Begotten is loved by the one begetting and loves His
    Begetter."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A difficulty about this question is objected to
    the effect that when we say, "the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost,"
    since the ablative is construed as denoting a cause, it seems to mean that
    the Holy Ghost is the principle of love to the Father and the Son; which
    cannot be admitted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In view of this difficulty some have held that it is false, that "the Father
    and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost"; and they add that it was
    retracted by Augustine when he retracted its equivalent to the effect that
    "the Father is wise by the Wisdom begotten." Others say that the proposition
    is inaccurate and ought to be expounded, as that "the Father loves the Son
    by the Holy Ghost"---that is, "by His essential Love," which is appropriated
    to the Holy Ghost. Others further say that this ablative should be construed
    as importing a sign, so that it means, "the Holy Ghost is the sign that the
    Father loves the Son"; inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds from them both,
    as Love. Others, again, say that this ablative must be construed as
    importing the relation of formal cause, because the Holy Ghost is the love
    whereby the Father and the Son formally love each other. Others, again, say
    that it should be construed as importing the relation of a formal effect;
    and these approach nearer to the truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To make the matter clear, we must consider that since a thing is commonly
    denominated from its forms, as "white" from whiteness, and "man" from
    humanity; everything whence anything is denominated, in this particular
    respect stands to that thing in the relation of form. So when I say, "this
    man is clothed with a garment," the ablative is to be construed as having
    relation to the formal cause, although the garment is not the form. Now it
    may happen that a thing may be denominated from that which proceeds from it,
    not only as an agent is from its action, but also as from the term itself of
    the action---that is, the effect, when the effect itself is included in the
    idea of the action. For we say that fire warms by heating, although heating
    is not the heat which is the form of the fire, but is an action proceeding
    from the fire; and we say that a tree flowers with the flower, although the
    flower is not the tree's form, but is the effect proceeding from the form.
    In this way, therefore, we must say that since in God "to love" is taken in
    two ways, essentially and notionally, when it is taken essentially, it means
    that the Father and the Son love each other not by the Holy Ghost, but by
    their essence. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 7): "Who dares to say that
    the Father loves neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, except by
    the Holy Ghost?" The opinions first quoted are to be taken in this sense.
    But when the term Love is taken in a notional sense it means nothing else
    than "to spirate love"; just as to speak is to produce a word, and to flower
    is to produce flowers. As therefore we say that a tree flowers by its
    flower, so do we say that the Father, by the Word or the Son, speaks
    Himself, and His creatures; and that the Father and the Son love each other
    and us, by the Holy Ghost, or by Love proceeding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To be wise or intelligent is taken only
    essentially in God; therefore we cannot say that "the Father is wise or
    intelligent by the Son." But to love is taken not only essentially, but also
    in a notional sense; and in this way, we can say that the Father and the Son
    love each other by the Holy Ghost, as was above explained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the idea of an action includes a
    determined effect, the principle of the action may be denominated both from
    the action, and from the effect; so we can say, for instance, that a tree
    flowers by its flowering and by its flower. When, however, the idea of an
    action does not include a determined effect, then in that case, the
    principle of the action cannot be denominated from the effect, but only from
    the action. For we do not say that the tree produces the flower by the
    flower, but by the production of the flower. So when we say, "spirates" or
    "begets," this imports only a notional act. Hence we cannot say that the
    Father spirates by the Holy Ghost, or begets by the Son. But we can say that
    the Father speaks by the Word, as by the Person proceeding, "and speaks by
    the speaking," as by a notional act; forasmuch as "to speak" imports a
    determinate person proceeding; since "to speak" means to produce a word.
    Likewise to love, taken in a notional sense, means to produce love; and so
    it can be said that the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost, as by the
    person proceeding, and by Love itself as a notional act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Father loves not only the Son, but
    also Himself and us, by the Holy Ghost; because, as above explained, to
    love, taken in a notional sense, not only imports the production of a divine
    person, but also the person produced, by way of love, which has relation to
    the object loved. Hence, as the Father speaks Himself and every creature by
    His begotten Word, inasmuch as the Word "begotten" adequately represents the
    Father and every creature; so He loves Himself and every creature by the
    Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love of the primal
    goodness whereby the Father loves Himself and every creature. Thus it is
    evident that relation to the creature is implied both in the Word and in the
    proceeding Love, as it were in a secondary way, inasmuch as the divine truth
    and goodness are a principle of understanding and loving all creatures.<br />
