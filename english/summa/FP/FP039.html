<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Those things considered which belong to the divine persons absolutely, 
we next treat of what concerns the person in reference to the essence, to 
the properties, and to the notional acts; and of the comparison of these 
with each other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the first of these, there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the essence in God is the same as the person?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether we should say that the three persons are of one essence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether essential names should be predicated of the persons in the 
plural, or in the singular? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether notional adjectives, or verbs, or participles, can be 
predicated of the essential names taken in a concrete sense?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in God the essence is not the same as person. 
For whenever essence is the same as person or "suppositum," there can be 
only one "suppositum" of one nature, as is clear in the case of all 
separate substances. For in those things which are really one and the 
same, one cannot be multiplied apart from the other. But in God there is 
one essence and three persons, as is clear from what is above expounded 
(<A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore essence is not the same as person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, simultaneous affirmation and negation of the same things 
in the same respect cannot be true. But affirmation and negation are true 
of essence and of person. For person is distinct, whereas essence is not. 
Therefore person and essence are not the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing can be subject to itself. But person is subject 
to essence; whence it is called "suppositum" or "hypostasis." Therefore 
person is not the same as essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 7): "When we say the 
person of the Father we mean nothing else but the substance of the 
Father."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The truth of this question is quite clear if we consider 
the divine simplicity. For it was shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that the 
divine simplicity requires that in God essence is the same as 
"suppositum," which in intellectual substances is nothing else than 
person. But a difficulty seems to arise from the fact that while the 
divine persons are multiplied, the essence nevertheless retains its 
unity. And because, as Boethius says (De Trin. i), "relation multiplies 
the Trinity of persons," some have thought that in God essence and person 
differ, forasmuch as they held the relations to be "adjacent"; 
considering only in the relations the idea of "reference to another," and 
not the relations as realities. But as it was shown above (<A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="FP028.html#FPQ28A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) 
in creatures relations are accidental, whereas in God they are the divine 
essence itself. Thence it follows that in God essence is not really 
distinct from person; and yet that the persons are really distinguished 
from each other. For person, as above stated (<A Href="FP029.html#FPQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="FP029.html#FPQ29A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), signifies 
relation as subsisting in the divine nature. But relation as referred to 
the essence does not differ therefrom really, but only in our way of  
thinking; while as referred to an opposite relation, it has a real 
distinction by virtue of that opposition. Thus there are one essence and 
three persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There cannot be a distinction of "suppositum" in creatures 
by means of relations, but only by essential principles; because in 
creatures relations are not subsistent. But in God relations are 
subsistent, and so by reason of the opposition between them they 
distinguish the "supposita"; and yet the essence is not distinguished, 
because the relations themselves are not distinguished from each other so 
far as they are identified with the essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As essence and person in God differ in our way of thinking, 
it follows that something can be denied of the one and affirmed of the 
other; and therefore, when we suppose the one, we need not suppose the 
other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Divine things are named by us after the way of created 
things, as above explained (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). And since created natures 
are individualized by matter which is the subject of the specific nature, 
it follows that individuals are called "subjects," "supposita," or 
"hypostases." So the divine persons are named "supposita" or 
"hypostases," but not as if there really existed any real "supposition" 
or "subjection."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it must be said that the three persons are of one essence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem not right to say that the three persons are of one 
essence. For Hilary says (De Synod.) that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost 
"are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony." But the substance of 
God is His essence. Therefore the three persons are not of one essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be 
confirmed by the authority of Holy Writ, as appears from Dionysius (Div. 
Nom. i). Now Holy Writ never says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are 
of one essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the divine nature is the same as the divine essence. It 
suffices therefore to say that the three persons are of one nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is not usual to say that the person is of the 
essence; but rather that the essence is of the person. Therefore it does 
not seem fitting to say that the three persons are of one essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 6) that we do not say that 
the three persons are "from one essence [ex una essentia]," lest we 
should seem to indicate a distinction between the essence and the persons 
in God. But prepositions which imply  transition, denote the oblique 
case. Therefore it is equally wrong to say that the three persons are "of 
one essence [unius essentiae]."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, nothing should be said of God which can be occasion of 
error. Now, to say that the three persons are of one essence or 
substance, furnishes occasion of error. For, as Hilary says (De Synod.): 
"One substance predicated of the Father and the Son signifies either one 
subsistent, with two denominations; or one substance divided into two 
imperfect substances; or a third prior substance taken and assumed by the 
other two." Therefore it must not be said that the three persons are of 
one substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii) that the word 
{homoousion}, which the Council of Nicaea adopted against the Arians, 
means that the three persons are of one essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above explained (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), divine things are 
named by our intellect, not as they really are in themselves, for in that 
way it knows them not; but in a way that belongs to things created. And 
as in the objects of the senses, whence the intellect derives its 
knowledge, the nature of the species is made individual by the matter, 
and thus the nature is as the form, and the individual is the 
"suppositum" of the form; so also in God the essence is taken as the form 
of the three persons, according to our mode of signification. Now in 
creatures we say that every form belongs to that whereof it is the form; 
as the health and beauty of a man belongs to the man. But we do not say 
of that which has a form, that it belongs to the form, unless some 
adjective qualifies the form; as when we say: "That woman is of a 
handsome figure," or: "This man is of perfect virtue." In like manner, as 
in God the persons are multiplied, and the essence is not multiplied, we 
speak of one essence of the three persons, and three persons of the one 
essence, provided that these genitives be understood as designating the 
form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Substance is here taken for the "hypostasis," and not for 
the essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ in so 
many words that the three persons are of one essence, nevertheless we 
find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, "I and the Father 
are one (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A30">Jn. 10:30</a>)," and "I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A38">Jn. 10:38</a>)"; and there are many other texts of the same import.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Because "nature" designates the principle of action while 
"essence" comes from being [essendo], things may be said to be of one 
nature which agree in some action, as all things which give heat; but 
only those things can be said to be of "one essence" which have one 
being. So the divine unity is better described by saying that the three 
persons are "of one essence," than by saying they are "of one nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Form, in the absolute sense, is wont to be designated as 
belonging to that of which it is the form, as we say "the virtue of 
Peter." On the other hand, the thing having form is not wont to be 
designated as belonging to the form except when we wish to qualify or 
designate the form. In which case two genitives are required, one 
signifying the form, and the other signifying the determination of the 
form, as, for instance, when we say, "Peter is of great virtue [magnae 
virtutis]," or else one genitive must have the force of two, as, for 
instance, "he is a man of blood"---that is, he is a man who sheds much 
blood [multi sanguinis]. So, because the divine essence signifies a form 
as regards the person, it may properly be said that the essence is of the 
person; but we cannot say the converse, unless we add some term to 
designate the essence; as, for instance, the Father is a person of the 
"divine essence"; or, the three persons are "of one essence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The preposition "from" or "out of" does not designate the 
habitude of a formal cause, but rather the habitude of an efficient or 
material cause; which causes are in all cases distinguished from those 
things of which they are the causes. For nothing can be its own matter, 
nor its own active principle. Yet a thing may be its own form, as appears 
in all immaterial things. So, when we say, "three persons of one 
essence," taking essence as having the habitude of form, we do not mean 
that essence is different from person, which we should mean if we said, 
"three persons from the same essence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> As Hilary says (De Synod.): "It would be prejudicial to 
holy things, if we had to do away with them, just because some do not 
think them holy. So if some misunderstand {homoousion}, what is that to 
me, if I understand it rightly? . . . The oneness of nature does not 
result from division, or from union or from community of possession, but 
from one nature being proper to both Father and Son."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether essential names should be predicated in the singular of the three persons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that essential names, as the name "God," should not 
be predicated in the singular of the three persons, but in the plural. 
For as "man" signifies "one that has humanity," so God signifies "one 
that has Godhead." But the three persons are three who have Godhead. 
Therefore the three persons are "three Gods."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gn. 1:1, where it is said, "In the beginning God created 
heaven and earth," the Hebrew original has "Elohim," which may be 
rendered "Gods" or "Judges": and this word is used on account of the 
plurality of persons. Therefore the three persons are "several Gods," and 
not "one" God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this word "thing" when it is said absolutely, seems to 
belong to substance. But it is predicated of the three  persons in the 
plural. For Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5): "The things that are 
the objects of our future glory are the Father, Son and Holy Ghost." 
Therefore other essential names can be predicated in the plural of the 
three persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as this word "God" signifies "a being who has Deity," so 
also this word "person" signifies a being subsisting in an intellectual 
nature. But we say there are three persons. So for the same reason we can 
say there are "three Gods."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++6%3A4">Dt. 6:4</a>): "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God 
is one God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some essential names signify the essence after the manner 
of substantives; while others signify it after the manner of adjectives. 
Those which signify it as substantives are predicated of the three 
persons in the singular only, and not in the plural. Those which signify 
the essence as adjectives are predicated of the three persons in the 
plural. The reason of this is that substantives signify something by way 
of substance, while adjectives signify something by way of accident, 
which adheres to a subject. Now just as substance has existence of 
itself, so also it has of itself unity or multitude; wherefore the 
singularity or plurality of a substantive name depends upon the form 
signified by the name. But as accidents have their existence in a 
subject, so they have unity or plurality from their subject; and 
therefore the singularity and plurality of adjectives depends upon their 
"supposita." In creatures, one form does not exist in several "supposita" 
except by unity of order, as the form of an ordered multitude. So if the 
names signifying such a form are substantives, they are predicated of 
many in the singular, but otherwise if they adjectives. For we say that 
many men are a college, or an army, or a people; but we say that many men 
are collegians. Now in God the divine essence is signified by way of a 
form, as above explained (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), which, indeed, is simple and supremely 
one, as shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). So, names which signify 
the divine essence in a substantive manner are predicated of the three 
persons in the singular, and not in the plural. This, then, is the reason 
why we say that Socrates, Plato and Cicero are "three men"; whereas we do 
not say the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are "three Gods," but "one God"; 
forasmuch as in the three "supposita" of human nature there are three 
humanities, whereas in the three divine Persons there is but one divine 
essence. On the other hand, the names which signify essence in an 
adjectival manner are predicated of the three persons plurally, by reason 
of the plurality of "supposita." For we say there are three "existent" or 
three "wise" beings, or three "eternal," "uncreated," and "immense" 
beings, if these terms are understood in an adjectival sense. But if 
taken in a substantive sense, we say "one uncreated, immense, eternal 
being," as Athanasius declares.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Though the name "God" signifies a being having Godhead, 
nevertheless the mode of signification is different. For the name "God" 
is used substantively; whereas "having Godhead" is  used adjectively. 
Consequently, although there are "three having Godhead," it does not 
follow that there are three Gods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Various languages have diverse modes of expression. So as 
by reason of the plurality of "supposita" the Greeks said "three 
hypostases," so also in Hebrew "Elohim" is in the plural. We, however, do 
not apply the plural either to "God" or to "substance," lest plurality be 
referred to the substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This word "thing" is one of the transcendentals. Whence, so 
far as it is referred to relation, it is predicated of God in the plural; 
whereas, so far as it is referred to the substance, it is predicated in 
the singular. So Augustine says, in the passage quoted, that "the same 
Trinity is a thing supreme."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The form signified by the word "person" is not essence or 
nature, but personality. So, as there are three personalities---that is, 
three personal properties in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost---it is 
predicated of the three, not in the singular, but in the plural.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the concrete, essential names cannot stand for 
the person, so that we can truly say "God begot God." For, as the 
logicians say, "a singular term signifies what it stands for." But this 
name "God" seems to be a singular term, for it cannot be predicated in 
the plural, as above explained (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, since it signifies the 
essence, it stands for essence, and not for person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a term in the subject is not modified by a term in the 
predicate, as to its signification; but only as to the sense signified in 
the predicate. But when I say, "God creates," this name "God" stands for 
the essence. So when we say "God begot," this term "God" cannot by reason 
of the notional predicate, stand for person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if this be true, "God begot," because the Father 
generates; for the same reason this is true, "God does not beget," 
because the Son does not beget. Therefore there is God who begets, and 
there is God who does not beget; and thus it follows that there are two 
Gods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if "God begot God," He begot either God, that is 
Himself, or another God. But He did not beget God, that is Himself; for, 
as Augustine says (De Trin. i, 1), "nothing begets itself." Neither did 
He beget another God; as there is only one God. Therefore it is false to 
say, "God begot God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if "God begot God," He begot either God who is the 
Father, or God who is not the Father. If God who is the Father, then God 
the Father was begotten. If God who is not the Father,  then there is a 
God who is not God the Father: which is false. Therefore it cannot be 
said that "God begot God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In the Creed it is said, "God of God."
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that this name "God" and the like, 
properly according to their nature, stand for the essence, but by reason 
of some notional adjunct are made to stand for the Person. This opinion 
apparently arose from considering the divine simplicity, which requires 
that in God, He "who possesses" and "what is possessed" be the same. So 
He who possesses Godhead, which is signified by the name God, is the same 
as Godhead. But when we consider the proper way of expressing ourselves, 
the mode of signification must be considered no less than the thing 
signified. Hence as this word "God" signifies the divine essence as in 
Him Who possesses it, just as the name "man" signifies humanity in a 
subject, others more truly have said that this word "God," from its mode 
of signification, can, in its proper sense, stand for person, as does the 
word "man." So this word "God" sometimes stands for the essence, as when 
we say "God creates"; because this predicate is attributed to the subject 
by reason of the form signified---that is, Godhead. But sometimes it 
stands for the person, either for only one, as when we say, "God begets," 
or for two, as when we say, "God spirates"; or for three, as when it is 
said: "To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God," etc. (1 
Tim. 1:17).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although this name "God" agrees with singular terms as 
regards the form signified not being multiplied; nevertheless it agrees 
also with general terms so far as the form signified is to be found in 
several "supposita." So it need not always stand for the essence it 
signifies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This holds good against those who say that the word "God" 
does not naturally stand for person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The word "God" stands for the person in a different way 
from that in which this word "man" does; for since the form signified by 
this word "man"---that is, humanity---is really divided among its 
different subjects, it stands of itself for the person, even if there is 
no adjunct determining it to the person---that is, to a distinct subject. 
The unity or community of the human nature, however, is not a reality, 
but is only in the consideration of the mind. Hence this term "man" does 
not stand for the common nature, unless this is required by some adjunct, 
as when we say, "man is a species"; whereas the form signified by the 
name "God"---that is, the divine essence---is really one and common. So 
of itself it stands for the common nature, but by some adjunct it may be 
restricted so as to stand for the person. So, when we say, "God 
generates," by reason of the notional act this name "God" stands for the 
person of the Father. But when we say, "God does not generate," there is 
no adjunct to determine this name to the person of the Son, and hence the 
phrase means that generation is repugnant to the divine nature. If, 
however, something be added belonging to the person of the Son, this 
proposition, for instance, "God  begotten does not beget," is true. 
Consequently, it does not follow that there exists a "God generator," and 
a "God not generator"; unless there be an adjunct pertaining to the 
persons; as, for instance, if we were to say, "the Father is God the 
generator" and the "Son is God the non-generator" and so it does not 
follow that there are many Gods; for the Father and the Son are one God, 
as was said above (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This is false, "the Father begot God, that is Himself," 
because the word "Himself," as a reciprocal term, refers to the same 
"suppositum." Nor is this contrary to what Augustine says (Ep. lxvi ad 
Maxim.) that "God the Father begot another self [alterum se]," forasmuch 
as the word "se" is either in the ablative case, and then it means "He 
begot another from Himself," or it indicates a single relation, and thus 
points to identity of nature. This is, however, either a figurative or an 
emphatic way of speaking, so that it would really mean, "He begot another 
most like to Himself." Likewise also it is false to say, "He begot 
another God," because although the Son is another than the Father, as 
above explained (<A Href="FP031.html#FPQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="FP031.html#FPQ31A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), nevertheless it cannot be said that He is 
"another God"; forasmuch as this adjective "another" would be understood 
to apply to the substantive God; and thus the meaning would be that there 
is a distinction of Godhead. Yet this proposition "He begot another God" 
is tolerated by some, provided that "another" be taken as a substantive, 
and the word "God" be construed in apposition with it. This, however, is 
an inexact way of speaking, and to be avoided, for fear of giving 
occasion to error.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> To say, "God begot God Who is God the Father," is wrong, 
because since the word "Father" is construed in apposition to "God," the 
word "God" is restricted to the person of the Father; so that it would 
mean, "He begot God, Who is Himself the Father"; and then the Father 
would be spoken of as begotten, which is false. Wherefore the negative of 
the proposition is true, "He begot God Who is not God the Father." If 
however, we understand these words not to be in apposition, and require 
something to be added, then, on the contrary, the affirmative proposition 
is true, and the negative is false; so that the meaning would be, "He 
begot God Who is God Who is the Father." Such a rendering however appears 
to be forced, so that it is better to say simply that the affirmative 
proposition is false, and the negative is true. Yet Prepositivus said 
that both the negative and affirmative are false, because this relative 
"Who" in the affirmative proposition can be referred to the "suppositum"; 
whereas in the negative it denotes both the thing signified and the 
"suppositum." Whence, in the affirmative the sense is that "to be God the 
Father" is befitting to the person of the Son; and in the negative sense 
is that "to be God the Father," is to be removed from the Son's divinity 
as well as from His personality. This, however, appears to be irrational; 
since, according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm. ii), what is open to 
affirmation, is open also to negation.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that abstract essential names can stand for the 
person, so that this proposition is true, "Essence begets essence." For 
Augustine says (De Trin. vii, i, 2): "The Father and the Son are one 
Wisdom, because they are one essence; and taken singly Wisdom is from 
Wisdom, as essence from essence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, generation or corruption in ourselves implies generation 
or corruption of what is within us. But the Son is generated. Therefore 
since the divine essence is in the Son, it seems that the divine essence 
is generated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God and the divine essence are the same, as is clear 
from what is above explained (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But, as was shown, it is true 
to say that "God begets God." Therefore this is also true: "Essence 
begets essence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a predicate can stand for that of which it is 
predicated. But the Father is the divine essence; therefore essence can 
stand for the person of the Father. Thus the essence begets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the essence is "a thing begetting," because the essence 
is the Father who is begetting. Therefore if the essence is not 
begetting, the essence will be "a thing begetting," and "not begetting": 
which cannot be.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): "The Father is the 
principle of the whole Godhead." But He is principle only by begetting or 
spirating. Therefore the Father begets or spirates the Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. i, 1): "Nothing begets 
itself." But if the essence begets the essence, it begets itself only, 
since nothing exists in God as distinguished from the divine essence. 
Therefore the essence does not beget essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Concerning this, the abbot Joachim erred in asserting 
that as we can say "God begot God," so we can say "Essence begot 
essence": considering that, by reason of the divine simplicity God is 
nothing else but the divine essence. In this he was wrong, because if we 
wish to express ourselves correctly, we must take into account not only 
the thing which is signified, but also the mode of its signification as 
above stated (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now although "God" is really the same as "Godhead," 
nevertheless the mode of signification is not in each case the same. For 
since this word "God" signifies the divine essence in Him that possesses 
it, from its mode of signification it can of its own nature stand for 
person. Thus the things which properly belong to the persons, can be 
predicated of this word, "God," as, for instance, we can say "God is 
begotten" or is "Begetter," as above explained (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). The word 
"essence," however, in its mode of signification, cannot stand for 
Person, because it signifies the essence as an abstract form. 
Consequently, what properly belongs to the persons whereby they are  
distinguished from each other, cannot be attributed to the essence. For 
that would imply distinction in the divine essence, in the same way as 
there exists distinction in the "supposita."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To express unity of essence and of person, the holy Doctors 
have sometimes expressed themselves with greater emphasis than the strict 
propriety of terms allows. Whence instead of enlarging upon such 
expressions we should rather explain them: thus, for instance, abstract 
names should be explained by concrete names, or even by personal names; 
as when we find "essence from essence"; or "wisdom from wisdom"; we 
should take the sense to be, "the Son" who is essence and wisdom, is from 
the Father who is essence and wisdom. Nevertheless, as regards these 
abstract names a certain order should be observed, forasmuch as what 
belongs to action is more nearly allied to the persons because actions 
belong to "supposita." So "nature from nature," and "wisdom from wisdom" 
are less inexact than "essence from essence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In creatures the one generated has not the same nature 
numerically as the generator, but another nature, numerically distinct, 
which commences to exist in it anew by generation, and ceases to exist by 
corruption, and so it is generated and corrupted accidentally; whereas 
God begotten has the same nature numerically as the begetter. So the 
divine nature in the Son is not begotten either directly or accidentally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although God and the divine essence are really the same, 
nevertheless, on account of their different mode of signification, we 
must speak in a different way about each of them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The divine essence is predicated of the Father by mode of 
identity by reason of the divine simplicity; yet it does not follow that 
it can stand for the Father, its mode of signification being different. 
This objection would hold good as regards things which are predicated of 
another as the universal of a particular.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The difference between substantive and adjectival names 
consist in this, that the former carry their subject with them, whereas 
the latter do not, but add the thing signified to the substantive. Whence 
logicians are wont to say that the substantive is considered in the light 
of "suppositum," whereas the adjective indicates something added to the 
"suppositum." Therefore substantive personal terms can be predicated of 
the essence, because they are really the same; nor does it follow that a 
personal property makes a distinct essence; but it belongs to the 
"suppositum" implied in the substantive. But notional and personal 
adjectives cannot be predicated of the essence unless we add some 
substantive. We cannot say that the "essence is begetting"; yet we can 
say that the "essence is a thing begetting," or that it is "God 
begetting," if "thing" and God stand for person, but not if they stand 
for essence. Consequently there exists no contradiction in saying that 
"essence is a thing begetting," and "a thing not begetting"; because in 
the first case "thing" stands for person,  and in the second it stands 
for the essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> So far as Godhead is one in several "supposita," it agrees 
in a certain degree with the form of a collective term. So when we say, 
"the Father is the principle of the whole Godhead," the term Godhead can 
be taken for all the persons together, inasmuch as it is the principle in 
all the divine persons. Nor does it follow that He is His own principle; 
as one of the people may be called the ruler of the people without being 
ruler of himself. We may also say that He is the principle of the whole 
Godhead; not as generating or spirating it, but as communicating it by 
generation and spiration.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the persons cannot be predicated of the 
concrete essential names; so that we can say for instance, "God is three 
persons"; or "God is the Trinity." For it is false to say, "man is every 
man," because it cannot be verified as regards any particular subject. 
For neither Socrates, nor Plato, nor anyone else is every man. In the 
same way this proposition, "God is the Trinity," cannot be verified of 
any one of the "supposita" of the divine nature. For the Father is not 
the Trinity; nor is the Son; nor is the Holy Ghost. So to say, "God is 
the Trinity," is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the lower is not predicated of the higher except by 
accidental predication; as when I say, "animal is man"; for it is 
accidental to animal to be man. But this name "God" as regards the three 
persons is as a general term to inferior terms, as Damascene says (De 
Fide Orth. iii, 4). Therefore it seems that the names of the persons 
cannot be predicated of this name "God," except in an accidental sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says, in his sermon on Faith [*Serm. ii, in 
coena Domini], "We believe that one God is one divinely named Trinity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above explained (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), although adjectival terms, 
whether personal or notional, cannot be predicated of the essence, 
nevertheless substantive terms can be so predicated, owing to the real 
identity of essence and person. The divine essence is not only really the 
same as one person, but it is really the same as the three persons. 
Whence, one person, and two, and three, can be predicated of the essence 
as if we were to say, "The essence is the Father, and the Son, and the 
Holy Ghost." And because this word "God" can of itself stand for the 
essence, as above explained (<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3), hence, as it is true to say, 
"The essence is the three persons"; so likewise it is true to say, "God 
is the three persons."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As above explained this term "man" can of itself stand for 
person, whereas an adjunct is required for it to stand for the universal 
human nature. So it is false to say, "Man is  every man"; because it 
cannot be verified of any particular human subject. On the contrary, this 
word "God" can of itself be taken for the divine essence. So, although to 
say of any of the "supposita" of the divine nature, "God is the Trinity," 
is untrue, nevertheless it is true of the divine essence. This was denied 
by Porretanus because he did not take note of this distinction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When we say, "God," or "the divine essence is the Father," 
the predication is one of identity, and not of the lower in regard to a 
higher species: because in God there is no universal and singular. Hence, 
as this proposition, "The Father is God" is of itself true, so this 
proposition "God is the Father" is true of itself, and by no means 
accidentally.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the essential names should not be appropriated 
to the persons. For whatever might verge on error in faith should be 
avoided in the treatment of divine things; for, as Jerome says, "careless 
words involve risk of heresy" [*In substance Ep. lvii.]. But to 
appropriate to any one person the names which are common to the three 
persons, may verge on error in faith; for it may be supposed either that 
such belong only to the person to whom they are appropriated or that they 
belong to Him in a fuller degree than to the others. Therefore the 
essential attributes should not be appropriated to the persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the essential attributes expressed in the abstract 
signify by mode of form. But one person is not as a form to another; 
since a form is not distinguished in subject from that of which it is the 
form. Therefore the essential attributes, especially when expressed in 
the abstract, are not to be appropriated to the persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, property is prior to the appropriated, for property is 
included in the idea of the appropriated. But the essential attributes, 
in our way of understanding, are prior to the persons; as what is common 
is prior to what is proper. Therefore the essential attributes are not to 
be appropriated to the persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> the Apostle says: "Christ the power of God and the 
wisdom of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++1%3A24">1 Cor. 1:24</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> For the manifestation of our faith it is fitting that the 
essential attributes should be appropriated to the persons. For although 
the trinity of persons cannot be proved by demonstration, as was above 
expounded (<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), nevertheless it is fitting that it be declared 
by things which are more known to us. Now the essential attributes of God 
are more clear to us from the standpoint of reason than the personal 
properties; because we can derive certain knowledge of the essential 
attributes from creatures which are sources of knowledge to us, such as 
we cannot obtain  regarding the personal properties, as was above 
explained (<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). As, therefore, we make use of the likeness of 
the trace or image found in creatures for the manifestation of the divine 
persons, so also in the same manner do we make use of the essential 
attributes. And such a manifestation of the divine persons by the use of 
the essential attributes is called "appropriation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The divine person can be manifested in a twofold manner by the essential 
attributes; in one way by similitude, and thus the things which belong to 
the intellect are appropriated to the Son, Who proceeds by way of 
intellect, as Word. In another way by dissimilitude; as power is 
appropriated to the Father, as Augustine says, because fathers by reason 
of old age are sometimes feeble; lest anything of the kind be imagined of 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The essential attributes are not appropriated to the 
persons as if they exclusively belonged to them; but in order to make the 
persons manifest by way of similitude, or dissimilitude, as above 
explained. So, no error in faith can arise, but rather manifestation of 
the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the essential attributes were appropriated to the 
persons as exclusively belonging to each of them, then it would follow 
that one person would be as a form as regards another; which Augustine 
altogether repudiates (De Trin. vi, 2), showing that the Father is wise, 
not by Wisdom begotten by Him, as though only the Son were Wisdom; so 
that the Father and the Son together only can be called wise, but not the 
Father without the Son. But the Son is called the Wisdom of the Father, 
because He is Wisdom from the Father Who is Wisdom. For each of them is 
of Himself Wisdom; and both together are one Wisdom. Whence the Father is 
not wise by the wisdom begotten by Him, but by the wisdom which is His 
own essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the essential attribute is in its proper concept 
prior to person, according to our way of understanding; nevertheless, so 
far as it is appropriated, there is nothing to prevent the personal 
property from being prior to that which is appropriated. Thus color is 
posterior to body considered as body, but is naturally prior to "white 
body," considered as white.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the essential attributes are appropriated to the persons in a fitting manner by the holy doctors?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the essential attributes are appropriated to 
the persons unfittingly by the holy doctors. For Hilary says (De Trin. 
ii): "Eternity is in the Father, the species in the Image; and use is in 
the Gift." In which words he designates three names proper to the 
persons: the name of the "Father," the name "Image" proper to the Son 
(<A Href="FP035.html#FPQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>, <A Href="FP035.html#FPQ35A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and the name "Bounty" or "Gift," which is proper to the 
Holy Ghost (<A Href="FP038.html#FPQ38OUTP1">Question [38]</a>, <A Href="FP038.html#FPQ38A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). He also designates three appropriated terms. 
For he appropriates "eternity" to the Father, "species" to the Son, and 
"use" to the Holy Ghost. This he does apparently without reason. For 
"eternity" imports  duration of existence; "species," the principle of 
existence; and 'use' belongs to the operation. But essence and operation 
are not found to be appropriated to any person. Therefore the above terms 
are not fittingly appropriated to the persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5): "Unity is in 
the Father, equality in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost is the concord of 
equality and unity." This does not, however, seem fitting; because one 
person does not receive formal denomination from what is appropriated to 
another. For the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten, as above 
explained (<A Href="FP037.html#FPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="FP037.html#FPQ37A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). But, as he subjoins, "All these three are 
one by the Father; all are equal by the Son, and all united by the Holy 
Ghost." The above, therefore, are not fittingly appropriated to the 
Persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine, to the Father is attributed 
"power," to the Son "wisdom," to the Holy Ghost "goodness." Nor does this 
seem fitting; for "strength" is part of power, whereas strength is found 
to be appropriated to the Son, according to the text, "Christ the 
strength [*Douay: power] of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++1%3A24">1 Cor. 1:24</a>). So it is likewise 
appropriated to the Holy Ghost, according to the words, "strength 
[*Douay: virtue] came out from Him and healed all" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++6%3A19">Lk. 6:19</a>). Therefore 
power should not be appropriated to the Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Likewise Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 10): "What the Apostle 
says, "From Him, and by Him, and in Him," is not to be taken in a 
confused sense." And (Contra Maxim. ii) "'from Him' refers to the Father, 
'by Him' to the Son, 'in Him' to the Holy Ghost.'" This, however, seems 
to be incorrectly said; for the words "in Him" seem to imply the relation 
of final cause, which is first among the causes. Therefore this relation 
of cause should be appropriated to the Father, Who is "the principle from 
no principle."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Likewise, Truth is appropriated to the Son, according to Jn. 
14:6, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"; and likewise "the book of 
life," according to Ps. 39:9, "In the beginning of the book it is written 
of Me," where a gloss observes, "that is, with the Father Who is My 
head," also this word "Who is"; because on the text of Is. 65:1, "Behold 
I go to the Gentiles," a gloss adds, "The Son speaks Who said to Moses, I 
am Who am." These appear to belong to the Son, and are not appropriated. 
For "truth," according to Augustine (De Vera Relig. 36), "is the supreme 
similitude of the principle without any dissimilitude." So it seems that 
it properly belongs to the Son, Who has a principle. Also the "book of 
life" seems proper to the Son, as signifying "a thing from another"; for 
every book is written by someone. This also, "Who is," appears to be 
proper to the Son; because if when it was said to Moses, "I am Who am," 
the Trinity spoke, then Moses could have said, "He Who is Father, Son, 
and Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost sent me to you," so also he could have 
said further, "He Who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost sent 
me to you," pointing out a certain person. This, however, is false; 
because no person is Father, Son  and Holy Ghost. Therefore it cannot be 
common to the Trinity, but is proper to the Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 1/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Our intellect, which is led to the knowledge of God from 
creatures, must consider God according to the mode derived from 
creatures. In considering any creature four points present themselves to 
us in due order. Firstly, the thing itself taken absolutely is considered 
as a being. Secondly, it is considered as one. Thirdly, its intrinsic 
power of operation and causality is considered. The fourth point of 
consideration embraces its relation to its effects. Hence this fourfold 
consideration comes to our mind in reference to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 2/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the first point of consideration, whereby we consider God 
absolutely in His being, the appropriation mentioned by Hilary applies, 
according to which "eternity" is appropriated to the Father, "species" to 
the Son, "use" to the Holy Ghost. For "eternity" as meaning a "being" 
without a principle, has a likeness to the property of the Father, Who is 
"a principle without a principle." Species or beauty has a likeness to 
the property of the Son. For beauty includes three conditions, 
"integrity" or "perfection," since those things which are impaired are by 
the very fact ugly; due "proportion" or "harmony"; and lastly, 
"brightness" or "clarity," whence things are called beautiful which have 
a bright color.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 3/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these has a likeness to the property of the Son, inasmuch 
as He as Son has in Himself truly and perfectly the nature of the Father. 
To insinuate this, Augustine says in his explanation (De Trin. vi, 10): 
"Where---that is, in the Son---there is supreme and primal life," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 4/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second agrees with the Son's property, inasmuch as He is the express 
Image of the Father. Hence we see that an image is said to be beautiful, 
if it perfectly represents even an ugly thing. This is indicated by 
Augustine when he says (De Trin. vi, 10), "Where there exists wondrous 
proportion and primal equality," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 5/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third agrees with the property of the Son, as the Word, which is the 
light and splendor of the intellect, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 
iii, 3). Augustine alludes to the same when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): 
"As the perfect Word, not wanting in anything, and, so to speak, the art 
of the omnipotent God," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 6/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Use" has a likeness to the property of the Holy Ghost; provided the 
"use" be taken in a wide sense, as including also the sense of "to 
enjoy"; according as "to use" is to employ something at the beck of the 
will, and "to enjoy" means to use joyfully, as Augustine says (De Trin. 
x, 11). So "use," whereby the Father and the Son enjoy each other, agrees 
with the property of the Holy Ghost, as Love. This is what Augustine says 
(De Trin. vi, 10): "That love, that delectation, that felicity or 
beatitude, is called use by him" (Hilary). But the "use" by which we 
enjoy God, is likened to the property of the Holy Ghost as the Gift; and  
Augustine points to this when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): "In the Trinity, 
the Holy Ghost, the sweetness of the Begettor and the Begotten, pours out 
upon us mere creatures His immense bounty and wealth." Thus it is clear 
how "eternity," "species," and "use" are attributed or appropriated to 
the persons, but not essence or operation; because, being common, there 
is nothing in their concept to liken them to the properties of the 
Persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 7/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second consideration of God regards Him as "one." In that view 
Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) appropriates "unity" to the Father, 
"equality" to the Son, "concord" or "union" to the Holy Ghost. It is 
manifest that these three imply unity, but in different ways. For "unity" 
is said absolutely, as it does not presuppose anything else; and for this 
reason it is appropriated to the Father, to Whom any other person is not 
presupposed since He is the "principle without principle." "Equality" 
implies unity as regards another; for that is equal which has the same 
quantity as another. So equality is appropriated to the Son, Who is the 
"principle from a principle." "Union" implies the unity of two; and is 
therefore appropriated to the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He proceeds from 
two. And from this we can understand what Augustine means when he says 
(De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) that "The Three are one, by reason of the 
Father; They are equal by reason of the Son; and are united by reason of 
the Holy Ghost." For it is clear that we trace a thing back to that in 
which we find it first: just as in this lower world we attribute life to 
the vegetative soul, because therein we find the first trace of life. Now 
"unity" is perceived at once in the person of the Father, even if by an 
impossible hypothesis, the other persons were removed. So the other 
persons derive their unity from the Father. But if the other persons be 
removed, we do not find equality in the Father, but we find it as soon as 
we suppose the Son. So, all are equal by reason of the Son, not as if the 
Son were the principle of equality in the Father, but that, without the 
Son equal to the Father, the Father could not be called equal; because 
His equality is considered firstly in regard to the Son: for that the 
Holy Ghost is equal to the Father, is also from the Son. Likewise, if the 
Holy Ghost, Who is the union of the two, be excluded, we cannot 
understand the oneness of the union between the Father and the Son. So 
all are connected by reason of the Holy Ghost; because given the Holy 
Ghost, we find whence the Father and the Son are said to be united.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 8/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the third consideration, which brings before us the 
adequate power of God in the sphere of causality, there is said to be a 
third kind of appropriation, of "power," "wisdom," and "goodness." This 
kind of appropriation is made both by reason of similitude as regards 
what exists in the divine persons, and by reason of dissimilitude if we 
consider what is in creatures. For "power" has the nature of a principle, 
and so it has a likeness to the heavenly Father, Who is the principle of 
the whole Godhead. But in an earthly father it is wanting sometimes by 
reason of old age. "Wisdom" has likeness to the heavenly Son, as the 
Word, for a word is nothing but the concept of wisdom. In an earthly son 
this is sometimes absent by reason of lack of years. "Goodness," as the  
nature and object of love, has likeness to the Holy Ghost; but seems 
repugnant to the earthly spirit, which often implies a certain violent 
impulse, according to Is. 25:4: "The spirit of the strong is as a blast 
beating on the wall." "Strength" is appropriated to the Son and to the 
Holy Ghost, not as denoting the power itself of a thing, but as sometimes 
used to express that which proceeds from power; for instance, we say that 
the strong work done by an agent is its strength.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 9/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the fourth consideration, i.e. God's relation to His 
effects, there arise appropriation of the expression "from Whom, by Whom, 
and in Whom." For this preposition "from" [ex] sometimes implies a 
certain relation of the material cause; which has no place in God; and 
sometimes it expresses the relation of the efficient cause, which can be 
applied to God by reason of His active power; hence it is appropriated to 
the Father in the same way as power. The preposition "by" [per] sometimes 
designates an intermediate cause; thus we may say that a smith works "by" 
a hammer. Hence the word "by" is not always appropriated to the Son, but 
belongs to the Son properly and strictly, according to the text, "All 
things were made by Him" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1%3A3">Jn. 1:3</a>); not that the Son is an instrument, 
but as "the principle from a principle." Sometimes it designates the 
habitude of a form "by" which an agent works; thus we say that an 
artificer works by his art. Hence, as wisdom and art are appropriated to 
the Son, so also is the expression "by Whom." The preposition "in" 
strictly denotes the habitude of one containing. Now, God contains things 
in two ways: in one way by their similitudes; thus things are said to be 
in God, as existing in His knowledge. In this sense the expression "in 
Him" should be appropriated to the Son. In another sense things are 
contained in God forasmuch as He in His goodness preserves and governs 
them, by guiding them to a fitting end; and in this sense the expression 
"in Him" is appropriated to the Holy Ghost, as likewise is "goodness." 
Nor need the habitude of the final cause (though the first of causes) be 
appropriated to the Father, Who is "the principle without a principle": 
because the divine persons, of Whom the Father is the principle, do not 
proceed from Him as towards an end, since each of Them is the last end; 
but They proceed by a natural procession, which seems more to belong to 
the nature of a natural power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[39] A[8] Body Para. 10/10-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the other points of inquiry, we can say that since "truth" 
belongs to the intellect, as stated above (<A Href="FP016.html#FPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="FP016.html#FPQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it is 
appropriated to the Son, without, however, being a property of His. For 
truth can be considered as existing in the thought or in the thing 
itself. Hence, as intellect and thing in their essential meaning, are 
referred to the essence, and not to the persons, so the same is to be 
said of truth. The definition quoted from Augustine belongs to truth as 
appropriated to the Son. The "book of life" directly means knowledge but 
indirectly it means life. For, as above explained (<A Href="FP024.html#FPQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="FP024.html#FPQ24A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it is 
God's knowledge regarding those who are to possess eternal life. 
Consequently, it is appropriated to the Son; although life is 
appropriated to the Holy Ghost, as implying a certain kind of interior 
movement, agreeing in that  sense with the property of the Holy Ghost as 
Love. To be written by another is not of the essence of a book considered 
as such; but this belongs to it only as a work produced. So this does not 
imply origin; nor is it personal, but an appropriation to a person. The 
expression "Who is" is appropriated to the person of the Son, not by 
reason of itself, but by reason of an adjunct, inasmuch as, in God's word 
to Moses, was prefigured the delivery of the human race accomplished by 
the Son. Yet, forasmuch as the word "Who" is taken in a relative sense, 
it may sometimes relate to the person of the Son; and in that sense it 
would be taken personally; as, for instance, were we to say, "The Son is 
the begotten 'Who is,'" inasmuch as "God begotten is personal." But taken 
indefinitely, it is an essential term. And although the pronoun "this" 
[iste] seems grammatically to point to a particular person, nevertheless 
everything that we can point to can be grammatically treated as a person, 
although in its own nature it is not a person; as we may say, "this 
stone," and "this ass." So, speaking in a grammatical sense, so far as 
the word "God" signifies and stands for the divine essence, the latter 
may be designated by the pronoun "this," according to Ex. 15:2: "This is 
my God, and I will glorify Him."<br>
