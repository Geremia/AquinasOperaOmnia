    Next we have to consider the power of sensuality, concerning which there are
    three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP081.html#FPQ81A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether sensuality is only an
    appetitive power?

  <h3 align="left">Whether sensuality is only appetitive?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sensuality is not only
    appetitive, but also cognitive. For Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12) that
    "the sensual movement of the soul which is directed to the bodily senses is
    common to us and beasts." But the bodily senses belong to the apprehensive
    powers. Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things which come under one division
    seem to be of one genus. But Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12) divides sensuality
    against the higher and lower reason, which belong to knowledge. Therefore
    sensuality also is apprehensive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in man's temptations sensuality stands
    in the place of the "serpent." But in the temptation of our first parents,
    the serpent presented himself as one giving information and proposing sin,
    which belong to the cognitive power. Therefore sensuality is a cognitive
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Sensuality is defined as "the appetite of
    things belonging to the body."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The name sensuality seems to be taken from the
    sensual movement, of which Augustine speaks (De Trin. xii, 12, 13), just as
    the name of a power is taken from its act; for instance, sight from seeing.
    Now the sensual movement is an appetite following sensitive apprehension.
    For the act of the apprehensive power is not so properly called a movement
    as the act of the appetite: since the operation of the apprehensive power is
    completed in the very fact that the thing apprehended is in the one that
    apprehends: while the operation of the appetitive power is completed in the
    fact that he who desires is borne towards the thing desirable. Therefore the
    operation of the apprehensive power is likened to rest: whereas the
    operation of the appetitive power is rather likened to movement. Wherefore
    by sensual movement we understand the operation of the appetitive power: so
    that sensuality is the name of the sensitive appetite.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By saying that the sensual movement of
    the soul is directed to the bodily senses, Augustine does not give us to
    understand that the bodily senses are included in sensuality, but rather
    that the movement of sensuality is a certain inclination to the bodily
    senses, since we desire things which are apprehended through the bodily
    senses. And thus the bodily senses appertain to sensuality as a preamble.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sensuality is divided against higher and
    lower reason, as having in common with them the act of movement: for the
    apprehensive power, to which belong the higher and lower reason, is a motive
    power; as is appetite, to which appertains sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The serpent not only showed and proposed
    sin, but also incited to the commission of sin. And in this, sensuality is
    signified by the serpent.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the sensitive appetite is divided into the irascible and
    concupiscible as distinct powers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sensitive appetite is not
    divided into the irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers. For the
    same power of the soul regards both sides of a contrariety, as sight regards
    both black and white, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 11). But
    suitable and harmful are contraries. Since, then, the concupiscible power
    regards what is suitable, while the irascible is concerned with what is
    harmful, it seems that irascible and concupiscible are the same power in the
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sensitive appetite regards only what
    is suitable according to the senses. But such is the object of the
    concupiscible power. Therefore there is no sensitive appetite differing from
    the concupiscible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hatred is in the irascible part: for
    Jerome says on Mt. 13:33: "We ought to have the hatred of vice in the
    irascible power." But hatred is contrary to love, and is in the
    concupiscible part. Therefore the concupiscible and irascible are the same
    powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Natura
    Hominis) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) assign two parts to the
    sensitive appetite, the irascible and the concupiscible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sensitive appetite is one generic power,
    and is called sensuality; but it is divided into two powers, which are
    species of the sensitive appetite---the irascible and the concupiscible. In
    order to make this clear, we must observe that in natural corruptible things
    there is needed an inclination not only to the acquisition of what is
    suitable and to the avoiding of what is harmful, but also to resistance
    against corruptive and contrary agencies which are a hindrance to the
    acquisition of what is suitable, and are productive of harm. For example,
    fire has a natural inclination, not only to rise from a lower position,
    which is unsuitable to it, towards a higher position which is suitable, but
    also to resist whatever destroys or hinders its action. Therefore, since the
    sensitive appetite is an inclination following sensitive apprehension, as
    natural appetite is an inclination following the natural form, there must
    needs be in the sensitive part two appetitive powers---one through which the
    soul is simply inclined to seek what is suitable, according to the senses,
    and to fly from what is hurtful, and this is called the concupiscible: and
    another, whereby an animal resists these attacks that hinder what is
    suitable, and inflict harm, and this is called the irascible. Whence we say
    that its object is something arduous, because its tendency is to overcome
    and rise above obstacles. Now these two are not to be reduced to one
    principle: for sometimes the soul busies itself with unpleasant things,
    against the inclination of the concupiscible appetite, in order that,
    following the impulse of the irascible appetite, it may fight against
    obstacles. Wherefore also the passions of the irascible appetite counteract
    the passions of the concupiscible appetite: since the concupiscence, on
    being aroused, diminishes anger; and anger being roused, diminishes
    concupiscence in many cases. This is clear also from the fact that the
    irascible is, as it were, the champion and defender of the concupiscible
    when it rises up against what hinders the acquisition of the suitable things
    which the concupiscible desires, or against what inflicts harm, from which
    the concupiscible flies. And for this reason all the passions of the
    irascible appetite rise from the passions of the concupiscible appetite and
    terminate in them; for instance, anger rises from sadness, and having
    wrought vengeance, terminates in joy. For this reason also the quarrels of
    animals are about things concupiscible---namely, food and sex, as the
    Philosopher says [*De Animal. Histor. viii.].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The concupiscible power regards both
    what is suitable and what is unsuitable. But the object of the irascible
    power is to resist the onslaught of the unsuitable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As in the apprehensive powers of the
    sensitive part there is an estimative power, which perceives those things
    which do not impress the senses, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP078.html#FPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="FP078.html#FPQ78A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); so also in the
    sensitive appetite there is a certain appetitive power which regards
    something as suitable, not because it pleases the senses, but because it is
    useful to the animal for self-defense: and this is the irascible power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hatred belongs simply to the
    concupiscible appetite: but by reason of the strife which arises from
    hatred, it may belong to the irascible appetite.<br />

    Whether the irascible and concupiscible appetites obey reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the irascible and
    concupiscible appetites do not obey reason. For irascible and concupiscible
    are parts of sensuality. But sensuality does not obey reason, wherefore it
    is signified by the serpent, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12,13).
    Therefore the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not obey reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what obeys a certain thing does not
    resist it. But the irascible and concupiscible appetites resist reason:
    according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A23"
      >Rm. 7:23</a
    >): "I see another law in my members fighting against the law of my mind."
    Therefore the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not obey reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the appetitive power is inferior to
    the rational part of the soul, so also is the sensitive power. But the
    sensitive part of the soul does not obey reason: for we neither hear nor see
    just when we wish. Therefore, in like manner, neither do the powers of the
    sensitive appetite, the irascible and concupscible, obey reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12) that
    "the part of the soul which is obedient and amenable to reason is divided
    into concupiscence and anger."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In two ways the irascible and concupiscible
    powers obey the higher part, in which are the intellect or reason, and the
    will; first, as to reason, secondly as to the will. They obey the reason in
    their own acts, because in other animals the sensitive appetite is naturally
    moved by the estimative power; for instance, a sheep, esteeming the wolf as
    an enemy, is afraid. In man the estimative power, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP078.html#FPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="FP078.html#FPQ78A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), is replaced by the
    cogitative power, which is called by some 'the particular reason,' because
    it compares individual intentions. Wherefore in man the sensitive appetite
    is naturally moved by this particular reason. But this same particular
    reason is naturally guided and moved according to the universal reason:
    wherefore in syllogistic matters particular conclusions are drawn from
    universal propositions. Therefore it is clear that the universal reason
    directs the sensitive appetite, which is divided into concupiscible and
    irascible; and this appetite obeys it. But because to draw particular
    conclusions from universal principles is not the work of the intellect, as
    such, but of the reason: hence it is that the irascible and concupiscible
    are said to obey the reason rather than to obey the intellect. Anyone can
    experience this in himself: for by applying certain universal
    considerations, anger or fear or the like may be modified or excited.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To the will also is the sensitive appetite subject in execution, which is
    accomplished by the motive power. For in other animals movement follows at
    once the concupiscible and irascible appetites: for instance, the sheep,
    fearing the wolf, flees at once, because it has no superior counteracting
    appetite. On the contrary, man is not moved at once, according to the
    irascible and concupiscible appetites: but he awaits the command of the
    will, which is the superior appetite. For wherever there is order among a
    number of motive powers, the second only moves by virtue of the first:
    wherefore the lower appetite is not sufficient to cause movement, unless the
    higher appetite consents. And this is what the Philosopher says (De Anima
    iii, 11), that "the higher appetite moves the lower appetite, as the higher
    sphere moves the lower." In this way, therefore, the irascible and
    concupiscible are subject to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sensuality is signified by the serpent,
    in what is proper to it as a sensitive power. But the irascible and
    concupiscible powers denominate the sensitive appetite rather on the part of
    the act, to which they are led by the reason, as we have said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2):
    "We observe in an animal a despotic and a politic principle: for the soul
    dominates the body by a despotic power; but the intellect dominates the
    appetite by a politic and royal power." For a power is called despotic
    whereby a man rules his slaves, who have not the right to resist in any way
    the orders of the one that commands them, since they have nothing of their
    own. But that power is called politic and royal by which a man rules over
    free subjects, who, though subject to the government of the ruler, have
    nevertheless something of their own, by reason of which they can resist the
    orders of him who commands. And so, the soul is said to rule the body by a
    despotic power, because the members of the body cannot in any way resist the
    sway of the soul, but at the soul's command both hand and foot, and whatever
    member is naturally moved by voluntary movement, are moved at once. But the
    intellect or reason is said to rule the irascible and concupiscible by a
    politic power: because the sensitive appetite has something of its own, by
    virtue whereof it can resist the commands of reason. For the sensitive
    appetite is naturally moved, not only by the estimative power in other
    animals, and in man by the cogitative power which the universal reason
    guides, but also by the imagination and sense. Whence it is that we
    experience that the irascible and concupiscible powers do resist reason,
    inasmuch as we sense or imagine something pleasant, which reason forbids, or
    unpleasant, which reason commands. And so from the fact that the irascible
    and concupiscible resist reason in something, we must not conclude that they
    do not obey.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The exterior senses require for action
    exterior sensible things, whereby they are affected, and the presence of
    which is not ruled by reason. But the interior powers, both appetitive and
    apprehensive, do not require exterior things. Therefore they are subject to
    the command of reason, which can not only incite or modify the affections of
    the appetitive power, but can also form the phantasms of the imagination.<br />
