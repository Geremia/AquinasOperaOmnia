</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the existence of a thing has been ascertained there  remains the 
further question of the manner of its existence, in order that we may 
know its essence. Now, because we cannot know what God is, but rather 
what He is not, we have no means for considering how God is, but rather 
how He is not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] Out. Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we must consider: (1) How He is not; (2) How He is known by 
us; (3) How He is named.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] Out. Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it can be shown how God is not, by denying Him whatever is opposed 
to the idea of Him, viz. composition, motion, and the like. Therefore (1) 
we must discuss His simplicity, whereby we deny composition in Him; and 
because whatever is simple in material things is imperfect and a part of 
something else, we shall discuss (2) His perfection; (3) His infinity; 
(4) His immutability; (5) His unity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] Out. Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning His simplicity, there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether God is a body?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He is composed of matter and form?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether in Him there is composition of quiddity, essence or nature, 
and subject?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He is composed of essence and existence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether He is composed of genus and difference?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether He is composed of subject and accident?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether He is in any way composite, or wholly simple?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether He enters into composition with other things?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is a body. For a body is that which has the 
three dimensions. But Holy Scripture attributes the three dimensions to 
God, for it is written: "He is higher than Heaven, and what wilt thou do? 
He is deeper than Hell, and how wilt thou know? The measure of Him is 
longer than the earth and broader than the sea" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+11%3A8,9">Job 11:8,9</a>). Therefore 
God is a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everything that has figure is a body, since figure is a 
quality of quantity. But God seems to have figure, for it is written: 
"Let us make man to our image and likeness" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1%3A26">Gn. 1:26</a>). Now a figure is 
called an image, according to the text: "Who being the brightness of His 
glory and the figure," i.e. the image, "of His substance" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++1%3A3">Heb. 1:3</a>). 
Therefore God is a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever has corporeal parts is a body. Now Scripture 
attributes corporeal parts to God. "Hast thou an arm like God?" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+40%3A4">Job 40:4</a>); and "The eyes of the Lord are upon the just" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++33%3A16">Ps. 33:16</a>); and "The 
right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++117%3A16">Ps. 117:16</a>). Therefore God 
is a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, posture belongs only to bodies. But something which 
supposes posture is said of God in the Scriptures: "I saw the Lord 
sitting" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++6%3A1">Is. 6:1</a>), and "He standeth up to judge" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++3%3A13">Is. 3:13</a>). Therefore 
God is a body. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, only bodies or things corporeal can be a local term 
"wherefrom" or "whereto." But in the Scriptures God is spoken of as a 
local term "whereto," according to the words, "Come ye to Him and be 
enlightened" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++33%3A6">Ps. 33:6</a>), and as a term "wherefrom": "All they that depart 
from Thee shall be written in the earth" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++17%3A13">Jer. 17:13</a>). Therefore God is a 
body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Gospel of St. John (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4%3A24">Jn. 4:24</a>): 
"God is a spirit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is absolutely true that God is not a body; and this 
can be shown in three ways. First, because no body is in motion unless it 
be put in motion, as is evident from induction. Now it has been already 
proved (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), that God is the First Mover, and is Himself unmoved. 
Therefore it is clear that God is not a body. Secondly, because the first 
being must of necessity be in act, and in no way in potentiality. For 
although in any single thing that passes from potentiality to actuality, 
the potentiality is prior in time to the actuality; nevertheless, 
absolutely speaking, actuality is prior to potentiality; for whatever is 
in potentiality can be reduced into actuality only by some being in 
actuality. Now it has been already proved that God is the First Being. It 
is therefore impossible that in God there should be any potentiality. But 
every body is in potentiality because the continuous, as such, is 
divisible to infinity; it is therefore impossible that God should be a 
body. Thirdly, because God is the most noble of beings. Now it is 
impossible for a body to be the most noble of beings; for a body must be 
either animate or inanimate; and an animate body is manifestly nobler 
than any inanimate body. But an animate body is not animate precisely as 
body; otherwise all bodies would be animate. Therefore its animation 
depends upon some other thing, as our body depends for its animation on 
the soul. Hence that by which a body becomes animated must be nobler than 
the body. Therefore it is impossible that God should be a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we have said above (<A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FP001.html#FPQ1A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), Holy Writ puts before 
us spiritual and divine things under the comparison of corporeal things. 
Hence, when it attributes to God the three dimensions under the 
comparison of corporeal quantity, it implies His virtual quantity; thus, 
by depth, it signifies His power of knowing hidden things; by height, the 
transcendence of His excelling power; by length, the duration of His 
existence; by breadth, His act of love for all. Or, as says Dionysius 
(Div. Nom. ix), by the depth of God is meant the incomprehensibility of 
His essence; by length, the procession of His all-pervading power; by 
breadth, His overspreading all things, inasmuch as all things lie under 
His protection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is said to be after the image of God, not as regards 
his body, but as regards that whereby he excels other animals. Hence, 
when it is said, "Let us make man to our image and likeness", it is 
added, "And let him have dominion over the fishes  of the sea" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1%3A26">Gn. 1:26</a>). Now man excels all animals by his reason and intelligence; hence 
it is according to his intelligence and reason, which are incorporeal, 
that man is said to be according to the image of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Corporeal parts are attributed to God in Scripture on 
account of His actions, and this is owing to a certain parallel. For 
instance the act of the eye is to see; hence the eye attributed to God 
signifies His power of seeing intellectually, not sensibly; and so on 
with the other parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Whatever pertains to posture, also, is only attributed to 
God by some sort of parallel. He is spoken of as sitting, on account of 
His unchangeableness and dominion; and as standing, on account of His 
power of overcoming whatever withstands Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> We draw near to God by no corporeal steps, since He is 
everywhere, but by the affections of our soul, and by the actions of that 
same soul do we withdraw from Him; thus, to draw near to or to withdraw 
signifies merely spiritual actions based on the metaphor of local motion.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is composed of matter and form. For whatever 
has a soul is composed of matter and form; since the soul is the form of 
the body. But Scripture attributes a soul to God; for it is mentioned in 
Hebrews (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++10%3A38">Heb. 10:38</a>), where God says: "But My just man liveth by faith; 
but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please My soul." Therefore God 
is composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, anger, joy and the like are passions of the composite. 
But these are attributed to God in Scripture: "The Lord was exceeding 
angry with His people" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++105%3A40">Ps. 105:40</a>). Therefore God is composed of matter 
and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matter is the principle of individualization. But God 
seems to be individual, for He cannot be predicated of many. Therefore He 
is composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is composed of matter and form is a body; for 
dimensive quantity is the first property of matter. But God is not a body 
as proved in the preceding Article; therefore He is not composed of 
matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible that matter should exist in God. First, 
because matter is in potentiality. But we have shown (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that 
God is pure act, without any potentiality. Hence it is impossible that 
God should be composed of matter and form. Secondly, because everything 
composed of matter and form owes its perfection and goodness to its form; 
therefore its goodness is participated, inasmuch as matter participates 
the form. Now the  first good and the best---viz. God---is not a 
participated good, because the essential good is prior to the 
participated good. Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of 
matter and form. Thirdly, because every agent acts by its form; hence the 
manner in which it has its form is the manner in which it is an agent. 
Therefore whatever is primarily and essentially an agent must be 
primarily and essentially form. Now God is the first agent, since He is 
the first efficient cause. He is therefore of His essence a form; and not 
composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A soul is attributed to God because His acts resemble the 
acts of a soul; for, that we will anything, is due to our soul. Hence 
what is pleasing to His will is said to be pleasing to His soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anger and the like are attributed to God on account of a 
similitude of effect. Thus, because to punish is properly the act of an 
angry man, God's punishment is metaphorically spoken of as His anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Forms which can be received in matter are individualized by 
matter, which cannot be in another as in a subject since it is the first 
underlying subject; although form of itself, unless something else 
prevents it, can be received by many. But that form which cannot be 
received in matter, but is self-subsisting, is individualized precisely 
because it cannot be received in a subject; and such a form is God. Hence 
it does not follow that matter exists in God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is the same as His essence or nature?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not the same as His essence or nature. For 
nothing can be in itself. But the substance or nature of God---i.e. the 
Godhead---is said to be in God. Therefore it seems that God is not the 
same as His essence or nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the effect is assimilated to its cause; for every agent 
produces its like. But in created things the "suppositum" is not 
identical with its nature; for a man is not the same as his humanity. 
Therefore God is not the same as His Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of God that He is life itself, and not only 
that He is a living thing: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14%3A6">Jn. 14:6</a>). Now the relation between Godhead and God is the same as the 
relation between life and a living thing. Therefore God is His very 
Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God is the same as His essence or nature. To understand 
this, it must be noted that in things composed of matter and form, the 
nature or essence must differ from the "suppositum," because the essence 
or nature connotes only what is included in the definition of the 
species; as, humanity connotes all that is included in the definition of 
man, for it is by this that man is  man, and it is this that humanity 
signifies, that, namely, whereby man is man. Now individual matter, with 
all the individualizing accidents, is not included in the definition of 
the species. For this particular flesh, these bones, this blackness or 
whiteness, etc., are not included in the definition of a man. Therefore 
this flesh, these bones, and the accidental qualities distinguishing this 
particular matter, are not included in humanity; and yet they are 
included in the thing which is man. Hence the thing which is a man has 
something more in it than has humanity. Consequently humanity and a man 
are not wholly identical; but humanity is taken to mean the formal part 
of a man, because the principles whereby a thing is defined are regarded 
as the formal constituent in regard to the individualizing matter. On the 
other hand, in things not composed of matter and form, in which 
individualization is not due to individual matter---that is to say, to 
"this" matter---the very forms being individualized of themselves---it is 
necessary the forms themselves should be subsisting "supposita." 
Therefore "suppositum" and nature in them are identified. Since God then 
is not composed of matter and form, He must be His own Godhead, His own 
Life, and whatever else is thus predicated of Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We can speak of simple things only as though they were like 
the composite things from which we derive our knowledge. Therefore in 
speaking of God, we use concrete nouns to signify His subsistence, 
because with us only those things subsist which are composite; and we use 
abstract nouns to signify His simplicity. In saying therefore that 
Godhead, or life, or the like are in God, we indicate the composite way 
in which our intellect understands, but not that there is any composition 
in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The effects of God do not imitate Him perfectly, but only 
as far as they are able; and the imitation is here defective, precisely 
because what is simple and one, can only be represented by divers things; 
consequently, composition is accidental to them, and therefore, in them 
"suppositum" is not the same as nature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether essence and existence are the same in God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that essence and existence are not the same in God. For 
if it be so, then the divine being has nothing added to it. Now being to 
which no addition is made is universal being which is predicated of all 
things. Therefore it follows that God is being in general which can be 
predicated of everything. But this is false: "For men gave the 
incommunicable name to stones and wood" (Wis. 14:21). Therefore God's 
existence is not His essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we can know "whether" God exists as said above (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); but we cannot know "what" He is. Therefore God's existence is not 
the same as His essence---that is, as His quiddity or nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (Trin. vii): "In God existence is  not an 
accidental quality, but subsisting truth." Therefore what subsists in God 
is His existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God is not only His own essence, as shown in the 
preceding article, but also His own existence. This may be shown in 
several ways. First, whatever a thing has besides its essence must be 
caused either by the constituent principles of that essence (like a 
property that necessarily accompanies the species---as the faculty of 
laughing is proper to a man---and is caused by the constituent principles 
of the species), or by some exterior agent---as heat is caused in water 
by fire. Therefore, if the existence of a thing differs from its essence, 
this existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its 
essential principles. Now it is impossible for a thing's existence to be 
caused by its essential constituent principles, for nothing can be the 
sufficient cause of its own existence, if its existence is caused. 
Therefore that thing, whose existence differs from its essence, must have 
its existence caused by another. But this cannot be true of God; because 
we call God the first efficient cause. Therefore it is impossible that in 
God His existence should differ from His essence. Secondly, existence is 
that which makes every form or nature actual; for goodness and humanity 
are spoken of as actual, only because they are spoken of as existing. 
Therefore existence must be compared to essence, if the latter is a 
distinct reality, as actuality to potentiality. Therefore, since in God 
there is no potentiality, as shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it follows that in Him 
essence does not differ from existence. Therefore His essence is His 
existence. Thirdly, because, just as that which has fire, but is not 
itself fire, is on fire by participation; so that which has existence but 
is not existence, is a being by participation. But God is His own 
essence, as shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) if, therefore, He is not His own existence 
He will be not essential, but participated being. He will not therefore 
be the first being---which is absurd. Therefore God is His own existence, 
and not merely His own essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A thing that has nothing added to it can be of two kinds. 
Either its essence precludes any addition; thus, for example, it is of 
the essence of an irrational animal to be without reason. Or we may 
understand a thing to have nothing added to it, inasmuch as its essence 
does not require that anything should be added to it; thus the genus 
animal is without reason, because it is not of the essence of animal in 
general to have reason; but neither is it to lack reason. And so the 
divine being has nothing added to it in the first sense; whereas 
universal being has nothing added to it in the second sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "To be" can mean either of two things. It may mean the act 
of essence, or it may mean the composition of a proposition effected by 
the mind in joining a predicate to a subject. Taking "to be" in the first 
sense, we cannot understand God's existence nor His essence; but only in 
the second sense. We know that this proposition which we form about God 
when we say "God is," is true; and this we know from His effects (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is contained in a genus?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is contained in a genus. For a substance is a 
being that subsists of itself. But this is especially true of God. 
Therefore God is in a genus of substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing can be measured save by something of its own 
genus; as length is measured by length and numbers by number. But God is 
the measure of all substances, as the Commentator shows (Metaph. x). 
Therefore God is in the genus of substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In the mind, genus is prior to what it contains. But 
nothing is prior to God either really or mentally. Therefore God is not 
in any genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing can be in a genus in two ways; either absolutely 
and properly, as a species contained under a genus; or as being reducible 
to it, as principles and privations. For example, a point and unity are 
reduced to the genus of quantity, as its principles; while blindness and 
all other privations are reduced to the genus of habit. But in neither 
way is God in a genus. That He cannot be a species of any genus may be 
shown in three ways. First, because a species is constituted of genus and 
difference. Now that from which the difference constituting the species 
is derived, is always related to that from which the genus is derived, as 
actuality is related to potentiality. For animal is derived from 
sensitive nature, by concretion as it were, for that is animal, which has 
a sensitive nature. Rational being, on the other hand, is derived from 
intellectual nature, because that is rational, which has an intellectual 
nature, and intelligence is compared to sense, as actuality is to 
potentiality. The same argument holds good in other things. Hence since 
in God actuality is not added to potentiality, it is impossible that He 
should be in any genus as a species. Secondly, since the existence of God 
is His essence, if God were in any genus, He would be the genus "being", 
because, since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the 
essence of a thing. But the Philosopher has shown (Metaph. iii) that 
being cannot be a genus, for every genus has differences distinct from 
its generic essence. Now no difference can exist distinct from being; for 
non-being cannot be a difference. It follows then that God is not in a 
genus. Thirdly, because all in one genus agree in the quiddity or essence 
of the genus which is predicated of them as an essential, but they differ 
in their existence. For the existence of man and of horse is not the 
same; as also of this man and that man: thus in every member of a genus, 
existence and quiddity---i.e. essence---must differ. But in God they do 
not differ, as shown in the preceding article. Therefore it is plain that 
God is not in a genus as if He were a species. From this it is also plain 
that He has no genus nor difference, nor can there be any definition of 
Him; nor, save through His effects, a demonstration of Him: for a 
definition is from genus and difference; and the mean of a demonstration 
is a definition. That  God is not in a genus, as reducible to it as its 
principle, is clear from this, that a principle reducible to any genus 
does not extend beyond that genus; as, a point is the principle of 
continuous quantity alone; and unity, of discontinuous quantity. But God 
is the principle of all being. Therefore He is not contained in any genus 
as its principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word substance signifies not only what exists of 
itself---for existence cannot of itself be a genus, as shown in the body 
of the article; but, it also signifies an essence that has the property 
of existing in this way---namely, of existing of itself; this existence, 
however, is not its essence. Thus it is clear that God is not in the 
genus of substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection turns upon proportionate measure which must 
be homogeneous with what is measured. Now, God is not a measure 
proportionate to anything. Still, He is called the measure of all things, 
in the sense that everything has being only according as it resembles Him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in God there are any accidents?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there are accidents in God. For substance cannot be 
an accident, as Aristotle says (Phys. i). Therefore that which is an 
accident in one, cannot, in another, be a substance. Thus it is proved 
that heat cannot be the substantial form of fire, because it is an 
accident in other things. But wisdom, virtue, and the like, which are 
accidents in us, are attributes of God. Therefore in God there are 
accidents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in every genus there is a first principle. But there are 
many "genera" of accidents. If, therefore, the primal members of these 
genera are not in God, there will be many primal beings other than 
God---which is absurd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Every accident is in a subject. But God cannot be a 
subject, for "no simple form can be a subject", as Boethius says (De 
Trin.). Therefore in God there cannot be any accident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> From all we have said, it is clear there can be no 
accident in God. First, because a subject is compared to its accidents as 
potentiality to actuality; for a subject is in some sense made actual by 
its accidents. But there can be no potentiality in God, as was shown 
(<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Secondly, because God is His own existence; and as Boethius 
says (Hebdom.), although every essence may have something superadded to 
it, this cannot apply to absolute being: thus a heated substance can have 
something extraneous to heat added to it, as whiteness, nevertheless 
absolute heat can have nothing else than heat. Thirdly, because what is 
essential is prior to what is accidental. Whence as God is absolute 
primal being, there can be in Him nothing accidental. Neither can He have 
any essential accidents (as the capability of laughing is  an essential 
accident of man), because such accidents are caused by the constituent 
principles of the subject. Now there can be nothing caused in God, since 
He is the first cause. Hence it follows that there is no accident in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtue and wisdom are not predicated of God and of us 
univocally. Hence it does not follow that there are accidents in God as 
there are in us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since substance is prior to its accidents, the principles 
of accidents are reducible to the principles of the substance as to that 
which is prior; although God is not first as if contained in the genus of 
substance; yet He is first in respect to all being, outside of every 
genus.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God is altogether simple?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God is not altogether simple. For whatever is from 
God must imitate Him. Thus from the first being are all beings; and from 
the first good is all good. But in the things which God has made, nothing 
is altogether simple. Therefore neither is God altogether simple.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is best must be attributed to God. But with us 
that which is composite is better than that which is simple; thus, 
chemical compounds are better than simple elements, and animals than the 
parts that compose them. Therefore it cannot be said that God is 
altogether simple.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 6,7): "God is truly and 
absolutely simple."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The absolute simplicity of God may be shown in many ways. 
First, from the previous articles of this question. For there is neither 
composition of quantitative parts in God, since He is not a body; nor 
composition of matter and form; nor does His nature differ from His 
"suppositum"; nor His essence from His existence; neither is there in Him 
composition of genus and difference, nor of subject and accident. 
Therefore, it is clear that God is nowise composite, but is altogether 
simple. Secondly, because every composite is posterior to its component 
parts, and is dependent on them; but God is the first being, as shown 
above (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Thirdly, because every composite has a cause, for 
things in themselves different cannot unite unless something causes them 
to unite. But God is uncaused, as shown above (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), since He is 
the first efficient cause. Fourthly, because in every composite there 
must be potentiality and actuality; but this does not apply to God; for 
either one of the parts actuates another, or at least all the parts are 
potential to the whole. Fifthly, because nothing composite can be 
predicated of any single one of its parts. And this is evident in a whole 
made up of dissimilar parts; for no part of a man is a man, nor any of 
the parts of the foot, a foot. But in wholes made up of similar parts, 
although something which is  predicated of the whole may be predicated of 
a part (as a part of the air is air, and a part of water, water), 
nevertheless certain things are predicable of the whole which cannot be 
predicated of any of the parts; for instance, if the whole volume of 
water is two cubits, no part of it can be two cubits. Thus in every 
composite there is something which is not it itself. But, even if this 
could be said of whatever has a form, viz. that it has something which is 
not it itself, as in a white object there is something which does not 
belong to the essence of white; nevertheless in the form itself, there is 
nothing besides itself. And so, since God is absolute form, or rather 
absolute being, He can be in no way composite. Hilary implies this 
argument, when he says (De Trin. vii): "God, Who is strength, is not made 
up of things that are weak; nor is He Who is light, composed of things 
that are dim."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Whatever is from God imitates Him, as caused things imitate 
the first cause. But it is of the essence of a thing to be in some sort 
composite; because at least its existence differs from its essence, as 
will be shown hereafter, (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> With us composite things are better than simple things, 
because the perfections of created goodness cannot be found in one simple 
thing, but in many things. But the perfection of divine goodness is found 
in one simple thing (<A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FP004.html#FPQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a> and <A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="FP006.html#FPQ6A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God enters into the composition of other things?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God enters into the composition of other things, 
for Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv): "The being of all things is that 
which is above being---the Godhead." But the being of all things enters 
into the composition of everything. Therefore God enters into the 
composition of other things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God is a form; for Augustine says (De Verb. Dom., 
[*Serm. xxxviii]) that, "the word of God, which is God, is an uncreated 
form." But a form is part of a compound. Therefore God is part of some 
compound.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever things exist, in no way differing from each 
other, are the same. But God and primary matter exist, and in no way 
differ from each other. Therefore they are absolutely the same. But 
primary matter enters into the composition things. Therefore also does 
God. Proof of the minor---whatever things differ, they differ by some 
differences, and therefore must be composite. But God and primary matter 
are altogether simple. Therefore they nowise differ from each other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): "There can be no 
touching Him," i.e. God, "nor any other union with Him by mingling part 
with part."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the first cause rules all things without commingling with them, 
as the Philosopher says (De Causis). 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> On this point there have been three errors. Some have 
affirmed that God is the world-soul, as is clear from Augustine (De Civ. 
Dei vii, 6). This is practically the same as the opinion of those who 
assert that God is the soul of the highest heaven. Again, others have 
said that God is the formal principle of all things; and this was the 
theory of the Almaricians. The third error is that of David of Dinant, 
who most absurdly taught that God was primary matter. Now all these 
contain manifest untruth; since it is not possible for God to enter into 
the composition of anything, either as a formal or a material principle. 
First, because God is the first efficient cause. Now the efficient cause 
is not identical numerically with the form of the thing caused, but only 
specifically: for man begets man. But primary matter can be neither 
numerically nor specifically identical with an efficient cause; for the 
former is merely potential, while the latter is actual. Secondly, 
because, since God is the first efficient cause, to act belongs to Him 
primarily and essentially. But that which enters into composition with 
anything does not act primarily and essentially, but rather the composite 
so acts; for the hand does not act, but the man by his hand; and, fire 
warms by its heat. Hence God cannot be part of a compound. Thirdly, 
because no part of a compound can be absolutely primal among beings---not 
even matter, nor form, though they are the primal parts of every 
compound. For matter is merely potential; and potentiality is absolutely 
posterior to actuality, as is clear from the foregoing (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): 
while a form which is part of a compound is a participated form; and as 
that which participates is posterior to that which is essential, so 
likewise is that which is participated; as fire in ignited objects is 
posterior to fire that is essentially such. Now it has been proved that 
God is absolutely primal being (<A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Godhead is called the being of all things, as their 
efficient and exemplar cause, but not as being their essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Word is an exemplar form; but not a form that is part 
of a compound.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[3] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Simple things do not differ by added differences---for this 
is the property of compounds. Thus man and horse differ by their 
differences, rational and irrational; which differences, however, do not 
differ from each other by other differences. Hence, to be quite accurate, 
it is better to say that they are, not different, but diverse. Hence, 
according to the Philosopher (Metaph. x), "things which are diverse are 
absolutely distinct, but things which are different differ by something." 
Therefore, strictly speaking, primary matter and God do not differ, but 
are by their very being, diverse. Hence it does not follow they are the 
same.<br>
