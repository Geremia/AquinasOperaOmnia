    OF THE PROPAGATION OF MAN AS TO THE BODY (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now consider the propagation of man, as to the body. Concerning this
    there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP119.html#FPQ119A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any part of the food is
    changed into true human nature?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP119.html#FPQ119A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the semen, which is the
    principle of human generation, is produced from the surplus food?<br />

    Whether some part of the food is changed into true human nature?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that none of the food is changed
    into true human nature. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A17"
      >Mt. 15:17</a
    >): "Whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast
    out into the privy." But what is cast out is not changed into the reality of
    human nature. Therefore none of the food is changed into true human
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher (De Gener. i, 5)
    distinguishes flesh belonging to the "species" from flesh belonging to
    "matter"; and says that the latter "comes and goes." Now what is formed from
    food comes and goes. Therefore what is produced from food is flesh belonging
    to matter, not to the species. But what belongs to true human nature belongs
    to the species. Therefore the food is not changed into true human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the "radical humor" seems to belong to
    the reality of human nature; and if it be lost, it cannot be recovered,
    according to physicians. But it could be recovered if the food were changed
    into the humor. Therefore food is not changed into true human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the food were changed into true human
    nature, whatever is lost in man could be restored. But man's death is due
    only to the loss of something. Therefore man would be able by taking food to
    insure himself against death in perpetuity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if the food is changed into true human
    nature, there is nothing in man which may not recede or be repaired: for
    what is generated in a man from his food can both recede and be repaired. If
    therefore a man lived long enough, it would follow that in the end nothing
    would be left in him of what belonged to him at the beginning. Consequently
    he would not be numerically the same man throughout his life; since for the
    thing to be numerically the same, identity of matter is necessary. But this
    is incongruous. Therefore the food is not changed into true human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xi): "The
    bodily food when corrupted, that is, having lost its form, is changed into
    the texture of the members." But the texture of the members belongs to true
    human nature. Therefore the food is changed into the reality of human
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Metaph. ii), "The
    relation of a thing to truth is the same as its relation to being."
    Therefore that belongs to the true nature of any thing which enters into the
    constitution of that nature. But nature can be considered in two ways:
    firstly, in general according to the species; secondly, as in the
    individual. And whereas the form and the common matter belong to a thing's
    true nature considered in general; individual signate matter, and the form
    individualized by that matter belong to the true nature considered in this
    particular individual. Thus a soul and body belong to the true human nature
    in general, but to the true human nature of Peter and Martin belong this
    soul and this body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now there are certain things whose form cannot exist but in one individual
    matter: thus the form of the sun cannot exist save in the matter in which it
    actually is. And in this sense some have said that the human form cannot
    exist but in a certain individual matter, which, they said, was given that
    form at the very beginning in the first man. So that whatever may have been
    added to that which was derived by posterity from the first parent, does not
    belong to the truth of human nature, as not receiving in truth the form of
    human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But, said they, that matter which, in the first man, was the subject of the
    human form, was multiplied in itself: and in this way the multitude of human
    bodies is derived from the body of the first man. According to these, the
    food is not changed into true human nature; we take food, they stated, in
    order to help nature to resist the action of natural heat, and prevent the
    consumption of the "radical humor"; just as lead or tin is mixed with silver
    to prevent its being consumed by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this is unreasonable in many ways. Firstly, because it comes to the same
    that a form can be produced in another matter, or that it can cease to be in
    its proper matter; wherefore all things that can be generated are
    corruptible, and conversely. Now it is manifest that the human form can
    cease to exist in this (particular) matter which is its subject: else the
    human body would not be corruptible. Consequently it can begin to exist in
    another matter, so that something else be changed into true human nature.
    Secondly, because in all beings whose entire matter is contained in one
    individual there is only one individual in the species: as is clearly the
    case with the sun, moon and such like. Thus there would only be one
    individual of the human species. Thirdly, because multiplication of matter
    cannot be understood otherwise than either in respect of quantity only, as
    in things which are rarefied, so that their matter increases in dimensions;
    or in respect of the substance itself of the matter. But as long as the
    substance alone of matter remains, it cannot be said to be multiplied; for
    multitude cannot consist in the addition of a thing to itself, since of
    necessity it can only result from division. Therefore some other substance
    must be added to matter, either by creation, or by something else being
    changed into it. Consequently no matter can be multiplied save either by
    rarefaction as when air is made from water; or by the change of some other
    things, as fire is multiplied by the addition of wood; or lastly by
    creation. Now it is manifest that the multiplication of matter in the human
    body does not occur by rarefaction: for thus the body of a man of perfect
    age would be more imperfect than the body of a child. Nor does it occur by
    creation of flesh matter: for, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxii): "All
    things were created together as to the substance of matter, but not as to
    the specific form." Consequently the multiplication of the human body can
    only be the result of the food being changed into the true human nature.
    Fourthly, because, since man does not differ from animals and plants in
    regard to the vegetative soul, it would follow that the bodies of animals
    and plants do not increase through a change of nourishment into the body so
    nourished, but through some kind of multiplication. Which multiplication
    cannot be natural: since the matter cannot naturally extend beyond a certain
    fixed quantity; nor again does anything increase naturally, save either by
    rarefaction or the change of something else into it. Consequently the whole
    process of generation and nourishment, which are called "natural forces,"
    would be miraculous. Which is altogether inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherefore others have said that the human form can indeed begin to exist in
    some other matter, if we consider the human nature in general: but not if we
    consider it as in this individual. For in the individual the form remains
    confined to a certain determinate matter, on which it is first imprinted at
    the generation of that individual, so that it never leaves that matter until
    the ultimate dissolution of the individual. And this matter, say they,
    principally belongs to the true human nature. But since this matter does not
    suffice for the requisite quantity, some other matter must be added, through
    the change of food into the substance of the individual partaking thereof,
    in such a quantity as suffices for the increase required. And this matter,
    they state, belongs secondarily to the true human nature: because it is not
    required for the primary existence of the individual, but for the quantity
    due to him. And if anything further is produced from the food, this does not
    belong to true human nature, properly speaking. However, this also is
    inadmissible. First, because this opinion judges of living bodies as of
    inanimate bodies; in which, although there be a power of generating their
    like in species, there is not the power of generating their like in the
    individual; which power in living bodies is the nutritive power. Nothing,
    therefore, would be added to living bodies by their nutritive power, if
    their food were not changed into their true nature. Secondly, because the
    active seminal power is a certain impression derived from the soul of the
    begetter, as stated above (<a href="FP118.html#FPQ118OUTP1"
      >Question [118]</a
    >, <a href="FP118.html#FPQ118A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it cannot have
    a greater power in acting, than the soul from which it is derived. If,
    therefore, by the seminal power a certain matter truly assumes the form of
    human nature, much more can the soul, by the nutritive power, imprint the
    true form of human nature on the food which is assimilated. Thirdly, because
    food is needed not only for growth, else at the term of growth, food would
    be needful no longer; but also to renew that which is lost by the action of
    natural heat. But there would be no renewal, unless what is formed from the
    food, took the place of what is lost. Wherefore just as that which was there
    previously belonged to true human nature, so also does that which is formed
    from the food.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, according to others, it must be said that the food is really
    changed into the true human nature by reason of its assuming the specific
    form of flesh, bones and such like parts. This is what the Philosopher says
    (De Anima ii, 4): "Food nourishes inasmuch as it is potentially flesh."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord does not say that the "whole"
    of what enters into the mouth, but "all"---because something from every kind
    of food is cast out into the privy. It may also be said that whatever is
    generated from food, can be dissolved by natural heat, and be cast aside
    through the pores, as Jerome expounds the passage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By flesh belonging to the species, some
    have understood that which first receives the human species, which is
    derived from the begetter: this, they say, lasts as long as the individual
    does. By flesh belonging to the matter these understand what is generated
    from food: and this, they say, does not always remain, but as it comes so it
    goes. But this is contrary to the mind of Aristotle. For he says there, that
    "just as in things which have their species in matter"---for instance, wood
    or stone---"so in flesh, there is something belonging to the species, and
    something belonging to matter." Now it is clear that this distinction has no
    place in inanimate things, which are not generated seminally, or nourished.
    Again, since what is generated from food is united to, by mixing with, the
    body so nourished, just as water is mixed with wine, as the Philosopher says
    there by way of example: that which is added, and that to which it is added,
    cannot be different natures, since they are already made one by being mixed
    together. Therefore there is no reason for saying that one is destroyed by
    natural heat, while the other remains.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must therefore be said that this distinction of the Philosopher is not of
    different kinds of flesh, but of the same flesh considered from different
    points of view. For if we consider the flesh according to the species, that
    is, according to that which is formed therein, thus it remains always:
    because the nature of flesh always remains together with its natural
    disposition. But if we consider flesh according to matter, then it does not
    remain, but is gradually destroyed and renewed: thus in the fire of a
    furnace, the form of fire remains, but the matter is gradually consumed, and
    other matter is substituted in its place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The "radical humor" is said to comprise
    whatever the virtue of the species is founded on. If this be taken away it
    cannot be renewed; as when a man's hand or foot is amputated. But the
    "nutritive humor" is that which has not yet received perfectly the specific
    nature, but is on the way thereto; such is the blood, and the like.
    Wherefore if such be taken away, the virtue of the species remains in its
    root, which is not destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Every virtue of a passible body is
    weakened by continuous action, because such agents are also patient.
    Therefore the transforming virtue is strong at first so as to be able to
    transform not only enough for the renewal of what is lost, but also for
    growth. Later on it can only transform enough for the renewal of what is
    lost, and then growth ceases. At last it cannot even do this; and then
    begins decline. In fine, when this virtue fails altogether, the animal dies.
    Thus the virtue of wine that transforms the water added to it, is weakened
    by further additions of water, so as to become at length watery, as the
    Philosopher says by way of example (De Gener. i, 5).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (De Gener. i,
    5), when a certain matter is directly transformed into fire, then fire is
    said to be generated anew: but when matter is transformed into a fire
    already existing, then fire is said to be fed. Wherefore if the entire
    matter together loses the form of fire, and another matter transformed into
    fire, there will be another distinct fire. But if, while one piece of wood
    is burning, other wood is laid on, and so on until the first piece is
    entirely consumed, the same identical fire will remain all the time: because
    that which is added passes into what pre-existed. It is the same with living
    bodies, in which by means of nourishment that is renewed which was consumed
    by natural heat.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the semen is produced from surplus food?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the semen is not produced from
    the surplus food, but from the substance of the begetter. For Damascene says
    (De Fide Orth. i, 8) that "generation is a work of nature, producing, from
    the substance of the begetter, that which is begotten." But that which is
    generated is produced from the semen. Therefore the semen is produced from
    the substance of the begetter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the son is like his father, in respect
    of that which he receives from him. But if the semen from which something is
    generated, is produced from the surplus food, a man would receive nothing
    from his grandfather and his ancestors in whom the food never existed.
    Therefore a man would not be more like to his grandfather or ancestors, than
    to any other men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the food of the generator is sometimes
    the flesh of cows, pigs and suchlike. If therefore, the semen were produced
    from surplus food, the man begotten of such semen would be more akin to the
    cow and the pig, than to his father or other relations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x, 20) that
    we were in Adam "not only by seminal virtue, but also in the very substance
    of the body." But this would not be, if the semen were produced from surplus
    food. Therefore the semen is not produced therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher proves in many ways (De
    Gener. Animal. i, 18) that "the semen is surplus food."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This question depends in some way on what has
    been stated above (<a href="FP119.html#FPQ119A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FP118.html#FPQ118OUTP1">Question [118]</a>,
    <a href="FP118.html#FPQ118A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For if human nature has
    a virtue for the communication of its form to alien matter not only in
    another, but also in its own subject; it is clear that the food which at
    first is dissimilar, becomes at length similar through the form communicated
    to it. Now it belongs to the natural order that a thing should be reduced
    from potentiality to act gradually: hence in things generated we observe
    that at first each is imperfect and is afterwards perfected. But it is clear
    that the common is to the proper and determinate, as imperfect is to
    perfect: therefore we see that in the generation of an animal, the animal is
    generated first, then the man or the horse. So therefore food first of all
    receives a certain common virtue in regard to all the parts of the body,
    which virtue is subsequently determinate to this or that part.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is not possible that the semen be a kind of solution from what is
    already transformed into the substance of the members. For this solution, if
    it does not retain the nature of the member it is taken from, it would no
    longer be of the nature of the begetter, and would be due to a process of
    corruption; and consequently it would not have the power of transforming
    something else into the likeness of that nature. But if it retained the
    nature of the member it is taken from, then, since it is limited to a
    certain part of the body, it would not have the power of moving towards (the
    production of) the whole nature, but only the nature of that part. Unless
    one were to say that the solution is taken from all the parts of the body,
    and that it retains the nature of each part. Thus the semen would be a small
    animal in act; and generation of animal from animal would be a mere
    division, as mud is generated from mud, and as animals which continue to
    live after being cut in two: which is inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It remains to be said, therefore, that the semen is not something separated
    from what was before the actual whole; rather is it the whole, though
    potentially, having the power, derived from the soul of the begetter, to
    produce the whole body, as stated above (<a href="FP119.html#FPQ119A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108OUTP1">Question [108]</a>,
    <a href="FP108.html#FPQ108A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now that which is in
    potentiality to the whole, is that which is generated from the food, before
    it is transformed into the substance of the members. Therefore the semen is
    taken from this. In this sense the nutritive power is said to serve the
    generative power: because what is transformed by the nutritive power is
    employed as semen by the generative power. A sign of this, according to the
    Philosopher, is that animals of great size, which require much food, have
    little semen in proportion to the size of their bodies, and generated
    seldom; in like manner fat men, and for the same reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Generation is from the substance of the
    begetter in animals and plants, inasmuch as the semen owes its virtue to the
    form of the begetter, and inasmuch as it is in potentiality to the
    substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of the begetter to the
    begotten is on account not of the matter, but of the form of the agent that
    generates its like. Wherefore in order for a man to be like his grandfather,
    there is no need that the corporeal seminal matter should have been in the
    grandfather; but that there be in the semen a virtue derived from the soul
    of the grandfather through the father. In like manner the third objection is
    answered. For kinship is not in relation to matter, but rather to the
    derivation of the forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> These words of Augustine are not to be
    understood as though the immediate seminal virtue, or the corporeal
    substance from which this individual was formed were actually in Adam: but
    so that both were in Adam as in principle. For even the corporeal matter,
    which is supplied by the mother, and which he calls the corporeal substance,
    is originally derived from Adam: and likewise the active seminal power of
    the father, which is the immediate seminal virtue (in the production) of
    this man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But Christ is said to have been in Adam according to the "corporeal
    substance," not according to the seminal virtue. Because the matter from
    which His Body was formed, and which was supplied by the Virgin Mother, was
    derived from Adam; whereas the active virtue was not derived from Adam,
    because His Body was not formed by the seminal virtue of a man, but by the
    operation of the Holy Ghost. For "such a birth was becoming to Him," [*Hymn
    for Vespers at Christmas; Breviary, O. P.], WHO IS ABOVE ALL GOD FOR EVER
    BLESSED. Amen.<br />
