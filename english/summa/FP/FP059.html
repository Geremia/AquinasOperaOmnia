  <h3 align="center">THE WILL OF THE ANGELS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must treat of things concerning the will of the angels.
    In the first place we shall treat of the will itself; secondly, of its
    movement, which is love. Under the first heading there are four points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP059.html#FPQ59A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is will in the
    angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP059.html#FPQ59A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the will of the angel is
    his nature, or his intellect?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP059.html#FPQ59A3THEP1">(3)</a> Is there free-will in the angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP059.html#FPQ59A4THEP1">(4)</a> Is there an irascible and a
    concupiscible appetite in them?

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is will in the angels?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no will in the
    angels. For as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 42), "The will is
    in the reason." But there is no reason in the angels, but something higher
    than reason. Therefore there is no will in the angels, but something higher
    than the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the will is comprised under the
    appetite, as is evident from the Philosopher (De Anima iii, text. 42). But
    the appetite argues something imperfect; because it is a desire of something
    not as yet possessed. Therefore, since there is no imperfection in the
    angels, especially in the blessed ones, it seems that there is no will in
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, text.
    54) that the will is a mover which is moved; for it is moved by the
    appetible object understood. Now the angels are immovable, since they are
    incorporeal. Therefore there is no will in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. x, 11,12) that the
    image of the Trinity is found in the soul according to memory,
    understanding, and will. But God's image is found not only in the soul of
    man, but also in the angelic mind, since it also is capable of knowing God.
    Therefore there is will in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must necessarily place a will in the angels.
    In evidence thereof, it must be borne in mind that, since all things flow
    from the Divine will, all things in their own way are inclined by appetite
    towards good, but in different ways. Some are inclined to good by their
    natural inclination, without knowledge, as plants and inanimate bodies. Such
    inclination towards good is called "a natural appetite." Others, again, are
    inclined towards good, but with some knowledge; not that they know the
    aspect of goodness, but that they apprehend some particular good; as in the
    sense, which knows the sweet, the white, and so on. The inclination which
    follows this apprehension is called "a sensitive appetite." Other things,
    again, have an inclination towards good, but with a knowledge whereby they
    perceive the aspect of goodness; this belongs to the intellect. This is most
    perfectly inclined towards what is good; not, indeed, as if it were merely
    guided by another towards some particular good only, like things devoid of
    knowledge, nor towards some particular good only, as things which have only
    sensitive knowledge, but as inclined towards good in general. Such
    inclination is termed "will." Accordingly, since the angels by their
    intellect know the universal aspect of goodness, it is manifest that there
    is a will in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Reason surpasses sense in a different
    way from that in which intellect surpasses reason. Reason surpasses sense
    according to the diversity of the objects known; for sense judges of
    particular objects, while reason judges of universals. Therefore there must
    be one appetite tending towards good in the abstract, which appetite belongs
    to reason; and another with a tendency towards particular good, which
    appetite belongs to sense. But intellect and reason differ as to their
    manner of knowing; because the intellect knows by simple intuition, while
    reason knows by a process of discursion from one thing to another.
    Nevertheless by such discursion reason comes to know what intellect learns
    without it, namely, the universal. Consequently the object presented to the
    appetitive faculty on the part of reason and on the part of intellect is the
    same. Therefore in the angels, who are purely intellectual, there is no
    appetite higher than the will.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the name of the appetitive part
    is derived from seeking things not yet possessed, yet the appetitive part
    reaches out not to these things only, but also to many other things; thus
    the name of a stone [lapis] is derived from injuring the foot [laesione
    pedis], though not this alone belongs to a stone. In the same way the
    irascible faculty is so denominated from anger [ira]; though at the same
    time there are several other passions in it, as hope, daring, and the
    rest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The will is called a mover which is
    moved, according as to will and to understand are termed movements of a
    kind; and there is nothing to prevent movement of this kind from existing in
    the angels, since such movement is the act of a perfect agent, as stated in
    De Anima iii, text. 28.<br />

    Whether in the angels the will differs from the intellect?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the angel the will does not
    differ from the intellect and from the nature. For an angel is more simple
    than a natural body. But a natural body is inclined through its form towards
    its end, which is its good. Therefore much more so is the angel. Now the
    angel's form is either the nature in which he subsists, or else it is some
    species within his intellect. Therefore the angel inclines towards the good
    through his own nature, or through an intelligible species. But such
    inclination towards the good belongs to the will. Therefore the will of the
    angel does not differ from his nature or his intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object of the intellect is the true,
    while the object of the will is the good. Now the good and the true differ,
    not really but only logically [*Cf. Question [16], Article [4]]. Therefore
    will and intellect are not really different.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the distinction of common and proper
    does not differentiate the faculties; for the same power of sight perceives
    color and whiteness. But the good and the true seem to be mutually related
    as common to particular; for the true is a particular good, to wit, of the
    intellect. Therefore the will, whose object is the good, does not differ
    from the intellect, whose object is the true.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The will in the angels regards good things
    only, while their intellect regards both good and bad things, for they know
    both. Therefore the will of the angels is distinct from their intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the angels the will is a special faculty or
    power, which is neither their nature nor their intellect. That it is not
    their nature is manifest from this, that the nature or essence of a thing is
    completely comprised within it: whatever, then, extends to anything beyond
    it, is not its essence. Hence we see in natural bodies that the inclination
    to being does not come from anything superadded to the essence, but from the
    matter which desires being before possessing it, and from the form which
    keeps it in such being when once it exists. But the inclination towards
    something extrinsic comes from something superadded to the essence; as
    tendency to a place comes from gravity or lightness, while the inclination
    to make something like itself comes from the active qualities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the will has a natural tendency towards good. Consequently there alone
    are essence and will identified where all good is contained within the
    essence of him who wills; that is to say, in God, Who wills nothing beyond
    Himself except on account of His goodness. This cannot be said of any
    creature, because infinite goodness is quite foreign to the nature of any
    created thing. Accordingly, neither the will of the angel, nor that of any
    creature, can be the same thing as its essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner neither can the will be the same thing as the intellect of
    angel or man. Because knowledge comes about in so far as the object known is
    within the knower; consequently the intellect extends itself to what is
    outside it, according as what, in its essence, is outside it is disposed to
    be somehow within it. On the other hand, the will goes out to what is beyond
    it, according as by a kind of inclination it tends, in a manner, to what is
    outside it. Now it belongs to one faculty to have within itself something
    which is outside it, and to another faculty to tend to what is outside it.
    Consequently intellect and will must necessarily be different powers in
    every creature. It is not so with God, for He has within Himself universal
    being, and the universal good. Therefore both intellect and will are His
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A natural body is moved to its own being
    by its substantial form: while it is inclined to something outside by
    something additional, as has been said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faculties are not differentiated by any
    material difference of their objects, but according to their formal
    distinction, which is taken from the nature of the object as such.
    Consequently the diversity derived from the notion of good and true suffices
    for the difference of intellect from will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Because the good and the true are really
    convertible, it follows that the good is apprehended by the intellect as
    something true; while the true is desired by the will as something good.
    Nevertheless, the diversity of their aspects is sufficient for diversifying
    the faculties, as was said above (ad 2).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is free-will in the angels?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no free-will in the
    angels. For the act of free-will is to choose. But there can be no choice
    with the angels, because choice is "the desire of something after taking
    counsel," while counsel is "a kind of inquiry," as stated in Ethic. iii, 3.
    But the angels' knowledge is not the result of inquiring, for this belongs
    to the discursiveness of reason. Therefore it appears that there is no
    free-will in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, free-will implies indifference to
    alternatives. But in the angels on the part of their intellect there is no
    such indifference; because, as was observed already (<a
      href="FP058.html#FPQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="FP058.html#FPQ58A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), their intellect is
    not deceived as to things which are naturally intelligible to them.
    Therefore neither on the part of their appetitive faculty can there be
    free-will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the natural endowments of the angels
    belong to them according to degrees of more or less; because in the higher
    angels the intellectual nature is more perfect than in the lower. But the
    free-will does not admit of degrees. Therefore there is no free-will in
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Free-will is part of man's dignity. But the
    angels' dignity surpasses that of men. Therefore, since free-will is in men,
    with much more reason is it in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some things there are which act, not from any
    previous judgment, but, as it were, moved and made to act by others; just as
    the arrow is directed to the target by the archer. Others act from some kind
    of judgment; but not from free-will, such as irrational animals; for the
    sheep flies from the wolf by a kind of judgment whereby it esteems it to be
    hurtful to itself: such a judgment is not a free one, but implanted by
    nature. Only an agent endowed with an intellect can act with a judgment
    which is free, in so far as it apprehends the common note of goodness; from
    which it can judge this or the other thing to be good. Consequently,
    wherever there is intellect, there is free-will. It is therefore manifest
    that just as there is intellect, so is there free-will in the angels, and in
    a higher degree of perfection than in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of choice,
    as it is in man. As a man's estimate in speculative matters differs from an
    angel's in this, that the one needs not to inquire, while the other does so
    need; so is it in practical matters. Hence there is choice in the angels,
    yet not with the inquisitive deliberation of counsel, but by the sudden
    acceptance of truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As was observed already (<a
      href="FP059.html#FPQ59A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), knowledge is effected by the presence of the known within the knower.
    Now it is a mark of imperfection in anything not to have within it what it
    should naturally have. Consequently an angel would not be perfect in his
    nature, if his intellect were not determined to every truth which he can
    know naturally. But the act of the appetitive faculty comes of this, that
    the affection is directed to something outside. Yet the perfection of a
    thing does not come from everything to which it is inclined, but only from
    something which is higher than it. Therefore it does not argue imperfection
    in an angel if his will be not determined with regard to things beneath him;
    but it would argue imperfection in him, with he to be indeterminate to what
    is above him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Free-will exists in a nobler manner in
    the higher angels than it does in the lower, as also does the judgment of
    the intellect. Yet it is true that liberty, in so far as the removal of
    compulsion is considered, is not susceptible of greater and less degree;
    because privations and negations are not lessened nor increased directly of
    themselves; but only by their cause, or through the addition of some
    qualification.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the angels?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is an irascible and a
    concupiscible appetite in the angels. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that
    in the demons there is "unreasonable fury and wild concupiscence." But
    demons are of the same nature as angels; for sin has not altered their
    nature. Therefore there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, love and joy are in the concupiscible;
    while anger, hope, and fear are in the irascible appetite. But in the Sacred
    Scriptures these things are attributed both to the good and to the wicked
    angels. Therefore there is an irascible and a concupiscible appetite in the
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some virtues are said to reside in the
    irascible appetite and some in the concupiscible: thus charity and
    temperance appear to be in the concupiscible, while hope and fortitude are
    in the irascible. But these virtues are in the angels. Therefore there is
    both a concupiscible and an irascible appetite in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 42)
    that the irascible and concupiscible are in the sensitive part, which does
    not exist in angels. Consequently there is no irascible or concupiscible
    appetite in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The intellective appetite is not divided into
    irascible and concupiscible; only the sensitive appetite is so divided. The
    reason of this is because, since the faculties are distinguished from one
    another not according to the material but only by the formal distinction of
    objects, if to any faculty there respond an object according to some common
    idea, there will be no distinction of faculties according to the diversity
    of the particular things contained under that common idea. Just as if the
    proper object of the power of sight be color as such, then there are not
    several powers of sight distinguished according to the difference of black
    and white: whereas if the proper object of any faculty were white, as white,
    then the faculty of seeing white would be distinguished from the faculty of
    seeing black.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is quite evident from what has been said (<a
      href="FP059.html#FPQ59A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="FP016.html#FPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>,
    <a href="FP016.html#FPQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that the object of the
    intellective appetite, otherwise known as the will, is good according to the
    common aspect of goodness; nor can there be any appetite except of what is
    good. Hence, in the intellective part, the appetite is not divided according
    to the distinction of some particular good things, as the sensitive appetite
    is divided, which does not crave for what is good according to its common
    aspect, but for some particular good object. Accordingly, since there exists
    in the angels only an intellective appetite, their appetite is not
    distinguished into irascible and concupiscible, but remains undivided; and
    it is called the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fury and concupiscence are
    metaphorically said to be in the demons, as anger is sometimes attributed to
    God;---on account of the resemblance in the effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Love and joy, in so far as they are
    passions, are in the concupiscible appetite, but in so far as they express a
    simple act of the will, they are in the intellective part: in this sense to
    love is to wish well to anyone; and to be glad is for the will to repose in
    some good possessed. Universally speaking, none of these things is said of
    the angels, as by way of passions; as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Charity, as a virtue, is not in the
    concupiscible appetite, but in the will; because the object of the
    concupiscible appetite is the good as delectable to the senses. But the
    Divine goodness, which is the object of charity, is not of any such kind.
    For the same reason it must be said that hope does not exist in the
    irascible appetite; because the object of the irascible appetite is
    something arduous belonging to the sensible order, which the virtue of hope
    does not regard; since the object of hope is arduous and divine. Temperance,
    however, considered as a human virtue, deals with the desires of sensible
    pleasures, which belong to the concupiscible faculty. Similarly, fortitude
    regulates daring and fear, which reside in the irascible part. Consequently
    temperance, in so far as it is a human virtue, resides in the concupiscible
    part, and fortitude in the irascible. But they do not exist in the angels in
    this manner. For in them there are no passions of concupiscence, nor of fear
    and daring, to be regulated by temperance and fortitude. But temperance is
    predicated of them according as in moderation they display their will in
    conformity with the Divine will. Fortitude is likewise attributed to them,
    in so far as they firmly carry out the Divine will. All of this is done by
    their will, and not by the irascible or concupiscible appetite.<br />
