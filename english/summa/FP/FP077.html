    OF THOSE THINGS WHICH BELONG TO THE POWERS OF THE SOUL IN GENERAL (EIGHT
    ARTICLES)<br />
    <br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We proceed to consider those things which belong to the powers of the soul;
    first, in general, secondly, in particular. Under the first head there are
    eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the essence of the soul is
    its power?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether there is one power of the
    soul, or several?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A3THEP1">(3)</a> How the powers of the soul are
    distinguished from one another?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the orders of the powers, one
    to another;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the powers of the soul are
    in it as in their subject?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the powers flow from the
    essence of the soul?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether one power rises from
    another?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether all the powers of the soul
    remain in the soul after death?

  <h3 align="left">Whether the essence of the soul is its power?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the essence of the soul is its
    power. For Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 4), that "mind, knowledge, and love
    are in the soul substantially, or, which is the same thing, essentially":
    and (De Trin. x, 11), that "memory, understanding, and will are one life,
    one mind, one essence."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul is nobler than primary matter.
    But primary matter is its own potentiality. Much more therefore is the soul
    its own power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the substantial form is simpler than the
    accidental form; a sign of which is that the substantial form is not
    intensified or relaxed, but is indivisible. But the accidental form is its
    own power. Much more therefore is that substantial form which is the
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we sense by the sensitive power and we
    understand by the intellectual power. But "that by which we first sense and
    understand" is the soul, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 2).
    Therefore the soul is its own power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, whatever does not belong to the essence
    is an accident. Therefore if the power of the soul is something else besides
    the essence thereof, it is an accident, which is contrary to Augustine, who
    says that the foregoing (see OBJ 1) "are not in the soul as in a subject as
    color or shape, or any other quality, or quantity, are in a body; for
    whatever is so, does not exceed the subject in which it is: Whereas the mind
    can love and know other things" (De Trin. ix, 4).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, " a simple form cannot be a subject."
    But the soul is a simple form; since it is not composed of matter and form,
    as we have said above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore the power of
    the soul cannot be in it as in a subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, an accident is not the principle of a
    substantial difference. But sensitive and rational are substantial
    differences; and they are taken from sense and reason, which are powers of
    the soul. Therefore the powers of the soul are not accidents; and so it
    would seem that the power of the soul is its own essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xi) says that
    "heavenly spirits are divided into essence, power, and operation." Much
    more, then, in the soul is the essence distinct from the virtue or power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible to admit that the power of the
    soul is its essence, although some have maintained it. For the present
    purpose this may be proved in two ways. First, because, since power and act
    divide being and every kind of being, we must refer a power and its act to
    the same genus. Therefore, if the act be not in the genus of substance, the
    power directed to that act cannot be in the genus of substance. Now the
    operation of the soul is not in the genus of substance; for this belongs to
    God alone, whose operation is His own substance. Wherefore the Divine power
    which is the principle of His operation is the Divine Essence itself. This
    cannot be true either of the soul, or of any creature; as we have said above
    when speaking of the angels (<a href="FP054.html#FPQ54OUTP1"
      >Question [54]</a
    >, <a href="FP054.html#FPQ54A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Secondly, this may be
    also shown to be impossible in the soul. For the soul by its very essence is
    an act. Therefore if the very essence of the soul were the immediate
    principle of operation, whatever has a soul would always have actual vital
    actions, as that which has a soul is always an actually living thing. For as
    a form the soul is not an act ordained to a further act, but the ultimate
    term of generation. Wherefore, for it to be in potentiality to another act,
    does not belong to it according to its essence, as a form, but according to
    its power. So the soul itself, as the subject of its power, is called the
    first act, with a further relation to the second act. Now we observe that
    what has a soul is not always actual with respect to its vital operations;
    whence also it is said in the definition of the soul, that it is "the act of
    a body having life potentially"; which potentiality, however, "does not
    exclude the soul." Therefore it follows that the essence of the soul is not
    its power. For nothing is in potentiality by reason of an act, as act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of the mind as it
    knows and loves itself. Thus knowledge and love as referred to the soul as
    known and loved, are substantially or essentially in the soul, for the very
    substance or essence of the soul is known and loved. In the same way are we
    to understand what he says in the other passage, that those things are "one
    life, one mind, one essence." Or, as some say, this passage is true in the
    sense in which the potential whole is predicated of its parts, being midway
    between the universal whole, and the integral whole. For the universal whole
    is in each part according to its entire essence and power; as animal in a
    man and in a horse; and therefore it is properly predicated of each part.
    But the integral whole is not in each part, neither according to its whole
    essence, nor according to its whole power. Therefore in no way can it be
    predicated of each part; yet in a way it is predicated, though improperly,
    of all the parts together; as if we were to say that the wall, roof, and
    foundations are a house. But the potential whole is in each part according
    to its whole essence, not, however, according to its whole power. Therefore
    in a way it can be predicated of each part, but not so properly as the
    universal whole. In this sense, Augustine says that the memory,
    understanding, and the will are the one essence of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The act to which primary matter is in
    potentiality is the substantial form. Therefore the potentiality of matter
    is nothing else but its essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Action belongs to the composite, as does
    existence; for to act belongs to what exists. Now the composite has
    substantial existence through the substantial form; and it operates by the
    power which results from the substantial form. Hence an active accidental
    form is to the substantial form of the agent (for instance, heat compared to
    the form of fire) as the power of the soul is to the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> That the accidental form is a principle
    of action is due to the substantial form. Therefore the substantial form is
    the first principle of action; but not the proximate principle. In this
    sense the Philosopher says that "the soul is that whereby we understand and
    sense."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> If we take accident as meaning what is
    divided against substance, then there can be no medium between substance and
    accident; because they are divided by affirmation and negation, that is,
    according to existence in a subject, and non-existence in a subject. In this
    sense, as the power of the soul is not its essence, it must be an accident;
    and it belongs to the second species of accident, that of quality. But if we
    take accident as one of the five universals, in this sense there is a medium
    between substance and accident. For the substance is all that belongs to the
    essence of a thing; whereas whatever is beyond the essence of a thing cannot
    be called accident in this sense; but only what is not caused by the
    essential principle of the species. For the 'proper' does not belong to the
    essence of a thing, but is caused by the essential principles of the
    species; wherefore it is a medium between the essence and accident thus
    understood. In this sense the powers of the soul may be said to be a medium
    between substance and accident, as being natural properties of the soul.
    When Augustine says that knowledge and love are not in the soul as accidents
    in a subject, this must be understood in the sense given above, inasmuch as
    they are compared to the soul, not as loving and knowing, but as loved and
    known. His argument proceeds in this sense; for if love were in the soul
    loved as in a subject, it would follow that an accident transcends its
    subject, since even other things are loved through the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Although the soul is not composed of
    matter and form, yet it has an admixture of potentiality, as we have said
    above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4); and for this
    reason it can be the subject of an accident. The statement quoted is
    verified in God, Who is the Pure Act; in treating of which subject Boethius
    employs that phrase (De Trin. i).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> Rational and sensitive, as differences,
    are not taken from the powers of sense and reason, but from the sensitive
    and rational soul itself. But because substantial forms, which in themselves
    are unknown to us, are known by their accidents; nothing prevents us from
    sometimes substituting accidents for substantial differences.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are several powers of the soul?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not several powers
    of the soul. For the intellectual soul approaches nearest to the likeness of
    God. But in God there is one simple power: and therefore also in the
    intellectual soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the higher a power is, the more unified
    it is. But the intellectual soul excels all other forms in power. Therefore
    above all others it has one virtue or power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to operate belongs to what is in act.
    But by the one essence of the soul, man has actual existence in the
    different degrees of perfection, as we have seen above (<a
      href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1"
      >Question [76]</a
    >, <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). Therefore by the
    one power of the soul he performs operations of various degrees.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher places several powers in the
    soul (De Anima ii, 2,3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Of necessity we must place several powers in
    the soul. To make this evident, we observe that, as the Philosopher says (De
    Coelo ii, 12), the lowest order of things cannot acquire perfect goodness,
    but they acquire a certain imperfect goodness, by few movements; and those
    which belong to a higher order acquire perfect goodness by many movements;
    and those yet higher acquire perfect goodness by few movements; and the
    highest perfection is found in those things which acquire perfect goodness
    without any movement whatever. Thus he is least of all disposed of health,
    who can only acquire imperfect health by means of a few remedies; better
    disposed is he who can acquire perfect health by means of many remedies; and
    better still, he who can by few remedies; best of all is he who has perfect
    health without any remedies. We conclude, therefore, that things which are
    below man acquire a certain limited goodness; and so they have a few
    determinate operations and powers. But man can acquire universal and perfect
    goodness, because he can acquire beatitude. Yet he is in the last degree,
    according to his nature, of those to whom beatitude is possible; therefore
    the human soul requires many and various operations and powers. But to
    angels a smaller variety of powers is sufficient. In God there is no power
    or action beyond His own Essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There is yet another reason why the human soul abounds in a variety of
    powers---because it is on the confines of spiritual and corporeal creatures;
    and therefore the powers of both meet together in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellectual soul approaches to the
    Divine likeness, more than inferior creatures, in being able to acquire
    perfect goodness; although by many and various means; and in this it falls
    short of more perfect creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A unified power is superior if it
    extends to equal things: but a multiform power is superior to it, if it is
    over many things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One thing has one substantial existence,
    but may have several operations. So there is one essence of the soul, with
    several powers.<br />

    Whether the powers are distinguished by their acts and objects?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the powers of the soul are not
    distinguished by acts and objects. For nothing is determined to its species
    by what is subsequent and extrinsic to it. But the act is subsequent to the
    power; and the object is extrinsic to it. Therefore the soul's powers are
    not specifically distinct by acts and objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contraries are what differ most from
    each other. Therefore if the powers are distinguished by their objects, it
    follows that the same power could not have contrary objects. This is clearly
    false in almost all the powers; for the power of vision extends to white and
    black, and the power to taste to sweet and bitter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the cause be removed, the effect is
    removed. Hence if the difference of powers came from the difference of
    objects, the same object would not come under different powers. This is
    clearly false; for the same thing is known by the cognitive power, and
    desired by the appetitive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that which of itself is the cause of
    anything, is the cause thereof, wherever it is. But various objects which
    belong to various powers, belong also to some one power; as sound and color
    belong to sight and hearing, which are different powers, yet they come under
    the one power of common sense. Therefore the powers are not distinguished
    according to the difference of their objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things that are subsequent are distinguished
    by what precedes. But the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 4) that "acts and
    operations precede the powers according to reason; and these again are
    preceded by their opposites," that is their objects. Therefore the powers
    are distinguished according to their acts and objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A power as such is directed to an act.
    Wherefore we seek to know the nature of a power from the act to which it is
    directed, and consequently the nature of a power is diversified, as the
    nature of the act is diversified. Now the nature of an act is diversified
    according to the various natures of the objects. For every act is either of
    an active power or of a passive power. Now, the object is to the act of a
    passive power, as the principle and moving cause: for color is the principle
    of vision, inasmuch as it moves the sight. On the other hand, to the act of
    an active power the object is a term and end; as the object of the power of
    growth is perfect quantity, which is the end of growth. Now, from these two
    things an act receives its species, namely, from its principle, or from its
    end or term; for the act of heating differs from the act of cooling, in
    this, that the former proceeds from something hot, which is the active
    principle, to heat; the latter from something cold, which is the active
    principle, to cold. Therefore the powers are of necessity distinguished by
    their acts and objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, we must observe that things which are accidental do not change
    the species. For since to be colored is accidental to an animal, its species
    is not changed by a difference of color, but by a difference in that which
    belongs to the nature of an animal, that is to say, by a difference in the
    sensitive soul, which is sometimes rational, and sometimes otherwise. Hence
    "rational" and "irrational" are differences dividing animal, constituting
    its various species. In like manner therefore, not any variety of objects
    diversifies the powers of the soul, but a difference in that to which the
    power of its very nature is directed. Thus the senses of their very nature
    are directed to the passive quality which of itself is divided into color,
    sound, and the like, and therefore there is one sensitive power with regard
    to color, namely, the sight, and another with regard to sound, namely,
    hearing. But it is accidental to a passive quality, for instance, to
    something colored, to be a musician or a grammarian, great or small, a man
    or a stone. Therefore by reason of such differences the powers of the soul
    are not distinct.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Act, though subsequent in existence to
    power, is, nevertheless, prior to it in intention and logically; as the end
    is with regard to the agent. And the object, although extrinsic, is,
    nevertheless, the principle or end of the action; and those conditions which
    are intrinsic to a thing, are proportionate to its principle and end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If any power were to have one of two
    contraries as such for its object, the other contrary would belong to
    another power. But the power of the soul does not regard the nature of the
    contrary as such, but rather the common aspect of both contraries; as sight
    does not regard white as such, but as color. This is because of two
    contraries one, in a manner, includes the idea of the other, since they are
    to one another as perfect and imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing prevents things which coincide
    in subject, from being considered under different aspects; therefore they
    can belong to various powers of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The higher power of itself regards a
    more universal formality of the object than the lower power; because the
    higher a power is, to a greater number of things does it extend. Therefore
    many things are combined in the one formality of the object, which the
    higher power considers of itself; while they differ in the formalities
    regarded by the lower powers of themselves. Thus it is that various objects
    belong to various lower powers; which objects, however, are subject to one
    higher power.<br />

    Whether among the powers of the soul there is order?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no order among the
    powers of the soul. For in those things which come under one division, there
    is no before and after, but all are naturally simultaneous. But the powers
    of the soul are contradistinguished from one another. Therefore there is no
    order among them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the powers of the soul are referred to
    their objects and to the soul itself. On the part of the soul, there is not
    order among them, because the soul is one. In like manner the objects are
    various and dissimilar, as color and sound. Therefore there is no order
    among the powers of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, where there is order among powers, we
    find that the operation of one depends on the operation of another. But the
    action of one power of the soul does not depend on that of another; for
    sight can act independently of hearing, and conversely. Therefore there is
    no order among the powers of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (De Anima ii, 3) compares the
    parts or powers of the soul to figures. But figures have an order among
    themselves. Therefore the powers of the soul have order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the soul is one, and the powers are many;
    and since a number of things that proceed from one must proceed in a certain
    order; there must be some order among the powers of the soul. Accordingly we
    may observe a triple order among them, two of which correspond to the
    dependence of one power on another; while the third is taken from the order
    of the objects. Now the dependence of one power on another can be taken in
    two ways; according to the order of nature, forasmuch as perfect things are
    by their nature prior to imperfect things; and according to the order of
    generation and time; forasmuch as from being imperfect, a thing comes to be
    perfect. Thus, according to the first kind of order among the powers, the
    intellectual powers are prior to the sensitive powers; wherefore they direct
    them and command them. Likewise the sensitive powers are prior in this order
    to the powers of the nutritive soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second kind of order, it is the other way about. For the powers of
    the nutritive soul are prior by way of generation to the powers of the
    sensitive soul; for which, therefore, they prepare the body. The same is to
    be said of the sensitive powers with regard to the intellectual. But in the
    third kind of order, certain sensitive powers are ordered among themselves,
    namely, sight, hearing, and smelling. For the visible naturally comes first;
    since it is common to higher and lower bodies. But sound is audible in the
    air, which is naturally prior to the mingling of elements, of which smell is
    the result.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The species of a given genus are to one
    another as before and after, like numbers and figures, if considered in
    their nature; although they may be said to be simultaneous, according as
    they receive the predication of the common genus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This order among the powers of the soul
    is both on the part of the soul (which, though it be one according to its
    essence, has a certain aptitude to various acts in a certain order) and on
    the part of the objects, and furthermore on the part of the acts, as we have
    said above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is verified as regards
    those powers among which order of the third kind exists. Those powers among
    which the two other kinds of order exist are such that the action of one
    depends on another.<br />

    Whether all the powers of the soul are in the soul as their subject?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the powers of the soul are
    in the soul as their subject. For as the powers of the body are to the body;
    so are the powers of the soul to the soul. But the body is the subject of
    the corporeal powers. Therefore the soul is the subject of the powers of the
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the operations of the powers of the soul
    are attributed to the body by reason of the soul; because, as the
    Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 2), "The soul is that by which we sense and
    understand primarily." But the natural principles of the operations of the
    soul are the powers. Therefore the powers are primarily in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24)
    that the soul senses certain things, not through the body, in fact, without
    the body, as fear and such like; and some things through the body. But if
    the sensitive powers were not in the soul alone as their subject, the soul
    could not sense anything without the body. Therefore the soul is the subject
    of the sensitive powers; and for a similar reason, of all the other
    powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Somno et Vigilia i)
    that "sensation belongs neither to the soul, nor to the body, but to the
    composite." Therefore the sensitive power is in "the composite" as its
    subject. Therefore the soul alone is not the subject of all the powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The subject of operative power is that which is
    able to operate, for every accident denominates its proper subject. Now the
    same is that which is able to operate, and that which does operate.
    Wherefore the "subject of power" is of necessity "the subject of operation,"
    as again the Philosopher says in the beginning of De Somno et Vigilia. Now,
    it is clear from what we have said above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3;
    <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), that some
    operations of the soul are performed without a corporeal organ, as
    understanding and will. Hence the powers of these operations are in the soul
    as their subject. But some operations of the soul are performed by means of
    corporeal organs; as sight by the eye, and hearing by the ear. And so it is
    with all the other operations of the nutritive and sensitive parts.
    Therefore the powers which are the principles of these operations have their
    subject in the composite, and not in the soul alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the powers are said to belong to the
    soul, not as their subject, but as their principle; because it is by the
    soul that the composite has the power to perform such operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All such powers are primarily in the
    soul, as compared to the composite; not as in their subject, but as in their
    principle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Plato's opinion was that sensation is an
    operation proper to the soul, just as understanding is. Now in many things
    relating to Philosophy Augustine makes use of the opinions of Plato, not
    asserting them as true, but relating them. However, as far as the present
    question is concerned, when it is said that the soul senses some things with
    the body, and some without the body, this can be taken in two ways. Firstly,
    the words "with the body or without the body" may determine the act of sense
    in its mode of proceeding from the sentient. Thus the soul senses nothing
    without the body, because the action of sensation cannot proceed from the
    soul except by a corporeal organ. Secondly, they may be understood as
    determining the act of sense on the part of the object sensed. Thus the soul
    senses some things with the body, that is, things existing in the body, as
    when it feels a wound or something of that sort; while it senses some things
    without the body, that is, which do not exist in the body, but only in the
    apprehension of the soul, as when it feels sad or joyful on hearing
    something.<br />

    Whether the powers of the soul flow from its essence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the powers of the soul do not
    flow from its essence. For different things do not proceed from one simple
    thing. But the essence of the soul is one and simple. Since, therefore, the
    powers of the soul are many and various, they cannot proceed from its
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that from which a thing proceeds is its
    cause. But the essence of the soul cannot be said to be the cause of the
    powers; as is clear if one considers the different kinds of causes.
    Therefore the powers of the soul do not flow from its essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, emanation involves some sort of
    movement. But nothing is moved by itself, as the Philosopher proves (Phys.
    vii, 1,2); except, perhaps, by reason of a part of itself, as an animal is
    said to be moved by itself, because one part thereof moves and another is
    moved. Neither is the soul moved, as the Philosopher proves (De Anima i, 4).
    Therefore the soul does not produce its powers within itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The powers of the soul are its natural
    properties. But the subject is the cause of its proper accidents; whence
    also it is included in the definition of accident, as is clear from Metaph.
    vii (Did. vi, 4). Therefore the powers of the soul proceed from its essence
    as their cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The substantial and the accidental form partly
    agree and partly differ. They agree in this, that each is an act; and that
    by each of them something is after a manner actual. They differ, however, in
    two respects. First, because the substantial form makes a thing to exist
    absolutely, and its subject is something purely potential. But the
    accidental form does not make a thing to exist absolutely but to be such, or
    so great, or in some particular condition; for its subject is an actual
    being. Hence it is clear that actuality is observed in the substantial form
    prior to its being observed in the subject: and since that which is first in
    a genus is the cause in that genus, the substantial form causes existence in
    its subject. On the other hand, actuality is observed in the subject of the
    accidental form prior to its being observed in the accidental form;
    wherefore the actuality of the accidental form is caused by the actuality of
    the subject. So the subject, forasmuch as it is in potentiality, is
    receptive of the accidental form: but forasmuch as it is in act, it produces
    it. This I say of the proper and "per se" accident; for with regard to the
    extraneous accident, the subject is receptive only, the accident being
    caused by an extrinsic agent. Secondly, substantial and accidental forms
    differ, because, since that which is the less principal exists for the sake
    of that which is the more principal, matter therefore exists on account of
    the substantial form; while on the contrary, the accidental form exists on
    account of the completeness of the subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is clear, from what has been said (<a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), that either the subject of the soul's powers is the soul itself alone,
    which can be the subject of an accident, forasmuch as it has something of
    potentiality, as we have said above (<a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 6); or else this subject is the composite. Now the composite is actual
    by the soul. Whence it is clear that all the powers of the soul, whether
    their subject be the soul alone, or the composite, flow from the essence of
    the soul, as from their principle; because it has already been said that the
    accident is caused by the subject according as it is actual, and is received
    into it according as it is in potentiality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> From one simple thing many things may
    proceed naturally, in a certain order; or again if there be diversity of
    recipients. Thus, from the one essence of the soul many and various powers
    proceed; both because order exists among these powers; and also by reason of
    the diversity of the corporeal organs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The subject is both the final cause, and
    in a way the active cause, of its proper accident. It is also as it were the
    material cause, inasmuch as it is receptive of the accident. From this we
    may gather that the essence of the soul is the cause of all its powers, as
    their end, and as their active principle; and of some as receptive
    thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The emanation of proper accidents from
    their subject is not by way of transmutation, but by a certain natural
    resultance; thus one thing results naturally from another, as color from
    light.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether one power of the soul arises from another?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one power of the soul does not
    arise from another. For if several things arise together, one of them does
    not arise from another. But all the powers of the soul are created at the
    same time with the soul. Therefore one of them does not arise from
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the power of the soul arises from the
    soul as an accident from the subject. But one power of the soul cannot be
    the subject of another; because nothing is the accident of an accident.
    Therefore one power does not arise from another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one opposite does not arise from the
    other opposite; but everything arises from that which is like it in species.
    Now the powers of the soul are oppositely divided, as various species.
    Therefore one of them does not proceed from another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Powers are known by their actions. But the
    action of one power is caused by the action of another power, as the action
    of the imagination by the action of the senses. Therefore one power of the
    soul is caused by another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In those things which proceed from one
    according to a natural order, as the first is the cause of all, so that
    which is nearer to the first is, in a way, the cause of those which are more
    remote. Now it has been shown above (<a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >) that among the powers of the soul there are several kinds of order.
    Therefore one power of the soul proceeds from the essence of the soul by the
    medium of another. But since the essence of the soul is compared to the
    powers both as a principle active and final, and as a receptive principle,
    either separately by itself, or together with the body; and since the agent
    and the end are more perfect, while the receptive principle, as such, is
    less perfect; it follows that those powers of the soul which precede the
    others, in the order of perfection and nature, are the principles of the
    others, after the manner of the end and active principle. For we see that
    the senses are for the sake of the intelligence, and not the other way
    about. The senses, moreover, are a certain imperfect participation of the
    intelligence; wherefore, according to their natural origin, they proceed
    from the intelligence as the imperfect from the perfect. But considered as
    receptive principles, the more perfect powers are principles with regard to
    the others; thus the soul, according as it has the sensitive power, is
    considered as the subject, and as something material with regard to the
    intelligence. On this account, the more imperfect powers precede the others
    in the order of generation, for the animal is generated before the man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the power of the soul flows from the
    essence, not by a transmutation, but by a certain natural resultance, and is
    simultaneous with the soul, so is it the case with one power as regards
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An accident cannot of itself be the
    subject of an accident; but one accident is received prior to another into
    substance, as quantity prior to quality. In this sense one accident is said
    to be the subject of another; as surface is of color, inasmuch as substance
    receives an accident through the means of another. The same thing may be
    said of the powers of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The powers of the soul are opposed to
    one another, as perfect and imperfect; as also are the species of numbers
    and figures. But this opposition does not prevent the origin of one from
    another, because imperfect things naturally proceed from perfect things.<br />

    Whether all the powers remain in the soul when separated from the body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the powers of the soul
    remain in the soul separated from the body. For we read in the book De
    Spiritu et Anima that "the soul withdraws from the body, taking with itself
    sense and imagination, reason and intelligence, concupiscibility and
    irascibility."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the powers of the soul are its natural
    properties. But properties are always in that to which they belong; and are
    never separated from it. Therefore the powers of the soul are in it even
    after death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the powers even of the sensitive soul
    are not weakened when the body becomes weak; because, as the Philosopher
    says (De Anima i, 4), "If an old man were given the eye of a young man, he
    would see even as well as a young man." But weakness is the road to
    corruption. Therefore the powers of the soul are not corrupted when the body
    is corrupted, but remain in the separated soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, memory is a power of the sensitive soul,
    as the Philosopher proves (De Memor. et Remin. 1). But memory remains in the
    separated soul; for it was said to the rich glutton whose soul was in hell:
    "Remember that thou didst receive good things during thy lifetime" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A25"
      >Lk. 16:25</a
    >). Therefore memory remains in the separated soul; and consequently the
    other powers of the sensitive part.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, joy and sorrow are in the concupiscible
    part, which is a power of the sensitive soul. But it is clear that separate
    souls grieve or rejoice at the pains or rewards which they receive.
    Therefore the concupiscible power remains in the separate soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32)
    that, as the soul, when the body lies senseless, yet not quite dead, sees
    some things by imaginary vision; so also when by death the soul is quite
    separate from the body. But the imagination is a power of the sensitive
    part. Therefore the power of the sensitive part remains in the separate
    soul; and consequently all the other powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (De Eccl. Dogm. xix) that "of two
    substances only does man consist; the soul with its reason, and the body
    with its senses." Therefore the body being dead, the sensitive powers do not
    remain.<br />
  </p>

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have said already (<a
      href="FP077.html#FPQ77ATHEP1"
      >Articles [5]</a
    >,6,7), all the powers of the soul belong to the soul alone as their
    principle. But some powers belong to the soul alone as their subject; as the
    intelligence and the will. These powers must remain in the soul, after the
    destruction of the body. But other powers are subjected in the composite; as
    all the powers of the sensitive and nutritive parts. Now accidents cannot
    remain after the destruction of the subject. Wherefore, the composite being
    destroyed, such powers do not remain actually; but they remain virtually in
    the soul, as in their principle or root.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    So it is false that, as some say, these powers remain in the soul even after
    the corruption of the body. It is much more false that, as they say also,
    the acts of these powers remain in the separate soul; because these powers
    have no act apart from the corporeal organ.<br />
  </p>

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That book has no authority, and so what
    is there written can be despised with the same facility as it was said;
    although we may say that the soul takes with itself these powers, not
    actually but virtually.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These powers, which we say do not
    actually remain in the separate soul, are not the properties of the soul
    alone, but of the composite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These powers are said not to be weakened
    when the body becomes weak, because the soul remains unchangeable, and is
    the virtual principle of these powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The recollection spoken of there is to
    be taken in the same way as Augustine (De Trin. x, 11; xiv, 7) places memory
    in the mind; not as a part of the sensitive soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> In the separate soul, sorrow and joy are
    not in the sensitive, but in the intellectual appetite, as in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Augustine in that passage is speaking as
    inquiring, not as asserting. Wherefore he retracted some things which he had
    said there (Retrac. ii, 24).<br />
