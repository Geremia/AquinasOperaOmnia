    OF THE WORK OF ADORNMENT, AS REGARDS THE FOURTH DAY (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the work of adornment, first as to each day by itself,
    secondly as to all seven days in general.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first place, then, we consider the work of the fourth day, secondly,
    that of the fifth day, thirdly, that of the sixth day, and fourthly, such
    matters as belong to the seventh day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP070.html#FPQ70A1THEP1">(1)</a> As to the production of the
    lights;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP070.html#FPQ70A2THEP1">(2)</a> As to the end of their production;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP070.html#FPQ70A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they are living beings?

    Whether the lights ought to have been produced on the fourth day?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the lights ought not to have
    been produced on the fourth day. For the heavenly luminaries are by nature
    incorruptible bodies: wherefore their matter cannot exist without their
    form. But as their matter was produced in the work of creation, before there
    was any day, so therefore were their forms. It follows, then, that the
    lights were not produced on the fourth day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the luminaries are, as it were, vessels
    of light. But light was made on the first day. The luminaries, therefore,
    should have been made on the first day, not on the fourth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the lights are fixed in the firmament,
    as plants are fixed in the earth. For, the Scripture says: "He set them in
    the firmament." But plants are described as produced when the earth, to
    which they are attached, received its form. The lights, therefore, should
    have been produced at the same time as the firmament, that is to say, on the
    second day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, plants are an effect of the sun, moon,
    and other heavenly bodies. Now, cause precedes effect in the order of
    nature. The lights, therefore, ought not to have been produced on the fourth
    day, but on the third day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as astronomers say, there are many stars
    larger than the moon. Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly
    described as the "two great lights."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Suffices the authority of Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In recapitulating the Divine works, Scripture
    says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A1">Gn. 2:1</a
    >): "So the heavens and the earth were finished and all the furniture of
    them," thereby indicating that the work was threefold. In the first work,
    that of "creation," the heaven and the earth were produced, but as yet
    without form. In the second, or work of "distinction," the heaven and the
    earth were perfected, either by adding substantial form to formless matter,
    as Augustine holds (Gen. ad lit. ii, 11), or by giving them the order and
    beauty due to them, as other holy writers suppose. To these two works is
    added the work of adornment, which is distinct from perfect. For the
    perfection of the heaven and the earth regards, seemingly, those things that
    belong to them intrinsically, but the adornment, those that are extrinsic,
    just as the perfection of a man lies in his proper parts and forms, and his
    adornment, in clothing or such like. Now just as distinction of certain
    things is made most evident by their local movement, as separating one from
    another; so the work of adornment is set forth by the production of things
    having movement in the heavens, and upon the earth. But it has been stated
    above (<a href="FP069.html#FPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>,
    <a href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that three things are
    recorded as created, namely, the heaven, the water, and the earth; and these
    three received their form from the three days' work of distinction, so that
    heaven was formed on the first day; on the second day the waters were
    separated; and on the third day, the earth was divided into sea and dry
    land. So also is it in the work of adornment; on the first day of this work,
    which is the fourth of creation, are produced the lights, to adorn the
    heaven by their movements; on the second day, which is the fifth, birds and
    fishes are called into being, to make beautiful the intermediate element,
    for they move in air and water, which are here taken as one; while on the
    third day, which is the sixth, animals are brought forth, to move upon the
    earth and adorn it. It must also here be noted that Augustine's opinion
    (Gen. ad lit. v, 5) on the production of lights is not at variance with that
    of other holy writers, since he says that they were made actually, and not
    merely virtually, for the firmament has not the power of producing lights,
    as the earth has of producing plants. Wherefore Scripture does not say: "Let
    the firmament produce lights," though it says: "Let the earth bring forth
    the green herb."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In Augustine's opinion there is no
    difficulty here; for he does not hold a succession of time in these works,
    and so there was no need for the matter of the lights to exist under another
    form. Nor is there any difficulty in the opinion of those who hold the
    heavenly bodies to be of the nature of the four elements, for it may be said
    that they were formed out of matter already existing, as animals and plants
    were formed. For those, however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of
    another nature from the elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer
    must be that the lights were substantially created at the beginning, but
    that their substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving
    not its substantial form, but a determination of power. As to the fact that
    the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning, but only as
    made on the fourth day, Chrysostom (Hom. vi in Gen.) explains this by the
    need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry: since the lights
    are proved not to be gods, by the fact that they were not from the
    beginning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No difficulty exists if we follow
    Augustine in holding the light made on the first day to be spiritual, and
    that made on this day to be corporeal. If, however, the light made on the
    first day is understood to be itself corporeal, then it must be held to have
    been produced on that day merely as light in general; and that on the fourth
    day the lights received a definite power to produce determinate effects.
    Thus we observe that the rays of the sun have one effect, those of the moon
    another, and so forth. Hence, speaking of such a determination of power,
    Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) says that the sun's light which previously was
    without form, was formed on the fourth day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Ptolemy the heavenly
    luminaries are not fixed in the spheres, but have their own movement
    distinct from the movement of the spheres. Wherefore Chrysostom says (Hom.
    vi in Gen.) that He is said to have set them in the firmament, not because
    He fixed them there immovably, but because He bade them to be there, even as
    He placed man in Paradise, to be there. In the opinion of Aristotle,
    however, the stars are fixed in their orbits, and in reality have no other
    movement but that of the spheres; and yet our senses perceive the movement
    of the luminaries and not that of the spheres (De Coel. ii, text. 43). But
    Moses describes what is obvious to sense, out of condescension to popular
    ignorance, as we have already said (<a href="FP067.html#FPQ67OUTP1"
      >Question [67]</a
    >, <a href="FP067.html#FPQ67A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FP068.html#FPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="FP068.html#FPQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). The objection, however,
    falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made on the second day as
    having a natural distinction from that in which the stars are placed, even
    though the distinction is not apparent to the senses, the testimony of which
    Moses follows, as stated above (De Coel. ii, text. 43). For although to the
    senses there appears but one firmament; if we admit a higher and a lower
    firmament, the lower will be that which was made on the second day, and on
    the fourth the stars were fixed in the higher firmament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the words of Basil (Hom. v in
    Hexaem.), plants were recorded as produced before the sun and moon, to
    prevent idolatry, since those who believe the heavenly bodies to be gods,
    hold that plants originate primarily from these bodies. Although as
    Chrysostom remarks (Hom. vi in Gen.), the sun, moon, and stars cooperate in
    the work of production by their movements, as the husbandman cooperates by
    his labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As Chrysostom says, the two lights are
    called great, not so much with regard to their dimensions as to their
    influence and power. For though the stars be of greater bulk than the moon,
    yet the influence of the moon is more perceptible to the senses in this
    lower world. Moreover, as far as the senses are concerned, its apparent size
    is greater.<br />

    Whether the cause assigned for the production of the lights is
    reasonable?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the cause assigned for the
    production of the lights is not reasonable. For it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++10%3A2"
      >Jer. 10:2</a
    >): "Be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear."
    Therefore the heavenly lights were not made to be signs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sign is contradistinguished from cause.
    But the lights are the cause of what takes place upon the earth. Therefore
    they are not signs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the distinction of seasons and days
    began from the first day. Therefore the lights were not made "for seasons,
    and days, and years," that is, in order to distinguish them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, nothing is made for the sake of that
    which is inferior to itself, "since the end is better than the means"
    (Topic. iii). But the lights are nobler than the earth. Therefore they were
    not made "to enlighten it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the new moon cannot be said "to rule the
    night." But such it probably did when first made; for men begin to count
    from the new moon. The moon, therefore, was not made "to rule the night."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Suffices the authority of Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have said above (<a
      href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a corporeal creature
    can be considered as made either for the sake of its proper act, or for
    other creatures, or for the whole universe, or for the glory of God. Of
    these reasons only that which points out the usefulness of these things to
    man, is touched upon by Moses, in order to withdraw his people from
    idolatry. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A19"
      >Dt. 4:19</a
    >): "Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the
    moon and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and
    serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all nations."
    Now, he explains this service at the beginning of Genesis as threefold.
    First, the lights are of service to man, in regard to sight, which directs
    him in his works, and is most useful for perceiving objects. In reference to
    this he says: "Let them shine in the firmament and give life to the earth."
    Secondly, as regards the changes of the seasons, which prevent weariness,
    preserve health, and provide for the necessities of food; all of which
    things could not be secured if it were always summer or winter. In reference
    to this he says: "Let them be for seasons, and for days, and years."
    Thirdly, as regards the convenience of business and work, in so far as the
    lights are set in the heavens to indicate fair or foul weather, as favorable
    to various occupations. And in this respect he says: "Let them be for
    signs."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The lights in the heaven are set for
    signs of changes effected in corporeal creatures, but not of those changes
    which depend upon the free-will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We are sometimes brought to the
    knowledge of hidden effects through their sensible causes, and conversely.
    Hence nothing prevents a sensible cause from being a sign. But he says
    "signs," rather than "causes," to guard against idolatry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The general division of time into day
    and night took place on the first day, as regards the diurnal movement,
    which is common to the whole heaven and may be understood to have begun on
    that first day. But the particular distinctions of days and seasons and
    years, according as one day is hotter than another, one season than another,
    and one year than another, are due to certain particular movements of the
    stars: which movements may have had their beginning on the fourth day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Light was given to the earth for the
    service of man, who, by reason of his soul, is nobler than the heavenly
    bodies. Nor is it untrue to say that a higher creature may be made for the
    sake of a lower, considered not in itself, but as ordained to the good of
    the universe.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> When the moon is at its perfection it
    rises in the evening and sets in the morning, and thus it rules the night,
    and it was probably made in its full perfection as were plants yielding
    seed, as also were animals and man himself. For although the perfect is
    developed from the imperfect by natural processes, yet the perfect must
    exist simply before the imperfect. Augustine, however (Gen. ad lit. ii),
    does not say this, for he says that it is not unfitting that God made things
    imperfect, which He afterwards perfected.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the lights of heaven are living beings?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the lights of heaven are
    living beings. For the nobler a body is, the more nobly it should be
    adorned. But a body less noble than the heaven, is adorned with living
    beings, with fish, birds, and the beasts of the field. Therefore the lights
    of heaven, as pertaining to its adornment, should be living beings also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the nobler a body is, the nobler must be
    its form. But the sun, moon, and stars are nobler bodies than plants or
    animals, and must therefore have nobler forms. Now the noblest of all forms
    is the soul, as being the first principle of life. Hence Augustine (De Vera
    Relig. xxix) says: "Every living substance stands higher in the order of
    nature than one that has not life." The lights of heaven, therefore, are
    living beings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a cause is nobler than its effect. But
    the sun, moon, and stars are a cause of life, as is especially evidenced in
    the case of animals generated from putrefaction, which receive life from the
    power of the sun and stars. Much more, therefore, have the heavenly bodies a
    living soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the movement of the heaven and the
    heavenly bodies are natural (De Coel. i, text. 7,8): and natural movement is
    from an intrinsic principle. Now the principle of movement in the heavenly
    bodies is a substance capable of apprehension, and is moved as the desirer
    is moved by the object desired (Metaph. xii, text. 36). Therefore,
    seemingly, the apprehending principle is intrinsic to the heavenly bodies:
    and consequently they are living beings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the first of movables is the heaven.
    Now, of all things that are endowed with movement the first moves itself, as
    is proved in Phys. viii, text. 34, because, what is such of itself precedes
    that which is by another. But only beings that are living move themselves,
    as is shown in the same book (text. 27). Therefore the heavenly bodies are
    living beings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii), "Let no
    one esteem the heavens or the heavenly bodies to be living things, for they
    have neither life nor sense."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Philosophers have differed on this question.
    Anaxagoras, for instance, as Augustine mentions (De Civ. Dei xviii, 41),
    "was condemned by the Athenians for teaching that the sun was a fiery mass
    of stone, and neither a god nor even a living being." On the other hand, the
    Platonists held that the heavenly bodies have life. Nor was there less
    diversity of opinion among the Doctors of the Church. It was the belief of
    Origen (Peri Archon i) and Jerome that these bodies were alive, and the
    latter seems to explain in that sense the words (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A6"
      >Eccles. 1:6</a
    >), "The spirit goeth forward, surveying all places round about." But Basil
    (Hom. iii, vi in Hexaem.) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii) maintain that the
    heavenly bodies are inanimate. Augustine leaves the matter in doubt, without
    committing himself to either theory, though he goes so far as to say that if
    the heavenly bodies are really living beings, their souls must be akin to
    the angelic nature (Gen. ad lit. ii, 18; Enchiridion lviii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of opinion
    exists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body
    exists for the sake of the soul and not of the body; for the form does not
    exist for the matter, but the matter for the form. Now the nature and power
    of the soul are apprehended through its operation, which is to a certain
    extent its end. Yet for some of these operations, as sensation and
    nutrition, our body is a necessary instrument. Hence it is clear that the
    sensitive and nutritive souls must be united to a body in order to exercise
    their functions. There are, however, operations of the soul, which are not
    exercised through the medium of the body, though the body ministers, as it
    were, to their production. The intellect, for example, makes use of the
    phantasms derived from the bodily senses, and thus far is dependent on the
    body, although capable of existing apart from it. It is not, however,
    possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and generation, through
    which the nutritive soul operates, can be exercised by the heavenly bodies,
    for such operations are incompatible with a body naturally incorruptible.
    Equally impossible is it that the functions of the sensitive soul can
    appertain to the heavenly body, since all the senses depend on the sense of
    touch, which perceives elemental qualities, and all the organs of the senses
    require a certain proportion in the admixture of elements, whereas the
    nature of the heavenly bodies is not elemental. It follows, then, that of
    the operations of the soul the only ones left to be attributed to the
    heavenly bodies are those of understanding and moving; for appetite follows
    both sensitive and intellectual perception, and is in proportion thereto.
    But the operations of the intellect, which does not act through the body, do
    not need a body as their instrument, except to supply phantasms through the
    senses. Moreover, the operations of the sensitive soul, as we have seen,
    cannot be attributed to the heavenly bodies. Accordingly, the union of a
    soul to a heavenly body cannot be for the purpose of the operations of the
    intellect. It remains, then, only to consider whether the movement of the
    heavenly bodies demands a soul as the motive power, not that the soul, in
    order to move the heavenly body, need be united to the latter as its form;
    but by contact of power, as a mover is united to that which he moves.
    Wherefore Aristotle (Phys. viii, text. 42,43), after showing that the first
    mover is made up of two parts, the moving and the moved, goes on to show the
    nature of the union between these two parts. This, he says, is effected by
    contact which is mutual if both are bodies; on the part of one only, if one
    is a body and the other not. The Platonists explain the union of soul and
    body in the same way, as a contact of a moving power with the object moved,
    and since Plato holds the heavenly bodies to be living beings, this means
    nothing else but that substances of spiritual nature are united to them, and
    act as their moving power. A proof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the
    direct influence and contact of some spiritual substance, and not, like
    bodies of specific gravity, by nature, lies in the fact that whereas nature
    moves to one fixed end which having attained, it rests; this does not appear
    in the movement of heavenly bodies. Hence it follows that they are moved by
    some intellectual substances. Augustine appears to be of the same opinion
    when he expresses his belief that all corporeal things are ruled by God
    through the spirit of life (De Trin. iii, 4).<br />

    From what has been said, then, it is clear that the heavenly bodies are not
    living beings in the same sense as plants and animals, and that if they are
    called so, it can only be equivocally. It will also be seen that the
    difference of opinion between those who affirm, and those who deny, that
    these bodies have life, is not a difference of things but of words.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Certain things belong to the adornment
    of the universe by reason of their proper movement; and in this way the
    heavenly luminaries agree with others that conduce to that adornment, for
    they are moved by a living substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One being may be nobler than another
    absolutely, but not in a particular respect. While, then, it is not conceded
    that the souls of heavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals
    absolutely it must be conceded that they are superior to them with regard to
    their respective forms, since their form perfects their matter entirely,
    which is not in potentiality to other forms; whereas a soul does not do
    this. Also as regards movement the power that moves the heavenly bodies is
    of a nobler kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the heavenly body is a mover
    moved, it is of the nature of an instrument, which acts in virtue of the
    agent: and therefore since this agent is a living substance the heavenly
    body can impart life in virtue of that agent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The movements of the heavenly bodies are
    natural, not on account of their active principle, but on account of their
    passive principle; that is to say, from a certain natural aptitude for being
    moved by an intelligent power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The heaven is said to move itself in as
    far as it is compounded of mover and moved; not by the union of the mover,
    as the form, with the moved, as the matter, but by contact with the motive
    power, as we have said. So far, then, the principle that moves it may be
    called intrinsic, and consequently its movement natural with respect to that
    active principle; just as we say that voluntary movement is natural to the
    animal as animal (Phys. viii, text. 27).<br />
