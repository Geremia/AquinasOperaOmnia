<H3 Align="Left">Whether the lights ought to have been produced on the fourth day?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the lights ought not to have been produced on 
the fourth day. For the heavenly luminaries are by nature incorruptible 
bodies: wherefore their matter cannot exist without their form. But as 
their matter was produced in the work of creation, before there was any 
day, so therefore were their forms. It follows, then, that the lights 
were not produced on the fourth day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the luminaries are, as it were, vessels of light. But 
light was made on the first day. The luminaries, therefore, should have 
been made on the first day, not on the fourth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the lights are fixed in the firmament, as plants are 
fixed in the earth. For, the Scripture says: "He set them in the 
firmament." But plants are described as produced when the earth, to which 
they are attached, received its form. The  lights, therefore, should have 
been produced at the same time as the firmament, that is to say, on the 
second day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, plants are an effect of the sun, moon, and other 
heavenly bodies. Now, cause precedes effect in the order of nature. The 
lights, therefore, ought not to have been produced on the fourth day, but 
on the third day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as astronomers say, there are many stars larger than the 
moon. Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly described as 
the "two great lights."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Suffices the authority of Scripture.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In recapitulating the Divine works, Scripture says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2:1">Gn. 2:1</a>): "So the heavens and the earth were finished and all the furniture 
of them," thereby indicating that the work was threefold. In the first 
work, that of "creation," the heaven and the earth were produced, but as 
yet without form. In the second, or work of "distinction," the heaven and 
the earth were perfected, either by adding substantial form to formless 
matter, as Augustine holds (Gen. ad lit. ii, 11), or by giving them the 
order and beauty due to them, as other holy writers suppose. To these two 
works is added the work of adornment, which is distinct from perfect. For 
the perfection of the heaven and the earth regards, seemingly, those 
things that belong to them intrinsically, but the adornment, those that 
are extrinsic, just as the perfection of a man lies in his proper parts 
and forms, and his adornment, in clothing or such like. Now just as 
distinction of certain things is made most evident by their local 
movement, as separating one from another; so the work of adornment is set 
forth by the production of things having movement in the heavens, and 
upon the earth. But it has been stated above (<A Href="FP069.html#FPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that three 
things are recorded as created, namely, the heaven, the water, and the 
earth; and these three received their form from the three days' work of 
distinction, so that heaven was formed on the first day; on the second 
day the waters were separated; and on the third day, the earth was 
divided into sea and dry land. So also is it in the work of adornment; on 
the first day of this work, which is the fourth of creation, are produced 
the lights, to adorn the heaven by their movements; on the second day, 
which is the fifth, birds and fishes are called into being, to make 
beautiful the intermediate element, for they move in air and water, which 
are here taken as one; while on the third day, which is the sixth, 
animals are brought forth, to move upon the earth and adorn it. It must 
also here be noted that Augustine's opinion (Gen. ad lit. v, 5) on the 
production of lights is not at variance with that of other holy writers, 
since he says that they were made actually, and not merely virtually, for 
the firmament has not the power of producing lights, as the earth has of 
producing plants. Wherefore Scripture does not say: "Let the firmament 
produce lights," though it says: "Let the earth bring forth the green 
herb."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In Augustine's opinion there is no difficulty  here; for he 
does not hold a succession of time in these works, and so there was no 
need for the matter of the lights to exist under another form. Nor is 
there any difficulty in the opinion of those who hold the heavenly bodies 
to be of the nature of the four elements, for it may be said that they 
were formed out of matter already existing, as animals and plants were 
formed. For those, however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another 
nature from the elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer must be 
that the lights were substantially created at the beginning, but that 
their substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving 
not its substantial form, but a determination of power. As to the fact 
that the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning, but 
only as made on the fourth day, Chrysostom (Hom. vi in Gen.) explains 
this by the need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry: 
since the lights are proved not to be gods, by the fact that they were 
not from the beginning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No difficulty exists if we follow Augustine in holding the 
light made on the first day to be spiritual, and that made on this day to 
be corporeal. If, however, the light made on the first day is understood 
to be itself corporeal, then it must be held to have been produced on 
that day merely as light in general; and that on the fourth day the 
lights received a definite power to produce determinate effects. Thus we 
observe that the rays of the sun have one effect, those of the moon 
another, and so forth. Hence, speaking of such a determination of power, 
Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) says that the sun's light which previously was 
without form, was formed on the fourth day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Ptolemy the heavenly luminaries are not fixed 
in the spheres, but have their own movement distinct from the movement of 
the spheres. Wherefore Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Gen.) that He is said 
to have set them in the firmament, not because He fixed them there 
immovably, but because He bade them to be there, even as He placed man in 
Paradise, to be there. In the opinion of Aristotle, however, the stars 
are fixed in their orbits, and in reality have no other movement but that 
of the spheres; and yet our senses perceive the movement of the 
luminaries and not that of the spheres (De Coel. ii, text. 43). But Moses 
describes what is obvious to sense, out of condescension to popular 
ignorance, as we have already said (<A Href="FP067.html#FPQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>, <A Href="FP067.html#FPQ67A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FP068.html#FPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FP068.html#FPQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). The 
objection, however, falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made 
on the second day as having a natural distinction from that in which the 
stars are placed, even though the distinction is not apparent to the 
senses, the testimony of which Moses follows, as stated above (De Coel. 
ii, text. 43). For although to the senses there appears but one 
firmament; if we admit a higher and a lower firmament, the lower will be 
that which was made on the second day, and on the fourth the stars were 
fixed in the higher firmament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the words of Basil (Hom. v in Hexaem.), plants were 
recorded as produced before the sun and moon, to prevent idolatry, since 
those who believe the heavenly bodies to be gods, hold that plants 
originate primarily from these bodies. Although as  Chrysostom remarks 
(Hom. vi in Gen.), the sun, moon, and stars cooperate in the work of 
production by their movements, as the husbandman cooperates by his labor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As Chrysostom says, the two lights are called great, not so 
much with regard to their dimensions as to their influence and power. For 
though the stars be of greater bulk than the moon, yet the influence of 
the moon is more perceptible to the senses in this lower world. Moreover, 
as far as the senses are concerned, its apparent size is greater.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the cause assigned for the production of the 
lights is not reasonable. For it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++10:2">Jer. 10:2</a>): "Be not afraid of 
the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear." Therefore the heavenly 
lights were not made to be signs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sign is contradistinguished from cause. But the lights 
are the cause of what takes place upon the earth. Therefore they are not 
signs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the distinction of seasons and days began from the first 
day. Therefore the lights were not made "for seasons, and days, and 
years," that is, in order to distinguish them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, nothing is made for the sake of that which is inferior 
to itself, "since the end is better than the means" (Topic. iii). But the 
lights are nobler than the earth. Therefore they were not made "to 
enlighten it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the new moon cannot be said "to rule the night." But 
such it probably did when first made; for men begin to count from the new 
moon. The moon, therefore, was not made "to rule the night."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Suffices the authority of Scripture.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As we have said above (<A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a corporeal creature 
can be considered as made either for the sake of its proper act, or for 
other creatures, or for the whole universe, or for the glory of God. Of 
these reasons only that which points out the usefulness of these things 
to man, is touched upon by Moses, in order to withdraw his people from 
idolatry. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++4:19">Dt. 4:19</a>): "Lest perhaps lifting up thy 
eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon and all the stars of 
heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the 
Lord thy God created for the service of all nations." Now, he explains 
this service at the beginning of Genesis as threefold. First, the lights 
are of service to man, in regard to sight, which directs him in his 
works, and is most useful for perceiving objects. In reference to this he 
says: "Let them shine in the firmament and give life to the  earth." 
Secondly, as regards the changes of the seasons, which prevent weariness, 
preserve health, and provide for the necessities of food; all of which 
things could not be secured if it were always summer or winter. In 
reference to this he says: "Let them be for seasons, and for days, and 
years." Thirdly, as regards the convenience of business and work, in so 
far as the lights are set in the heavens to indicate fair or foul 
weather, as favorable to various occupations. And in this respect he 
says: "Let them be for signs."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The lights in the heaven are set for signs of changes 
effected in corporeal creatures, but not of those changes which depend 
upon the free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We are sometimes brought to the knowledge of hidden effects 
through their sensible causes, and conversely. Hence nothing prevents a 
sensible cause from being a sign. But he says "signs," rather than 
"causes," to guard against idolatry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The general division of time into day and night took place 
on the first day, as regards the diurnal movement, which is common to the 
whole heaven and may be understood to have begun on that first day. But 
the particular distinctions of days and seasons and years, according as 
one day is hotter than another, one season than another, and one year 
than another, are due to certain particular movements of the stars: which 
movements may have had their beginning on the fourth day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Light was given to the earth for the service of man, who, 
by reason of his soul, is nobler than the heavenly bodies. Nor is it 
untrue to say that a higher creature may be made for the sake of a lower, 
considered not in itself, but as ordained to the good of the universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> When the moon is at its perfection it rises in the evening 
and sets in the morning, and thus it rules the night, and it was probably 
made in its full perfection as were plants yielding seed, as also were 
animals and man himself. For although the perfect is developed from the 
imperfect by natural processes, yet the perfect must exist simply before 
the imperfect. Augustine, however (Gen. ad lit. ii), does not say this, 
for he says that it is not unfitting that God made things imperfect, 
which He afterwards perfected.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the lights of heaven are living beings?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the lights of heaven are living beings. For 
the nobler a body is, the more nobly it should be adorned. But a body 
less noble than the heaven, is adorned with living beings, with fish, 
birds, and the beasts of the field. Therefore the lights of heaven, as 
pertaining to its adornment, should be living beings also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the nobler a body is, the nobler must be its form. But 
the sun, moon, and stars are nobler bodies than plants or animals, and 
must therefore have nobler forms. Now the noblest of all forms is the 
soul, as being the first principle of life. Hence Augustine (De Vera 
Relig. xxix) says: "Every living substance stands higher in the order of 
nature than one that has not life." The lights of heaven, therefore, are 
living beings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a cause is nobler than its effect. But the sun, moon, 
and stars are a cause of life, as is especially evidenced in the case of 
animals generated from putrefaction, which receive life from the power of 
the sun and stars. Much more, therefore, have the heavenly bodies a 
living soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the movement of the heaven and the heavenly bodies are 
natural (De Coel. i, text. 7,8): and natural movement is from an 
intrinsic principle. Now the principle of movement in the heavenly bodies 
is a substance capable of apprehension, and is moved as the desirer is 
moved by the object desired (Metaph. xii, text. 36). Therefore, 
seemingly, the apprehending principle is intrinsic to the heavenly 
bodies: and consequently they are living beings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the first of movables is the heaven. Now, of all things 
that are endowed with movement the first moves itself, as is proved in 
Phys. viii, text. 34, because, what is such of itself precedes that which 
is by another. But only beings that are living move themselves, as is 
shown in the same book (text. 27). Therefore the heavenly bodies are 
living beings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii), "Let no one esteem 
the heavens or the heavenly bodies to be living things, for they have 
neither life nor sense."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Philosophers have differed on this question. Anaxagoras, 
for instance, as Augustine mentions (De Civ. Dei xviii, 41), "was 
condemned by the Athenians for teaching that the sun was a fiery mass of 
stone, and neither a god nor even a living being." On the other hand, the 
Platonists held that the heavenly bodies have life. Nor was there less 
diversity of opinion among the Doctors of the Church. It was the belief 
of Origen (Peri Archon i) and Jerome that these bodies were alive, and 
the latter seems to explain in that sense the words (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++1:6">Eccles. 1:6</a>), "The 
spirit goeth forward, surveying all places round about." But Basil (Hom. 
iii, vi in Hexaem.) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii) maintain that the 
heavenly bodies are inanimate. Augustine leaves the matter in doubt, 
without committing himself to either theory, though he goes so far as to 
say that if the heavenly bodies are really living beings, their souls 
must be akin to the angelic nature (Gen. ad lit. ii, 18; Enchiridion 
lviii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of opinion 
exists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body 
exists for the sake of the soul and not of the  body; for the form does 
not exist for the matter, but the matter for the form. Now the nature and 
power of the soul are apprehended through its operation, which is to a 
certain extent its end. Yet for some of these operations, as sensation 
and nutrition, our body is a necessary instrument. Hence it is clear that 
the sensitive and nutritive souls must be united to a body in order to 
exercise their functions. There are, however, operations of the soul, 
which are not exercised through the medium of the body, though the body 
ministers, as it were, to their production. The intellect, for example, 
makes use of the phantasms derived from the bodily senses, and thus far 
is dependent on the body, although capable of existing apart from it. It 
is not, however, possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and 
generation, through which the nutritive soul operates, can be exercised 
by the heavenly bodies, for such operations are incompatible with a body 
naturally incorruptible. Equally impossible is it that the functions of 
the sensitive soul can appertain to the heavenly body, since all the 
senses depend on the sense of touch, which perceives elemental qualities, 
and all the organs of the senses require a certain proportion in the 
admixture of elements, whereas the nature of the heavenly bodies is not 
elemental. It follows, then, that of the operations of the soul the only 
ones left to be attributed to the heavenly bodies are those of 
understanding and moving; for appetite follows both sensitive and 
intellectual perception, and is in proportion thereto. But the operations 
of the intellect, which does not act through the body, do not need a body 
as their instrument, except to supply phantasms through the senses. 
Moreover, the operations of the sensitive soul, as we have seen, cannot 
be attributed to the heavenly bodies. Accordingly, the union of a soul to 
a heavenly body cannot be for the purpose of the operations of the 
intellect. It remains, then, only to consider whether the movement of the 
heavenly bodies demands a soul as the motive power, not that the soul, in 
order to move the heavenly body, need be united to the latter as its 
form; but by contact of power, as a mover is united to that which he 
moves. Wherefore Aristotle (Phys. viii, text. 42,43), after showing that 
the first mover is made up of two parts, the moving and the moved, goes 
on to show the nature of the union between these two parts. This, he 
says, is effected by contact which is mutual if both are bodies; on the 
part of one only, if one is a body and the other not. The Platonists 
explain the union of soul and body in the same way, as a contact of a 
moving power with the object moved, and since Plato holds the heavenly 
bodies to be living beings, this means nothing else but that substances 
of spiritual nature are united to them, and act as their moving power. A 
proof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the direct influence and 
contact of some spiritual substance, and not, like bodies of specific 
gravity, by nature, lies in the fact that whereas nature moves to one 
fixed end which having attained, it rests; this does not appear in the 
movement of heavenly bodies. Hence it follows that they are moved by some 
intellectual substances. Augustine appears to be of the same opinion when 
he expresses his belief that all corporeal things are ruled by God 
through the spirit of life (De Trin. iii, 4).<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From what has been said, then, it is clear that the heavenly bodies are 
not living beings in the same sense as plants and animals, and that if 
they are called so, it can only be equivocally. It will also be seen that 
the difference of opinion between those who affirm, and those who deny, 
that these bodies have life, is not a difference of things but of words.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Certain things belong to the adornment of the universe by 
reason of their proper movement; and in this way the heavenly luminaries 
agree with others that conduce to that adornment, for they are moved by a 
living substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One being may be nobler than another absolutely, but not in 
a particular respect. While, then, it is not conceded that the souls of 
heavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals absolutely it must 
be conceded that they are superior to them with regard to their 
respective forms, since their form perfects their matter entirely, which 
is not in potentiality to other forms; whereas a soul does not do this. 
Also as regards movement the power that moves the heavenly bodies is of a 
nobler kind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the heavenly body is a mover moved, it is of the 
nature of an instrument, which acts in virtue of the agent: and therefore 
since this agent is a living substance the heavenly body can impart life 
in virtue of that agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The movements of the heavenly bodies are natural, not on 
account of their active principle, but on account of their passive 
principle; that is to say, from a certain natural aptitude for being 
moved by an intelligent power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[70] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The heaven is said to move itself in as far as it is 
compounded of mover and moved; not by the union of the mover, as the 
form, with the moved, as the matter, but by contact with the motive 
power, as we have said. So far, then, the principle that moves it may be 
called intrinsic, and consequently its movement natural with respect to 
that active principle; just as we say that voluntary movement is natural 
to the animal as animal (Phys. viii, text. 27).<br>
