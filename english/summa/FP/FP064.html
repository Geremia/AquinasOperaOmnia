<H3 Align="Left">Whether the demons' intellect is darkened by privation of the knowledge of all truth?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the demons' intellect is darkened by being 
deprived of the knowledge of all truth. For it they knew any truth at 
all, they would most of all know themselves; which is to know separated 
substances. But this is not in keeping with their unhappiness: for this 
seems to belong to great happiness, insomuch as that some writers have 
assigned as man's last happiness the knowledge of the separated 
substances. Therefore the demons are deprived of all knowledge of truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is most manifest in its nature, seems to be 
specially manifest to the angels, whether good or bad. That the same is 
not manifest with regard to ourselves, comes from the weakness of our 
intellect which draws its knowledge from phantasms; as it comes from the 
weakness of its eye that the owl cannot behold the light of the sun. But 
the demons cannot know God, Who is most manifest of Himself, because He 
is the sovereign truth; and this is because they are not clean of heart, 
whereby alone can God be seen. Therefore neither can they know other 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22), the proper 
knowledge of the angels is twofold; namely, morning and evening. But the 
demons have no morning knowledge, because they do not see things in the 
Word; nor have they the evening knowledge,  because this evening 
knowledge refers the things known to the Creator's praise (hence, after 
"evening" comes "morning" [Gn. 1]). Therefore the demons can have no 
knowledge of things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the angels at their creation knew the mystery of the 
kingdom of God, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19; De Civ. Dei xi). 
But the demons are deprived of such knowledge: "for if they had known it, 
they would never have crucified the Lord of glory," as is said 1 Cor. 
2:8. Therefore, for the same reason, they are deprived of all other 
knowledge of truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, whatever truth anyone knows is known either naturally, 
as we know first principles; or by deriving it from someone else, as we 
know by learning; or by long experience, as the things we learn by 
discovery. Now, the demons cannot know the truth by their own nature, 
because, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 33), the good angels are 
separated from them as light is from darkness; and every manifestation is 
made through light, as is said Eph. 5:13. In like manner they cannot 
learn by revelation, nor by learning from the good angels: because "there 
is no fellowship of light with darkness [*Vulg.: 'What fellowship hath . 
. . ?']" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++6%3A14">2 Cor. 6:14</a>). Nor can they learn by long experience: because 
experience comes of the senses. Consequently there is no knowledge of 
truth in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that, "certain gifts were 
bestowed upon the demons which, we say, have not been changed at all, but 
remain entire and most brilliant." Now, the knowledge of truth stands 
among those natural gifts. Consequently there is some knowledge of truth 
in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The knowledge of truth is twofold: one which comes of 
nature, and one which comes of grace. The knowledge which comes of grace 
is likewise twofold: the first is purely speculative, as when Divine 
secrets are imparted to an individual; the other is effective, and 
produces love for God; which knowledge properly belongs to the gift of 
wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these three kinds of knowledge the first was neither taken away nor 
lessened in the demons. For it follows from the very nature of the angel, 
who, according to his nature, is an intellect or mind: since on account 
of the simplicity of his substance, nothing can be withdrawn from his 
nature, so as to punish him by subtracting from his natural powers, as a 
man is punished by being deprived of a hand or a foot or of something 
else. Therefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that the natural gifts 
remain entire in them. Consequently their natural knowledge was not 
diminished. The second kind of knowledge, however, which comes of grace, 
and consists in speculation, has not been utterly taken away from them, 
but lessened; because, of these Divine secrets only so much is revealed 
to them as is necessary; and that is done either by means of the angels, 
or "through some temporal workings of Divine power," as Augustine says 
(De Civ. Dei ix, 21); but not in the same degree as to the holy angels, 
to whom many more things are revealed, and  more fully, in the Word 
Himself. But of the third knowledge, as likewise of charity, they are 
utterly deprived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Happiness consists in self-application to something higher. 
The separated substances are above us in the order of nature; hence man 
can have happiness of a kind by knowing the separated substances, 
although his perfect happiness consists in knowing the first substance, 
namely, God. But it is quite natural for one separate substance to know 
another; as it is natural for us to know sensible natures. Hence, as 
man's happiness does not consist in knowing sensible natures; so neither 
does the angel's happiness consist in knowing separated substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What is most manifest in its nature is hidden from us by 
its surpassing the bounds of our intellect; and not merely because our 
intellect draws knowledge from phantasms. Now the Divine substance 
surpasses the proportion not only of the human intellect, but even of the 
angelic. Consequently, not even an angel can of his own nature know God's 
substance. Yet on account of the perfection of his intellect he can of 
his nature have a higher knowledge of God than man can have. Such 
knowledge of God remains also in the demons. Although they do not possess 
the purity which comes with grace, nevertheless they have purity of 
nature; and this suffices for the knowledge of God which belongs to them 
from their nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The creature is darkness in comparison with the excellence 
of the Divine light; and therefore the creature's knowledge in its own 
nature is called "evening" knowledge. For the evening is akin to 
darkness, yet it possesses some light: but when the light fails utterly, 
then it is night. So then the knowledge of things in their own nature, 
when referred to the praise of the Creator, as it is in the good angels, 
has something of the Divine light, and can be called evening knowledge; 
but if it be not referred to God, as is the case with the demons, it is 
not called evening, but "nocturnal" knowledge. Accordingly we read in Gn. 
1:5 that the darkness, which God separated from the light, "He called 
night."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> All the angels had some knowledge from the very beginning 
respecting the mystery of God's kingdom, which found its completion in 
Christ; and most of all from the moment when they were beatified by the 
vision of the Word, which vision the demons never had. Yet all the angels 
did not fully and equally apprehend it; hence the demons much less fully 
understood the mystery of the Incarnation, when Christ was in the world. 
For, as Augustine observes (De Civ. Dei ix, 21), "It was not manifested 
to them as it was to the holy angels, who enjoy a participated eternity 
of the Word; but it was made known by some temporal effects, so as to 
strike terror into them." For had they fully and certainly known that He 
was the Son of God and the effect of His passion, they would never have 
procured the crucifixion of the Lord of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The demons know a truth in three ways: first of  all by the 
subtlety of their nature; for although they are darkened by privation of 
the light of grace, yet they are enlightened by the light of their 
intellectual nature: secondly, by revelation from the holy angels; for 
while not agreeing with them in conformity of will, they do agree, 
nevertheless, by their likeness of intellectual nature, according to 
which they can accept what is manifested by others: thirdly, they know by 
long experience; not as deriving it from the senses; but when the 
similitude of their innate intelligible species is completed in 
individual things, they know some things as present, which they 
previously did not know would come to pass, as we said when dealing with 
the knowledge of the angels (<A Href="FP057.html#FPQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FP057.html#FPQ57A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the will of the demons is obstinate in evil?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will of the demons is not obstinate in 
evil. For liberty of will belongs to the nature of an intellectual being, 
which nature remains in the demons, as we said above (<A Href="FP064.html#FPQ64A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But liberty 
of will is directly and firstly ordained to good rather than to evil. 
Therefore the demons' will is not so obstinate in evil as not to be able 
to return to what is good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since God's mercy is infinite, it is greater than the 
demons' malice, which is finite. But no one returns from the malice of 
sin to the goodness of justice save through God's mercy. Therefore the 
demons can likewise return from their state of malice to the state of 
justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the demons have a will obstinate in evil, then their 
will would be especially obstinate in the sin whereby they fell. But that 
sin, namely, pride, is in them no longer; because the motive for the sin 
no longer endures, namely, excellence. Therefore the demon is not 
obstinate in malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. iv) that man can be reinstated by 
another, since he fell through another. But, as was observed already 
(<A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the lower demons fell through the highest one. Therefore 
their fall can be repaired by another. Consequently they are not 
obstinate in malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, whoever is obstinate in malice, never performs any good 
work. But the demon performs some good works: for he confesses the truth, 
saying to Christ: "I know Who Thou art, the holy one of God" (Mk. 1:24). 
"The demons" also "believe and tremble" (Jm. 2:19). And Dionysius 
observes (Div. Nom. iv), that "they desire what is good and best, which 
is, to be, to live, to understand." Therefore they are not obstinate in 
malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++73%3A23">Ps. 73:23</a>): "The pride of them that hate 
Thee, ascendeth continually"; and this is understood of the demons. 
Therefore they remain ever obstinate in their malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was Origen's opinion [*Peri Archon i. 6]  that every 
will of the creature can by reason of free-will be inclined to good and 
evil; with the exception of the soul of Christ on account of the union of 
the Word. Such a statement deprives angels and saints of true beatitude, 
because everlasting stability is of the very nature of true beatitude; 
hence it is termed "life everlasting." It is also contrary to the 
authority of Sacred Scripture, which declares that demons and wicked men 
shall be sent "into everlasting punishment," and the good brought "into 
everlasting life." Consequently such an opinion must be considered 
erroneous; while according to Catholic Faith, it must be held firmly both 
that the will of the good angels is confirmed in good, and that the will 
of the demons is obstinate in evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must seek for the cause of this obstinacy, not in the gravity of the 
sin, but in the condition of their nature or state. For as Damascene says 
(De Fide Orth. ii), "death is to men, what the fall is to the angels." 
Now it is clear that all the mortal sins of men, grave or less grave, are 
pardonable before death; whereas after death they are without remission 
and endure for ever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To find the cause, then, of this obstinacy, it must be borne in mind 
that the appetitive power is in all things proportioned to the 
apprehensive, whereby it is moved, as the movable by its mover. For the 
sensitive appetite seeks a particular good; while the will seeks the 
universal good, as was said above (<A Href="FP059.html#FPQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>, <A Href="FP059.html#FPQ59A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); as also the sense 
apprehends particular objects, while the intellect considers universals. 
Now the angel's apprehension differs from man's in this respect, that the 
angel by his intellect apprehends immovably, as we apprehend immovably 
first principles which are the object of the habit of "intelligence"; 
whereas man by his reason apprehends movably, passing from one 
consideration to another; and having the way open by which he may proceed 
to either of two opposites. Consequently man's will adheres to a thing 
movably, and with the power of forsaking it and of clinging to the 
opposite; whereas the angel's will adheres fixedly and immovably. 
Therefore, if his will be considered before its adhesion, it can freely 
adhere either to this or to its opposite (namely, in such things as he 
does not will naturally); but after he has once adhered, he clings 
immovably. So it is customary to say that man's free-will is flexible to 
the opposite both before and after choice; but the angel's free-will is 
flexible either opposite before the choice, but not after. Therefore the 
good angels who adhered to justice, were confirmed therein; whereas the 
wicked ones, sinning, are obstinate in sin. Later on we shall treat of 
the obstinacy of men who are damned (SP, <A Href="FP098.html#FPQ98OUTP1">Question [98]</a>, <A Href="FP098.html#FPQ98ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The good and wicked angels have free-will, but according to 
the manner and condition of their state, as has been said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's mercy delivers from sin those who repent. But such as 
are not capable of repenting, cling immovably to sin, and are not 
delivered by the Divine mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The devil's first sin still remains in him according to 
desire; although not as to his believing that he can obtain what he 
desired. Even so, if a man were to believe that he can commit murder, and 
wills to commit it, and afterwards the power is taken from him; 
nevertheless, the will to murder can stay with him, so that he would he 
had done it, or still would do it if he could.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The fact that man sinned from another's suggestion, is not 
the whole cause of man's sin being pardonable. Consequently the argument 
does not hold good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A demon's act is twofold. One comes of deliberate will; and 
this is properly called his own act. Such an act on the demon's part is 
always wicked; because, although at times he does something good, yet he 
does not do it well; as when he tells the truth in order to deceive; and 
when he believes and confesses, yet not willingly, but compelled by the 
evidence of things. Another kind of act is natural to the demon; this can 
be good and bears witness to the goodness of nature. Yet he abuses even 
such good acts to evil purpose.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there is sorrow in the demons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no sorrow in the demons. For since 
sorrow and joy are opposites, they cannot be together in the same 
subject. But there is joy in the demons: for Augustine writing against 
the Maniches (De Gen. Contra Manich. ii, 17) says: "The devil has power 
over them who despise God's commandments, and he rejoices over this 
sinister power." Therefore there is no sorrow in the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sorrow is the cause of fear, for those things cause fear 
while they are future, which cause sorrow when they are present. But 
there is no fear in the demons, according to Job 41:24, "Who was made to 
fear no one." Therefore there is no grief in the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a good thing to be sorry for evil. But the demons 
can do no good action. Therefore they cannot be sorry, at least for the 
evil of sin; which applies to the worm of conscience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The demon's sin is greater than man's sin. But man is 
punished with sorrow on account of the pleasure taken in sin, according 
to Apoc. 18:7, "As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in 
delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her." Consequently much 
more is the devil punished with the grief of sorrow, because he 
especially glorified himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Fear, sorrow, joy, and the like, so far as they are 
passions, cannot exist in the demons; for thus they are proper to the 
sensitive appetite, which is a power in a corporeal organ.  According, 
however, as they denote simple acts of the will, they can be in the 
demons. And it must be said that there is sorrow in them; because sorrow, 
as denoting a simple act of the will, is nothing else than the resistance 
of the will to what is, or to what is not. Now it is evident that the 
demons would wish many things not to be, which are, and others to be, 
which are not: for, out of envy, they would wish others to be damned, who 
are saved. Consequently, sorrow must be said to exist in them: and 
especially because it is of the very notion of punishment for it to be 
repugnant to the will. Moreover, they are deprived of happiness, which 
they desire naturally; and their wicked will is curbed in many respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Joy and sorrow about the same thing are opposites, but not 
about different things. Hence there is nothing to hinder a man from being 
sorry for one thing, and joyful for another; especially so far as sorrow 
and joy imply simple acts of the will; because, not merely in different 
things, but even in one and the same thing, there can be something that 
we will, and something that we will not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As there is sorrow in the demons over present evil, so also 
there is fear of future evil. Now when it is said, "He was made to fear 
no one," this is to be understood of the fear of God which restrains from 
sin. For it is written elsewhere that "the devils believe and tremble" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+2%3A19">James 2:19</a>).<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To be sorry for the evil of sin on account of the sin bears 
witness to the goodness of the will, to which the evil of sin is opposed. 
But to be sorry for the evil of punishment, for the evil of sin on 
account of the punishment, bears witness to the goodness of nature, to 
which the evil of punishment is opposed. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. 
Dei xix, 13), that "sorrow for good lost by punishment, is the witness to 
a good nature." Consequently, since the demon has a perverse and 
obstinate will, he is not sorry for the evil of sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether our atmosphere is the demons' place of punishment?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this atmosphere is not the demons' place of 
punishment. For a demon is a spiritual nature. But a spiritual nature is 
not affected by place. Therefore there is no place of punishment for 
demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man's sin is not graver than the demons'. But man's 
place of punishment is hell. Much more, therefore, is it the demons' 
place of punishment; and consequently not the darksome atmosphere.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the demons are punished with the pain of fire. But there 
is no fire in the darksome atmosphere. Therefore the darksome atmosphere 
is not the place of punishment for the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iii, 10), that "the 
darksome atmosphere is as a prison to the demons until the judgment day."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angels in their own nature stand midway between God 
and men. Now the order of Divine providence so disposes, that it procures 
the welfare of the inferior orders through the superior. But man's 
welfare is disposed by Divine providence in two ways: first of all, 
directly, when a man is brought unto good and withheld from evil; and 
this is fittingly done through the good angels. In another way, 
indirectly, as when anyone assailed is exercised by fighting against 
opposition. It was fitting for this procuring of man's welfare to be 
brought about through the wicked spirits, lest they should cease to be of 
service in the natural order. Consequently a twofold place of punishment 
is due to the demons: one, by reason of their sin, and this is hell; and 
another, in order that they may tempt men, and thus the darksome 
atmosphere is their due place of punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the procuring of men's salvation is prolonged even to the judgment 
day: consequently, the ministry of the angels and wrestling with demons 
endure until then. Hence until then the good angels are sent to us here; 
and the demons are in this dark atmosphere for our trial: although some 
of them are even now in hell, to torment those whom they have led astray; 
just as some of the good angels are with the holy souls in heaven. But 
after the judgment day all the wicked, both men and angels, will be in 
hell, and the good in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A place is not penal to angel or soul as if affecting the 
nature by changing it, but as affecting the will by saddening it: because 
the angel or the soul apprehends that it is in a place not agreeable to 
its will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One soul is not set over another in the order of nature, as 
the demons are over men in the order of nature; consequently there is no 
parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some have maintained that the pain of sense for demons and 
souls is postponed until the judgment day: and that the beatitude of the 
saints is likewise postponed until the judgment day. But this is 
erroneous, and contrary to the teaching of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++5%3A1">2 Cor. 5:1</a>): "If 
our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, we have a house in 
heaven." Others, again, while not admitting the same of souls, admit it 
as to demons. But it is better to say that the same judgment is passed 
upon wicked souls and wicked angels, even as on good souls and good 
angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[64] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it must be said that, although a heavenly place belongs to 
the glory of the angels, yet their glory is not lessened by their coming 
to us, for they consider that place to be their own; in the same way as 
we say that the bishop's honor is not lessened while he is not actually 
sitting on his throne. In like manner it must be said, that although the 
demons are not actually  bound within the fire of hell while they are in 
this dark atmosphere, nevertheless their punishment is none the less; 
because they know that such confinement is their due. Hence it is said in 
a gloss upon James 3:6: "They carry fire of hell with them wherever they 
go." Nor is this contrary to what is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++8%3A31">Lk. 8:31</a>), "They besought the 
Lord not to cast them into the abyss"; for they asked for this, deeming 
it to be a punishment for them to be cast out of a place where they could 
injure men. Hence it is stated, "They [Vulg. 'He'] besought Him that He 
would not expel them [Vulg. 'him'] out of the country" (Mk. 5:10).<br>
