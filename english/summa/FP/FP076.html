    Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the intellectual principle is not
    united to the body as its form. For the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 4)
    that the intellect is "separate," and that it is not the act of any body.
    Therefore it is not united to the body as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every form is determined according to
    the nature of the matter of which it is the form; otherwise no proportion
    would be required between matter and form. Therefore if the intellect were
    united to the body as its form, since every body has a determinate nature,
    it would follow that the intellect has a determinate nature; and thus, it
    would not be capable of knowing all things, as is clear from what has been
    said (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); which is contrary to the
    nature of the intellect. Therefore the intellect is not united to the body
    as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a
    body, receives a form materially and individually; for what is received must
    be received according to the condition of the receiver. But the form of the
    thing understood is not received into the intellect materially and
    individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the
    intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal
    objects, but only of individuals, like the senses. Therefore the intellect
    is not united to the body as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, power and action have the same subject;
    for the same subject is what can, and does, act. But the intellectual action
    is not the action of a body, as appears from above (<a
      href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore neither is
    the intellectual faculty a power of the body. But virtue or power cannot be
    more abstract or more simple than the essence from which the faculty or
    power is derived. Therefore neither is the substance of the intellect the
    form of a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, whatever has "per se" existence is not
    united to the body as its form; because a form is that by which a thing
    exists: so that the very existence of a form does not belong to the form by
    itself. But the intellectual principle has "per se" existence and is
    subsistent, as was said above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it is not
    united to the body as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, whatever exists in a thing by reason of
    its nature exists in it always. But to be united to matter belongs to the
    form by reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an
    accidental quality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form would
    not make a thing substantially one, but only accidentally one. Therefore a
    form cannot be without its own proper matter. But the intellectual
    principle, since it is incorruptible, as was shown above (<a
      href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), remains separate from
    the body, after the dissolution of the body. Therefore the intellectual
    principle is not united to the body as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the Philosopher, Metaph. viii
    (Did. vii 2), difference is derived from the form. But the difference which
    constitutes man is "rational," which is applied to man on account of his
    intellectual principle. Therefore the intellectual principle is the form of
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must assert that the intellect which is the
    principle of intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For that
    whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is
    to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is
    health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence health
    is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The reason is
    because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; wherefore a thing acts
    by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first thing by which
    the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through various operations
    in different degrees of living things, that whereby we primarily perform
    each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the soul is the primary
    principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise of
    our understanding. Therefore this principle by which we primarily
    understand, whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is
    the form of the body. This is the demonstration used by Aristotle (De Anima
    ii, 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he
    must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is the action
    of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it is himself who
    understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in three ways, as is
    clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing is said to move or act,
    either by virtue of its whole self, for instance, as a physician heals; or
    by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye; or through an accidental
    quality, as when we say that something that is white builds, because it is
    accidental to the builder to be white. So when we say that Socrates or Plato
    understands, it is clear that this is not attributed to him accidentally;
    since it is ascribed to him as man, which is predicated of him essentially.
    We must therefore say either that Socrates understands by virtue of his
    whole self, as Plato maintained, holding that man is an intellectual soul;
    or that intelligence is a part of Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was
    shown above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), for this reason, that it
    is one and the same man who is conscious both that he understands, and that
    he senses. But one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body must be
    some part of man. It follows therefore that the intellect by which Socrates
    understands is a part of Socrates, so that in some way it is united to the
    body of Socrates.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Commentator held that this union is through the intelligible species, as
    having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and in the phantasms
    which are in the corporeal organs. Thus through the intelligible species the
    possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particular man. But
    this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the act of
    the intellect is the act of Socrates. This can be clearly seen from
    comparison with the sensitive faculty, from which Aristotle proceeds to
    consider things relating to the intellect. For the relation of phantasms to
    the intellect is like the relation of colors to the sense of sight, as he
    says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore, as the species of colors are in the
    sight, so are the species of phantasms in the possible intellect. Now it is
    clear that because the colors, the images of which are in the sight, are on
    a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: for we do not
    say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen. Therefore, from the fact
    that the species of phantasms are in the possible intellect, it does not
    follow that Socrates, in whom are the phantasms, understands, but that he or
    his phantasms are understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as
    its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing so that the
    act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This is, however,
    absurd for many reasons. First, because the intellect does not move the body
    except through the appetite, the movement of which presupposes the operation
    of the intellect. The reason therefore why Socrates understands is not
    because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved
    by his intellect because he understands. Secondly, because since Socrates is
    an individual in a nature of one essence composed of matter and form, if the
    intellect be not the form, it follows that it must be outside the essence,
    and then the intellect is the whole Socrates as a motor to the thing moved.
    Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, and does not pass into
    something else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of
    understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is
    moved by his intellect. Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never
    attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as the action of
    a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if understanding is attributed to Socrates,
    as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is attributed to him as
    to an instrument. This is contrary to the teaching of the Philosopher, who
    holds that understanding is not possible through a corporeal instrument (De
    Anima iii, 4). Fourthly, because, although the action of a part be
    attributed to the whole, as the action of the eye is attributed to a man;
    yet it is never attributed to another part, except perhaps indirectly; for
    we do not say that the hand sees because the eye sees. Therefore if the
    intellect and Socrates are united in the above manner, the action of the
    intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates. If, however, Socrates be a whole
    composed of a union of the intellect with whatever else belongs to Socrates,
    and still the intellect be united to those other things only as a motor, it
    follows that Socrates is not one absolutely, and consequently neither a
    being absolutely, for a thing is a being according as it is one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by
    Aristotle---namely, that this particular man understands, because the
    intellectual principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of the
    intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the
    body as its form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species. For the
    nature of each thing is shown by its operation. Now the proper operation of
    man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpasses all other animals.
    Whence Aristotle concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that the ultimate happiness of man
    must consist in this operation as properly belonging to him. Man must
    therefore derive his species from that which is the principle of this
    operation. But the species of anything is derived from its form. It follows
    therefore that the intellectual principle is the proper form of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above
    corporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and the more it excels
    matter by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form of a
    mixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities. And
    the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the
    power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul
    excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative
    soul. Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. Wherefore it
    excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it has an operation
    and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever. This power is
    called the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of
    matter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the form
    of the body. For since the form is an act, and matter is only in
    potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot be the form
    of another by virtue of itself as a whole. But if it is a form by virtue of
    some part of itself, then that part which is the form we call the soul, and
    that of which it is the form we call the "primary animate," as was said
    above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 2),
    the ultimate natural form to which the consideration of the natural
    philosopher is directed is indeed separate; yet it exists in matter. He
    proves this from the fact that "man and the sun generate man from matter."
    It is separate indeed according to its intellectual power, because the
    intellectual power does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of
    seeing is the act of the eye; for understanding is an act which cannot be
    performed by a corporeal organ, like the act of seeing. But it exists in
    matter so far as the soul itself, to which this power belongs, is the form
    of the body, and the term of human generation. And so the Philosopher says
    (De Anima iii) that the intellect is separate, because it is not the faculty
    of a corporeal organ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: since,
    in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his
    intellect, and that his intellect may understand immaterial things and
    universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the act of
    the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The human soul, by reason of its
    perfection, is not a form merged in matter, or entirely embraced by matter.
    Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act
    of the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The soul communicates that existence in
    which it subsists to the corporeal matter, out of which and the intellectual
    soul there results unity of existence; so that the existence of the whole
    composite is also the existence of the soul. This is not the case with other
    non-subsistent forms. For this reason the human soul retains its own
    existence after the dissolution of the body; whereas it is not so with other
    forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> To be united to the body belongs to the
    soul by reason of itself, as it belongs to a light body by reason of itself
    to be raised up. And as a light body remains light, when removed from its
    proper place, retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclination for its
    proper place; so the human soul retains its proper existence when separated
    from the body, having an aptitude and a natural inclination to be united to
    the body.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied according to the number of
    bodies?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellectual principle is
    not multiplied according to the number of bodies, but that there is one
    intellect in all men. For an immaterial substance is not multiplied in
    number within one species. But the human soul is an immaterial substance;
    since it is not composed of matter and form as was shown above (<a
      href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore there are
    not many human souls in one species. But all men are of one species.
    Therefore there is but one intellect in all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, when the cause is removed, the effect is
    also removed. Therefore, if human souls were multiplied according to the
    number of bodies, it follows that the bodies being removed, the number of
    souls would not remain; but from all the souls there would be but a single
    remainder. This is heretical; for it would do away with the distinction of
    rewards and punishments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if my intellect is distinct from your
    intellect, my intellect is an individual, and so is yours; for individuals
    are things which differ in number but agree in one species. Now whatever is
    received into anything must be received according to the condition of the
    receiver. Therefore the species of things would be received individually
    into my intellect, and also into yours: which is contrary to the nature of
    the intellect which knows universals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the thing understood is in the intellect
    which understands. If, therefore, my intellect is distinct from yours, what
    is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you; and
    consequently it will be reckoned as something individual, and be only
    potentially something understood; so that the common intention will have to
    be abstracted from both; since from things diverse something intelligible
    common to them may be abstracted. But this is contrary to the nature of the
    intellect; for then the intellect would seem not to be distinct from the
    imagination. It seems, therefore, to follow that there is one intellect in
    all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, when the disciple receives knowledge
    from the master, it cannot be said that the master's knowledge begets
    knowledge in the disciple, because then also knowledge would be an active
    form, such as heat is, which is clearly false. It seems, therefore, that the
    same individual knowledge which is in the master is communicated to the
    disciple; which cannot be, unless there is one intellect in both. Seemingly,
    therefore, the intellect of the disciple and master is but one; and,
    consequently, the same applies to all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Quant. Animae xxxii) says:
    "If I were to say that there are many human souls, I should laugh at
    myself." But the soul seems to be one chiefly on account of the intellect.
    Therefore there is one intellect of all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 3) that the
    relation of universal causes to universals is like the relation of
    particular causes to individuals. But it is impossible that a soul, one in
    species, should belong to animals of different species. Therefore it is
    impossible that one individual intellectual soul should belong to several
    individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is absolutely impossible for one intellect
    to belong to all men. This is clear if, as Plato maintained, man is the
    intellect itself. For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man;
    and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside
    the essence of each. The distinction between Socrates and Plato would be no
    other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; which is
    quite absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the opinion of
    Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), it is supposed that the intellect is a part or a
    power of the soul which is the form of man. For it is impossible for many
    distinct individuals to have one form, as it is impossible for them to have
    one existence, for the form is the principle of existence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of
    the union of the intellect to this or that man. For it is manifest that,
    supposing there is one principal agent, and two instruments, we can say that
    there is one agent absolutely, but several actions; as when one man touches
    several things with his two hands, there will be one who touches, but two
    contacts. If, on the contrary, we suppose one instrument and several
    principal agents, we might say that there are several agents, but one act;
    for example, if there be many drawing a ship by means of a rope; there will
    be many drawing, but one pull. If, however, there is one principal agent,
    and one instrument, we say that there is one agent and one action, as when
    the smith strikes with one hammer, there is one striker and one stroke. Now
    it is clear that no matter how the intellect is united or coupled to this or
    that man, the intellect has the precedence of all the other things which
    appertain to man; for the sensitive powers obey the intellect, and are at
    its service. Therefore, if we suppose two men to have several intellects and
    one sense---for instance, if two men had one eye---there would be several
    seers, but one sight. But if there is one intellect, no matter how diverse
    may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in
    no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Plato are otherwise than one
    understanding man. And if to this we add that to understand, which is the
    act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ other than the intellect
    itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent and one action:
    that is to say that all men are but one "understander," and have but one act
    of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it would be possible to distinguish my intellectual action form
    yours by the distinction of the phantasms---that is to say, were there one
    phantasm of a stone in me, and another in you---if the phantasm itself, as
    it is one thing in me and another in you, were a form of the possible
    intellect; since the same agent according to divers forms produces divers
    actions; as, according to divers forms of things with regard to the same
    eye, there are divers visions. But the phantasm itself is not a form of the
    possible intellect; it is the intelligible species abstracted from the
    phantasm that is a form. Now in one intellect, from different phantasms of
    the same species, only one intelligible species is abstracted; as appears in
    one man, in whom there may be different phantasms of a stone; yet from all
    of them only one intelligible species of a stone is abstracted; by which the
    intellect of that one man, by one operation, understands the nature of a
    stone, notwithstanding the diversity of phantasms. Therefore, if there were
    one intellect for all men, the diversity of phantasms which are in this one
    and that one would not cause a diversity of intellectual operation in this
    man and that man. It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible
    and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the intellectual soul, like an
    angel, has no matter from which it is produced, yet it is the form of a
    certain matter; in which it is unlike an angel. Therefore, according to the
    division of matter, there are many souls of one species; while it is quite
    impossible for many angels to be of one species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Everything has unity in the same way
    that it has being; consequently we must judge of the multiplicity of a thing
    as we judge of its being. Now it is clear that the intellectual soul, by
    virtue of its very being, is united to the body as its form; yet, after the
    dissolution of the body, the intellectual soul retains its own being. In
    like manner the multiplicity of souls is in proportion to the multiplicity
    of the bodies; yet, after the dissolution of the bodies, the souls retain
    their multiplied being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Individuality of the intelligent being,
    or of the species whereby it understands, does not exclude the understanding
    of universals; otherwise, since separate intellects are subsistent
    substances, and consequently individual, they could not understand
    universals. But the materiality of the knower, and of the species whereby it
    knows, impedes the knowledge of the universal. For as every action is
    according to the mode of the form by which the agent acts, as heating is
    according to the mode of the heat; so knowledge is according to the mode of
    the species by which the knower knows. Now it is clear that common nature
    becomes distinct and multiplied by reason of the individuating principles
    which come from the matter. Therefore if the form, which is the means of
    knowledge, is material---that is, not abstracted from material
    conditions---its likeness to the nature of a species or genus will be
    according to the distinction and multiplication of that nature by means of
    individuating principles; so that knowledge of the nature of a thing in
    general will be impossible. But if the species be abstracted from the
    conditions of individual matter, there will be a likeness of the nature
    without those things which make it distinct and multiplied; thus there will
    be knowledge of the universal. Nor does it matter, as to this particular
    point, whether there be one intellect or many; because, even if there were
    but one, it would necessarily be an individual intellect, and the species
    whereby it understands, an individual species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Whether the intellect be one or many,
    what is understood is one; for what is understood is in the intellect, not
    according to its own nature, but according to its likeness; for "the stone
    is not in the soul, but its likeness is," as is said, De Anima iii, 8. Yet
    it is the stone which is understood, not the likeness of the stone; except
    by a reflection of the intellect on itself: otherwise, the objects of
    sciences would not be things, but only intelligible species. Now it happens
    that different things, according to different forms, are likened to the same
    thing. And since knowledge is begotten according to the assimilation of the
    knower to the thing known, it follows that the same thing may happen to be
    known by several knowers; as is apparent in regard to the senses; for
    several see the same color, according to different likenesses. In the same
    way several intellects understand one object understood. But there is this
    difference, according to the opinion of Aristotle, between the sense and the
    intelligence---that a thing is perceived by the sense according to the
    disposition which it has outside the soul ---that is, in its individuality;
    whereas the nature of the thing understood is indeed outside the soul, but
    the mode according to which it exists outside the soul is not the mode
    according to which it is understood. For the common nature is understood as
    apart from the individuating principles; whereas such is not its mode of
    existence outside the soul. But, according to the opinion of Plato, the
    thing understood exists outside the soul in the same condition as those
    under which it is understood; for he supposed that the natures of things
    exist separate from matter.<br />

    Whether besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls
    essentially different from one another?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that besides the intellectual soul
    there are in man other souls essentially different from one another, such as
    the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. For corruptible and incorruptible
    are not of the same substance. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible;
    whereas the other souls, as the sensitive and the nutritive, are
    corruptible, as was shown above (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore in man the
    essence of the intellectual soul, the sensitive soul, and the nutritive
    soul, cannot be the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it be said that the sensitive soul in
    man is incorruptible; on the contrary, "corruptible and incorruptible differ
    generically," says the Philosopher, Metaph. x (Did. ix, 10). But the
    sensitive soul in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals, is
    corruptible. If, therefore, in man it be incorruptible, the sensitive soul
    in man and brute animals will not be of the same "genus." Now an animal is
    so called from its having a sensitive soul; and, therefore, "animal" will
    not be one genus common to man and other animals, which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says, Metaph. viii (Did.
    vii, 2), that the genus is taken from the matter, and difference from the
    form. But "rational," which is the difference constituting man, is taken
    from the intellectual soul; while he is called "animal" by reason of his
    having a body animated by a sensitive soul. Therefore the intellectual soul
    may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive soul, as form to matter.
    Therefore in man the intellectual soul is not essentially the same as the
    sensitive soul, but presupposes it as a material subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in the book De Ecclesiasticis
    Dogmatibus xv: "Nor do we say that there are two souls in one man, as James
    and other Syrians write; one, animal, by which the body is animated, and
    which is mingled with the blood; the other, spiritual, which obeys the
    reason; but we say that it is one and the same soul in man, that both gives
    life to the body by being united to it, and orders itself by its own
    reasoning."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Plato held that there were several souls in one
    body, distinct even as to organs, to which souls he referred the different
    vital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the
    concupiscible in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. Which
    opinion is rejected by Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to those
    parts of the soul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that in those
    animals which continue to live when they have been divided in each part are
    observed the operations of the soul, as sense and appetite. Now this would
    not be the case if the various principles of the soul's operations were
    essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the body. But
    with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether
    it be "only logically" distinct from the other parts of the soul, "or also
    locally."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The opinion of Plato might be maintained if, as he held, the soul was
    supposed to be united to the body, not as its form, but as its motor. For it
    involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing be moved by
    several motors; and still less if it be moved according to its various
    parts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the body as its
    form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different souls to be
    in one body. This can be made clear by three different reasons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there
    were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except by one form, by
    which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the same source both
    existence and unity; and therefore things which are denominated by various
    forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, "a white man." If,
    therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative soul, and 'animal'
    by another form, the sensitive soul, and "man" by another form, the
    intellectual soul, it would follow that man is not absolutely one. Thus
    Aristotle argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), against Plato, that if the
    idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of a biped, then a biped animal
    is not absolutely one. For this reason, against those who hold that there
    are several souls in the body, he asks (De Anima i, 5), "what contains
    them?"---that is, what makes them one? It cannot be said that they are
    united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain the body and
    make it one, than the reverse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, this is proved to be impossible by the manner in which one thing
    is predicated of another. Those things which are derived from various forms
    are predicated of one another, either accidentally, (if the forms are not
    ordered to one another, as when we say that something white is sweet), or
    essentially, in the second manner of essential predication, (if the forms
    are ordered one to another, the subject belonging to the definition of the
    predicate; as a surface is presupposed to color; so that if we say that a
    body with a surface is colored, we have the second manner of essential
    predication.) Therefore, if we have one form by which a thing is an animal,
    and another form by which it is a man, it follows either that one of these
    two things could not be predicated of the other, except accidentally,
    supposing these two forms not to be ordered to one another---or that one
    would be predicated of the other according to the second manner of essential
    predication, if one soul be presupposed to the other. But both of these
    consequences are clearly false: because "animal" is predicated of man
    essentially and not accidentally; and man is not part of the definition of
    an animal, but the other way about. Therefore of necessity by the same form
    a thing is animal and man; otherwise man would not really be the thing which
    is an animal, so that animal can be essentially predicated of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation
    of the soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case
    unless the principle of action were essentially one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual
    soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily be
    explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms. For we
    observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another, as the
    perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more
    perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and man
    than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees.
    For this reason Aristotle, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 3), compares the species
    of things to numbers, which differ in species by the addition or subtraction
    of unity. And (De Anima ii, 3) he compares the various souls to the species
    of figures, one of which contains another; as a pentagon contains and
    exceeds a tetragon. Thus the intellectual soul contains virtually whatever
    belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals, and to the nutritive souls
    of plants. Therefore, as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape, is not
    tetragonal by one shape, and pentagonal by another---since a tetragonal
    shape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal---so neither is
    Socrates a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same
    soul he is both animal and man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not
    by reason of its being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual.
    When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with
    sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For although
    sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive
    intellectuality of its incorruptibility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not forms, but composites, are
    classified either generically or specifically. Now man is corruptible like
    other animals. And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which
    is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference between
    man and the other animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The embryo has first of all a soul which
    is merely sensitive, and when this is removed, it is supplanted by a more
    perfect soul, which is both sensitive and intellectual: as will be shown
    further on (<a href="FP118.html#FPQ118OUTP1">Question [118]</a>,
    <a href="FP118.html#FPQ118A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> We must not consider the diversity of
    natural things as proceeding from the various logical notions or intentions,
    which flow from our manner of understanding, because reason can apprehend
    one and the same thing in various ways. Therefore since, as we have said,
    the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive soul,
    and something more, reason can consider separately what belongs to the power
    of the sensitive soul, as something imperfect and material. And because it
    observes that this is something common to man and to other animals, it forms
    thence the notion of the "genus"; while that wherein the intellectual soul
    exceeds the sensitive soul, it takes as formal and perfecting; thence it
    gathers the "difference" of man.<br />

    Whether in man there is another form besides the intellectual soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in man there is another form
    besides the intellectual soul. For the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1),
    that "the soul is the act of a physical body which has life potentially."
    Therefore the soul is to the body as a form of matter. But the body has a
    substantial form by which it is a body. Therefore some other substantial
    form in the body precedes the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man moves himself as every animal does.
    Now everything that moves itself is divided into two parts, of which one
    moves, and the other is moved, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 5).
    But the part which moves is the soul. Therefore the other part must be such
    that it can be moved. But primary matter cannot be moved (Phys. v, 1), since
    it is a being only potentially; indeed everything that is moved is a body.
    Therefore in man and in every animal there must be another substantial form,
    by which the body is constituted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the order of forms depends on their
    relation to primary matter; for "before" and "after" apply by comparison to
    some beginning. Therefore if there were not in man some other substantial
    form besides the rational soul, and if this were to inhere immediately to
    primary matter; it would follow that it ranks among the most imperfect forms
    which inhere to matter immediately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the human body is a mixed body. Now
    mingling does not result from matter alone; for then we should have mere
    corruption. Therefore the forms of the elements must remain in a mixed body;
    and these are substantial forms. Therefore in the human body there are other
    substantial forms besides the intellectual soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Of one thing there is but one substantial
    being. But the substantial form gives substantial being. Therefore of one
    thing there is but one substantial form. But the soul is the substantial
    form of man. Therefore it is impossible for there to be in man another
    substantial form besides the intellectual soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we suppose that the intellectual soul is not
    united to the body as its form, but only as its motor, as the Platonists
    maintain, it would necessarily follow that in man there is another
    substantial form, by which the body is established in its being as movable
    by the soul. If, however, the intellectual soul be united to the body as its
    substantial form, as we have said above (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it is impossible for another substantial form besides the intellectual
    soul to be found in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to make this evident, we must consider that the substantial form
    differs from the accidental form in this, that the accidental form does not
    make a thing to be "simply," but to be "such," as heat does not make a thing
    to be simply, but only to be hot. Therefore by the coming of the accidental
    form a thing is not said to be made or generated simply, but to be made
    such, or to be in some particular condition; and in like manner, when an
    accidental form is removed, a thing is said to be corrupted, not simply, but
    relatively. Now the substantial form gives being simply; therefore by its
    coming a thing is said to be generated simply; and by its removal to be
    corrupted simply. For this reason, the old natural philosophers, who held
    that primary matter was some actual being---for instance, fire or air, or
    something of that sort---maintained that nothing is generated simply, or
    corrupted simply; and stated that "every becoming is nothing but an
    alteration," as we read, Phys. i, 4. Therefore, if besides the intellectual
    soul there pre-existed in matter another substantial form by which the
    subject of the soul were made an actual being, it would follow that the soul
    does not give being simply; and consequently that it is not the substantial
    form: and so at the advent of the soul there would not be simple generation;
    nor at its removal simple corruption, all of which is clearly false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Whence we must conclude, that there is no other substantial form in man
    besides the intellectual soul; and that the soul, as it virtually contains
    the sensitive and nutritive souls, so does it virtually contain all inferior
    forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other
    things. The same is to be said of the sensitive soul in brute animals, and
    of the nutritive soul in plants, and universally of all more perfect forms
    with regard to the imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Aristotle does not say that the soul is
    the act of a body only, but "the act of a physical organic body which has
    life potentially"; and that this potentiality "does not reject the soul."
    Whence it is clear that when the soul is called the act, the soul itself is
    included; as when we say that heat is the act of what is hot, and light of
    what is lucid; not as though lucid and light were two separate things, but
    because a thing is made lucid by the light. In like manner, the soul is said
    to be the "act of a body," etc., because by the soul it is a body, and is
    organic, and has life potentially. Yet the first act is said to be in
    potentiality to the second act, which is operation; for such a potentiality
    "does not reject"---that is, does not exclude---the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The soul does not move the body by its
    essence, as the form of the body, but by the motive power, the act of which
    presupposes the body to be already actualized by the soul: so that the soul
    by its motive power is the part which moves; and the animate body is the
    part moved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We observe in matter various degrees of
    perfection, as existence, living, sensing, and understanding. Now what is
    added is always more perfect. Therefore that form which gives matter only
    the first degree of perfection is the most imperfect; while that form which
    gives the first, second, and third degree, and so on, is the most perfect:
    and yet it inheres to matter immediately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Avicenna held that the substantial forms
    of the elements remain entire in the mixed body; and that the mixture is
    made by the contrary qualities of the elements being reduced to an average.
    But this is impossible, because the various forms of the elements must
    necessarily be in various parts of matter; for the distinction of which we
    must suppose dimensions, without which matter cannot be divisible. Now
    matter subject to dimension is not to be found except in a body. But various
    bodies cannot be in the same place. Whence it follows that elements in the
    mixed body would be distinct as to situation. And then there would not be a
    real mixture which is in respect of the whole; but only a mixture apparent
    to sense, by the juxtaposition of particles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Averroes maintained that the forms of elements, by reason of their
    imperfection, are a medium between accidental and substantial forms, and so
    can be "more" or "less"; and therefore in the mixture they are modified and
    reduced to an average, so that one form emerges from them. But this is even
    still more impossible. For the substantial being of each thing consists in
    something indivisible, and every addition and subtraction varies the
    species, as in numbers, as stated in Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 3); and
    consequently it is impossible for any substantial form to receive "more" or
    "less." Nor is it less impossible for anything to be a medium between
    substance and accident.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we must say, in accordance with the Philosopher (De Gener. i, 10),
    that the forms of the elements remain in the mixed body, not actually but
    virtually. For the proper qualities of the elements remain, though modified;
    and in them is the power of the elementary forms. This quality of the
    mixture is the proper disposition for the substantial form of the mixed
    body; for instance, the form of a stone, or of any sort of soul.<br />

    Whether the intellectual soul is properly united to such a body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellectual soul is
    improperly united to such a body. For matter must be proportionate to the
    form. But the intellectual soul is incorruptible. Therefore it is not
    properly united to a corruptible body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the intellectual soul is a perfectly
    immaterial form; a proof whereof is its operation in which corporeal matter
    does not share. But the more subtle is the body, the less has it of matter.
    Therefore the soul should be united to a most subtle body, to fire, for
    instance, and not to a mixed body, still less to a terrestrial body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since the form is the principle of the
    species, one form cannot produce a variety of species. But the intellectual
    soul is one form. Therefore, it should not be united to a body which is
    composed of parts belonging to various species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is susceptible of a more perfect
    form should itself be more perfect. But the intellectual soul is the most
    perfect of souls. Therefore since the bodies of other animals are naturally
    provided with a covering, for instance, with hair instead of clothes, and
    hoofs instead of shoes; and are, moreover, naturally provided with arms, as
    claws, teeth, and horns; it seems that the intellectual soul should not have
    been united to a body which is imperfect as being deprived of the above
    means of protection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1), that
    "the soul is the act of a physical organic body having life potentially."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the form is not for the matter, but
    rather the matter for the form, we must gather from the form the reason why
    the matter is such as it is; and not conversely. Now the intellectual soul,
    as we have seen above (<a href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) in the order of nature,
    holds the lowest place among intellectual substances; inasmuch as it is not
    naturally gifted with the knowledge of truth, as the angels are; but has to
    gather knowledge from individual things by way of the senses, as Dionysius
    says (Div. Nom. vii). But nature never fails in necessary things: therefore
    the intellectual soul had to be endowed not only with the power of
    understanding, but also with the power of feeling. Now the action of the
    senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument. Therefore it
    behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted to be a
    convenient organ of sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now all the other senses are based on the sense of touch. But the organ of
    touch requires to be a medium between contraries, such as hot and cold, wet
    and dry, and the like, of which the sense of touch has the perception; thus
    it is in potentiality with regard to contraries, and is able to perceive
    them. Therefore the more the organ of touch is reduced to an equable
    complexion, the more sensitive will be the touch. But the intellectual soul
    has the power of sense in all its completeness; because what belongs to the
    inferior nature pre-exists more perfectly in the superior, as Dionysius says
    (Div. Nom. v). Therefore the body to which the intellectual soul is united
    should be a mixed body, above others reduced to the most equable complexion.
    For this reason among animals, man has the best sense of touch. And among
    men, those who have the best sense of touch have the best intelligence. A
    sign of which is that we observe "those who are refined in body are well
    endowed in mind," as stated in De Anima ii, 9.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Perhaps someone might attempt to answer
    this by saying that before sin the human body was incorruptible. This answer
    does not seem sufficient; because before sin the human body was immortal not
    by nature, but by a gift of Divine grace; otherwise its immortality would
    not be forfeited through sin, as neither was the immortality of the
    devil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we answer otherwise by observing that in matter two conditions are
    to be found; one which is chosen in order that the matter be suitable to the
    form; the other which follows by force of the first disposition. The
    artisan, for instance, for the form of the saw chooses iron adapted for
    cutting through hard material; but that the teeth of the saw may become
    blunt and rusted, follows by force of the matter itself. So the intellectual
    soul requires a body of equable complexion, which, however, is corruptible
    by force of its matter. If, however, it be said that God could avoid this,
    we answer that in the formation of natural things we do not consider what
    God might do; but what is suitable to the nature of things, as Augustine
    says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 1). God, however, provided in this case by applying a
    remedy against death in the gift of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A body is not necessary to the
    intellectual soul by reason of its intellectual operation considered as
    such; but on account of the sensitive power, which requires an organ of
    equable temperament. Therefore the intellectual soul had to be united to
    such a body, and not to a simple element, or to a mixed body, in which fire
    was in excess; because otherwise there could not be an equability of
    temperament. And this body of an equable temperament has a dignity of its
    own by reason of its being remote from contraries, thereby resembling in a
    way a heavenly body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The parts of an animal, for instance,
    the eye, hand, flesh, and bones, and so forth, do not make the species; but
    the whole does, and therefore, properly speaking, we cannot say that these
    are of different species, but that they are of various dispositions. This is
    suitable to the intellectual soul, which, although it be one in its essence,
    yet on account of its perfection, is manifold in power: and therefore, for
    its various operations it requires various dispositions in the parts of the
    body to which it is united. For this reason we observe that there is a
    greater variety of parts in perfect than in imperfect animals; and in these
    a greater variety than in plants.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The intellectual soul as comprehending
    universals, has a power extending to the infinite; therefore it cannot be
    limited by nature to certain fixed natural notions, or even to certain fixed
    means whether of defence or of clothing, as is the case with other animals,
    the souls of which are endowed with knowledge and power in regard to fixed
    particular things. Instead of all these, man has by nature his reason and
    his hands, which are "the organs of organs" (De Anima iii), since by their
    means man can make for himself instruments of an infinite variety, and for
    any number of purposes.<br />

    Whether the intellectual soul is united to the body through the medium of
    accidental dispositions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellectual soul is
    united to the body through the medium of accidental dispositions. For every
    form exists in its proper disposed matter. But dispositions to a form are
    accidents. Therefore we must presuppose accidents to be in matter before the
    substantial form; and therefore before the soul, since the soul is a
    substantial form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, various forms of one species require
    various parts of matter. But various parts of matter are unintelligible
    without division in measurable quantities. Therefore we must suppose
    dimensions in matter before the substantial forms, which are many belonging
    to one species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is spiritual is connected with what
    is corporeal by virtual contact. But the virtue of the soul is its power.
    Therefore it seems that the soul is united to the body by means of a power,
    which is an accident.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Accident is posterior to substance, both in
    the order of time and in the order of reason, as the Philosopher says,
    Metaph. vii (Did. vi, 1). Therefore it is unintelligible that any accidental
    form exist in matter before the soul, which is the substantial form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If the soul were united to the body, merely as
    a motor, there would be nothing to prevent the existence of certain
    dispositions mediating between the soul and the body; on the contrary, they
    would be necessary, for on the part of the soul would be required the power
    to move the body; and on the part of the body, a certain aptitude to be
    moved by the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, the intellectual soul is united to the body as the substantial
    form, as we have already said above (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it is impossible for any accidental disposition to come between the body
    and the soul, or between any substantial form whatever and its matter. The
    reason is because since matter is in potentiality to all manner of acts in a
    certain order, what is absolutely first among the acts must be understood as
    being first in matter. Now the first among all acts is existence. Therefore,
    it is impossible for matter to be apprehended as hot, or as having quantity,
    before it is actual. But matter has actual existence by the substantial
    form, which makes it to exist absolutely, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP076.html#FPQ76A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). Wherefore it is impossible for any accidental dispositions to pre-exist
    in matter before the substantial form, and consequently before the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As appears from what has been already
    said (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the more perfect
    form virtually contains whatever belongs to the inferior forms; therefore
    while remaining one and the same, it perfects matter according to the
    various degrees of perfection. For the same essential form makes man an
    actual being, a body, a living being, an animal, and a man. Now it is clear
    that to every "genus" follow its own proper accidents. Therefore as matter
    is apprehended as perfected in its existence, before it is understood as
    corporeal, and so on; so those accidents which belong to existence are
    understood to exist before corporeity; and thus dispositions are understood
    in matter before the form, not as regards all its effects, but as regards
    the subsequent effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dimensions of quantity are accidents
    consequent to the corporeity which belongs to the whole matter. Wherefore
    matter, once understood as corporeal and measurable, can be understood as
    distinct in its various parts, and as receptive of different forms according
    to the further degrees of perfection. For although it is essentially the
    same form which gives matter the various degrees of perfection, as we have
    said (ad 1), yet it is considered as different when brought under the
    observation of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A spiritual substance which is united to
    a body as its motor only, is united thereto by power or virtue. But the
    intellectual soul is united by its very being to the body as a form; and yet
    it guides and moves the body by its power and virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the soul is united to the animal body by means of a body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the soul is united to the animal
    body by means of a body. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 19), that
    "the soul administers the body by light," that is, by fire, "and by air,
    which is most akin to a spirit." But fire and air are bodies. Therefore the
    soul is united to the human body by means of a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a link between two things seems to be
    that thing the removal of which involves the cessation of their union. But
    when breathing ceases, the soul is separated from the body. Therefore the
    breath, which is a subtle body, is the means of union between soul and
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things which are very distant from one
    another, are not united except by something between them. But the
    intellectual soul is very distant from the body, both because it is
    incorporeal, and because it is incorruptible. Therefore it seems to be
    united to the body by means of an incorruptible body, and such would be some
    heavenly light, which would harmonize the elements, and unite them
    together.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1): "We
    need not ask if the soul and body are one, as neither do we ask if wax and
    its shape are one." But the shape is united to the wax without a body
    intervening. Therefore also the soul is thus united to the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If the soul, according to the Platonists, were
    united to the body merely as a motor, it would be right to say that some
    other bodies must intervene between the soul and body of man, or any animal
    whatever; for a motor naturally moves what is distant from it by means of
    something nearer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, the soul is united to the body as its form, as we have said (<a
      href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it is impossible for it to be united by means of another body. The
    reason of this is that a thing is one, according as it is a being. Now the
    form, through itself, makes a thing to be actual since it is itself
    essentially an act; nor does it give existence by means of something else.
    Wherefore the unity of a thing composed of matter and form, is by virtue of
    the form itself, which by reason of its very nature is united to matter as
    its act. Nor is there any other cause of union except the agent, which
    causes matter to be in act, as the Philosopher says, Metaph. viii (Did. vii,
    6).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From this it is clear how false are the opinions of those who maintained the
    existence of some mediate bodies between the soul and body of man. Of these
    certain Platonists said that the intellectual soul has an incorruptible body
    naturally united to it, from which it is never separated, and by means of
    which it is united to the corruptible body of man. Others said that the soul
    is united to the body by means of a corporeal spirit. Others said it is
    united to the body by means of light, which, they say, is a body and of the
    nature of the fifth essence; so that the vegetative soul would be united to
    the body by means of the light of the sidereal heaven; the sensible soul, by
    means of the light of the crystal heaven; and the intellectual soul by means
    of the light of the empyrean heaven. Now all this is fictious and
    ridiculous: for light is not a body; and the fifth essence does not enter
    materially into the composition of a mixed body (since it is unchangeable),
    but only virtually: and lastly, because the soul is immediately united to
    the body as the form to matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine speaks there of the soul as it
    moves the body; whence he uses the word "administration." It is true that it
    moves the grosser parts of the body by the more subtle parts. And the first
    instrument of the motive power is a kind of spirit, as the Philosopher says
    in De causa motus animalium (De mot. animal. x).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The union of soul and body ceases at the
    cessation of breath, not because this is the means of union, but because of
    the removal of that disposition by which the body is disposed for such a
    union. Nevertheless the breath is a means of moving, as the first instrument
    of motion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The soul is indeed very distant from the
    body, if we consider the condition of each separately: so that if each had a
    separate existence, many means of connection would have to intervene. But
    inasmuch as the soul is the form of the body, it has not an existence apart
    from the existence of the body, but by its own existence is united to the
    body immediately. This is the case with every form which, if considered as
    an act, is very distant from matter, which is a being only in
    potentiality.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the soul is in each part of the body?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the whole soul is not in each
    part of the body; for the Philosopher says in De causa motus animalium (De
    mot. animal. x): "It is not necessary for the soul to be in each part of the
    body; it suffices that it be in some principle of the body causing the other
    parts to live, for each part has a natural movement of its own."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul is in the body of which it is
    the act. But it is the act of an organic body. Therefore it exists only in
    an organic body. But each part of the human body is not an organic body.
    Therefore the whole soul is not in each part.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima. ii, 1)
    that the relation of a part of the soul to a part of the body, such as the
    sight to the pupil of the eye, is the same as the relation of the soul to
    the whole body of an animal. If, therefore, the whole soul is in each part
    of the body, it follows that each part of the body is an animal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all the powers of the soul are rooted in
    the essence of the soul. If, therefore, the whole soul be in each part of
    the body, it follows that all the powers of the soul are in each part of the
    body; thus the sight will be in the ear, and hearing in the eye, and this is
    absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if the whole soul is in each part of the
    body, each part of the body is immediately dependent on the soul. Thus one
    part would not depend on another; nor would one part be nobler than another;
    which is clearly untrue. Therefore the soul is not in each part of the
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 6), that "in
    each body the whole soul is in the whole body, and in each part is
    entire."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have said, if the soul were united to the
    body merely as its motor, we might say that it is not in each part of the
    body, but only in one part through which it would move the others. But since
    the soul is united to the body as its form, it must necessarily be in the
    whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an accidental form, but
    the substantial form of the body. Now the substantial form perfects not only
    the whole, but each part of the whole. For since a whole consists of parts,
    a form of the whole which does not give existence to each of the parts of
    the body, is a form consisting in composition and order, such as the form of
    a house; and such a form is accidental. But the soul is a substantial form;
    and therefore it must be the form and the act, not only of the whole, but
    also of each part. Therefore, on the withdrawal of the soul, as we do not
    speak of an animal or a man unless equivocally, as we speak of a painted
    animal or a stone animal; so is it with the hand, the eye, the flesh and
    bones, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1). A proof of which is, that
    on the withdrawal of the soul, no part of the body retains its proper
    action; although that which retains its species, retains the action of the
    species. But act is in that which it actuates: wherefore the soul must be in
    the whole body, and in each part thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    That it is entire in each part thereof, may be concluded from this, that
    since a whole is that which is divided into parts, there are three kinds of
    totality, corresponding to three kinds of division. There is a whole which
    is divided into parts of quantity, as a whole line, or a whole body. There
    is also a whole which is divided into logical and essential parts: as a
    thing defined is divided into the parts of a definition, and a composite
    into matter and form. There is, further, a third kind of whole which is
    potential, divided into virtual parts. The first kind of totality does not
    apply to forms, except perhaps accidentally; and then only to those forms,
    which have an indifferent relationship to a quantitative whole and its
    parts; as whiteness, as far as its essence is concerned, is equally disposed
    to be in the whole surface and in each part of the surface; and, therefore,
    the surface being divided, the whiteness is accidentally divided. But a form
    which requires variety in the parts, such as a soul, and specially the soul
    of perfect animals, is not equally related to the whole and the parts: hence
    it is not divided accidentally when the whole is divided. So therefore
    quantitative totality cannot be attributed to the soul, either essentially
    or accidentally. But the second kind of totality, which depends on logical
    and essential perfection, properly and essentially belongs to forms: and
    likewise the virtual totality, because a form is the principle of
    operation.<br />

    Therefore if it be asked whether the whole whiteness is in the whole surface
    and in each part thereof, it is necessary to distinguish. If we mean
    quantitative totality which whiteness has accidentally, then the whole
    whiteness is not in each part of the surface. The same is to be said of
    totality of power: since the whiteness which is in the whole surface moves
    the sight more than the whiteness which is in a small part thereof. But if
    we mean totality of species and essence, then the whole whiteness is in each
    part of a surface.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, however, the soul has not quantitative totality, neither essentially,
    nor accidentally, as we have seen; it is enough to say that the whole soul
    is in each part of the body, by totality of perfection and of essence, but
    not by totality of power. For it is not in each part of the body, with
    regard to each of its powers; but with regard to sight, it is in the eye;
    and with regard to hearing, it is in the ear; and so forth. We must observe,
    however, that since the soul requires variety of parts, its relation to the
    whole is not the same as its relation to the parts; for to the whole it is
    compared primarily and essentially, as to its proper and proportionate
    perfectible; but to the parts, secondarily, inasmuch as they are ordained to
    the whole.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking there of the
    motive power of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The soul is the act of an organic body,
    as of its primary and proportionate perfectible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> An animal is that which is composed of a
    soul and a whole body, which is the soul's primary and proportionate
    perfectible. Thus the soul is not in a part. Whence it does not follow that
    a part of an animal is an animal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some of the powers of the soul are in it
    according as it exceeds the entire capacity of the body, namely the
    intellect and the will; whence these powers are not said to be in any part
    of the body. Other powers are common to the soul and body; wherefore each of
    these powers need not be wherever the soul is, but only in that part of the
    body, which is adapted to the operation of such a power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> One part of the body is said to be
    nobler than another, on account of the various powers, of which the parts of
    the body are the organs. For that part which is the organ of a nobler power,
    is a nobler part of the body: as also is that part which serves the same
    power in a nobler manner.<br />
