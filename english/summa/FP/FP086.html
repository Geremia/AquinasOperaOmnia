    WHAT OUR INTELLECT KNOWS IN MATERIAL THINGS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now have to consider what our intellect knows in material things. Under
    this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it knows singulars?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it knows the infinite?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it knows contingent
    things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it knows future things?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether our intellect knows singulars?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect knows singulars.
    For whoever knows composition, knows the terms of composition. But our
    intellect knows this composition; "Socrates is a man": for it belongs to the
    intellect to form a proposition. Therefore our intellect knows this
    singular, Socrates.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the practical intellect directs to
    action. But action has relation to singular things. Therefore the intellect
    knows the singular.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our intellect understands itself. But in
    itself it is a singular, otherwise it would have no action of its own; for
    actions belong to singulars. Therefore our intellect knows singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a superior power can do whatever is done
    by an inferior power. But sense knows the singular. Much more, therefore,
    can the intellect know it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Phys. i, 5), that "the
    universal is known by reason; and the singular is known by sense."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Our intellect cannot know the singular in
    material things directly and primarily. The reason of this is that the
    principle of singularity in material things is individual matter, whereas
    our intellect, as have said above (<a href="FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1"
      >Question [85]</a
    >, <a href="FP085.html#FPQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), understands by
    abstracting the intelligible species from such matter. Now what is
    abstracted from individual matter is the universal. Hence our intellect
    knows directly the universal only. But indirectly, and as it were by a kind
    of reflection, it can know the singular, because, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1"
      >Question [85]</a
    >, <a href="FP085.html#FPQ85A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), even after
    abstracting the intelligible species, the intellect, in order to understand,
    needs to turn to the phantasms in which it understands the species, as is
    said De Anima iii, 7. Therefore it understands the universal directly
    through the intelligible species, and indirectly the singular represented by
    the phantasm. And thus it forms the proposition "Socrates is a man."
    Wherefore the reply to the first objection is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The choice of a particular thing to be
    done is as the conclusion of a syllogism formed by the practical intellect,
    as is said Ethic. vii, 3. But a singular proposition cannot be directly
    concluded from a universal proposition, except through the medium of a
    singular proposition. Therefore the universal principle of the practical
    intellect does not move save through the medium of the particular
    apprehension of the sensitive part, as is said De Anima iii, 11.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Intelligibility is incompatible with the
    singular not as such, but as material, for nothing can be understood
    otherwise than immaterially. Therefore if there be an immaterial singular
    such as the intellect, there is no reason why it should not be
    intelligible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The higher power can do what the lower
    power can, but in a more eminent way. Wherefore what the sense knows
    materially and concretely, which is to know the singular directly, the
    intellect knows immaterially and in the abstract, which is to know the
    universal.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether our intellect can know the infinite?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect can know the
    infinite. For God excels all infinite things. But our intellect can know
    God, as we have said above (<a href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a
    >, <a href="FP012.html#FPQ12A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Much more, therefore,
    can our intellect know all other infinite things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our intellect can naturally know
    "genera" and "species." But there is an infinity of species in some genera,
    as in number, proportion, and figure. Therefore our intellect can know the
    infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if one body can coexist with another in
    the same place, there is nothing to prevent an infinite number of bodies
    being in one place. But one intelligible species can exist with another in
    the same intellect, for many things can be habitually known at the same
    time. Therefore our intellect can have an habitual knowledge of an infinite
    number of things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as the intellect is not a corporeal
    faculty, as we have said (<a href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it appears to be an
    infinite power. But an infinite power has a capacity for an infinite object.
    Therefore our intellect can know the infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (Phys. i, 4) that "the infinite,
    considered as such, is unknown."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since a faculty and its object are proportional
    to each other, the intellect must be related to the infinite, as is its
    object, which is the quiddity of a material thing. Now in material things
    the infinite does not exist actually, but only potentially, in the sense of
    one succeeding another, as is said Phys. iii, 6. Therefore infinity is
    potentially in our mind through its considering successively one thing after
    another: because never does our intellect understand so many things, that it
    cannot understand more.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, our intellect cannot understand the infinite either
    actually or habitually. Not actually, for our intellect cannot know actually
    at the same time, except what it knows through one species. But the infinite
    is not represented by one species, for if it were it would be something
    whole and complete. Consequently it cannot be understood except by a
    successive consideration of one part after another, as is clear from its
    definition (Phys. iii, 6): for the infinite is that "from which, however
    much we may take, there always remains something to be taken." Thus the
    infinite could not be known actually, unless all its parts were counted:
    which is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For the same reason we cannot have habitual knowledge of the infinite:
    because in us habitual knowledge results from actual consideration: since by
    understanding we acquire knowledge, as is said Ethic. ii, 1. Wherefore it
    would not be possible for us to have a habit of an infinity of things
    distinctly known, unless we had already considered the entire infinity
    thereof, counting them according to the succession of our knowledge: which
    is impossible. And therefore neither actually nor habitually can our
    intellect know the infinite, but only potentially as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we have said above (<a
      href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), God is called
    infinite, because He is a form unlimited by matter; whereas in material
    things, the term 'infinite' is applied to that which is deprived of any
    formal term. And form being known in itself, whereas matter cannot be known
    without form, it follows that the material infinite is in itself unknowable.
    But the formal infinite, God, is of Himself known; but He is unknown to us
    by reason of our feeble intellect, which in its present state has a natural
    aptitude for material objects only. Therefore we cannot know God in our
    present life except through material effects. In the future life this defect
    of intellect will be removed by the state of glory, when we shall be able to
    see the Essence of God Himself, but without being able to comprehend Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The nature of our mind is to know
    species abstracted from phantasms; therefore it cannot know actually or
    habitually species of numbers or figures that are not in the imagination,
    except in a general way and in their universal principles; and this is to
    know them potentially and confusedly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If two or more bodies were in the same
    place, there would be no need for them to occupy the place successively, in
    order for the things placed to be counted according to this succession of
    occupation. On the other hand, the intelligible species enter into our
    intellect successively; since many things cannot be actually understood at
    the same time: and therefore there must be a definite and not an infinite
    number of species in our intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As our intellect is infinite in power,
    so does it know the infinite. For its power is indeed infinite inasmuch as
    it is not terminated by corporeal matter. Moreover it can know the
    universal, which is abstracted from individual matter, and which
    consequently is not limited to one individual, but, considered in itself,
    extends to an infinite number of individuals.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether our intellect can know contingent things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellect cannot know
    contingent things: because, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 6), the
    objects of understanding, wisdom and knowledge are not contingent, but
    necessary things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated in Phys. iv, 12, "what
    sometimes is and sometimes is not, is measured by time." Now the intellect
    abstracts from time, and from other material conditions. Therefore, as it is
    proper to a contingent thing sometime to be and sometime not to be, it seems
    that contingent things are not known by the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> All knowledge is in the intellect. But some
    sciences are of the contingent things, as the moral sciences, the objects of
    which are human actions subject to free-will; and again, the natural
    sciences in as far as they relate to things generated and corruptible.
    Therefore the intellect knows contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Contingent things can be considered in two
    ways; either as contingent, or as containing some element of necessity,
    since every contingent thing has in it something necessary: for example,
    that Socrates runs, is in itself contingent; but the relation of running to
    motion is necessary, for it is necessary that Socrates move if he runs. Now
    contingency arises from matter, for contingency is a potentiality to be or
    not to be, and potentiality belongs to matter; whereas necessity results
    from form, because whatever is consequent on form is of necessity in the
    subject. But matter is the individualizing principle: whereas the universal
    comes from the abstraction of the form from the particular matter. Moreover
    it was laid down above (<a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>)
    that the intellect of itself and directly has the universal for its object;
    while the object of sense is the singular, which in a certain way is the
    indirect object of the intellect, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore the contingent, considered as such, is known directly by sense
    and indirectly by the intellect; while the universal and necessary
    principles of contingent things are known only by the intellect. Hence if we
    consider the objects of science in their universal principles, then all
    science is of necessary things. But if we consider the things themselves,
    thus some sciences are of necessary things, some of contingent things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From which the replies to the objections are clear.</p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether our intellect can know the future?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect knows the
    future. For our intellect knows by means of intelligible species abstracted
    from the "here" and "now," and related indifferently to all time. But it can
    know the present. Therefore it can know the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man, while his senses are in suspense,
    can know some future things, as in sleep, and in frenzy. But the intellect
    is freer and more vigorous when removed from sense. Therefore the intellect
    of its own nature can know the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> The intellectual knowledge of man is superior to
    any knowledge of brutes. But some animals know the future; thus crows by
    their frequent cawing foretell rain. Therefore much more can the intellect
    know the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++8%3A6,7"
      >Eccles. 8:6,7</a
    >), "There is a great affliction for man, because he is ignorant of things
    past; and things to come he cannot know by any messenger."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must apply the same distinction to future
    things, as we applied above (<a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >) to contingent things. For future things considered as subject to time are
    singular, and the human intellect knows them by reflection only, as stated
    above (<a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the
    principles of future things may be universal; and thus they may enter the
    domain of the intellect and become the objects of science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking, however, of the knowledge of the future in a general way, we must
    observe that the future may be known in two ways: either in itself, or in
    its cause. The future cannot be known in itself save by God alone; to Whom
    even that is present which in the course of events is future, forasmuch as
    from eternity His glance embraces the whole course of time, as we have said
    above when treating of God's knowledge (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>). But forasmuch as it
    exists in its cause, the future can be known by us also. And if, indeed, the
    cause be such as to have a necessary connection with its future result, then
    the future is known with scientific certitude, just as the astronomer
    foresees the future eclipse. If, however, the cause be such as to produce a
    certain result more frequently than not, then can the future be known more
    or less conjecturally, according as its cause is more or less inclined to
    produce the effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers that knowledge
    which is drawn from universal causal principles; from these the future may
    be known, according to the order of the effects to the cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Confess. xii [*Gen.
    ad lit. xii. 13]), the soul has a certain power of forecasting, so that by
    its very nature it can know the future; hence when withdrawn from corporeal
    sense, and, as it were, concentrated on itself, it shares in the knowledge
    of the future. Such an opinion would be reasonable if we were to admit that
    the soul receives knowledge by participating the ideas as the Platonists
    maintained, because in that case the soul by its nature would know the
    universal causes of all effects, and would only be impeded in its knowledge
    by the body, and hence when withdrawn from the corporeal senses it would
    know the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since it is connatural to our intellect to know things, not thus, but by
    receiving its knowledge from the senses; it is not natural for the soul to
    know the future when withdrawn from the senses: rather does it know the
    future by the impression of superior spiritual and corporeal causes; of
    spiritual causes, when by Divine power the human intellect is enlightened
    through the ministry of angels, and the phantasms are directed to the
    knowledge of future events; or, by the influence of demons, when the
    imagination is moved regarding the future known to the demons, as explained
    above (<a href="FP057.html#FPQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>,
    <a href="FP057.html#FPQ57A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). The soul is naturally
    more inclined to receive these impressions of spiritual causes when it is
    withdrawn from the senses, as it is then nearer to the spiritual world, and
    freer from external distractions. The same may also come from superior
    corporeal causes. For it is clear that superior bodies influence inferior
    bodies. Hence, in consequence of the sensitive faculties being acts of
    corporeal organs, the influence of the heavenly bodies causes the
    imagination to be affected, and so, as the heavenly bodies cause many future
    events, the imagination receives certain images of some such events. These
    images are perceived more at night and while we sleep than in the daytime
    and while we are awake, because, as stated in De Somn. et Vigil. ii [*De
    Divinat. per somn. ii.], "impressions made by day are evanescent. The night
    air is calmer, when silence reigns, hence bodily impressions are made in
    sleep, when slight internal movements are felt more than in wakefulness, and
    such movements produce in the imagination images from which the future may
    be foreseen."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Brute animals have no power above the
    imagination wherewith to regulate it, as man has his reason, and therefore
    their imagination follows entirely the influence of the heavenly bodies.
    Thus from such animals' movements some future things, such as rain and the
    like, may be known rather from human movements directed by reason. Hence the
    Philosopher says (De Somn. et Vig.), that "some who are most imprudent are
    most far-seeing; for their intelligence is not burdened with cares, but is
    as it were barren and bare of all anxiety moving at the caprice of whatever
    is brought to bear on it."<br />
