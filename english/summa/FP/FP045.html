</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question concerns the mode of the emanation of things from the 
First Principle, and this is called creation, and includes eight points 
of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is creation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether God can create anything?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether creation is anything in the very nature of things?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A4THEP1">(4)</a> To what things it belongs to be created?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it belongs to God alone to create?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether creation is common to the whole Trinity, or proper to any 
one Person?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether any trace of the Trinity is to be found in created things?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the work of creation is mingled with the works of nature and 
of the will?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to create is not to make anything from 
nothing. For Augustine says (Contra Adv. Leg. et Proph. i): "To make 
concerns what did not exist at all; but to create is to make something by 
bringing forth something from what was already."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the nobility of action and of motion is considered from 
their terms. Action is therefore nobler from good to good, and from being 
to being, than from nothing to something. But creation appears to be the 
most noble action, and first among all actions. Therefore it is not from 
nothing to something, but rather from being to being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the preposition "from" [ex] imports relation of some 
cause, and especially of the material cause; as when we say that a statue 
is made from brass. But "nothing" cannot be the matter of being, nor in 
any way its cause. Therefore to create is  not to make something from 
nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> On the text of Gn. 1, "In the beginning God created," 
etc., the gloss has, "To create is to make something from nothing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As said above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), we must consider not only 
the emanation of a particular being from a particular agent, but also the 
emanation of all being from the universal cause, which is God; and this 
emanation we designate by the name of creation. Now what proceeds by 
particular emanation, is not presupposed to that emanation; as when a man 
is generated, he was not before, but man is made from "not-man," and 
white from "not-white." Hence if the emanation of the whole universal 
being from the first principle be considered, it is impossible that any 
being should be presupposed before this emanation. For nothing is the 
same as no being. Therefore as the generation of a man is from the 
"not-being" which is "not-man," so creation, which is the emanation of 
all being, is from the "not-being" which is "nothing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine uses the word creation in an equivocal sense, 
according as to be created signifies improvement in things; as when we 
say that a bishop is created. We do not, however, speak of creation in 
that way here, but as it is described above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Changes receive species and dignity, not from the term 
"wherefrom," but from the term "whereto." Therefore a change is more 
perfect and excellent when the term "whereto" of the change is more noble 
and excellent, although the term "wherefrom," corresponding to the term 
"whereto," may be more imperfect: thus generation is simply nobler and 
more excellent than alteration, because the substantial form is nobler 
than the accidental form; and yet the privation of the substantial form, 
which is the term "wherefrom" in generation, is more imperfect than the 
contrary, which is the term "wherefrom" in alteration. Similarly creation 
is more perfect and excellent than generation and alteration, because the 
term "whereto" is the whole substance of the thing; whereas what is 
understood as the term "wherefrom" is simply not-being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When anything is said to be made from nothing, this 
preposition "from" [ex] does not signify the material cause, but only 
order; as when we say, "from morning comes midday"--i.e. after morning is 
midday. But we must understand that this preposition "from" [ex] can 
comprise the negation implied when I say the word "nothing," or can be 
included in it. If taken in the first sense, then we affirm the order by 
stating the relation between what is now and its previous non-existence. 
But if the negation includes the preposition, then the order is denied, 
and the sense is, "It is made from nothing---i.e. it is not made from 
anything"---as if we were to say, "He speaks of nothing," because he does 
not speak of anything. And this is verified in both ways, when it is 
said, that anything is made from nothing. But in the first way this 
preposition "from" [ex] implies order, as has been said in this reply. In 
the second sense, it imports the material  cause, which is denied.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God can create anything?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot create anything, because, according 
to the Philosopher (Phys. i, text 34), the ancient philosophers 
considered it as a commonly received axiom that "nothing is made from 
nothing." But the power of God does not extend to the contraries of first 
principles; as, for instance, that God could make the whole to be less 
than its part, or that affirmation and negation are both true at the same 
time. Therefore God cannot make anything from nothing, or create.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if to create is to make something from nothing, to be 
created is to be made. But to be made is to be changed. Therefore 
creation is change. But every change occurs in some subject, as appears 
by the definition of movement: for movement is the act of what is in 
potentiality. Therefore it is impossible for anything to be made out of 
nothing by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what has been made must have at some time been becoming. 
But it cannot be said that what is created, at the same time, is becoming 
and has been made, because in permanent things what is becoming, is not, 
and what has been made, already is: and so it would follow that something 
would be, and not be, at the same time. Therefore when anything is made, 
its becoming precedes its having been made. But this is impossible, 
unless there is a subject in which the becoming is sustained. Therefore 
it is impossible that anything should be made from nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, infinite distance cannot be crossed. But infinite 
distance exists between being and nothing. Therefore it does not happen 
that something is made from nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:1">Gn. 1:1</a>): "In the beginning God created 
heaven and earth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Not only is it impossible that anything should be created 
by God, but it is necessary to say that all things were created by God, 
as appears from what has been said (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For when anyone makes 
one thing from another, this latter thing from which he makes is 
presupposed to his action, and is not produced by his action; thus the 
craftsman works from natural things, as wood or brass, which are caused 
not by the action of art, but by the action of nature. So also nature 
itself causes natural things as regards their form, but presupposes 
matter. If therefore God did only act from something presupposed, it 
would follow that the thing presupposed would not be caused by Him. Now 
it has been shown above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), that nothing can be, unless it 
is from God, Who is the universal cause of all being. Hence it is 
necessary to say that God brings things into being from nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Ancient philosophers, as is said above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>),  
considered only the emanation of particular effects from particular 
causes, which necessarily presuppose something in their action; whence 
came their common opinion that "nothing is made from nothing." But this 
has no place in the first emanation from the universal principle of 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Creation is not change, except according to a mode of 
understanding. For change means that the same something should be 
different now from what it was previously. Sometimes, indeed, the same 
actual thing is different now from what it was before, as in motion 
according to quantity, quality and place; but sometimes it is the same 
being only in potentiality, as in substantial change, the subject of 
which is matter. But in creation, by which the whole substance of a thing 
is produced, the same thing can be taken as different now and before only 
according to our way of understanding, so that a thing is understood as 
first not existing at all, and afterwards as existing. But as action and 
passion coincide as to the substance of motion, and differ only according 
to diverse relations (Phys. iii, text 20,21), it must follow that when 
motion is withdrawn, only diverse relations remain in the Creator and in 
the creature. But because the mode of signification follows the mode of 
understanding as was said above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), creation is signified by 
mode of change; and on this account it is said that to create is to make 
something from nothing. And yet "to make" and "to be made" are more 
suitable expressions here than "to change" and "to be changed," because 
"to make" and "to be made" import a relation of cause to the effect, and 
of effect to the cause, and imply change only as a consequence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In things which are made without movement, to become and to 
be already made are simultaneous, whether such making is the term of 
movement, as illumination (for a thing is being illuminated and is 
illuminated at the same time) or whether it is not the term of movement, 
as the word is being made in the mind and is made at the same time. In 
these things what is being made, is; but when we speak of its being made, 
we mean that it is from another, and was not previously. Hence since 
creation is without movement, a thing is being created and is already 
created at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This objection proceeds from a false imagination, as if 
there were an infinite medium between nothing and being; which is plainly 
false. This false imagination comes from creation being taken to signify 
a change existing between two forms.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that creation is not anything in the creature. For 
as creation taken in a passive sense is attributed to the creature, so 
creation taken in an active sense is attributed to the Creator. But 
creation taken actively is not anything in the Creator, because otherwise 
it would follow that in God there would be something temporal. Therefore 
creation taken passively is not  anything in the creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no medium between the Creator and the creature. 
But creation is signified as the medium between them both: since it is 
not the Creator, as it is not eternal; nor is it the creature, because in 
that case it would be necessary for the same reason to suppose another 
creation to create it, and so on to infinity. Therefore creation is not 
anything in the creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if creation is anything besides the created substance, 
it must be an accident belonging to it. But every accident is in a 
subject. Therefore a thing created would be the subject of creation, and 
so the same thing would be the subject and also the term of creation. 
This is impossible, because the subject is before the accident, and 
preserves the accident; while the term is after the action and passion 
whose term it is, and as soon as it exists, action and passion cease. 
Therefore creation itself is not any thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is greater for a thing to be made according to its 
entire substance, than to be made according to its substantial or 
accidental form. But generation taken simply, or relatively, whereby 
anything is made according to the substantial or the accidental form, is 
something in the thing generated. Therefore much more is creation, 
whereby a thing is made according to its whole substance, something in 
the thing created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Creation places something in the thing created according 
to relation only; because what is created, is not made by movement, or by 
change. For what is made by movement or by change is made from something 
pre-existing. And this happens, indeed, in the particular productions of 
some beings, but cannot happen in the production of all being by the 
universal cause of all beings, which is God. Hence God by creation 
produces things without movement. Now when movement is removed from 
action and passion, only relation remains, as was said above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Hence creation in the creature is only a certain relation to the 
Creator as to the principle of its being; even as in passion, which 
implies movement, is implied a relation to the principle of motion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Creation signified actively means the divine action, which 
is God's essence, with a relation to the creature. But in God relation to 
the creature is not a real relation, but only a relation of reason; 
whereas the relation of the creature to God is a real relation, as was 
said above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>) in treating of the divine names.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Because creation is signified as a change, as was said 
above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2), and change is a kind of medium between the mover and 
the moved, therefore also creation is signified as a medium between the 
Creator and the creature. Nevertheless passive creation is in the 
creature, and is a creature. Nor is there need of a further creation in 
its creation; because relations, or their entire nature being referred to 
something, are not referred by any  other relations, but by themselves; 
as was also shown above (<A Href="FP042.html#FPQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="FP042.html#FPQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4), in treating of the equality 
of the Persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The creature is the term of creation as signifying a 
change, but is the subject of creation, taken as a real relation, and is 
prior to it in being, as the subject is to the accident. Nevertheless 
creation has a certain aspect of priority on the part of the object to 
which it is directed, which is the beginning of the creature. Nor is it 
necessary that as long as the creature is it should be created; because 
creation imports a relation of the creature to the Creator, with a 
certain newness or beginning.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether to be created belongs to composite and subsisting things?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to be created does not belong to composite and 
subsisting things. For in the book, De Causis (prop. iv) it is said, "The 
first of creatures is being." But the being of a thing created is not 
subsisting. Therefore creation properly speaking does not belong to 
subsisting and composite things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is created is from nothing. But composite 
things are not from nothing, but are the result of their own component 
parts. Therefore composite things are not created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is presupposed in the second emanation is properly 
produced by the first: as natural generation produces the natural thing, 
which is presupposed in the operation of art. But the thing supposed in 
natural generation is matter. Therefore matter, and not the composite, 
is, properly speaking, that which is created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:1">Gn. 1:1</a>): "In the beginning God created 
heaven and earth." But heaven and earth are subsisting composite things. 
Therefore creation belongs to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To be created is, in a manner, to be made, as was shown 
above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2,3). Now, to be made is directed to the being of 
a thing. Hence to be made and to be created properly belong to whatever 
being belongs; which, indeed, belongs properly to subsisting things, 
whether they are simple things, as in the case of separate substances, or 
composite, as in the case of material substances. For being belongs to 
that which has being---that is, to what subsists in its own being. But 
forms and accidents and the like are called beings, not as if they 
themselves were, but because something is by them; as whiteness is called 
a being, inasmuch as its subject is white by it. Hence, according to the 
Philosopher (Metaph. vii, text 2) accident is more properly said to be 
"of a being" than "a being." Therefore, as accidents and forms and the 
like non-subsisting things are to be said to co-exist rather than to 
exist, so they ought to be called rather "concreated" than "created" 
things; whereas, properly speaking, created things are subsisting beings. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the proposition "the first of created things is being," 
the word "being" does not refer to the subject of creation, but to the 
proper concept of the object of creation. For a created thing is called 
created because it is a being, not because it is "this" being, since 
creation is the emanation of all being from the Universal Being, as was 
said above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). We use a similar way of speaking when we say that "the 
first visible thing is color," although, strictly speaking, the thing 
colored is what is seen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Creation does not mean the building up of a composite thing 
from pre-existing principles; but it means that the "composite" is 
created so that it is brought into being at the same time with all its 
principles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This reason does not prove that matter alone is created, 
but that matter does not exist except by creation; for creation is the 
production of the whole being, and not only matter.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it does not belong to God alone to create, 
because, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, text 34), what is 
perfect can make its own likeness. But immaterial creatures are more 
perfect than material creatures, which nevertheless can make their own 
likeness, for fire generates fire, and man begets man. Therefore an 
immaterial substance can make a substance like to itself. But immaterial 
substance can be made only by creation, since it has no matter from which 
to be made. Therefore a creature can create.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater the resistance is on the part of the thing 
made, so much the greater power is required in the maker. But a 
"contrary" resists more than "nothing." Therefore it requires more power 
to make (something) from its contrary, which nevertheless a creature can 
do, than to make a thing from nothing. Much more therefore can a creature 
do this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the power of the maker is considered according to the 
measure of what is made. But created being is finite, as we proved above 
when treating of the infinity of God (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,4). Therefore only a 
finite power is needed to produce a creature by creation. But to have a 
finite power is not contrary to the nature of a creature. Therefore it is 
not impossible for a creature to create.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 8) that neither good nor 
bad angels can create anything. Much less therefore can any other 
creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It sufficiently appears at the first glance, according to 
what precedes (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that to create can be the action  of God alone. For 
the more universal effects must be reduced to the more universal and 
prior causes. Now among all effects the most universal is being itself: 
and hence it must be the proper effect of the first and most universal 
cause, and that is God. Hence also it is said (De Causis prop., iii) that 
"neither intelligence nor the soul gives us being, except inasmuch as it 
works by divine operation." Now to produce being absolutely, not as this 
or that being, belongs to creation. Hence it is manifest that creation is 
the proper act of God alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It happens, however, that something participates the proper action of 
another, not by its own power, but instrumentally, inasmuch as it acts by 
the power of another; as air can heat and ignite by the power of fire. 
And so some have supposed that although creation is the proper act of the 
universal cause, still some inferior cause acting by the power of the 
first cause, can create. And thus Avicenna asserted that the first 
separate substance created by God created another after itself, and the 
substance of the world and its soul; and that the substance of the world 
creates the matter of inferior bodies. And in the same manner the Master 
says (Sent. iv, D, 5) that God can communicate to a creature the power of 
creating, so that the latter can create ministerially, not by its own 
power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But such a thing cannot be, because the secondary instrumental cause 
does not participate the action of the superior cause, except inasmuch as 
by something proper to itself it acts dispositively to the effect of the 
principal agent. If therefore it effects nothing, according to what is 
proper to itself, it is used to no purpose; nor would there be any need 
of certain instruments for certain actions. Thus we see that a saw, in 
cutting wood, which it does by the property of its own form, produces the 
form of a bench, which is the proper effect of the principal agent. Now 
the proper effect of God creating is what is presupposed to all other 
effects, and that is absolute being. Hence nothing else can act 
dispositively and instrumentally to this effect, since creation is not 
from anything presupposed, which can be disposed by the action of the 
instrumental agent. So therefore it is impossible for any creature to 
create, either by its own power or instrumentally---that is, 
ministerially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And above all it is absurd to suppose that a body can create, for no 
body acts except by touching or moving; and thus it requires in its 
action some pre-existing thing, which can be touched or moved, which is 
contrary to the very idea of creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A perfect thing participating any nature, makes a likeness 
to itself, not by absolutely producing that nature, but by applying it to 
something else. For an individual man cannot be the cause of human nature 
absolutely, because he would then be the cause of himself; but he is the 
cause of human nature being in the man begotten; and thus he presupposes 
in his action a determinate matter whereby he is an individual man. But 
as an individual man participates human nature, so every created being 
participates, so  to speak, the nature of being; for God alone is His own 
being, as we have said above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore no created being 
can produce a being absolutely, except forasmuch as it causes "being" in 
"this": and so it is necessary to presuppose that whereby a thing is this 
thing, before the action whereby it makes its own likeness. But in an 
immaterial substance it is not possible to presuppose anything whereby it 
is this thing; because it is what it is by its form, whereby it has 
being, since it is a subsisting form. Therefore an immaterial substance 
cannot produce another immaterial substance like to itself as regards its 
being, but only as regards some added perfection; as we may say that a 
superior angel illuminates an inferior, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 
iv, x). In this way even in heaven there is paternity, as the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++3:15">Eph. 3:15</a>): "From whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is 
named." From which evidently appears that no created being can cause 
anything, unless something is presupposed; which is against the very idea 
of creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A thing is made from its contrary indirectly (Phys. i, text 
43), but directly from the subject which is in potentiality. And so the 
contrary resists the agent, inasmuch as it impedes the potentiality from 
the act which the agent intends to induce, as fire intends to reduce the 
matter of water to an act like to itself, but is impeded by the form and 
contrary dispositions, whereby the potentiality (of the water) is 
restrained from being reduced to act; and the more the potentiality is 
restrained, the more power is required in the agent to reduce the matter 
to act. Hence a much greater power is required in the agent when no 
potentiality pre-exists. Thus therefore it appears that it is an act of 
much greater power to make a thing from nothing, than from its contrary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of the maker is reckoned not only from the 
substance of the thing made, but also from the mode of its being made; 
for a greater heat heats not only more, but quicker. Therefore although 
to create a finite effect does not show an infinite power, yet to create 
it from nothing does show an infinite power: which appears from what has 
been said (ad 2). For if a greater power is required in the agent in 
proportion to the distance of the potentiality from the act, it follows 
that the power of that which produces something from no presupposed 
potentiality is infinite, because there is no proportion between "no 
potentiality" and the potentiality presupposed by the power of a natural 
agent, as there is no proportion between "not being" and "being." And 
because no creature has simply an infinite power, any more than it has an 
infinite being, as was proved above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that no 
creature can create.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to create is proper to some Person. For what 
comes first is the cause of what is after; and what is perfect is the 
cause of what is imperfect. But the procession of  the divine Person is 
prior to the procession of the creature: and is more perfect, because the 
divine Person proceeds in perfect similitude of its principle; whereas 
the creature proceeds in imperfect similitude. Therefore the processions 
of the divine Persons are the cause of the processions of things, and so 
to create belongs to a Person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the divine Persons are distinguished from each other 
only by their processions and relations. Therefore whatever difference is 
attributed to the divine Persons belongs to them according to the 
processions and relations of the Persons. But the causation of creatures 
is diversely attributed to the divine Persons; for in the Creed, to the 
Father is attributed that "He is the Creator of all things visible and 
invisible"; to the Son is attributed that by Him "all things were made"; 
and to the Holy Ghost is attributed that He is "Lord and Life-giver." 
Therefore the causation of creatures belongs to the Persons according to 
processions and relations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it be said that the causation of the creature flows 
from some essential attribute appropriated to some one Person, this does 
not appear to be sufficient; because every divine effect is caused by 
every essential attribute---viz. by power, goodness and wisdom---and thus 
does not belong to one more than to another. Therefore any determinate 
mode of causation ought not to be attributed to one Person more than to 
another, unless they are distinguished in creating according to relations 
and processions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii) that all things caused 
are the common work of the whole Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To create is, properly speaking, to cause or produce the 
being of things. And as every agent produces its like, the principle of 
action can be considered from the effect of the action; for it must be 
fire that generates fire. And therefore to create belongs to God 
according to His being, that is, His essence, which is common to the 
three Persons. Hence to create is not proper to any one Person, but is 
common to the whole Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless the divine Persons, according to the nature of their 
procession, have a causality respecting the creation of things. For as 
was said above (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), when treating of the knowledge 
and will of God, God is the cause of things by His intellect and will, 
just as the craftsman is cause of the things made by his craft. Now the 
craftsman works through the word conceived in his mind, and through the 
love of his will regarding some object. Hence also God the Father made 
the creature through His Word, which is His Son; and through His Love, 
which is the Holy Ghost. And so the processions of the Persons are the 
type of the productions of creatures inasmuch as they include the 
essential attributes, knowledge and will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The processions of the divine Persons are the  cause of 
creation, as above explained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the divine nature, although common to the three Persons, 
still belongs to them in a kind of order, inasmuch as the Son receives 
the divine nature from the Father, and the Holy Ghost from both: so also 
likewise the power of creation, whilst common to the three Persons, 
belongs to them in a kind of order. For the Son receives it from the 
Father, and the Holy Ghost from both. Hence to be the Creator is 
attributed to the Father as to Him Who does not receive the power of 
creation from another. And of the Son it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:3">Jn. 1:3</a>), "Through Him 
all things were made," inasmuch as He has the same power, but from 
another; for this preposition "through" usually denotes a mediate cause, 
or "a principle from a principle." But to the Holy Ghost, Who has the 
same power from both, is attributed that by His sway He governs, and 
quickens what is created by the Father through the Son. Again, the reason 
for this particular appropriation may be taken from the common notion of 
the appropriation of the essential attributes. For, as above stated 
(<A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="FP039.html#FPQ39A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 3), to the Father is appropriated power which is chiefly 
shown in creation, and therefore it is attributed to Him to be the 
Creator. To the Son is appropriated wisdom, through which the 
intellectual agent acts; and therefore it is said: "Through Whom all 
things were made." And to the Holy Ghost is appropriated goodness, to 
which belong both government, which brings things to their proper end, 
and the giving of life---for life consists in a certain interior 
movement; and the first mover is the end, and goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although every effect of God proceeds from each attribute, 
each effect is reduced to that attribute with which it is naturally 
connected; thus the order of things is reduced to "wisdom," and the 
justification of the sinner to "mercy" and "goodness" poured out 
super-abundantly. But creation, which is the production of the very 
substance of a thing, is reduced to "power."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in creatures is necessarily found a trace of the Trinity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in creatures there is not necessarily found a 
trace of the Trinity. For anything can be traced through its traces. But 
the trinity of persons cannot be traced from the creatures, as was above 
stated (<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore there is no trace of the Trinity in 
creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is in creatures is created. Therefore if the 
trace of the Trinity is found in creatures according to some of their 
properties, and if everything created has a trace of the Trinity, it 
follows that we can find a trace of the Trinity in each of these 
(properties): and so on to infinitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the effect represents only its own cause. But the 
causality of creatures belongs to the common nature, and not to the 
relations whereby the Persons are distinguished and numbered. Therefore 
in the creature is to be found a trace not of the Trinity  but of the 
unity of essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 10), that "the trace of 
the Trinity appears in creatures."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every effect in some degree represents its cause, but 
diversely. For some effects represent only the causality of the cause, 
but not its form; as smoke represents fire. Such a representation is 
called a "trace": for a trace shows that someone has passed by but not 
who it is. Other effects represent the cause as regards the similitude of 
its form, as fire generated represents fire generating; and a statue of 
Mercury represents Mercury; and this is called the representation of 
"image." Now the processions of the divine Persons are referred to the 
acts of intellect and will, as was said above (<A Href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>). For the Son 
proceeds as the word of the intellect; and the Holy Ghost proceeds as 
love of the will. Therefore in rational creatures, possessing intellect 
and will, there is found the representation of the Trinity by way of 
image, inasmuch as there is found in them the word conceived, and the 
love proceeding.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in all creatures there is found the trace of the Trinity, inasmuch 
as in every creature are found some things which are necessarily reduced 
to the divine Persons as to their cause. For every creature subsists in 
its own being, and has a form, whereby it is determined to a species, and 
has relation to something else. Therefore as it is a created substance, 
it represents the cause and principle; and so in that manner it shows the 
Person of the Father, Who is the "principle from no principle." According 
as it has a form and species, it represents the Word as the form of the 
thing made by art is from the conception of the craftsman. According as 
it has relation of order, it represents the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He is 
love, because the order of the effect to something else is from the will 
of the Creator. And therefore Augustine says (De Trin. vi 10) that the 
trace of the Trinity is found in every creature, according "as it is one 
individual," and according "as it is formed by a species," and according 
as it "has a certain relation of order." And to these also are reduced 
those three, "number," "weight," and "measure," mentioned in the Book of 
Wisdom (9:21). For "measure" refers to the substance of the thing limited 
by its principles, "number" refers to the species, "weight" refers to the 
order. And to these three are reduced the other three mentioned by 
Augustine (De Nat. Boni iii), "mode," "species," and "order," and also 
those he mentions (Questions. 83, qu. 18): "that which exists; whereby it is 
distinguished; whereby it agrees." For a thing exists by its substance, 
is distinct by its form, and agrees by its order. Other similar 
expressions may be easily reduced to the above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The representation of the trace is to be referred to the 
appropriations: in which manner we are able to arrive at a knowledge of 
the trinity of the divine persons from creatures, as we have said (<A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FP032.html#FPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A creature properly speaking is a thing self-subsisting; 
and in such are the three above-mentioned things to be found. Nor is it 
necessary that these three things should be found in all that exists in 
the creature; but only to a subsisting being is the trace ascribed in 
regard to those three things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The processions of the persons are also in some way the 
cause and type of creation; as appears from the above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether creation is mingled with works of nature and art?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that creation is mingled in works of nature and 
art. For in every operation of nature and art some form is produced. But 
it is not produced from anything, since matter has no part in it. 
Therefore it is produced from nothing; and thus in every operation of 
nature and art there is creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the effect is not more powerful than its cause. But in 
natural things the only agent is the accidental form, which is an active 
or a passive form. Therefore the substantial form is not produced by the 
operation of nature; and therefore it must be produced by creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in nature like begets like. But some things are found 
generated in nature by a thing unlike to them; as is evident in animals 
generated through putrefaction. Therefore the form of these is not from 
nature, but by creation; and the same reason applies to other things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is not created, is not a creature. If therefore in 
nature's productions there were not creation, it would follow that 
nature's productions are not creatures; which is heretical.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Super Gen. v, 6,14,15) distinguishes the 
work of propagation, which is a work of nature, from the work of creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The doubt on this subject arises from the forms which, 
some said, do not come into existence by the action of nature, but 
previously exist in matter; for they asserted that forms are latent. This 
arose from ignorance concerning matter, and from not knowing how to 
distinguish between potentiality and act. For because forms pre-exist in 
matter, "in potentiality," they asserted that they pre-exist "simply." 
Others, however, said that the forms were given or caused by a separate 
agent by way of creation; and accordingly, that to each operation of 
nature is joined creation. But this opinion arose from ignorance 
concerning form. For they failed to consider that the form of the natural 
body is not subsisting, but is that by which a thing is. And therefore, 
since to be made and to be created belong properly to a subsisting thing 
alone, as shown above (<A Href="FP045.html#FPQ45A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it does not belong to forms to be made or 
to be created, but to be "concreated." What, indeed, is  properly made by 
the natural agent is the "composite," which is made from matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence in the works of nature creation does not enter, but is presupposed 
to the work of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Forms begin to be actual when the composite things are 
made, not as though they were made "directly," but only "indirectly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The active qualities in nature act by virtue of substantial 
forms: and therefore the natural agent not only produces its like 
according to quality, but according to species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> For the generation of imperfect animals, a universal agent 
suffices, and this is to be found in the celestial power to which they 
are assimilated, not in species, but according to a kind of analogy. Nor 
is it necessary to say that their forms are created by a separate agent. 
However, for the generation of perfect animals the universal agent does 
not suffice, but a proper agent is required, in the shape of a univocal 
generator.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[45] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The operation of nature takes place only on the 
presupposition of created principles; and thus the products of nature are 
called creatures.<br>
