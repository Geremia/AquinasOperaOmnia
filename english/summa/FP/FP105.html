</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now consider the second effect of the Divine government, i.e. the 
change of creatures; and first, the change of creatures by God; secondly, 
the change of one creature by another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether God can move immediately the matter to the form?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He can immediately move a body?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot move the matter immediately to 
receive the form. For as the Philosopher proves (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 
8), nothing can bring a form into any particular matter, except that form 
which is in matter; because, like begets like. But God is not a form in 
matter. Therefore He cannot cause a form in matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, any agent inclined to several effects will produce none 
of them, unless it is determined to a particular one by some other cause; 
for, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 11), a general assertion does 
not move the mind, except by means of some particular apprehension. But 
the Divine power is the universal cause of all things. Therefore it 
cannot produce any particular form, except by means of a particular agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> As universal being depends on the first universal cause, so 
determinate being depends on determinate particular causes; as we have 
seen above (<A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104OUTP1">Question [104]</a>, <A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the determinate being  of a particular 
thing is from its own form. Therefore the forms of things are produced by 
God, only by means of particular causes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A7">Gn. 2:7</a>): "God formed man of the slime 
of the earth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God can move matter immediately to form; because whatever 
is in passive potentiality can be reduced to act by the active power 
which extends over that potentiality. Therefore, since the Divine power 
extends over matter, as produced by God, it can be reduced to act by the 
Divine power: and this is what is meant by matter being moved to a form; 
for a form is nothing else but the act of matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> An effect is assimilated to the active cause in two ways. 
First, according to the same species; as man is generated by man, and 
fire by fire. Secondly, by being virtually contained in the cause; as the 
form of the effect is virtually contained in its cause: thus animals 
produced by putrefaction, and plants, and minerals are like the sun and 
stars, by whose power they are produced. In this way the effect is like 
its active cause as regards all that over which the power of that cause 
extends. Now the power of God extends to both matter and form; as we have 
said above (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); wherefore if a composite thing be 
produced, it is likened to God by way of a virtual inclusion; or it is 
likened to the composite generator by a likeness of species. Therefore 
just as the composite generator can move matter to a form by generating a 
composite thing like itself; so also can God. But no other form not 
existing in matter can do this; because the power of no other separate 
substance extends over matter. Hence angels and demons operate on visible 
matter; not by imprinting forms in matter, but by making use of corporeal 
seeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument would hold if God were to act of natural 
necessity. But since He acts by His will and intellect, which knows the 
particular and not only the universal natures of all forms, it follows 
that He can determinately imprint this or that form on matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact that secondary causes are ordered to determinate 
effects is due to God; wherefore since God ordains other causes to 
certain effects He can also produce certain effects by Himself without 
any other cause.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot move a body immediately. For as the 
mover and the moved must exist simultaneously, as the Philosopher says 
(Phys. vii, 2), it follows that there must be some contact between the 
mover and moved. But there can be no contact between God and a body; for 
Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 1): "There is no contact with God." Therefore 
God cannot move a body immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God is the mover unmoved. But such also is the desirable 
object when apprehended. Therefore God moves as the object of desire and 
apprehension. But He cannot be apprehended except by the intellect, which 
is neither a body nor a corporeal power. Therefore God cannot move a body 
immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 10) that an infinite 
power moves instantaneously. But it is impossible for a body to be moved 
in one instant; for since every movement is between opposites, it follows 
that two opposites would exist at once in the same subject, which is 
impossible. Therefore a body cannot be moved immediately by an infinite 
power. But God's power is infinite, as we have explained (<A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FP025.html#FPQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore God cannot move a body immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> God produced the works of the six days immediately 
among which is included the movements of bodies, as is clear from Gn. 1:9 
"Let the waters be gathered together into one place." Therefore God alone 
can move a body immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is erroneous to say that God cannot Himself produce 
all the determinate effects which are produced by any created cause. 
Wherefore, since bodies are moved immediately by created causes, we 
cannot possibly doubt that God can move immediately any bodies whatever. 
This indeed follows from what is above stated (<A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For every movement 
of any body whatever, either results from a form, as the movements of 
things heavy and light result from the form which they have from their 
generating cause, for which reason the generator is called the mover; or 
else tends to a form, as heating tends to the form of heat. Now it 
belongs to the same cause, to imprint a form, to dispose to that form, 
and to give the movement which results from that form; for fire not only 
generates fire, but it also heats and moves things upwards. Therefore, as 
God can imprint form immediately in matter, it follows that He can move 
any body whatever in respect of any movement whatever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There are two kinds of contact; corporeal contact, when two 
bodies touch each other; and virtual contact, as the cause of sadness is 
said to touch the one made sad. According to the first kind of contact, 
God, as being incorporeal, neither touches, nor is touched; but according 
to virtual contact He touches creatures by moving them; but He is not 
touched, because the natural power of no creature can reach up to Him. 
Thus did Dionysius understand the words, "There is no contact with God"; 
that is, so that God Himself be touched.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God moves as the object of desire and apprehension; but it 
does not follow that He always moves as being desired and apprehended by 
that which is moved; but as being desired and known by Himself; for He 
does all things for His own goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher (Phys. viii, 10) intends to prove  that the 
power of the first mover is not a power of the first mover "of bulk," by 
the following argument. The power of the first mover is infinite (which 
he proves from the fact that the first mover can move in infinite time). 
Now an infinite power, if it were a power "of bulk," would move without 
time, which is impossible; therefore the infinite power of the first 
mover must be in something which is not measured by its bulk. Whence it 
is clear that for a body to be moved without time can only be the result 
of an infinite power. The reason is that every power of bulk moves in its 
entirety; since it moves by the necessity of its nature. But an infinite 
power surpasses out of all proportion any finite power. Now the greater 
the power of the mover, the greater is the velocity of the movement. 
Therefore, since a finite power moves in a determinate time, it follows 
that an infinite power does not move in any time; for between one time 
and any other time there is some proportion. On the other hand, a power 
which is not in bulk is the power of an intelligent being, which operates 
in its effects according to what is fitting to them; and therefore, since 
it cannot be fitting for a body to be moved without time, it does not 
follow that it moves without time.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God does not immediately move the created 
intellect. For the action of the intellect is governed by its own 
subject; since it does not pass into external matter; as stated in 
Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8. But the action of what is moved by another does 
not proceed from that wherein it is; but from the mover. Therefore the 
intellect is not moved by another; and so apparently God cannot move the 
created intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, anything which in itself is a sufficient principle of 
movement, is not moved by another. But the movement of the intellect is 
its act of understanding; in the sense in which we say that to understand 
or to feel is a kind of movement, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 
7). But the intellectual light which is natural to the soul, is a 
sufficient principle of understanding. Therefore it is not moved by 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the senses are moved by the sensible, so the 
intellect is moved by the intelligible. But God is not intelligible to 
us, and exceeds the capacity of our intellect. Therefore God cannot move 
our intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The teacher moves the intellect of the one taught. But 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++93%3A10">Ps. 93:10</a>) that God "teaches man knowledge." Therefore God 
moves the human intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As in corporeal movement that is called the mover which 
gives the form that is the principle of movement, so that is said to move 
the intellect, which is the cause of the form that is the principle of 
the intellectual operation, called the movement of the intellect. Now 
there is a twofold principle of  intellectual operation in the 
intelligent being; one which is the intellectual power itself, which 
principle exists in the one who understands in potentiality; while the 
other is the principle of actual understanding, namely, the likeness of 
the thing understood in the one who understands. So a thing is said to 
move the intellect, whether it gives to him who understands the power of 
understanding; or impresses on him the likeness of the thing understood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now God moves the created intellect in both ways. For He is the First 
immaterial Being; and as intellectuality is a result of immateriality, it 
follows that He is the First intelligent Being. Therefore since in each 
order the first is the cause of all that follows, we must conclude that 
from Him proceeds all intellectual power. In like manner, since He is the 
First Being, and all other beings pre-exist in Him as in their First 
Cause, it follows that they exist intelligibly in Him, after the mode of 
His own Nature. For as the intelligible types of everything exist first 
of all in God, and are derived from Him by other intellects in order that 
these may actually understand; so also are they derived by creatures that 
they may subsist. Therefore God so moves the created intellect, inasmuch 
as He gives it the intellectual power, whether natural, or superadded; 
and impresses on the created intellect the intelligible species, and 
maintains and preserves both power and species in existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellectual operation is performed by the intellect in 
which it exists, as by a secondary cause; but it proceeds from God as 
from its first cause. For by Him the power to understand is given to the 
one who understands.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The intellectual light together with the likeness of the 
thing understood is a sufficient principle of understanding; but it is a 
secondary principle, and depends upon the First Principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intelligible object moves our human intellect, so far 
as, in a way, it impresses on it its own likeness, by means of which the 
intellect is able to understand it. But the likenesses which God 
impresses on the created intellect are not sufficient to enable the 
created intellect to understand Him through His Essence, as we have seen 
above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP056.html#FPQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>, <A Href="FP056.html#FPQ56A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence He moves the created intellect, 
and yet He cannot be intelligible to it, as we have explained (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot move the created will. For whatever 
is moved from without, is forced. But the will cannot be forced. 
Therefore it is not moved from without; and therefore cannot be moved by 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God cannot make two contradictories to be true  at the 
same time. But this would follow if He moved the will; for to be 
voluntarily moved means to be moved from within, and not by another. 
Therefore God cannot move the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, movement is attributed to the mover rather than to the 
one moved; wherefore homicide is not ascribed to the stone, but to the 
thrower. Therefore, if God moves the will, it follows that voluntary 
actions are not imputed to man for reward or blame. But this is false. 
Therefore God does not move the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A13">Phil. 2:13</a>): "It is God who worketh in 
us [Vulgate---'you'] both to will and to accomplish."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the intellect is moved by the object and by the Giver 
of the power of intelligence, as stated above (<A Href="FP105.html#FPQ105A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), so is the will 
moved by its object, which is good, and by Him who creates the power of 
willing. Now the will can be moved by good as its object, but by God 
alone sufficiently and efficaciously. For nothing can move a movable 
thing sufficiently unless the active power of the mover surpasses or at 
least equals the potentiality of the thing movable. Now the potentiality 
of the will extends to the universal good; for its object is the 
universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal 
being. But every created good is some particular good; God alone is the 
universal good. Whereas He alone fills the capacity of the will, and 
moves it sufficiently as its object. In like manner the power of willing 
is caused by God alone. For to will is nothing but to be inclined towards 
the object of the will, which is universal good. But to incline towards 
the universal good belongs to the First Mover, to Whom the ultimate end 
is proportionate; just as in human affairs to him that presides over the 
community belongs the directing of his subjects to the common weal. 
Wherefore in both ways it belongs to God to move the will; but especially 
in the second way by an interior inclination of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A thing moved by another is forced if moved against its 
natural inclination; but if it is moved by another giving to it the 
proper natural inclination, it is not forced; as when a heavy body is 
made to move downwards by that which produced it, then it is not forced. 
In like manner God, while moving the will, does not force it, because He 
gives the will its own natural inclination.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To be moved voluntarily, is to be moved from within, that 
is, by an interior principle: yet this interior principle may be caused 
by an exterior principle; and so to be moved from within is not repugnant 
to being moved by another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the will were so moved by another as in no way to be 
moved from within itself, the act of the will would not be imputed for 
reward or blame. But since its being moved by another does not prevent 
its being moved from within itself, as we have stated (ad 2), it does not 
thereby forfeit the motive for merit or demerit.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God works in every agent?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God does not work in every agent. For we must 
not attribute any insufficiency to God. If therefore God works in every 
agent, He works sufficiently in each one. Hence it would be superfluous 
for the created agent to work at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same work cannot proceed at the same time from two 
sources; as neither can one and the same movement belong to two movable 
things. Therefore if the creature's operation is from God operating in 
the creature, it cannot at the same time proceed from the creature; and 
so no creature works at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the maker is the cause of the operation of the thing 
made, as giving it the form whereby it operates. Therefore, if God is the 
cause of the operation of things made by Him, this would be inasmuch as 
He gives them the power of operating. But this is in the beginning, when 
He makes them. Thus it seems that God does not operate any further in the 
operating creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++26%3A12">Is. 26:12</a>): "Lord, Thou hast wrought all 
our works in [Vulg.: 'for'] us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have understood God to work in every agent in such a 
way that no created power has any effect in things, but that God alone is 
the ultimate cause of everything wrought; for instance, that it is not 
fire that gives heat, but God in the fire, and so forth. But this is 
impossible. First, because the order of cause and effect would be taken 
away from created things: and this would imply lack of power in the 
Creator: for it is due to the power of the cause, that it bestows active 
power on its effect. Secondly, because the active powers which are seen 
to exist in things, would be bestowed on things to no purpose, if these 
wrought nothing through them. Indeed, all things created would seem, in a 
way, to be purposeless, if they lacked an operation proper to them; since 
the purpose of everything is its operation. For the less perfect is 
always for the sake of the more perfect: and consequently as the matter 
is for the sake of the form, so the form which is the first act, is for 
the sake of its operation, which is the second act; and thus operation is 
the end of the creature. We must therefore understand that God works in 
things in such a manner that things have their proper operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make this clear, we must observe that as there are few kinds 
of causes; matter is not a principle of action, but is the subject that 
receives the effect of action. On the other hand, the end, the agent, and 
the form are principles of action, but in a certain order. For the first 
principle of action is the end which moves the agent; the second is the 
agent; the third is the form of that which the agent applies to action 
(although the agent also acts through its own form); as may be clearly 
seen in things made by art. For the craftsman is moved to action by the 
end, which is the thing wrought, for instance a chest or a bed; and 
applies to  action the axe which cuts through its being sharp.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus then does God work in every worker, according to these three 
things. First as an end. For since every operation is for the sake of 
some good, real or apparent; and nothing is good either really or 
apparently, except in as far as it participates in a likeness to the 
Supreme Good, which is God; it follows that God Himself is the cause of 
every operation as its end. Again it is to be observed that where there 
are several agents in order, the second always acts in virtue of the 
first; for the first agent moves the second to act. And thus all agents 
act in virtue of God Himself: and therefore He is the cause of action in 
every agent. Thirdly, we must observe that God not only moves things to 
operated, as it were applying their forms and powers to operation, just 
as the workman applies the axe to cut, who nevertheless at times does not 
give the axe its form; but He also gives created agents their forms and 
preserves them in being. Therefore He is the cause of action not only by 
giving the form which is the principle of action, as the generator is 
said to be the cause of movement in things heavy and light; but also as 
preserving the forms and powers of things; just as the sun is said to be 
the cause of the manifestation of colors, inasmuch as it gives and 
preserves the light by which colors are made manifest. And since the form 
of a thing is within the thing, and all the more, as it approaches nearer 
to the First and Universal Cause; and because in all things God Himself 
is properly the cause of universal being which is innermost in all 
things; it follows that in all things God works intimately. For this 
reason in Holy Scripture the operations of nature are attributed to God 
as operating in nature, according to Job 10:11: "Thou hast clothed me 
with skin and flesh: Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God works sufficiently in things as First Agent, but it 
does not follow from this that the operation of secondary agents is 
superfluous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One action does not proceed from two agents of the same 
order. But nothing hinders the same action from proceeding from a primary 
and a secondary agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God not only gives things their form, but He also preserves 
them in existence, and applies them to act, and is moreover the end of 
every action, as above explained.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God can do anything outside the established order of nature?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot do anything outside the established 
order of nature. For Augustine (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3) says: "God the 
Maker and Creator of each nature, does nothing against nature." But that 
which is outside the natural order seems to be against nature. Therefore 
God can do nothing outside the natural order. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the order of justice is from God, so is the order of 
nature. But God cannot do anything outside the order of justice; for then 
He would do something unjust. Therefore He cannot do anything outside the 
order of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God established the order of nature. Therefore it God 
does anything outside the order of nature, it would seem that He is 
changeable; which cannot be said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "God sometimes 
does things which are contrary to the ordinary course of nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> From each cause there results a certain order to its 
effects, since every cause is a principle; and so, according to the 
multiplicity of causes, there results a multiplicity of orders, subjected 
one to the other, as cause is subjected to cause. Wherefore a higher 
cause is not subjected to a cause of a lower order; but conversely. An 
example of this may be seen in human affairs. On the father of a family 
depends the order of the household; which order is contained in the order 
of the city; which order again depends on the ruler of the city; while 
this last order depends on that of the king, by whom the whole kingdom is 
ordered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If therefore we consider the order of things depending on the first 
cause, God cannot do anything against this order; for, if He did so, He 
would act against His foreknowledge, or His will, or His goodness. But if 
we consider the order of things depending on any secondary cause, thus 
God can do something outside such order; for He is not subject to the 
order of secondary causes; but, on the contrary, this order is subject to 
Him, as proceeding from Him, not by a natural necessity, but by the 
choice of His own will; for He could have created another order of 
things. Wherefore God can do something outside this order created by Him, 
when He chooses, for instance by producing the effects of secondary 
causes without them, or by producing certain effects to which secondary 
causes do not extend. So Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "God 
acts against the wonted course of nature, but by no means does He act 
against the supreme law; because He does not act against Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In natural things something may happen outside this natural 
order, in two ways. It may happen by the action of an agent which did not 
give them their natural inclination; as, for example, when a man moves a 
heavy body upwards, which does not owe to him its natural inclination to 
move downwards; and that would be against nature. It may also happen by 
the action of the agent on whom the natural inclination depends; and this 
is not against nature, as is clear in the ebb and flow of the tide, which 
is not against nature; although it is against the natural movement of 
water in a downward direction; for it is owing to the influence of a 
heavenly body, on which the natural inclination of lower bodies depends. 
Therefore since the order of nature is given to things by God; if He does 
anything outside this order, it is not against  nature. Wherefore 
Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "That is natural to each thing 
which is caused by Him from Whom is all mode, number, and order in 
nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The order of justice arises by relation to the First Cause, 
Who is the rule of all justice; and therefore God can do nothing against 
such order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God fixed a certain order in things in such a way that at 
the same time He reserved to Himself whatever he intended to do otherwise 
than by a particular cause. So when He acts outside this order, He does 
not change.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether whatever God does outside the natural order is miraculous?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not everything which God does outside the 
natural order of things, is miraculous. For the creation of the world, 
and of souls, and the justification of the unrighteous, are done by God 
outside the natural order; as not being accomplished by the action of any 
natural cause. Yet these things are not called miracles. Therefore not 
everything that God does outside the natural order is a miracle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a miracle is "something difficult, which seldom occurs, 
surpassing the faculty of nature, and going so far beyond our hopes as to 
compel our astonishment" [*St. Augustine, De utilitate credendi xvi.]. 
But some things outside the order of nature are not arduous; for they 
occur in small things, such as the recovery and healing of the sick. Nor 
are they of rare occurrence, since they happen frequently; as when the 
sick were placed in the streets, to be healed by the shadow of Peter 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+5%3A15">Acts 5:15</a>). Nor do they surpass the faculty of nature; as when people 
are cured of a fever. Nor are they beyond our hopes, since we all hope 
for the resurrection of the dead, which nevertheless will be outside the 
course of nature. Therefore not all things are outside the course of 
natur are miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the word miracle is derived from admiration. Now 
admiration concerns things manifest to the senses. But sometimes things 
happen outside the order of nature, which are not manifest to the senses; 
as when the Apostles were endowed with knowledge without studying or 
being taught. Therefore not everything that occurs outside the order of 
nature is miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): "Where God does 
anything against that order of nature which we know and are accustomed to 
observe, we call it a miracle."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The word miracle is derived from admiration, which arises 
when an effect is manifest, whereas its cause is hidden; as when a man 
sees an eclipse without knowing its cause, as the Philosopher says in the 
beginning of his Metaphysics. Now the cause of a manifest effect may be 
known to one, but unknown to  others. Wherefore a thing is wonderful to 
one man, and not at all to others: as an eclipse is to a rustic, but not 
to an astronomer. Now a miracle is so called as being full of wonder; as 
having a cause absolutely hidden from all: and this cause is God. 
Wherefore those things which God does outside those causes which we know, 
are called miracles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Creation, and the justification of the unrighteous, though 
done by God alone, are not, properly speaking, miracles, because they are 
not of a nature to proceed from any other cause; so they do not occur 
outside the order of nature, since they do not belong to that order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An arduous thing is called a miracle, not on account of the 
excellence of the thing wherein it is done, but because it surpasses the 
faculty of nature: likewise a thing is called unusual, not because it 
does not often happen, but because it is outside the usual natural course 
of things. Furthermore, a thing is said to be above the faculty of 
nature, not only by reason of the substance of the thing done, but also 
on account of the manner and order in which it is done. Again, a miracle 
is said to go beyond the hope "of nature," not above the hope "of grace," 
which hope comes from faith, whereby we believe in the future 
resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The knowledge of the Apostles, although not manifest in 
itself, yet was made manifest in its effect, from which it was shown to 
be wonderful.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one miracle is greater than another?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one miracle is not greater than another. For 
Augustine says (Epist. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "In miraculous deeds, the 
whole measure of the deed is the power of the doer." But by the same 
power of God all miracles are done. Therefore one miracle is not greater 
than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the power of God is infinite. But the infinite exceeds 
the finite beyond all proportion; and therefore no more reason exists to 
wonder at one effect thereof than at another. Therefore one miracle is 
not greater than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Lord says, speaking of miraculous works (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14%3A12">Jn. 14:12</a>): "The works that I do, he also shall do, and greater than these 
shall he do."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing is called a miracle by comparison with the Divine 
Power; because no action is of any account compared with the power of 
God, according to Is. 40:15: "Behold the Gentiles are as a drop from a 
bucket, and are counted as the smallest grain of a balance." But a thing 
is called a miracle by comparison with the power of nature which it 
surpasses. So the more the power of nature is surpassed, the greater the 
miracle. Now the power of nature is  surpassed in three ways: firstly, in 
the substance of the deed, for instance, if two bodies occupy the same 
place, or if the sun goes backwards; or if a human body is glorified: 
such things nature is absolutely unable to do; and these hold the highest 
rank among miracles. Secondly, a thing surpasses the power of nature, not 
in the deed, but in that wherein it is done; as the raising of the dead, 
and giving sight to the blind, and the like; for nature can give life, 
but not to the dead; and such hold the second rank in miracles. Thirdly, 
a thing surpasses nature's power in the measure and order in which it is 
done; as when a man is cured of a fever suddenly, without treatment or 
the usual process of nature; or as when the air is suddenly condensed 
into rain, by Divine power without a natural cause, as occurred at the 
prayers of Samuel and Elias; and these hold the lowest place in miracles. 
Moreover, each of these kinds has various degrees, according to the 
different ways in which the power of nature is surpassed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[105] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this is clear how to reply to the objections, arguing as they do 
from the Divine power.<br>
