    HOW ONE CREATURE MOVES ANOTHER (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
    <br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next consider how one creature moves another. This consideration will be
    threefold: (1) How the angels move, who are purely spiritual creatures; (2)
    How bodies move; (3) How man moves, who is composed of a spiritual and a
    corporeal nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning the first point, there are three things to be considered: (1) How
    an angel acts on an angel; (2) How an angel acts on a corporeal nature; (3)
    How an angel acts on man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first of these raises the question of the enlightenment and speech of
    the angels; and of their mutual coordination, both of the good and of the
    bad angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning their enlightenment there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether one angel moves the
    intellect of another by enlightenment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether one angel moves the will
    of another?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether an inferior angel can
    enlighten a superior angel?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a superior angel
    enlightens an inferior angel in all that he knows himself?<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether one angel enlightens another?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one angel does not enlighten
    another. For the angels possess now the same beatitude which we hope to
    obtain. But one man will not then enlighten another, according to Jer.
    31:34: "They shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his
    brother." Therefore neither does an angel enlighten another now.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, light in the angels is threefold; of
    nature, of grace, and of glory. But an angel is enlightened in the light of
    nature by the Creator; in the light of grace by the Justifier; in the light
    of glory by the Beatifier; all of which comes from God. Therefore one angel
    does not enlighten another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, light is a form in the mind. But the
    rational mind is "informed by God alone, without created intervention," as
    Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 51). Therefore one angel does not
    enlighten the mind of another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that "the
    angels of the second hierarchy are cleansed, enlightened and perfected by
    the angels of the first hierarchy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> One angel enlightens another. To make this
    clear, we must observe that intellectual light is nothing else than a
    manifestation of truth, according to Eph. 5:13: "All that is made manifest
    is light." Hence to enlighten means nothing else but to communicate to
    others the manifestation of the known truth; according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A8"
      >Eph. 3:8</a
    >): "To me the least of all the saints is given this grace... to enlighten
    all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which
    hath been hidden from eternity in God." Therefore one angel is said to
    enlighten another by manifesting the truth which he knows himself. Hence
    Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii): "Theologians plainly show that the orders
    of the heavenly beings are taught Divine science by the higher minds."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now since two things concur in the intellectual operation, as we have said
    (<a href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>,
    <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), namely, the
    intellectual power, and the likeness of the thing understood; in both of
    these one angel can notify the known truth to another. First, by
    strengthening his intellectual power; for just as the power of an imperfect
    body is strengthened by the neighborhood of a more perfect body ---for
    instance, the less hot is made hotter by the presence of what is hotter; so
    the intellectual power of an inferior angel is strengthened by the superior
    angel turning to him: since in spiritual things, for one thing to turn to
    another, corresponds to neighborhood in corporeal things. Secondly, one
    angel manifests the truth to another as regards the likeness of the thing
    understood. For the superior angel receives the knowledge of truth by a kind
    of universal conception, to receive which the inferior angel's intellect is
    not sufficiently powerful, for it is natural to him to receive truth in a
    more particular manner. Therefore the superior angel distinguishes, in a
    way, the truth which he conceives universally, so that it can be grasped by
    the inferior angel; and thus he proposes it to his knowledge. Thus it is
    with us that the teacher, in order to adapt himself to others, divides into
    many points the knowledge which he possesses in the universal. This is thus
    expressed by Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xv): "Every intellectual substance with
    provident power divides and multiplies the uniform knowledge bestowed on it
    by one nearer to God, so as to lead its inferiors upwards by analogy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the angels, both inferior and
    superior, see the Essence of God immediately, and in this respect one does
    not teach another. It is of this truth that the prophet speaks; wherefore he
    adds: "They shall teach no more every man his brother, saying: 'Know the
    Lord': for all shall know Me, from the least of them even to the greatest."
    But all the types of the Divine works, which are known in God as in their
    cause, God knows in Himself, because He comprehends Himself; but of others
    who see God, each one knows the more types, the more perfectly he sees God.
    Hence a superior angel knows more about the types of the Divine works than
    an inferior angel, and concerning these the former enlightens the latter;
    and as to this Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that the angels "are
    enlightened by the types of existing things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An angel does not enlighten another by
    giving him the light of nature, grace, or glory; but by strengthening his
    natural light, and by manifesting to him the truth concerning the state of
    nature, of grace, and of glory, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rational mind is formed immediately
    by God, either as the image from the exemplar, forasmuch as it is made to
    the image of God alone; or as the subject by the ultimate perfecting form:
    for the created mind is always considered to be unformed, except it adhere
    to the first truth; while the other kinds of enlightenment that proceed from
    man or angel, are, as it were, dispositions to this ultimate form.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether one angel moves another angel's will?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one angel can move another
    angel's will. Because, according to Dionysius quoted above (<a
      href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), as one angel enlightens another, so does he cleanse and perfect another.
    But cleansing and perfecting seem to belong to the will: for the former
    seems to point to the stain of sin which appertains to will; while to be
    perfected is to obtain an end, which is the object of the will. Therefore an
    angel can move another angel's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii):
    "The names of the angels designate their properties." Now the Seraphim are
    so called because they "kindle" or "give heat": and this is by love which
    belongs to the will. Therefore one angel moves another angel's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 11)
    that the higher appetite moves the lower. But as the intellect of the
    superior angel is higher, so also is his will. It seems, therefore, that the
    superior angel can change the will of another angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> To him it belongs to change the will, to whom
    it belongs to bestow righteousness: for righteousness is the rightness of
    the will. But God alone bestows righteousness. Therefore one angel cannot
    change another angel's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1"
      >Question [105]</a
    >, <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the will is changed
    in two ways; on the part of the object, and on the part of the power. On the
    part of the object, both the good itself which is the object of the will,
    moves the will, as the appetible moves the appetite; and he who points out
    the object, as, for instance, one who proves something to be good. But as we
    have said above (<a href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>,
    <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), other goods in a
    measure incline the will, yet nothing sufficiently moves the will save the
    universal good, and that is God. And this good He alone shows, that it may
    be seen by the blessed, Who, when Moses asked: "Show me Thy glory,"
    answered: "I will show thee all good" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++33%3A18,19"
      >Ex. 33:18,19</a
    >). Therefore an angel does not move the will sufficiently, either as the
    object or as showing the object. But he inclines the will as something
    lovable, and as manifesting some created good ordered to God's goodness. And
    thus he can incline the will to the love of the creature or of God, by way
    of persuasion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But on the part of the power the will cannot be moved at all save by God.
    For the operation of the will is a certain inclination of the willer to the
    thing willed. And He alone can change this inclination, Who bestowed on the
    creature the power to will: just as that agent alone can change the natural
    inclination, which can give the power to which follows that natural
    inclination. Now God alone gave to the creature the power to will, because
    He alone is the author of the intellectual nature. Therefore an angel cannot
    move another angel's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Cleansing and perfecting are to be
    understood according to the mode of enlightenment. And since God enlightens
    by changing the intellect and will, He cleanses by removing defects of
    intellect and will, and perfects unto the end of the intellect and will. But
    the enlightenment caused by an angel concerns the intellect, as explained
    above (<a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); therefore an
    angel is to be understood as cleansing from the defect of nescience in the
    intellect; and as perfecting unto the consummate end of the intellect, and
    this is the knowledge of truth. Thus Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. vi): that
    "in the heavenly hierarchy the chastening of the inferior essence is an
    enlightening of things unknown, that leads them to more perfect knowledge."
    For instance, we might say that corporeal sight is cleansed by the removal
    of darkness; enlightened by the diffusion of light; and perfected by being
    brought to the perception of the colored object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One angel can induce another to love God
    by persuasion as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher speaks of the lower
    sensitive appetite which can be moved by the superior intellectual appetite,
    because it belongs to the same nature of the soul, and because the inferior
    appetite is a power in a corporeal organ. But this does not apply to the
    angels.<br />

    Whether an inferior angel can enlighten a superior angel?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an inferior angel can
    enlighten a superior angel. For the ecclesiastical hierarchy is derived
    from, and represents the heavenly hierarchy; and hence the heavenly
    Jerusalem is called "our mother" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A26"
      >Gal. 4:26</a
    >). But in the Church even superiors are enlightened and taught by their
    inferiors, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A31"
      >1 Cor. 14:31</a
    >): "You may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be
    exhorted." Therefore, likewise in the heavenly hierarchy, the superiors can
    be enlightened by inferiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the order of corporeal substances
    depends on the will of God, so also does the order of spiritual substances.
    But, as was said above (<a href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>,
    <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), God sometimes acts
    outside the order of corporeal substances. Therefore He also sometimes acts
    outside the order of spiritual substances, by enlightening inferior
    otherwise than through their superiors. Therefore in that way the inferiors
    enlightened by God can enlighten superiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one angel enlightens the other to whom
    he turns, as was above explained (<a href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). But since this turning to another is voluntary, the highest angel can
    turn to the lowest passing over the others. Therefore he can enlighten him
    immediately; and thus the latter can enlighten his superiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says that "this is the Divine
    unalterable law, that inferior things are led to God by the superior" (Coel.
    Hier. iv; Eccl. Hier. v).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The inferior angels never enlighten the
    superior, but are always enlightened by them. The reason is, because, as
    above explained (<a href="FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>,
    <a href="FP105.html#FPQ105A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), one order is under
    another, as cause is under cause; and hence as cause is ordered to cause, so
    is order to order. Therefore there is no incongruity if sometimes anything
    is done outside the order of the inferior cause, to be ordered to the
    superior cause, as in human affairs the command of the president is passed
    over from obedience to the prince. So it happens that God works miraculously
    outside the order of corporeal nature, that men may be ordered to the
    knowledge of Him. But the passing over of the order that belongs to
    spiritual substances in no way belongs to the ordering of men to God; since
    the angelic operations are not made known to us; as are the operations of
    sensible bodies. Thus the order which belongs to spiritual substances is
    never passed over by God; so that the inferiors are always moved by the
    superior, and not conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The ecclesiastical hierarchy imitates
    the heavenly in some degree, but by a perfect likeness. For in the heavenly
    hierarchy the perfection of the order is in proportion to its nearness to
    God; so that those who are the nearer to God are the more sublime in grade,
    and more clear in knowledge; and on that account the superiors are never
    enlightened by the inferiors, whereas in the ecclesiastical hierarchy,
    sometimes those who are the nearer to God in sanctity, are in the lowest
    grade, and are not conspicuous for science; and some also are eminent in one
    kind of science, and fail in another; and on that account superiors may be
    taught by inferiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As above explained, there is no
    similarity between what God does outside the order of corporeal nature, and
    that of spiritual nature. Hence the argument does not hold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> An angel turns voluntarily to enlighten
    another angel, but the angel's will is ever regulated by the Divine law
    which made the order in the angels.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the superior angel enlightens the inferior as regards all he himself
    knows?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the superior angel does not
    enlighten the inferior concerning all he himself knows. For Dionysius says
    (Coel. Hier. xii) that the superior angels have a more universal knowledge;
    and the inferior a more particular and individual knowledge. But more is
    contained under a universal knowledge than under a particular knowledge.
    Therefore not all that the superior angels know, is known by the inferior,
    through these being enlightened by the former.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Master of the Sentences (ii, D, 11)
    says that the superior angels had long known the Mystery of the Incarnation,
    whereas the inferior angels did not know it until it was accomplished. Thus
    we find that on some of the angels inquiring, as it were, in ignorance: "Who
    is this King of glory?" other angels, who knew, answered: "The Lord of
    Hosts, He is the King of glory," as Dionysius expounds (Coel. Hier. vii).
    But this would not apply if the superior angels enlightened the inferior
    concerning all they know themselves. Therefore they do not do so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the superior angels enlighten the
    inferior about all they know, nothing that the superior angels know would be
    unknown to the inferior angels. Therefore the superior angels could
    communicate nothing more to the inferior; which appears open to objection.
    Therefore the superior angels enlighten the inferior in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory [*Peter Lombard, Sent. ii, D, ix; Cf.
    Gregory, Hom. xxxiv, in Ev.] says: "In that heavenly country, though there
    are some excellent gifts, yet nothing is held individually." And Dionysius
    says: "Each heavenly essence communicates to the inferior the gift derived
    from the superior" (Coel. Hier. xv), as quoted above (<a
      href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Every creature participates in the Divine
    goodness, so as to diffuse the good it possesses to others; for it is of the
    nature of good to communicate itself to others. Hence also corporeal agents
    give their likeness to others so far as they can. So the more an agent is
    established in the share of the Divine goodness, so much the more does it
    strive to transmit its perfections to others as far as possible. Hence the
    Blessed Peter admonishes those who by grace share in the Divine goodness;
    saying: "As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to
    another; as good stewards of the manifold grace of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++4%3A10"
      >1 Pt. 4:10</a
    >). Much more therefore do the holy angels, who enjoy the plenitude of
    participation of the Divine goodness, impart the same to those below
    them.<br />

    Nevertheless this gift is not received so excellently by the inferior as by
    the superior angels; and therefore the superior ever remain in a higher
    order, and have a more perfect knowledge; as the master understands the same
    thing better than the pupil who learns from him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The knowledge of the superior angels is
    said to be more universal as regards the more eminent mode of knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Master's words are not to be
    understood as if the inferior angels were entirely ignorant of the Mystery
    of the Incarnation but that they did not know it as fully as the superior
    angels; and that they progressed in the knowledge of it afterwards when the
    Mystery was accomplished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Till the Judgment Day some new things
    are always being revealed by God to the highest angels, concerning the
    course of the world, and especially the salvation of the elect. Hence there
    is always something for the superior angels to make known to the
    inferior.<br />
