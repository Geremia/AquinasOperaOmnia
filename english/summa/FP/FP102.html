<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next consider man's abode, which is paradise. Under this head there 
are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP102.html#FPQ102A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether paradise is a corporeal place?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP102.html#FPQ102A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a place apt for human habitation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP102.html#FPQ102A3THEP1">(3)</a> For what purpose was man placed in paradise?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP102.html#FPQ102A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he should have been created in paradise?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether paradise is a corporeal place?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that paradise is not a corporeal place. For Bede 
[*Strabus, Gloss on Gn. 2:8] says that "paradise reaches to the lunar 
circle." But no earthly place answers that description, both because it 
is contrary to the nature of the earth to be raised up so high, and 
because beneath the moon is the region of fire, which would consume the 
earth. Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Scripture mentions four rivers as rising in paradise 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A10">Gn. 2:10</a>). But the rivers there mentioned have visible sources 
elsewhere, as is clear from the Philosopher (Meteor. i). Therefore 
paradise is not a corporeal place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, although men have explored the entire habitable world, 
yet none have made mention of the place of paradise. Therefore apparently 
it is not a corporeal place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the tree of life is described as growing in paradise. 
But the tree of life is a spiritual thing, for it is written of Wisdom 
that "She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++3%3A18">Prov. 3:18</a>). 
Therefore paradise also is not a corporeal, but a spiritual place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if paradise be a corporeal place, the trees also of 
paradise must be corporeal. But it seems they were not; for corporeal 
trees were produced on the third day, while the planting of the trees of 
paradise is recorded after the work of the six days. Therefore paradise 
was not a corporeal place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 1): "Three general 
opinions prevail about paradise. Some understand a place merely 
corporeal; others a place entirely spiritual; while others, whose 
opinion, I confess, hold that paradise was both corporeal and spiritual."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiii, 21): "Nothing 
prevents us from holding, within proper limits, a spiritual paradise; so 
long as we believe in the truth of the events narrated as having there 
occurred." For whatever Scripture tells us about paradise is set down as 
matter of history; and wherever Scripture makes use of this method, we 
must hold to the historical truth of the narrative as a foundation of 
whatever spiritual explanation we may offer. And so paradise, as Isidore 
says (Etym. xiv, 3), "is a place situated in the east, its name being the 
Greek for garden." It was fitting that it should be in the east; for it 
is to be believed that it was situated in the most excellent part of the 
earth. Now the east is the right hand on the heavens, as the Philosopher 
explains (De Coel. ii, 2); and the right hand is nobler than the left: 
hence it was fitting that God should place the earthly paradise in the 
east.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bede's assertion is untrue, if taken in its obvious sense. 
It may, however, be explained to mean that paradise reaches to the moon, 
not literally, but figuratively; because, as Isidore says (Etym. xiv, 3), 
the atmosphere there is "a continually even temperature"; and in this 
respect it is like the heavenly bodies, which are devoid of opposing 
elements. Mention, however, is made of the moon rather than of other 
bodies, because, of all the heavenly bodies, the moon is nearest to us, 
and is, moreover, the most akin to the earth; hence it is observed to be 
overshadowed by clouds so as to be almost obscured. Others say that 
paradise reached to the moon---that is, to the middle space of the air, 
where rain, and wind, and the like arise; because the moon is said to 
have influence on such changes. But in this sense it would not be a fit 
place for human dwelling, through being uneven in temperature, and not 
attuned to the human temperament, as is the lower atmosphere in the 
neighborhood of the earth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 7): "It is probable that 
man has no idea where paradise was, and that the rivers, whose sources 
are said to be known, flowed for some distance underground, and then 
sprang up elsewhere. For who is not aware that such is the case with some 
other streams?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The situation of paradise is shut off from the habitable 
world by mountains, or seas, or some torrid region, which cannot be 
crossed; and so people who have written about topography  make no mention 
of it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The tree of life is a material tree, and so called because 
its fruit was endowed with a life-preserving power as above stated (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Yet it had a spiritual signification; as the rock in the desert 
was of a material nature, and yet signified Christ. In like manner the 
tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a material tree, so called in 
view of future events; because, after eating of it, man was to learn, by 
experience of the consequent punishment, the difference between the good 
of obedience and the evil of rebellion. It may also be said to signify 
spiritually the free-will as some say.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. v, 5, viii, 3), the 
plants were not actually produced on the third day, but in their seminal 
virtues; whereas, after the work of the six days, the plants, both of 
paradise and others, were actually produced. According to other holy 
writers, we ought to say that all the plants were actually produced on 
the third day, including the trees of paradise; and what is said of the 
trees of paradise being planted after the work of the six days is to be 
understood, they say, by way of recapitulation. Whence our text reads: 
"The Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A8">Gn. 2:8</a>).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether paradise was a place adapted to be the abode of man?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that paradise was not a place adapted to be the 
abode of man. For man and angels are similarly ordered to beatitude. But 
the angels from the very beginning of their existence were made to dwell 
in the abode of the blessed---that is, the empyrean heaven. Therefore the 
place of man's habitation should have been there also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if some definite place were required for man's abode, 
this would be required on the part either of the soul or of the body. If 
on the part of the soul, the place would be in heaven, which is adapted 
to the nature of the soul; since the desire of heaven is implanted in 
all. On the part of the body, there was no need for any other place than 
the one provided for other animals. Therefore paradise was not at all 
adapted to be the abode of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a place which contains nothing is useless. But after 
sin, paradise was not occupied by man. Therefore if it were adapted as a 
dwelling-place for man, it seems that God made paradise to no purpose.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, since man is of an even temperament, a fitting place for 
him should be of even temperature. But paradise was not of an even 
temperature; for it is said to have been on the equator---a situation of 
extreme heat, since twice in the year the sun passes vertically over the 
heads of its inhabitants. Therefore paradise was not a fit dwelling-place 
for man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): "Paradise was a 
divinely ordered region, and worthy of him who was made to God's image."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), Man was incorruptible and 
immortal, not because his body had a disposition to incorruptibility, but 
because in his soul there was a power preserving the body from 
corruption. Now the human body may be corrupted from within or from 
without. From within, the body is corrupted by the consumption of the 
humors, and by old age, as above explained (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), and man was 
able to ward off such corruption by food. Among those things which 
corrupt the body from without, the chief seems to be an atmosphere of 
unequal temperature; and to such corruption a remedy is found in an 
atmosphere of equable nature. In paradise both conditions were found; 
because, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): "Paradise was 
permeated with the all pervading brightness of a temperate, pure, and 
exquisite atmosphere, and decked with ever-flowering plants." Whence it 
is clear that paradise was most fit to be a dwelling-place for man, and 
in keeping with his original state of immortality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The empyrean heaven is the highest of corporeal places, and 
is outside the region of change. By the first of these two conditions, it 
is a fitting abode for the angelic nature: for, as Augustine says (De 
Trin. ii), "God rules corporeal creatures through spiritual creatures." 
Hence it is fitting that the spiritual nature should be established above 
the entire corporeal nature, as presiding over it. By the second 
condition, it is a fitting abode for the state of beatitude, which is 
endowed with the highest degree of stability. Thus the abode of beatitude 
was suited to the very nature of the angel; therefore he was created 
there. But it is not suited to man's nature, since man is not set as a 
ruler over the entire corporeal creation: it is a fitting abode for man 
in regard only to his beatitude. Wherefore he was not placed from the 
beginning in the empyrean heaven, but was destined to be transferred 
thither in the state of his final beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is ridiculous to assert that any particular place is 
natural to the soul or to any spiritual substances, though some 
particular place may have a certain fitness in regard to spiritual 
substances. For the earthly paradise was a place adapted to man, as 
regards both his body and his soul---that is, inasmuch as in his soul was 
the force which preserved the human body from corruption. This could not 
be said of the other animals. Therefore, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 
ii, 11): "No irrational animal inhabited paradise"; although, by a 
certain dispensation, the animals were brought thither by God to Adam; 
and the serpent was able to trespass therein by the complicity of the 
devil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Paradise did not become useless through being unoccupied by 
man after sin, just as immortality was not conferred on man in vain, 
though he was to lose it. For thereby we learn God's kindness to man, and 
what man lost by sin. Moreover, some say  that Enoch and Elias still 
dwell in that paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who say that paradise was on the equinoctial line are 
of opinion that such a situation is most temperate, on account of the 
unvarying equality of day and night; that it is never too cold there, 
because the sun is never too far off; and never too hot, because, 
although the sun passes over the heads of the inhabitants, it does not 
remain long in that position. However, Aristotle distinctly says (Meteor. 
ii, 5) that such a region is uninhabitable on account of the heat. This 
seems to be more probable; because, even those regions where the sun does 
not pass vertically overhead, are extremely hot on account of the mere 
proximity of the sun. But whatever be the truth of the matter, we must 
hold that paradise was situated in a most temperate situation, whether on 
the equator or elsewhere.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man was not placed in paradise to dress and 
keep it. For what was brought on him as a punishment of sin would not 
have existed in paradise in the state of innocence. But the cultivation 
of the soil was a punishment of sin (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++3%3A17">Gn. 3:17</a>). Therefore man was not 
placed in paradise to dress and keep it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no need of a keeper when there is no fear of 
trespass with violence. But in paradise there was no fear of trespass 
with violence. Therefore there was no need for man to keep paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if man was placed in paradise to dress and keep it, man 
would apparently have been made for the sake of paradise, and not 
contrariwise; which seems to be false. Therefore man was not place in 
paradise to dress and keep it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2:+15">Gn. 2: 15</a>): "The Lord God took man and 
placed in the paradise of pleasure, to dress and keep it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 10), these words in 
Genesis may be understood in two ways. First, in the sense that God 
placed man in paradise that He might Himself work in man and keep him, by 
sanctifying him (for if this work cease, man at once relapses into 
darkness, as the air grows dark when the light ceases to shine); and by 
keeping man from all corruption and evil. Secondly, that man might dress 
and keep paradise, which dressing would not have involved labor, as it 
did after sin; but would have been pleasant on account of man's practical 
knowledge of the powers of nature. Nor would man have kept paradise 
against a trespasser; but he would have striven to keep paradise for 
himself lest he should lose it by sin. All of which was for man's good; 
wherefore paradise was ordered to man's benefit, and not conversely.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man was created in paradise. For the angel was 
created in his dwelling-place---namely, the empyrean heaven. But before 
sin paradise was a fitting abode for man. Therefore it seems that man was 
created in paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, other animals remain in the place where they are 
produced, as the fish in the water, and walking animals on the earth from 
which they were made. Now man would have remained in paradise after he 
was created (<A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97OUTP1">Question [97]</a>, <A Href="FP097.html#FPQ97A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore he was created in paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, woman was made in paradise. But man is greater than 
woman. Therefore much more should man have been made in paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2%3A15">Gn. 2:15</a>): "God took man and placed him 
in paradise."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Paradise was a fitting abode for man as regards the 
incorruptibility of the primitive state. Now this incorruptibility was 
man's, not by nature, but by a supernatural gift of God. Therefore that 
this might be attributed to God, and not to human nature, God made man 
outside of paradise, and afterwards placed him there to live there during 
the whole of his animal life; and, having attained to the spiritual life, 
to be transferred thence to heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The empyrean heaven was a fitting abode for the angels as 
regards their nature, and therefore they were created there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way I reply to the second objection, for those places befit 
those animals in their nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[102] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Woman was made in paradise, not by reason of her own 
dignity, but on account of the dignity of the principle from which her 
body was formed. For the same reason the children would have been born in 
paradise, where their parents were already.<br>
