<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As hitherto we have considered God as He is in Himself, we now go on to 
consider in what manner He is in the knowledge of creatures; concerning 
which there are thirteen points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any created intellect can see the essence of God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the essence of God is seen by the intellect through any 
created image?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the essence of God can be seen by the corporeal eye?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether any created intellectual substance is sufficient by its own 
natural powers to see the essence of God?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the created intellect needs any created light in order to 
see the essence of God?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether of those who see God, one sees Him more perfectly than 
another?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether any created intellect can comprehend the essence of God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the created intellect seeing the essence of God, knows all 
things in it?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether what is there known is known by any similitudes?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether the created intellect knows at once what it sees in God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether in the state of this life any man can see the essence of 
God?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A12THEP1">(12)</a> Whether by natural reason we can know God in this life?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A13THEP1">(13)</a> Whether there is in this life any knowledge of God through grace 
above the knowledge of natural reason?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no created intellect can see the essence of God. 
For Chrysostom (Hom. xiv. in Joan.) commenting on Jn. 1:18, "No man hath 
seen God at any time," says: "Not prophets only, but neither angels nor 
archangels have seen God. For how can a creature see what is 
increatable?" Dionysius also says (Div. Nom. i), speaking of God: 
"Neither is there sense, nor image, nor opinion, nor reason, nor 
knowledge of Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everything infinite, as such, is unknown. But God is 
infinite, as was shown above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore in Himself He is 
unknown.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the created intellect knows only existing things. For 
what falls first under the apprehension of the intellect is being. Now 
God is not something existing; but He is rather super-existence, as 
Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore God is not intelligible; but 
above all intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there must be some proportion between the knower and the 
known, since the known is the perfection of the knower. But no proportion 
exists between the created intellect and God; for there is an infinite 
distance between them. Therefore the created intellect cannot see the 
essence of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "We shall see Him as He is" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3:2">1 Jn. 3:2</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since everything is knowable according as it is actual, 
God, Who is pure act without any admixture of potentiality, is in Himself 
supremely knowable. But what is supremely knowable in itself, may not be 
knowable to a particular intellect, on account of the excess of the 
intelligible object above the intellect; as, for example, the sun, which 
is supremely visible, cannot be seen by the bat by reason of its excess 
of light.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore some who considered this, held that no created intellect can 
see the essence of God. This opinion, however, is not tenable. For as the 
ultimate beatitude of man consists in the use of his highest function, 
which is the operation of his intellect; if we suppose that the created 
intellect could never see God, it would either never attain to beatitude, 
or its beatitude would consist in something else beside God; which is 
opposed to faith. For the ultimate perfection of the rational creature is 
to be found in that which is the principle of its being; since a thing is 
perfect so far as it attains to its principle. Further the same opinion 
is also against reason. For there resides in every man a natural desire 
to know the cause of any effect which he sees; and thence arises wonder 
in men. But if the intellect of the rational creature could not reach so 
far as to the first cause of things, the natural desire would remain void.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] Body Para. 3/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it must be absolutely granted that the blessed see the essence of 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Both of these authorities speak of the vision of 
comprehension. Hence Dionysius premises immediately before the words 
cited, "He is universally to all incomprehensible," etc. Chrysostom 
likewise after the words quoted says: "He says this of the most certain 
vision of the Father, which is such a perfect consideration and 
comprehension as the Father has of the Son."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The infinity of matter not made perfect by form, is unknown 
in itself, because all knowledge comes by the form; whereas the infinity 
of the form not limited by matter, is in itself supremely known. God is 
Infinite in this way, and not in the first way: as appears from what was 
said above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God is not said to be not existing as if He did not exist 
at all, but because He exists above all that exists; inasmuch as He is 
His own existence. Hence it does not follow that He cannot be known at 
all, but that He exceeds every kind of knowledge; which means that He is 
not comprehended.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Proportion is twofold. In one sense it means a certain 
relation of one quantity to another, according as double, treble and 
equal are species of proportion. In another sense every relation of one 
thing to another is called proportion. And in this sense there can be a 
proportion of the creature to God, inasmuch as it is related to Him as 
the effect of its cause, and as potentiality to its act; and in this way 
the created intellect can be proportioned to know God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the essence of God is seen by the created intellect through an image?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the essence of God is seen through an image by the 
created intellect. For it is written: "We know that when He shall appear, 
we shall be like to Him, and [Vulg.: 'because'] we shall see Him as He 
is" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3:2">1 Jn. 3:2</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. v): "When we know God, some 
likeness of God is made in us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect in act is the actual intelligible; as 
sense in act is the actual sensible. But this comes about inasmuch as 
sense is informed with the likeness of the sensible object, and the 
intellect with the likeness of the thing understood. Therefore, if God is 
seen by the created intellect in act, it must be that He is seen by some 
similitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xv) that when the Apostle 
says, "We see through a glass and in an enigma [*Douay: 'in a dark 
manner']," "by the terms 'glass' and 'enigma' certain similitudes are 
signified by him, which are accommodated to the  vision of God." But to 
see the essence of God is not an enigmatic nor a speculative vision, but 
is, on the contrary, of an opposite kind. Therefore the divine essence is 
not seen through a similitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things are required both for sensible and for 
intellectual vision---viz. power of sight, and union of the thing seen 
with the sight. For vision is made actual only when the thing seen is in 
a certain way in the seer. Now in corporeal things it is clear that the 
thing seen cannot be by its essence in the seer, but only by its 
likeness; as the similitude of a stone is in the eye, whereby the vision 
is made actual; whereas the substance of the stone is not there. But if 
the principle of the visual power and the thing seen were one and the 
same thing, it would necessarily follow that the seer would receive both 
the visual power and the form whereby it sees, from that one same thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is manifest both that God is the author of the intellect power, 
and that He can be seen by the intellect. And since the intellective 
power of the creature is not the essence of God, it follows that it is 
some kind of participated likeness of Him who is the first intellect. 
Hence also the intellectual power of the creature is called an 
intelligible light, as it were, derived from the first light, whether 
this be understood of the natural power, or of some perfection superadded 
of grace or of glory. Therefore, in order to see God, there must be some 
similitude of God on the part of the visual faculty, whereby the 
intellect is made capable of seeing God. But on the part of the object 
seen, which must necessarily be united to the seer, the essence of God 
cannot be seen by any created similitude. First, because as Dionysius 
says (Div. Nom. i), "by the similitudes of the inferior order of things, 
the superior can in no way be known;" as by the likeness of a body the 
essence of an incorporeal thing cannot be known. Much less therefore can 
the essence of God be seen by any created likeness whatever. Secondly, 
because the essence of God is His own very existence, as was shown above 
(<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), which cannot be said of any created form; and so no created 
form can be the similitude representing the essence of God to the seer. 
Thirdly, because the divine essence is uncircumscribed, and contains in 
itself super-eminently whatever can be signified or understood by the 
created intellect. Now this cannot in any way be represented by any 
created likeness; for every created form is determined according to some 
aspect of wisdom, or of power, or of being itself, or of some like thing. 
Hence to say that God is seen by some similitude, is to say that the 
divine essence is not seen at all; which is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it must be said that to see the essence of God, there is 
required some similitude in the visual faculty, namely, the light of 
glory strengthening the intellect to see God, which is spoken of in the 
Ps. 35:10, "In Thy light we shall see light." The essence of God, 
however, cannot be seen by any created similitude representing the divine 
essence itself as it really is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That authority speaks of the similitude which is caused by 
participation of the light of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine speaks of the knowledge of God here on earth.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The divine essence is existence itself. Hence as other 
intelligible forms which are not their own existence are united to the 
intellect by means of some entity, whereby the intellect itself is 
informed, and made in act; so the divine essence is united to the created 
intellect, as the object actually understood, making the intellect in act 
by and of itself.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the essence of God can be seen by the corporeal 
eye. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+19:26">Job 19:26</a>): "In my flesh I shall see . . . God," 
and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+42:5">Job 42:5</a>), "With the hearing of the ear I have heard Thee, but now 
my eye seeth Thee."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxix, 29): "Those eyes" 
(namely the glorified) "will therefore have a greater power of sight, not 
so much to see more keenly, as some report of the sight of serpents or of 
eagles (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by these creatures, 
they can see only corporeal things) but to see even incorporeal things." 
Now whoever can see incorporeal things, can be raised up to see God. 
Therefore the glorified eye can see God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God can be seen by man through a vision of the 
imagination. For it is written: "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne," 
etc. (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++6:1">Is. 6:1</a>). But an imaginary vision originates from sense; for the 
imagination is moved by sense to act. Therefore God can be seen by a 
vision of sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Vid. Deum, Ep. cxlvii): "No one has 
ever seen God either in this life, as He is, nor in the angelic life, as 
visible things are seen by corporeal vision."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for God to be seen by the sense of 
sight, or by any other sense, or faculty of the sensitive power. For 
every such kind of power is the act of a corporeal organ, as will be 
shown later (<A Href="FP078.html#FPQ78OUTP1">Question [78]</a>). Now act is proportional to the nature which 
possesses it. Hence no power of that kind can go beyond corporeal things. 
For God is incorporeal, as was shown above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence He cannot 
be seen by the sense or the imagination, but only by the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words, "In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour," do not 
mean that God will be seen with the eye of the flesh, but that man 
existing in the flesh after the resurrection will see God. Likewise the 
words, "Now my eye seeth Thee," are to be understood of the mind's eye, 
as the Apostle says: "May He give  unto you the spirit of wisdom . . . in 
the knowledge of Him, that the eyes of your heart" may be "enlightened" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++1:17,18">Eph. 1:17,18</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine speaks as one inquiring, and conditionally. This 
appears from what he says previously: "Therefore they will have an 
altogether different power (viz. the glorified eyes), if they shall see 
that incorporeal nature;" and afterwards he explains this, saying: "It is 
very credible, that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the new heaven 
and the new earth, as to see most clearly God everywhere present, 
governing all corporeal things, not as we now see the invisible things of 
God as understood by what is made; but as when we see men among whom we 
live, living and exercising the functions of human life, we do not 
believe they live, but see it." Hence it is evident how the glorified 
eyes will see God, as now our eyes see the life of another. But life is 
not seen with the corporeal eye, as a thing in itself visible, but as the 
indirect object of the sense; which indeed is not known by sense, but at 
once, together with sense, by some other cognitive power. But that the 
divine presence is known by the intellect immediately on the sight of, 
and through, corporeal things, happens from two causes---viz. from the 
perspicuity of the intellect, and from the refulgence of the divine glory 
infused into the body after its renovation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The essence of God is not seen in a vision of the 
imagination; but the imagination receives some form representing God 
according to some mode of similitude; as in the divine Scripture divine 
things are metaphorically described by means of sensible things.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any created intellect by its natural powers can see the Divine essence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a created intellect can see the Divine essence by 
its own natural power. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): "An angel is a 
pure mirror, most clear, receiving, if it is right to say so, the whole 
beauty of God." But if a reflection is seen, the original thing is seen. 
Therefore since an angel by his natural power understands himself, it 
seems that by his own natural power he understands the Divine essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is supremely visible, is made less visible to us by 
reason of our defective corporeal or intellectual sight. But the angelic 
intellect has no such defect. Therefore, since God is supremely 
intelligible in Himself, it seems that in like manner He is supremely so 
to an angel. Therefore, if he can understand other intelligible things by 
his own natural power, much more can he understand God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, corporeal sense cannot be raised up to understand 
incorporeal substance, which is above its nature. Therefore if to see the 
essence of God is above the nature of every created intellect, it follows 
that no created intellect can reach  up to see the essence of God at all. 
But this is false, as appears from what is said above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore 
it seems that it is natural for a created intellect to see the Divine 
essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "The grace of God is life everlasting" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6:23">Rm. 6:23</a>). But life everlasting consists in the vision of the Divine 
essence, according to the words: "This is eternal life, that they may 
know Thee the only true God," etc. (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++17:3">Jn. 17:3</a>). Therefore to see the 
essence of God is possible to the created intellect by grace, and not by 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for any created intellect to see the 
essence of God by its own natural power. For knowledge is regulated 
according as the thing known is in the knower. But the thing known is in 
the knower according to the mode of the knower. Hence the knowledge of 
every knower is ruled according to its own nature. If therefore the mode 
of anything's being exceeds the mode of the knower, it must result that 
the knowledge of the object is above the nature of the knower. Now the 
mode of being of things is manifold. For some things have being only in 
this one individual matter; as all bodies. But others are subsisting 
natures, not residing in matter at all, which, however, are not their own 
existence, but receive it; and these are the incorporeal beings, called 
angels. But to God alone does it belong to be His own subsistent being. 
Therefore what exists only in individual matter we know naturally, 
forasmuch as our soul, whereby we know, is the form of certain matter. 
Now our soul possesses two cognitive powers; one is the act of a 
corporeal organ, which naturally knows things existing in individual 
matter; hence sense knows only the singular. But there is another kind of 
cognitive power in the soul, called the intellect; and this is not the 
act of any corporeal organ. Wherefore the intellect naturally knows 
natures which exist only in individual matter; not as they are in such 
individual matter, but according as they are abstracted therefrom by the 
considering act of the intellect; hence it follows that through the 
intellect we can understand these objects as universal; and this is 
beyond the power of the sense. Now the angelic intellect naturally knows 
natures that are not in matter; but this is beyond the power of the 
intellect of our soul in the state of its present life, united as it is 
to the body. It follows therefore that to know self-subsistent being is 
natural to the divine intellect alone; and this is beyond the natural 
power of any created intellect; for no creature is its own existence, 
forasmuch as its existence is participated. Therefore the created 
intellect cannot see the essence of God, unless God by His grace unites 
Himself to the created intellect, as an object made intelligible to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This mode of knowing God is natural to an angel---namely, 
to know Him by His own likeness refulgent in the angel himself. But to 
know God by any created similitude is not to know the essence of God, as 
was shown above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence it does not follow that an angel can know 
the essence of God by his own power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angelic intellect is not defective, if defect  be taken 
to mean privation, as if it were without anything which it ought to have. 
But if the defect be taken negatively, in that sense every creature is 
defective, when compared with God; forasmuch as it does not possess the 
excellence which is in God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sense of sight, as being altogether material, cannot be 
raised up to immateriality. But our intellect, or the angelic intellect, 
inasmuch as it is elevated above matter in its own nature, can be raised 
up above its own nature to a higher level by grace. The proof is, that 
sight cannot in any way know abstractedly what it knows concretely; for 
in no way can it perceive a nature except as this one particular nature; 
whereas our intellect is able to consider abstractedly what it knows 
concretely. Now although it knows things which have a form residing in 
matter, still it resolves the composite into both of these elements; and 
it considers the form separately by itself. Likewise, also, the intellect 
of an angel, although it naturally knows the concrete in any nature, 
still it is able to separate that existence by its intellect; since it 
knows that the thing itself is one thing, and its existence is another. 
Since therefore the created intellect is naturally capable of 
apprehending the concrete form, and the concrete being abstractedly, by 
way of a kind of resolution of parts; it can by grace be raised up to 
know separate subsisting substance, and separate subsisting existence.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the created intellect does not need any created 
light in order to see the essence of God. For what is of itself lucid in 
sensible things does not require any other light in order to be seen. 
Therefore the same applies to intelligible things. Now God is 
intelligible light. Therefore He is not seen by means of any created 
light.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if God is seen through a medium, He is not seen in His 
essence. But if seen by any created light, He is seen through a medium. 
Therefore He is not seen in His essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is created can be natural to some creature. 
Therefore if the essence of God is seen through any created light, such a 
light can be made natural to some other creature; and thus, that creature 
would not need any other light to see God; which is impossible. Therefore 
it is not necessary that every creature should require a superadded light 
in order to see the essence of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "In Thy light we shall see light" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++35:10">Ps. 35:10</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Everything which is raised up to what exceeds its nature, 
must be prepared by some disposition above its nature; as, for example, 
if air is to receive the form of fire, it must be  prepared by some 
disposition for such a form. But when any created intellect sees the 
essence of God, the essence of God itself becomes the intelligible form 
of the intellect. Hence it is necessary that some supernatural 
disposition should be added to the intellect in order that it may be 
raised up to such a great and sublime height. Now since the natural power 
of the created intellect does not avail to enable it to see the essence 
of God, as was shown in the preceding article, it is necessary that the 
power of understanding should be added by divine grace. Now this increase 
of the intellectual powers is called the illumination of the intellect, 
as we also call the intelligible object itself by the name of light of 
illumination. And this is the light spoken of in the Apocalypse (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++21:23">Apoc. 21:23</a>): "The glory of God hath enlightened it"---viz. the society of the 
blessed who see God. By this light the blessed are made "deiform"---i.e. 
like to God, according to the saying: "When He shall appear we shall be 
like to Him, and [Vulg.: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++2:2">1 Jn. 2:2</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The created light is necessary to see the essence of God, 
not in order to make the essence of God intelligible, which is of itself 
intelligible, but in order to enable the intellect to understand in the 
same way as a habit makes a power abler to act. Even so corporeal light 
is necessary as regards external sight, inasmuch as it makes the medium 
actually transparent, and susceptible of color.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This light is required to see the divine essence, not as a 
similitude in which God is seen, but as a perfection of the intellect, 
strengthening it to see God. Therefore it may be said that this light is 
to be described not as a medium in which God is seen, but as one by which 
He is seen; and such a medium does not take away the immediate vision of 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The disposition to the form of fire can be natural only to 
the subject of that form. Hence the light of glory cannot be natural to a 
creature unless the creature has a divine nature; which is impossible. 
But by this light the rational creature is made deiform, as is said in 
this article.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that of those who see the essence of God, one does not 
see more perfectly than another. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3:2">1 Jn. 3:2</a>): "We shall 
see Him as He is." But He is only in one way. Therefore He will be seen 
by all in one way only; and therefore He will not be seen more perfectly 
by one and less perfectly by another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xxxii): "One 
person cannot see one and the same thing more perfectly than another." 
But all who see the essence of God, understand the Divine essence, for 
God is seen by the intellect and  not by sense, as was shown above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore of those who see the divine essence, one does not see more 
clearly than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, That anything be seen more perfectly than another can 
happen in two ways: either on the part of the visible object, or on the 
part of the visual power of the seer. On the part of the object, it may 
so happen because the object is received more perfectly in the seer, that 
is, according to the greater perfection of the similitude; but this does 
not apply to the present question, for God is present to the intellect 
seeing Him not by way of similitude, but by His essence. It follows then 
that if one sees Him more perfectly than another, this happens according 
to the difference of the intellectual power; thus it follows too that the 
one whose intellectual power is higher, will see Him the more clearly; 
and this is incongruous; since equality with angels is promised to men as 
their beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Eternal life consists in the vision of God, according 
to Jn. 17:3: "This is eternal life, that they may know Thee the only true 
God," etc. Therefore if all saw the essence of God equally in eternal 
life, all would be equal; the contrary to which is declared by the 
Apostle: "Star differs from star in glory" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15:41">1 Cor. 15:41</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Of those who see the essence of God, one sees Him more 
perfectly than another. This, indeed, does not take place as if one had a 
more perfect similitude of God than another, since that vision will not 
spring from any similitude; but it will take place because one intellect 
will have a greater power or faculty to see God than another. The faculty 
of seeing God, however, does not belong to the created intellect 
naturally, but is given to it by the light of glory, which establishes 
the intellect in a kind of "deiformity," as appears from what is said 
above, in the preceding article.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the intellect which has more of the light of glory will see God 
the more perfectly; and he will have a fuller participation of the light 
of glory who has more charity; because where there is the greater 
charity, there is the more desire; and desire in a certain degree makes 
the one desiring apt and prepared to receive the object desired. Hence he 
who possesses the more charity, will see God the more perfectly, and will 
be the more beatified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the words,"We shall see Him as He is," the conjunction 
"as" determines the mode of vision on the part of the object seen, so 
that the meaning is, we shall see Him to be as He is, because we shall 
see His existence, which is His essence. But it does not determine the 
mode of vision on the part of the one seeing; as if the meaning was that 
the mode of seeing God will be as perfect as is the perfect mode of God's 
existence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus appears the answer to the Second Objection. For when it is said 
that one intellect does not understand one and the same thing better than 
another, this would be true if referred to the  mode of the thing 
understood, for whoever understands it otherwise than it really is, does 
not truly understand it, but not if referred to the mode of 
understanding, for the understanding of one is more perfect than the 
understanding of another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The diversity of seeing will not arise on the part of the 
object seen, for the same object will be presented to all---viz. the 
essence of God; nor will it arise from the diverse participation of the 
object seen by different similitudes; but it will arise on the part of 
the diverse faculty of the intellect, not, indeed, the natural faculty, 
but the glorified faculty.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that those who see the divine essence, comprehend God. 
For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++3:12">Phil. 3:12</a>): "But I follow after, if I may by any 
means comprehend [Douay: 'apprehend']." But the Apostle did not follow in 
vain; for he said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9:26">1 Cor. 9:26</a>): "I . . . so run, not as at an 
uncertainty." Therefore he comprehended; and in the same way, others 
also, whom he invites to do the same, saying: "So run that you may 
comprehend."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Vid. Deum, Ep. cxlvii): "That is 
comprehended which is so seen as a whole, that nothing of it is hidden 
from the seer." But if God is seen in His essence, He is seen whole, and 
nothing of Him is hidden from the seer, since God is simple. Therefore 
whoever sees His essence, comprehends Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if we say that He is seen as a "whole," but not 
"wholly," it may be contrarily urged that "wholly" refers either to the 
mode of the seer, or to the mode of the thing seen. But he who sees the 
essence of God, sees Him wholly, if the mode of the thing seen is 
considered; forasmuch as he sees Him as He is; also, likewise, he sees 
Him wholly if the mode of the seer is meant, forasmuch as the intellect 
will with its full power see the Divine essence. Therefore all who see 
the essence of God see Him wholly; therefore they comprehend Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written: "O most mighty, great, and powerful, the 
Lord of hosts is Thy Name. Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in 
thought" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++32:18,19">Jer. 32:18,19</a>). Therefore He cannot be comprehended.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for any created intellect to comprehend 
God; yet "for the mind to attain to God in some degree is great 
beatitude," as Augustine says (De Verb. Dim., Serm. xxxvii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In proof of this we must consider that what is comprehended is perfectly 
known; and that is perfectly known which is known so far as it can be 
known. Thus, if anything which is capable of scientific demonstration is 
held only by an opinion resting on a probably proof, it is not 
comprehended; as, for instance, if anyone  knows by scientific 
demonstration that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles, 
he comprehends that truth; whereas if anyone accepts it as a probable 
opinion because wise men or most men teach it, he cannot be said to 
comprehend the thing itself, because he does not attain to that perfect 
mode of knowledge of which it is intrinsically capable. But no created 
intellect can attain to that perfect mode of the knowledge of the Divine 
intellect whereof it is intrinsically capable. Which thus 
appears---Everything is knowable according to its actuality. But God, 
whose being is infinite, as was shown above (<A Href="FP007.html#FPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>) is infinitely 
knowable. Now no created intellect can know God infinitely. For the 
created intellect knows the Divine essence more or less perfectly in 
proportion as it receives a greater or lesser light of glory. Since 
therefore the created light of glory received into any created intellect 
cannot be infinite, it is clearly impossible for any created intellect to 
know God in an infinite degree. Hence it is impossible that it should 
comprehend God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Comprehension" is twofold: in one sense it is taken 
strictly and properly, according as something is included in the one 
comprehending; and thus in no way is God comprehended either by 
intellect, or in any other way; forasmuch as He is infinite and cannot be 
included in any finite being; so that no finite being can contain Him 
infinitely, in the degree of His own infinity. In this sense we now take 
comprehension. But in another sense "comprehension" is taken more largely 
as opposed to "non-attainment"; for he who attains to anyone is said to 
comprehend him when he attains to him. And in this sense God is 
comprehended by the blessed, according to the words, "I held him, and I 
will not let him go" (Cant 3:4); in this sense also are to be understood 
the words quoted from the Apostle concerning comprehension. And in this 
way "comprehension" is one of the three prerogatives of the soul, 
responding to hope, as vision responds to faith, and fruition responds to 
charity. For even among ourselves not everything seen is held or 
possessed, forasmuch as things either appear sometimes afar off, or they 
are not in our power of attainment. Neither, again, do we always enjoy 
what we possess; either because we find no pleasure in them, or because 
such things are not the ultimate end of our desire, so as to satisfy and 
quell it. But the blessed possess these three things in God; because they 
see Him, and in seeing Him, possess Him as present, having the power to 
see Him always; and possessing Him, they enjoy Him as the ultimate 
fulfilment of desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is called incomprehensible not because anything of Him 
is not seen; but because He is not seen as perfectly as He is capable of 
being seen; thus when any demonstrable proposition is known by probable 
reason only, it does not follow that any part of it is unknown, either 
the subject, or the predicate, or the composition; but that it is not as 
perfectly known as it is capable of being known. Hence Augustine, in his 
definition of comprehension, says the whole is comprehended when it is 
seen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer, or when 
its boundaries can be completely viewed or traced; for the  boundaries of 
a thing are said to be completely surveyed when the end of the knowledge 
of it is attained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The word "wholly" denotes a mode of the object; not that 
the whole object does not come under knowledge, but that the mode of the 
object is not the mode of the one who knows. Therefore he who sees God's 
essence, sees in Him that He exists infinitely, and is infinitely 
knowable; nevertheless, this infinite mode does not extend to enable the 
knower to know infinitely; thus, for instance, a person can have a 
probable opinion that a proposition is demonstrable, although he himself 
does not know it as demonstrated.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that those who see the essence of God see all things in 
God. For Gregory says (Dialog. iv): "What do they not see, who see Him 
Who sees all things?" But God sees all things. Therefore those who see 
God see all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever sees a mirror, sees what is reflected in the 
mirror. But all actual or possible things shine forth in God as in a 
mirror; for He knows all things in Himself. Therefore whoever sees God, 
sees all actual things in Him, and also all possible things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever understands the greater, can understand the 
least, as is said in De Anima iii. But all that God does, or can do, are 
less than His essence. Therefore whoever understands God, can understand 
all that God does, or can do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the rational creature naturally desires to know all 
things. Therefore if in seeing God it does not know all things, its 
natural desire will not rest satisfied; thus, in seeing God it will not 
be fully happy; which is incongruous. Therefore he who sees God knows all 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The angels see the essence of God; and yet do not know 
all things. For as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii), "the inferior angels 
are cleansed from ignorance by the superior angels." Also they are 
ignorant of future contingent things, and of secret thoughts; for this 
knowledge belongs to God alone. Therefore whosoever sees the essence of 
God, does not know all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The created intellect, in seeing the divine essence, does 
not see in it all that God does or can do. For it is manifest that things 
are seen in God as they are in Him. But all other things are in God as 
effects are in the power of their cause. Therefore all things are seen in 
God as an effect is seen in its cause. Now it is clear that the more 
perfectly a cause is seen, the more of its effects can be seen in it. For 
whoever has a lofty understanding, as soon as one demonstrative principle 
is put before him can gather the knowledge of many conclusions; but this 
is  beyond one of a weaker intellect, for he needs things to be explained 
to him separately. And so an intellect can know all the effects of a 
cause and the reasons for those effects in the cause itself, if it 
comprehends the cause wholly. Now no created intellect can comprehend God 
wholly, as shown above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore no created intellect in seeing 
God can know all that God does or can do, for this would be to comprehend 
His power; but of what God does or can do any intellect can know the 
more, the more perfectly it sees God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory speaks as regards the object being sufficient, 
namely, God, who in Himself sufficiently contains and shows forth all 
things; but it does not follow that whoever sees God knows all things, 
for he does not perfectly comprehend Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not necessary that whoever sees a mirror should see 
all that is in the mirror, unless his glance comprehends the mirror 
itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although it is more to see God than to see all things else, 
still it is a greater thing to see Him so that all things are known in 
Him, than to see Him in such a way that not all things, but the fewer or 
the more, are known in Him. For it has been shown in this article that 
the more things are known in God according as He is seen more or less 
perfectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The natural desire of the rational creature is to know 
everything that belongs to the perfection of the intellect, namely, the 
species and the genera of things and their types, and these everyone who 
sees the Divine essence will see in God. But to know other singulars, 
their thoughts and their deeds does not belong to the perfection of the 
created intellect nor does its natural desire go out to these things; 
neither, again, does it desire to know things that exist not as yet, but 
which God can call into being. Yet if God alone were seen, Who is the 
fount and principle of all being and of all truth, He would so fill the 
natural desire of knowledge that nothing else would be desired, and the 
seer would be completely beatified. Hence Augustine says (Confess. v): 
"Unhappy the man who knoweth all these" (i.e. all creatures) "and knoweth 
not Thee! but happy whoso knoweth Thee although he know not these. And 
whoso knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them, but for 
Thee alone."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether what is seen in God by those who see the Divine essence, is seen through any similitude?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that what is seen in God by those who see the Divine 
essence, is seen by means of some similitude. For every kind of knowledge 
comes about by the knower being assimilated to the object known. For thus 
the intellect in act becomes the actual intelligible, and the sense in 
act becomes the actual sensible, inasmuch as it is informed by a 
similitude of the object, as the eye by the similitude of color. 
Therefore if the intellect of one  who sees the Divine essence 
understands any creatures in God, it must be informed by their 
similitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what we have seen, we keep in memory. But Paul, seeing 
the essence of God whilst in ecstasy, when he had ceased to see the 
Divine essence, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 28,34), remembered 
many of the things he had seen in the rapture; hence he said: "I have 
heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++12:4">2 Cor. 12:4</a>). Therefore it must be said that certain similitudes of what he 
remembered, remained in his mind; and in the same way, when he actually 
saw the essence of God, he had certain similitudes or ideas of what he 
actually saw in it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A mirror and what is in it are seen by means of one 
likeness. But all things are seen in God as in an intelligible mirror. 
Therefore if God Himself is not seen by any similitude but by His own 
essence, neither are the things seen in Him seen by any similitudes or 
ideas.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Those who see the divine essence see what they see in God 
not by any likeness, but by the divine essence itself united to their 
intellect. For each thing is known in so far as its likeness is in the 
one who knows. Now this takes place in two ways. For as things which are 
like one and the same thing are like to each other, the cognitive faculty 
can be assimilated to any knowable object in two ways. In one way it is 
assimilated by the object itself, when it is directly informed by a 
similitude, and then the object is known in itself. In another way when 
informed by a similitude which resembles the object; and in this way, the 
knowledge is not of the thing in itself, but of the thing in its 
likeness. For the knowledge of a man in himself differs from the 
knowledge of him in his image. Hence to know things thus by their 
likeness in the one who knows, is to know them in themselves or in their 
own nature; whereas to know them by their similitudes pre-existing in 
God, is to see them in God. Now there is a difference between these two 
kinds of knowledge. Hence, according to the knowledge whereby things are 
known by those who see the essence of God, they are seen in God Himself 
not by any other similitudes but by the Divine essence alone present to 
the intellect; by which also God Himself is seen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The created intellect of one who sees God is assimilated to 
what is seen in God, inasmuch as it is united to the Divine essence, in 
which the similitudes of all things pre-exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some of the cognitive faculties form other images from 
those first conceived; thus the imagination from the preconceived images 
of a mountain and of gold can form the likeness of a golden mountain; and 
the intellect, from the preconceived ideas of genus and difference, forms 
the idea of species; in like manner from the similitude of an image we 
can form in our minds the similitude of the original of the image. Thus 
Paul, or any other person who sees God, by the very vision of the divine 
essence, can form in himself the similitudes of what is seen in the 
divine  essence, which remained in Paul even when he had ceased to see 
the essence of God. Still this kind of vision whereby things are seen by 
this likeness thus conceived, is not the same as that whereby things are 
seen in God.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that those who see the essence of God do not see all 
they see in Him at one and the same time. For according to the 
Philosopher (Topic. ii): "It may happen that many things are known, but 
only one is understood." But what is seen in God, is understood; for God 
is seen by the intellect. Therefore those who see God do not see all in 
Him at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 22,23), "God moves 
the spiritual creature according to time"---i.e. by intelligence and 
affection. But the spiritual creature is the angel who sees God. 
Therefore those who see God understand and are affected successively; for 
time means succession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xvi): "Our thoughts will not 
be unstable, going to and fro from one thing to another; but we shall see 
all we know at one glance."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> What is seen in the Word is seen not successively, but at 
the same time. In proof whereof, we ourselves cannot know many things all 
at once, forasmuch as understand many things by means of many ideas. But 
our intellect cannot be actually informed by many diverse ideas at the 
same time, so as to understand by them; as one body cannot bear different 
shapes simultaneously. Hence, when many things can be understood by one 
idea, they are understood at the same time; as the parts of a whole are 
understood successively, and not all at the same time, if each one is 
understood by its own idea; whereas if all are understood under the one 
idea of the whole, they are understood simultaneously. Now it was shown 
above that things seen in God, are not seen singly by their own 
similitude; but all are seen by the one essence of God. Hence they are 
seen simultaneously, and not successively.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We understand one thing only when we understand by one 
idea; but many things understood by one idea are understood 
simultaneously, as in the idea of a man we understand "animal" and 
"rational"; and in the idea of a house we understand the wall and the 
roof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As regards their natural knowledge, whereby they know 
things by diverse ideas given them, the angels do not know all things 
simultaneously, and thus they are moved in the act of understanding 
according to time; but as regards what they see in God, they see all at 
the same time.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that one can in this life see the Divine essence. For 
Jacob said: "I have seen God face to face" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++32:30">Gn. 32:30</a>). But to see Him 
face to face is to see His essence, as appears from the words: "We see 
now in a glass and in a dark manner, but then face to face" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13:12">1 Cor. 13:12</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Lord said to Moses: "I speak to him mouth to mouth, 
and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++12:8">Num. 12:8</a>); but this is to see God in His essence. Therefore it is possible to 
see the essence of God in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that wherein we know all other things, and whereby we 
judge of other things, is known in itself to us. But even now we know all 
things in God; for Augustine says (Confess. viii): "If we both see that 
what you say is true, and we both see that what I say is true; where, I 
ask, do we see this? neither I in thee, nor thou in me; but both of us in 
the very incommutable truth itself above our minds." He also says (De 
Vera Relig. xxx) that, "We judge of all things according to the divine 
truth"; and (De Trin. xii) that, "it is the duty of reason to judge of 
these corporeal things according to the incorporeal and eternal ideas; 
which unless they were above the mind could not be incommutable." 
Therefore even in this life we see God Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24, 25), those 
things that are in the soul by their essence are seen by intellectual 
vision. But intellectual vision is of intelligible things, not by 
similitudes, but by their very essences, as he also says (Gen. ad lit. 
xiii, 24,25). Therefore since God is in our soul by His essence, it 
follows that He is seen by us in His essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written, "Man shall not see Me, and live" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++32:20">Ex. 32:20</a>), and a gloss upon this says, "In this mortal life God can be seen 
by certain images, but not by the likeness itself of His own nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God cannot be seen in His essence by a mere human being, 
except he be separated from this mortal life. The reason is because, as 
was said above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the mode of knowledge follows the mode of the 
nature of the knower. But our soul, as long as we live in this life, has 
its being in corporeal matter; hence naturally it knows only what has a 
form in matter, or what can be known by such a form. Now it is evident 
that the Divine essence cannot be known through the nature of material 
things. For it was shown above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,9) that the knowledge of God by 
means of any created similitude is not the vision of His essence. Hence 
it is impossible for the soul of man in this life to see the essence of 
God. This can be seen in the fact that the more our soul is abstracted 
from corporeal things, the more it is capable of receiving abstract 
intelligible things. Hence in dreams and alienations of the bodily senses 
divine revelations and foresight  of future events are perceived the more 
clearly. It is not possible, therefore, that the soul in this mortal life 
should be raised up to the supreme of intelligible objects, i.e. to the 
divine essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv) a man is said in 
the Scriptures to see God in the sense that certain figures are formed in 
the senses or imagination, according to some similitude representing in 
part the divinity. So when Jacob says, "I have seen God face to face," 
this does not mean the Divine essence, but some figure representing God. 
And this is to be referred to some high mode of prophecy, so that God 
seems to speak, though in an imaginary vision; as will later be explained 
(<A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS174.html#SSQ174OUTP1">Question [174]</a>) in treating of the degrees of prophecy. We may also say that 
Jacob spoke thus to designate some exalted intellectual contemplation, 
above the ordinary state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As God works miracles in corporeal things, so also He does 
supernatural wonders above the common order, raising the minds of some 
living in the flesh beyond the use of sense, even up to the vision of His 
own essence; as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 26,27,28) of Moses, the 
teacher of the Jews; and of Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles. This will 
be treated more fully in the question of rapture (<A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS175.html#SSQ175OUTP1">Question [175]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All things are said to be seen in God and all things are 
judged in Him, because by the participation of His light, we know and 
judge all things; for the light of natural reason itself is a 
participation of the divine light; as likewise we are said to see and 
judge of sensible things in the sun, i.e., by the sun's light. Hence 
Augustine says (Soliloq. i, 8), "The lessons of instruction can only be 
seen as it were by their own sun," namely God. As therefore in order to 
see a sensible object, it is not necessary to see the substance of the 
sun, so in like manner to see any intelligible object, it is not 
necessary to see the essence of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[11] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Intellectual vision is of the things which are in the soul 
by their essence, as intelligible things are in the intellect. And thus 
God is in the souls of the blessed; not thus is He in our soul, but by 
presence, essence and power.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that by natural reason we cannot know God in this life. 
For Boethius says (De Consol. v) that "reason does not grasp simple

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the knowledge of natural reason belongs to both good and 
evil, inasmuch as they have a common nature. But the knowledge of God 
belongs only to the good; for Augustine says (De Trin. i): "The weak eye 
of the human mind is not fixed on that excellent light unless purified by 
the justice of faith." Therefore God cannot be known by natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1:19">Rm. 1:19</a>), "That which is known of God," 
namely, what can be known of God by natural reason, "is manifest in them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Our natural knowledge begins from sense. Hence our 
natural knowledge can go as far as it can be led by sensible things. But 
our mind cannot be led by sense so far as to see the essence of God; 
because the sensible effects of God do not equal the power of God as 
their cause. Hence from the knowledge of sensible things the whole power 
of God cannot be known; nor therefore can His essence be seen. But 
because they are His effects and depend on their cause, we can be led 
from them so far as to know of God "whether He exists," and to know of 
Him what must necessarily belong to Him, as the first cause of all 
things, exceeding all things caused by Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence we know that His relationship with creatures so far as to be the 
cause of them all; also that creatures differ from Him, inasmuch as He is 
not in any way part of what is caused by Him; and that creatures are not 
removed from Him by reason of any defect on His part, but because He 
superexceeds them all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Reason cannot reach up to simple form, so as to know "what 
it is"; but it can know "whether it is."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is known by natural knowledge through the images of His 
effects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the knowledge of God's essence is by grace, it belongs 
only to the good; but the knowledge of Him by natural reason can belong 
to both good and bad; and hence Augustine says (Retract. i), retracting 
what he had said before: "I do not approve what I said in prayer, 'God 
who willest that only the pure should know truth.' For it can be answered 
that many who are not pure can know many truths," i.e. by natural reason.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether by grace a higher knowledge of God can be obtained than by natural reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that by grace a higher knowledge of God is not obtained 
than by natural reason. For Dionysius says (De Mystica Theol. i) that 
whoever is the more united to God in this life, is united to Him as to 
one entirely unknown. He says the same of Moses, who nevertheless 
obtained a certain excellence by the  knowledge conferred by grace. But 
to be united to God while ignoring of Him "what He is," comes about also 
by natural reason. Therefore God is not more known to us by grace than by 
natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we can acquire the knowledge of divine things by natural 
reason only through the imagination; and the same applies to the 
knowledge given by grace. For Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it is 
impossible for the divine ray to shine upon us except as screened round 
about by the many colored sacred veils." Therefore we cannot know God 
more fully by grace than by natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our intellect adheres to God by grace of faith. But 
faith does not seem to be knowledge; for Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Ev.) 
that "things not seen are the objects of faith, and not of knowledge." 
Therefore there is not given to us a more excellent knowledge of God by 
grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says that "God hath revealed to us His 
spirit," what "none of the princes of this world knew" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2:10">1 Cor. 2:10</a>), 
namely, the philosophers, as the gloss expounds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We have a more perfect knowledge of God by grace than by 
natural reason. Which is proved thus. The knowledge which we have by 
natural reason contains two things: images derived from the sensible 
objects; and the natural intelligible light, enabling us to abstract from 
them intelligible conceptions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in both of these, human knowledge is assisted by the revelation of 
grace. For the intellect's natural light is strengthened by the infusion 
of gratuitous light; and sometimes also the images in the human 
imagination are divinely formed, so as to express divine things better 
than those do which we receive from sensible objects, as appears in 
prophetic visions; while sometimes sensible things, or even voices, are 
divinely formed to express some divine meaning; as in the Baptism, the 
Holy Ghost was seen in the shape of a dove, and the voice of the Father 
was heard, "This is My beloved Son" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++3:17">Mt. 3:17</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although by the revelation of grace in this life we cannot 
know of God "what He is," and thus are united to Him as to one unknown; 
still we know Him more fully according as many and more excellent of His 
effects are demonstrated to us, and according as we attribute to Him some 
things known by divine revelation, to which natural reason cannot reach, 
as, for instance, that God is Three and One.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the images either received from sense in the natural 
order, or divinely formed in the imagination, we have so much the more 
excellent intellectual knowledge, the stronger the intelligible light is 
in man; and thus through the revelation given by the images a fuller 
knowledge is received by the infusion of the divine light. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[12] A[13] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Faith is a kind of knowledge, inasmuch as the intellect is 
determined by faith to some knowable object. But this determination to 
one object does not proceed from the vision of the believer, but from the 
vision of Him who is believed. Thus as far as faith falls short of 
vision, it falls short of the knowledge which belongs to science, for 
science determines the intellect to one object by the vision and 
understanding of first principles.<br>
