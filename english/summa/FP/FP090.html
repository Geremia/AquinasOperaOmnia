<H3 Align="Center">OF THE FIRST PRODUCTION OF MAN'S SOUL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After the foregoing we must consider the first production of man, 
concerning which there are four subjects of treatment: (1) the production 
of man himself; (2) the end of this production; (3) the state and 
condition of the first man; (4) the place of his abode. Concerning the 
production of man, there are three things to be considered: (1) the 
production of man's soul; (2) the production of man's body; (3) the 
production of the woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP090.html#FPQ90A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man's soul was something made, or was of the Divine 
substance?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP090.html#FPQ90A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether, if made, it was created?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP090.html#FPQ90A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it was made by angelic instrumentality?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP090.html#FPQ90A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was made before the body?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul was not made, but was God's 
substance. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2:7">Gn. 2:7</a>): "God formed man of the slime of 
the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man was 
made a living soul." But he who breathes sends forth something of 
himself. Therefore the soul, whereby man lives, is of the Divine 
substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as above explained (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the soul is a simple 
form. But a form is an act. Therefore the soul is a pure act; which 
applies to God alone. Therefore the soul is of God's substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that exist and do differ are the same. But God 
and the mind exist, and in no way differ, for they could only be 
differentiated by certain differences, and thus would be composite. 
Therefore God and the human mind are the same. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Orig. Animae iii, 15) mentions certain 
opinions which he calls "exceedingly and evidently perverse, and contrary 
to the Catholic Faith," among which the first is the opinion that "God 
made the soul not out of nothing, but from Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To say that the soul is of the Divine substance involves 
a manifest improbability. For, as is clear from what has been said (<A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="FP077.html#FPQ77A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), the human soul is sometimes in a state 
of potentiality to the act of intelligence ---acquires its knowledge 
somehow from things---and thus has various powers; all of which are 
incompatible with the Divine Nature, Which is a pure act---receives 
nothing from any other---and admits of no variety in itself, as we have 
proved (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,7; <A Href="FP009.html#FPQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FP009.html#FPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This error seems to have originated from two statements of the ancients. 
For those who first began to observe the nature of things, being unable 
to rise above their imagination, supposed that nothing but bodies 
existed. Therefore they said that God was a body, which they considered 
to be the principle of other bodies. And since they held that the soul 
was of the same nature as that body which they regarded as the first 
principle, as is stated De Anima i, 2, it followed that the soul was of 
the nature of God Himself. According to this supposition, also, the 
Manichaeans, thinking that God was corporeal light, held that the soul 
was part of that light bound up with the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a further step in advance was made, and some surmised the existence 
of something incorporeal, not apart from the body, but the form of a 
body; so that Varro said, "God is a soul governing the world by movement 
and reason," as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei vii, 6 [*The words as 
quoted are to be found iv. 31.]) So some supposed man's soul to be part 
of that one soul, as man is a part of the whole world; for they were 
unable to go so far as to understand the different degrees of spiritual 
substance, except according to the distinction of bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, all these theories are impossible, as proved above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,8; and <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), wherefore it is evidently false that the soul is of the 
substance of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The term "breathe" is not to be taken in the material 
sense; but as regards the act of God, to breathe [spirare], is the same 
as to "make a spirit." Moreover, in the material sense, man by breathing 
does not send forth anything of his own substance, but an extraneous 
thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the soul is a simple form in its essence, yet it 
is not its own existence, but is a being by participation, as above 
explained (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4). Therefore it is not a pure act like God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which differs, properly speaking, differs in  
something; wherefore we seek for difference where we find also 
resemblance. For this reason things which differ must in some way be 
compound; since they differ in something, and in something resemble each 
other. In this sense, although all that differ are diverse, yet all 
things that are diverse do not differ. For simple things are diverse; yet 
do not differ from one another by differences which enter into their 
composition. For instance, a man and a horse differ by the difference of 
rational and irrational; but we cannot say that these again differ by 
some further difference.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the soul was produced by creation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul was not produced by creation. For 
that which has in itself something material is produced from matter. But 
the soul is in part material, since it is not a pure act. Therefore the 
soul was made of matter; and hence it was not created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every actuality of matter is educed from the 
potentiality of that matter; for since matter is in potentiality to act, 
any act pre-exists in matter potentially. But the soul is the act of 
corporeal matter, as is clear from its definition. Therefore the soul is 
educed from the potentiality of matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soul is a form. Therefore, if the soul is created, 
all other forms also are created. Thus no forms would come into existence 
by generation; which is not true.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++1:27">Gn. 1:27</a>): "God created man to His own 
image." But man is like to God in his soul. Therefore the soul was 
created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The rational soul can be made only by creation; which, 
however, is not true of other forms. The reason is because, since to be 
made is the way to existence, a thing must be made in such a way as is 
suitable to its mode of existence. Now that properly exists which itself 
has existence; as it were, subsisting in its own existence. Wherefore 
only substances are properly and truly called beings; whereas an accident 
has not existence, but something is (modified) by it, and so far is it 
called a being; for instance, whiteness is called a being, because by it 
something is white. Hence it is said Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 1 that an 
accident should be described as "of something rather than as something." 
The same is to be said of all non-subsistent forms. Therefore, properly 
speaking, it does not belong to any non-existing form to be made; but 
such are said to be made through the composite substances being made. On 
the other hand, the rational soul is a subsistent form, as above 
explained (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Wherefore it is competent to be and to be made. 
And since it cannot be made of pre-existing matter---whether corporeal, 
which would render it a corporeal being---or spiritual, which would 
involve the transmutation of one spiritual substance into another, we 
must conclude that it cannot exist except by creation. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The soul's simple essence is as the material element, while 
its participated existence is its formal element; which participated 
existence necessarily co-exists with the soul's essence, because 
existence naturally follows the form. The same reason holds if the soul 
is supposed to be composed of some spiritual matter, as some maintain; 
because the said matter is not in potentiality to another form, as 
neither is the matter of a celestial body; otherwise the soul would be 
corruptible. Wherefore the soul cannot in any way be made of pre-existent 
matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The production of act from the potentiality of matter is 
nothing else but something becoming actually that previously was in 
potentiality. But since the rational soul does not depend in its 
existence on corporeal matter, and is subsistent, and exceeds the 
capacity of corporeal matter, as we have seen (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it is not 
educed from the potentiality of matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As we have said, there is no comparison between the 
rational soul and other forms.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the rational soul is produced by God immediately?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rational soul is not immediately made by 
God, but by the instrumentality of the angels. For spiritual things have 
more order than corporeal things. But inferior bodies are produced by 
means of the superior, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore also 
the inferior spirits, who are the rational souls, are produced by means 
of the superior spirits, the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end corresponds to the beginning of things; for God 
is the beginning and end of all. Therefore the issue of things from their 
beginning corresponds to the forwarding of them to their end. But 
"inferior things are forwarded by the higher," as Dionysius says (Eccl. 
Hier. v); therefore also the inferior are produced into existence by the 
higher, and souls by angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "perfect is that which can produce its like," as is 
stated Metaph. v. But spiritual substances are much more perfect than 
corporeal. Therefore, since bodies produce their like in their own 
species, much more are angels able to produce something specifically 
inferior to themselves; and such is the rational soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2:7">Gn. 2:7</a>) that God Himself "breathed into 
the face of man the breath of life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that angels, acting by the power of God, 
produce rational souls. But this is quite impossible, and is against 
faith. For it has been proved that the rational soul cannot be produced 
except by creation. Now, God alone can create;  for the first agent alone 
can act without presupposing the existence of anything; while the second 
cause always presupposes something derived from the first cause, as above 
explained (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and every agent, that presupposes something to 
its act, acts by making a change therein. Therefore everything else acts 
by producing a change, whereas God alone acts by creation. Since, 
therefore, the rational soul cannot be produced by a change in matter, it 
cannot be produced, save immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the replies to the objections are clear. For that bodies produce 
their like or something inferior to themselves, and that the higher 
things lead forward the inferior---all these things are effected through 
a certain transmutation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the human soul was produced before the body?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human soul was made before the body. For 
the work of creation preceded the work of distinction and adornment, as 
shown above (<A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="FP066.html#FPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP070.html#FPQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="FP070.html#FPQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the soul was made by 
creation; whereas the body was made at the end of the work of adornment. 
Therefore the soul of man was made before the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the rational soul has more in common with the angels 
than with the brute animals. But angels were created before bodies, or at 
least, at the beginning with corporeal matter; whereas the body of man 
was formed on the sixth day, when also the animals were made. Therefore 
the soul of man was created before the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the end is proportionate to the beginning. But in the 
end the soul outlasts the body. Therefore in the beginning it was created 
before the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The proper act is produced in its proper potentiality. 
Therefore since the soul is the proper act of the body, the soul was 
produced in the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Origen (Peri Archon i, 7,8) held that not only the soul 
of the first man, but also the souls of all men were created at the same 
time as the angels, before their bodies: because he thought that all 
spiritual substances, whether souls or angels, are equal in their natural 
condition, and differ only by merit; so that some of them---namely, the 
souls of men or of heavenly bodies---are united to bodies while others 
remain in their different orders entirely free from matter. Of this 
opinion we have already spoken (<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); and so we need say nothing 
about it here.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine, however (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24), says that the soul of the 
first man was created at the same time as the angels, before the body, 
for another reason; because he supposes that the body of man, during the 
work of the six days, was produced, not actually, but only as to some 
"causal virtues"; which cannot be said of the soul, because neither was 
it made of any pre-existing corporeal or  spiritual matter, nor could it 
be produced from any created virtue. Therefore it seems that the soul 
itself, during the work of the six days, when all things were made, was 
created, together with the angels; and that afterwards, by its own will, 
was joined to the service of the body. But he does not say this by way of 
assertion; as his words prove. For he says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 29): "We 
may believe, if neither Scripture nor reason forbid, that man was made on 
the sixth day, in the sense that his body was created as to its causal 
virtue in the elements of the world, but that the soul was already 
created."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this could be upheld by those who hold that the soul has of itself a 
complete species and nature, and that it is not united to the body as its 
form, but as its administrator. But if the soul is united to the body as 
its form, and is naturally a part of human nature, the above supposition 
is quite impossible. For it is clear that God made the first things in 
their perfect natural state, as their species required. Now the soul, as 
a part of human nature, has its natural perfection only as united to the 
body. Therefore it would have been unfitting for the soul to be created 
without the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, if we admit the opinion of Augustine about the work of the 
six days (<A Href="FP074.html#FPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="FP074.html#FPQ74A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), we may say that the human soul preceded in the 
work of the six days by a certain generic similitude, so far as it has 
intellectual nature in common with the angels; but was itself created at 
the same time as the body. According to the other saints, both the body 
and soul of the first man were produced in the work of the six days.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If the soul by its nature were a complete species, so that 
it might be created as to itself, this reason would prove that the soul 
was created by itself in the beginning. But as the soul is naturally the 
form of the body, it was necessarily created, not separately, but in the 
body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same observation applies to the second objection. For 
if the soul had a species of itself it would have something still more in 
common with the angels. But, as the form of the body, it belongs to the 
animal genus, as a formal principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[90] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That the soul remains after the body, is due to a defect of 
the body, namely, death. Which defect was not due when the soul was first 
created.<br>
