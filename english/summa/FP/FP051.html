    OF THE ANGELS IN COMPARISON WITH BODIES (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We next inquire about the angels in comparison with corporeal things; and in
    the first place about their comparison with bodies; secondly, of the angels
    in comparison with corporeal places; and, thirdly, of their comparison with
    local movement.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first heading there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether angels have bodies
    naturally united to them?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FP051.html#FPQ51A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they assume bodies?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP051.html#FPQ51A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they exercise functions of
    life in the bodies assumed?<br />

    Whether the angels have bodies naturally united to them?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that angels have bodies naturally
    united to them. For Origen says (Peri Archon i): "It is God's attribute
    alone---that is, it belongs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as a
    property of nature, that He is understood to exist without any material
    substance and without any companionship of corporeal addition." Bernard
    likewise says (Hom. vi. super Cant.): "Let us assign incorporeity to God
    alone even as we do immortality, whose nature alone, neither for its own
    sake nor on account of anything else, needs the help of any corporeal organ.
    But it is clear that every created spirit needs corporeal substance."
    Augustine also says (Gen. ad lit. iii): "The demons are called animals of
    the atmosphere because their nature is akin to that of aerial bodies." But
    the nature of demons and angels is the same. Therefore angels have bodies
    naturally united to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory (Hom. x in Ev.) calls an angel a
    rational animal. But every animal is composed of body and soul. Therefore
    angels have bodies naturally united to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, life is more perfect in the angels than
    in souls. But the soul not only lives, but gives life to the body. Therefore
    the angels animate bodies which are naturally united to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the
    angels are understood to be incorporeal."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The angels have not bodies naturally united to
    them. For whatever belongs to any nature as an accident is not found
    universally in that nature; thus, for instance, to have wings, because it is
    not of the essence of an animal, does not belong to every animal. Now since
    to understand is not the act of a body, nor of any corporeal energy, as will
    be shown later (<a href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that to have
    a body united to it is not of the nature of an intellectual substance, as
    such; but it is accidental to some intellectual substance on account of
    something else. Even so it belongs to the human soul to be united to a body,
    because it is imperfect and exists potentially in the genus of intellectual
    substances, not having the fulness of knowledge in its own nature, but
    acquiring it from sensible things through the bodily senses, as will be
    explained later on (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>;
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>,
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now whenever we find
    something imperfect in any genus we must presuppose something perfect in
    that genus. Therefore in the intellectual nature there are some perfectly
    intellectual substances, which do not need to acquire knowledge from
    sensible things. Consequently not all intellectual substances are united to
    bodies; but some are quite separated from bodies, and these we call
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) it was the opinion of
    some that every being is a body; and consequently some seem to have thought
    that there were no incorporeal substances existing except as united to
    bodies; so much so that some even held that God was the soul of the world,
    as Augustine tells us (De Civ. Dei vii). As this is contrary to Catholic
    Faith, which asserts that God is exalted above all things, according to Ps.
    8:2: "Thy magnificence is exalted beyond the heavens"; Origen, while
    refusing to say such a thing of God, followed the above opinion of others
    regarding the other substances; being deceived here as he was also in many
    other points, by following the opinions of the ancient philosophers.
    Bernard's expression can be explained, that the created spirit needs some
    bodily instrument, which is not naturally united to it, but assumed for some
    purpose, as will be explained (<a href="FP051.html#FPQ51A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Augustine speaks, not as asserting the fact, but merely using the
    opinion of the Platonists, who maintained that there are some aerial
    animals, which they termed demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory calls the angel a rational
    animal metaphorically, on account of the likeness to the rational nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To give life effectively is a perfection
    simply speaking; hence it belongs to God, as is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++2%3A6"
      >1 Kgs. 2:6</a
    >): "The Lord killeth, and maketh alive." But to give life formally belongs
    to a substance which is part of some nature, and which has not within itself
    the full nature of the species. Hence an intellectual substance which is not
    united to a body is more perfect than one which is united to a body.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether angels assume bodies?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that angels do not assume bodies.
    For there is nothing superfluous in the work of an angel, as there is
    nothing of the kind in the work of nature. But it would be superfluous for
    the angels to assume bodies, because an angel has no need for a body, since
    his own power exceeds all bodily power. Therefore an angel does not assume a
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every assumption is terminated in some
    union; because to assume implies a taking to oneself [ad se sumere]. But a
    body is not united to an angel as to a form, as stated (<a
      href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >); while in so far as it is united to the angel as to a mover, it is not
    said to be assumed, otherwise it would follow that all bodies moved by the
    angels are assumed by them. Therefore the angels do not assume bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, angels do not assume bodies from the
    earth or water, or they could not suddenly disappear; nor again from fire,
    otherwise they would burn whatever things they touched; nor again from air,
    because air is without shape or color. Therefore the angels do not assume
    bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xvi) that angels
    appeared to Abraham under assumed bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have maintained that the angels never
    assume bodies, but that all that we read in Scripture of apparitions of
    angels happened in prophetic vision---that is, according to imagination. But
    this is contrary to the intent of Scripture; for whatever is beheld in
    imaginary vision is only in the beholder's imagination, and consequently is
    not seen by everybody. Yet Divine Scripture from time to time introduces
    angels so apparent as to be seen commonly by all; just as the angels who
    appeared to Abraham were seen by him and by his whole family, by Lot, and by
    the citizens of Sodom; in like manner the angel who appeared to Tobias was
    seen by all present. From all this it is clearly shown that such apparitions
    were beheld by bodily vision, whereby the object seen exists outside the
    person beholding it, and can accordingly be seen by all. Now by such a
    vision only a body can be beheld. Consequently, since the angels are not
    bodies, nor have they bodies naturally united with them, as is clear from
    what has been said (<a href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>,
    <a href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it follows that they
    sometimes assume bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Angels need an assumed body, not for
    themselves, but on our account; that by conversing familiarly with men they
    may give evidence of that intellectual companionship which men expect to
    have with them in the life to come. Moreover that angels assumed bodies
    under the Old Law was a figurative indication that the Word of God would
    take a human body; because all the apparitions in the Old Testament were
    ordained to that one whereby the Son of God appeared in the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The body assumed is united to the angel
    not as its form, nor merely as its mover, but as its mover represented by
    the assumed movable body. For as in the Sacred Scripture the properties of
    intelligible things are set forth by the likenesses of things sensible, in
    the same way by Divine power sensible bodies are so fashioned by angels as
    fittingly to represent the intelligible properties of an angel. And this is
    what we mean by an angel assuming a body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although air as long as it is in a state
    of rarefaction has neither shape nor color, yet when condensed it can both
    be shaped and colored as appears in the clouds. Even so the angels assume
    bodies of air, condensing it by the Divine power in so far as is needful for
    forming the assumed body.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the angels exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels exercise functions
    of life in assumed bodies. For pretence is unbecoming in angels of truth.
    But it would be pretence if the body assumed by them, which seems to live
    and to exercise vital functions, did not possess these functions. Therefore
    the angels exercise functions of life in the assumed body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the works of the angels there is
    nothing without a purpose. But eyes, nostrils, and the other instruments of
    the senses, would be fashioned without a purpose in the body assumed by the
    angel, if he perceived nothing by their means. Consequently, the angel
    perceives by the assumed body; and this is the most special function of
    life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to move hither and thither is one of the
    functions of life, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii). But the angels are
    manifestly seen to move in their assumed bodies. For it was said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++18%3A16"
      >Gn. 18:16</a
    >) that "Abraham walked with" the angels, who had appeared to him, "bringing
    them on the way"; and when Tobias said to the angel (Tob. 5:7,8): "Knowest
    thou the way that leadeth to the city of Medes?" he answered: "I know it;
    and I have often walked through all the ways thereof." Therefore the angels
    often exercise functions of life in assumed bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, speech is the function of a living
    subject, for it is produced by the voice, while the voice itself is a sound
    conveyed from the mouth. But it is evident from many passages of Sacred
    Scripture that angels spoke in assumed bodies. Therefore in their assumed
    bodies they exercise functions of life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, eating is a purely animal function.
    Hence the Lord after His Resurrection ate with His disciples in proof of
    having resumed life (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24"
      >Lk. 24</a
    >). Now when angels appeared in their assumed bodies they ate, and Abraham
    offered them food, after having previously adored them as God (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++18"
      >Gn. 18</a
    >). Therefore the angels exercise functions of life in assumed bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, to beget offspring is a vital act. But
    this has befallen the angels in their assumed bodies; for it is related:
    "After the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought
    forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++6%3A4"
      >Gn. 6:4</a
    >). Consequently the angels exercised vital functions in their assumed
    bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The bodies assumed by angels have no life, as
    was stated in the previous article (ad 3). Therefore they cannot exercise
    functions of life through assumed bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some functions of living subjects have
    something in common with other operations; just as speech, which is the
    function of a living creature, agrees with other sounds of inanimate things,
    in so far as it is sound; and walking agrees with other movements, in so far
    as it is movement. Consequently vital functions can be performed in assumed
    bodies by the angels, as to that which is common in such operations; but not
    as to that which is special to living subjects; because, according to the
    Philosopher (De Somn. et Vig. i), "that which has the faculty has the
    action." Hence nothing can have a function of life except what has life,
    which is the potential principle of such action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As it is in no wise contrary to truth
    for intelligible things to be set forth in Scripture under sensible figures,
    since it is not said for the purpose of maintaining that intelligible things
    are sensible, but in order that properties of intelligible things may be
    understood according to similitude through sensible figures; so it is not
    contrary to the truth of the holy angels that through their assumed bodies
    they appear to be living men, although they are really not. For the bodies
    are assumed merely for this purpose, that the spiritual properties and works
    of the angels may be manifested by the properties of man and of his works.
    This could not so fittingly be done if they were to assume true men; because
    the properties of such men would lead us to men, and not to angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sensation is entirely a vital function.
    Consequently it can in no way be said that the angels perceive through the
    organs of their assumed bodies. Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain;
    for they are not fashioned for the purpose of sensation through them, but to
    this end, that by such bodily organs the spiritual powers of the angels may
    be made manifest; just as by the eye the power of the angel's knowledge is
    pointed out, and other powers by the other members, as Dionysius teaches
    (Coel. Hier.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Movement coming from a united mover is a
    proper function of life; but the bodies assumed by the angels are not thus
    moved, since the angels are not their forms. Yet the angels are moved
    accidentally, when such bodies are moved, since they are in them as movers
    are in the moved; and they are here in such a way as not to be elsewhere
    which cannot be said of God. Accordingly, although God is not moved when the
    things are moved in which He exists, since He is everywhere; yet the angels
    are moved accidentally according to the movement of the bodies assumed. But
    they are not moved according to the movement of the heavenly bodies, even
    though they be in them as the movers in the thing moved, because the
    heavenly bodies do not change place in their entirety; nor for the spirit
    which moves the world is there any fixed locality according to any
    restricted part of the world's substance, which now is in the east, and now
    in the west, but according to a fixed quarter; because "the moving energy is
    always in the east," as stated in Phys. viii, text 84.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Properly speaking, the angels do not
    talk through their assumed bodies; yet there is a semblance of speech, in so
    far as they fashion sounds in the air like to human voices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Properly speaking, the angels cannot be
    said to eat, because eating involves the taking of food convertible into the
    substance of the eater.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Although after the Resurrection food was not converted into the substance of
    Christ's body, but resolved into pre-existing matter; nevertheless Christ
    had a body of such a true nature that food could be changed into it; hence
    it was a true eating. But the food taken by angels was neither changed into
    the assumed body, nor was the body of such a nature that food could be
    changed into it; consequently, it was not a true eating, but figurative of
    spiritual eating. This is what the angel said to Tobias: "When I was with
    you, I seemed indeed to eat and to drink; but I use an invisible meat and
    drink" (Tob. 12:19).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Abraham offered them food, deeming them to be men, in whom, nevertheless, he
    worshipped God, as God is wont to be in the prophets, as Augustine says (De
    Civ. Dei xvi).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv):
    "Many persons affirm that they have had the experience, or have heard from
    such as have experienced it, that the Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk
    call incubi, have often presented themselves before women, and have sought
    and procured intercourse with them. Hence it is folly to deny it. But God's
    holy angels could not fall in such fashion before the deluge. Hence by the
    sons of God are to be understood the sons of Seth, who were good; while by
    the daughters of men the Scripture designates those who sprang from the race
    of Cain. Nor is it to be wondered at that giants should be born of them; for
    they were not all giants, albeit there were many more before than after the
    deluge." Still if some are occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from
    the seed of such demons, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of
    men taken for the purpose; as when the demon assumes first the form of a
    woman, and afterwards of a man; just as they take the seed of other things
    for other generating purposes, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii), so that the
    person born is not the child of a demon, but of a man.<br />
