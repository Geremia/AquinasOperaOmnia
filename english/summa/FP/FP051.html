<H3 Align="Center">OF THE ANGELS IN COMPARISON WITH BODIES (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We next inquire about the angels in comparison with corporeal things; 
and in the first place about their comparison with bodies; secondly, of 
the angels in comparison with corporeal places; and, thirdly, of their 
comparison with local movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first heading there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether angels have bodies naturally united to them?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they assume bodies?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that angels have bodies naturally united to them. 
For Origen says (Peri Archon i): "It is God's attribute alone---that is, 
it belongs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as a property of 
nature, that He is understood to exist without any material substance and 
without any companionship of corporeal addition." Bernard likewise says 
(Hom. vi. super Cant.): "Let us assign incorporeity to God alone even as 
we do immortality, whose nature alone, neither for its own sake nor on 
account of anything else, needs the help of any corporeal organ. But it 
is clear that every created spirit needs corporeal substance." Augustine 
also says (Gen. ad lit. iii): "The demons are called animals of the 
atmosphere because their nature is akin to that of aerial bodies." But 
the nature of demons and angels is the same. Therefore angels have bodies 
naturally united to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory (Hom. x in Ev.) calls an angel a rational 
animal. But every animal is composed of body and soul. Therefore angels 
have bodies naturally united to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, life is more perfect in the angels than in souls. But 
the soul not only lives, but gives life to the body. Therefore the angels 
animate bodies which are naturally united to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the angels are 
understood to be incorporeal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angels have not bodies naturally united to them. For 
whatever belongs to any nature as an accident is not found universally in 
that nature; thus, for instance, to have wings, because it is not of the 
essence of an animal, does not belong to every animal. Now since to 
understand is not the act of a body, nor of any corporeal energy, as will 
be shown later (<A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that to have a body united to it 
is not of the nature of an intellectual substance, as such; but it is 
accidental to some intellectual substance on account of something else. 
Even so it belongs to the human soul to be united to a body, because it 
is imperfect and exists potentially in the genus of intellectual 
substances, not having the fulness of knowledge in its own nature, but 
acquiring it from sensible things through the bodily senses, as will be 
explained later on (<A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>, <A Href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now whenever we find 
something imperfect in any genus we must presuppose something perfect in 
that genus. Therefore in the intellectual nature there are some perfectly 
intellectual substances, which do not need to acquire knowledge from 
sensible things. Consequently not all intellectual substances are united 
to bodies; but some are quite separated from bodies, and these we call 
angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) it was the opinion of some 
that every being is a body; and consequently some seem to have thought 
that there were no incorporeal substances existing except  as united to 
bodies; so much so that some even held that God was the soul of the 
world, as Augustine tells us (De Civ. Dei vii). As this is contrary to 
Catholic Faith, which asserts that God is exalted above all things, 
according to Ps. 8:2: "Thy magnificence is exalted beyond the heavens"; 
Origen, while refusing to say such a thing of God, followed the above 
opinion of others regarding the other substances; being deceived here as 
he was also in many other points, by following the opinions of the 
ancient philosophers. Bernard's expression can be explained, that the 
created spirit needs some bodily instrument, which is not naturally 
united to it, but assumed for some purpose, as will be explained (<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Augustine speaks, not as asserting the fact, but merely using the opinion 
of the Platonists, who maintained that there are some aerial animals, 
which they termed demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory calls the angel a rational animal metaphorically, 
on account of the likeness to the rational nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To give life effectively is a perfection simply speaking; 
hence it belongs to God, as is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Sam++2:6">1 Kgs. 2:6</a>): "The Lord killeth, and 
maketh alive." But to give life formally belongs to a substance which is 
part of some nature, and which has not within itself the full nature of 
the species. Hence an intellectual substance which is not united to a 
body is more perfect than one which is united to a body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether angels assume bodies?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that angels do not assume bodies. For there is 
nothing superfluous in the work of an angel, as there is nothing of the 
kind in the work of nature. But it would be superfluous for the angels to 
assume bodies, because an angel has no need for a body, since his own 
power exceeds all bodily power. Therefore an angel does not assume a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every assumption is terminated in some union; because to 
assume implies a taking to oneself [ad se sumere]. But a body is not 
united to an angel as to a form, as stated (<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); while in so far as it 
is united to the angel as to a mover, it is not said to be assumed, 
otherwise it would follow that all bodies moved by the angels are assumed 
by them. Therefore the angels do not assume bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, angels do not assume bodies from the earth or water, or 
they could not suddenly disappear; nor again from fire, otherwise they 
would burn whatever things they touched; nor again from air, because air 
is without shape or color. Therefore the angels do not assume bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xvi) that angels appeared 
to Abraham under assumed bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have maintained that the angels never  assume 
bodies, but that all that we read in Scripture of apparitions of angels 
happened in prophetic vision---that is, according to imagination. But 
this is contrary to the intent of Scripture; for whatever is beheld in 
imaginary vision is only in the beholder's imagination, and consequently 
is not seen by everybody. Yet Divine Scripture from time to time 
introduces angels so apparent as to be seen commonly by all; just as the 
angels who appeared to Abraham were seen by him and by his whole family, 
by Lot, and by the citizens of Sodom; in like manner the angel who 
appeared to Tobias was seen by all present. From all this it is clearly 
shown that such apparitions were beheld by bodily vision, whereby the 
object seen exists outside the person beholding it, and can accordingly 
be seen by all. Now by such a vision only a body can be beheld. 
Consequently, since the angels are not bodies, nor have they bodies 
naturally united with them, as is clear from what has been said (<A Href="FP051.html#FPQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it follows that they sometimes assume bodies.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Angels need an assumed body, not for themselves, but on our 
account; that by conversing familiarly with men they may give evidence of 
that intellectual companionship which men expect to have with them in the 
life to come. Moreover that angels assumed bodies under the Old Law was a 
figurative indication that the Word of God would take a human body; 
because all the apparitions in the Old Testament were ordained to that 
one whereby the Son of God appeared in the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The body assumed is united to the angel not as its form, 
nor merely as its mover, but as its mover represented by the assumed 
movable body. For as in the Sacred Scripture the properties of 
intelligible things are set forth by the likenesses of things sensible, 
in the same way by Divine power sensible bodies are so fashioned by 
angels as fittingly to represent the intelligible properties of an angel. 
And this is what we mean by an angel assuming a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although air as long as it is in a state of rarefaction has 
neither shape nor color, yet when condensed it can both be shaped and 
colored as appears in the clouds. Even so the angels assume bodies of 
air, condensing it by the Divine power in so far as is needful for 
forming the assumed body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels exercise functions of life in the bodies assumed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels exercise functions of life in 
assumed bodies. For pretence is unbecoming in angels of truth. But it 
would be pretence if the body assumed by them, which seems to live and to 
exercise vital functions, did not possess these functions. Therefore the 
angels exercise functions of life in the assumed body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the works of the angels there is nothing  without a 
purpose. But eyes, nostrils, and the other instruments of the senses, 
would be fashioned without a purpose in the body assumed by the angel, if 
he perceived nothing by their means. Consequently, the angel perceives by 
the assumed body; and this is the most special function of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to move hither and thither is one of the functions of 
life, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii). But the angels are 
manifestly seen to move in their assumed bodies. For it was said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++18:16">Gn. 18:16</a>) that "Abraham walked with" the angels, who had appeared to him, 
"bringing them on the way"; and when Tobias said to the angel (Tob. 
5:7,8): "Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the city of Medes?" he 
answered: "I know it; and I have often walked through all the ways 
thereof." Therefore the angels often exercise functions of life in 
assumed bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, speech is the function of a living subject, for it is 
produced by the voice, while the voice itself is a sound conveyed from 
the mouth. But it is evident from many passages of Sacred Scripture that 
angels spoke in assumed bodies. Therefore in their assumed bodies they 
exercise functions of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, eating is a purely animal function. Hence the Lord after 
His Resurrection ate with His disciples in proof of having resumed life 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++24">Lk. 24</a>). Now when angels appeared in their assumed bodies they ate, and 
Abraham offered them food, after having previously adored them as God 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++18">Gn. 18</a>). Therefore the angels exercise functions of life in assumed 
bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, to beget offspring is a vital act. But this has befallen 
the angels in their assumed bodies; for it is related: "After the sons of 
God went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, 
these are the mighty men of old, men of renown" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++6:4">Gn. 6:4</a>). Consequently 
the angels exercised vital functions in their assumed bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The bodies assumed by angels have no life, as was 
stated in the previous article (ad 3). Therefore they cannot exercise 
functions of life through assumed bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some functions of living subjects have something in 
common with other operations; just as speech, which is the function of a 
living creature, agrees with other sounds of inanimate things, in so far 
as it is sound; and walking agrees with other movements, in so far as it 
is movement. Consequently vital functions can be performed in assumed 
bodies by the angels, as to that which is common in such operations; but 
not as to that which is special to living subjects; because, according to 
the Philosopher (De Somn. et Vig. i), "that which has the faculty has the 
action." Hence nothing can have a function of life except what has life, 
which is the potential principle of such action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As it is in no wise contrary to truth for intelligible 
things to be set forth in Scripture under sensible  figures, since it is 
not said for the purpose of maintaining that intelligible things are 
sensible, but in order that properties of intelligible things may be 
understood according to similitude through sensible figures; so it is not 
contrary to the truth of the holy angels that through their assumed 
bodies they appear to be living men, although they are really not. For 
the bodies are assumed merely for this purpose, that the spiritual 
properties and works of the angels may be manifested by the properties of 
man and of his works. This could not so fittingly be done if they were to 
assume true men; because the properties of such men would lead us to men, 
and not to angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sensation is entirely a vital function. Consequently it can 
in no way be said that the angels perceive through the organs of their 
assumed bodies. Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain; for they are 
not fashioned for the purpose of sensation through them, but to this end, 
that by such bodily organs the spiritual powers of the angels may be made 
manifest; just as by the eye the power of the angel's knowledge is 
pointed out, and other powers by the other members, as Dionysius teaches 
(Coel. Hier.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Movement coming from a united mover is a proper function of 
life; but the bodies assumed by the angels are not thus moved, since the 
angels are not their forms. Yet the angels are moved accidentally, when 
such bodies are moved, since they are in them as movers are in the moved; 
and they are here in such a way as not to be elsewhere which cannot be 
said of God. Accordingly, although God is not moved when the things are 
moved in which He exists, since He is everywhere; yet the angels are 
moved accidentally according to the movement of the bodies assumed. But 
they are not moved according to the movement of the heavenly bodies, even 
though they be in them as the movers in the thing moved, because the 
heavenly bodies do not change place in their entirety; nor for the spirit 
which moves the world is there any fixed locality according to any 
restricted part of the world's substance, which now is in the east, and 
now in the west, but according to a fixed quarter; because "the moving 
energy is always in the east," as stated in Phys. viii, text 84.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Properly speaking, the angels do not talk through their 
assumed bodies; yet there is a semblance of speech, in so far as they 
fashion sounds in the air like to human voices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Properly speaking, the angels cannot be said to eat, 
because eating involves the taking of food convertible into the substance 
of the eater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although after the Resurrection food was not converted into the 
substance of Christ's body, but resolved into pre-existing matter; 
nevertheless Christ had a body of such a true nature that food could be 
changed into it; hence it was a true eating. But the food taken by angels 
was neither changed into the assumed body, nor was the body of such a 
nature that food could be changed into it;  consequently, it was not a 
true eating, but figurative of spiritual eating. This is what the angel 
said to Tobias: "When I was with you, I seemed indeed to eat and to 
drink; but I use an invisible meat and drink" (Tob. 12:19).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abraham offered them food, deeming them to be men, in whom, 
nevertheless, he worshipped God, as God is wont to be in the prophets, as 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xvi).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[51] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv): "Many persons affirm 
that they have had the experience, or have heard from such as have 
experienced it, that the Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk call 
incubi, have often presented themselves before women, and have sought and 
procured intercourse with them. Hence it is folly to deny it. But God's 
holy angels could not fall in such fashion before the deluge. Hence by 
the sons of God are to be understood the sons of Seth, who were good; 
while by the daughters of men the Scripture designates those who sprang 
from the race of Cain. Nor is it to be wondered at that giants should be 
born of them; for they were not all giants, albeit there were many more 
before than after the deluge." Still if some are occasionally begotten 
from demons, it is not from the seed of such demons, nor from their 
assumed bodies, but from the seed of men taken for the purpose; as when 
the demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; 
just as they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes, 
as Augustine says (De Trin. iii), so that the person born is not the 
child of a demon, but of a man.<br>
