<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now consider the ordering of the bad angels; concerning which there 
are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there are orders among the demons?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether among them there is precedence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether one enlightens another?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether they are subject to the precedence of the good angels?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there are orders among the demons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are no orders among the demons. For 
order belongs to good, as also mode, and species, as Augustine says (De 
Nat. Boni iii); and on the contrary, disorder belongs to evil. But there 
is nothing disorderly in the good angels. Therefore in the bad angels 
there are no orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angelic orders are contained under a hierarchy. But 
the demons are not in a hierarchy, which is defined as a holy 
principality; for they are void of all holiness. Therefore among the 
demons there are no orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the demons fell from every one of the angelic orders; as 
is commonly supposed. Therefore, if some demons are said to belong to an 
order, as falling from that order, it would seem necessary to give them 
the names of each of those orders. But we never find that they are called 
"Seraphim," or "Thrones," or "Dominations." Therefore on the same ground 
they are not to be placed in any other order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++6%3A12">Eph. 6:12</a>): "Our wrestling . . . is 
against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of 
this darkness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As explained above (<A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108OUTP1">Question [108]</a>, <A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,7,8), order in the 
angels is considered both according to the grade of nature; and according 
to that of grace. Now grace has a twofold state, the imperfect, which is 
that of merit; and the perfect, which is that of consummate glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If therefore we consider the angelic orders in the light of the 
perfection of glory, then the demons are not in the angelic orders, and 
never were. But if we consider them in relation to imperfect grace, in 
that view the demons were at the time in the orders of angels, but fell 
away from them, according to what was said above (<A Href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FP062.html#FPQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), that all 
the angels were created in grace. But if we consider them in the light of 
nature, in that view they are still in those orders; because they have 
not lost their natural gifts; as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Good can exist without evil; whereas evil cannot exist 
without good (<A Href="FP049.html#FPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="FP049.html#FPQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>); so there is order in the demons, as 
possessing a good nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If we consider the ordering of the demons on the part of 
God Who orders them, it is sacred; for He uses the demons for Himself; 
but on the part of the demons' will it is not a sacred thing, because 
they abuse their nature for evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The name "Seraphim" is given from the ardor of charity; and 
the name "Thrones" from the Divine indwelling; and the name "Dominations" 
imports a certain liberty; all of which are opposed to sin; and therefore 
these names are not given to the angels who sinned.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether among the demons there is precedence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no precedence among the demons. For 
every precedence is according to some order of justice. But the demons 
are wholly fallen from justice. Therefore there is  no precedence among 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no precedence where obedience and subjection do 
not exist. But these cannot be without concord; which is not to be found 
among the demons, according to the text, "Among the proud there are 
always contentions" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++13%3A10">Prov. 13:10</a>). Therefore there is no precedence among 
the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> If there be precedence among them it is either according to 
nature, or according to their sin or punishment. But it is not according 
to their nature, for subjection and service do not come from nature but 
from subsequent sin; neither is it according to sin or punishment, 
because in that case the superior demons who have sinned the most 
grievously, would be subject to the inferior. Therefore there is no 
precedence among the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> On 1 Cor. 15:24 the gloss says: "While the world lasts, 
angels will preside over angels, men over men, and demons over demons."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since action follows the nature of a thing, where natures 
are subordinate, actions also must be subordinate to each other. Thus it 
is in corporeal things, for as the inferior bodies by natural order are 
below the heavenly bodies, their actions and movements are subject to the 
actions and movements of the heavenly bodies. Now it is plain from what 
we have said (<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that the demons are by natural order subject to 
others; and hence their actions are subject to the action of those above 
them, and this is what we mean by precedence---that the action of the 
subject should be under the action of the prelate. So the very natural 
disposition of the demons requires that there should be authority among 
them. This agrees too with Divine wisdom, which leaves nothing 
inordinate, which "reacheth from end to end mightily, and ordereth all 
things sweetly" (Wis. 8:1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The authority of the demons is not founded on their 
justice, but on the justice of God ordering all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The concord of the demons, whereby some obey others, does 
not arise from mutual friendships, but from their common wickedness 
whereby they hate men, and fight against God's justice. For it belongs to 
wicked men to be joined to and subject to those whom they see to be 
stronger, in order to carry out their own wickedness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The demons are not equal in nature; and so among them there 
exists a natural precedence; which is not the case with men, who are 
naturally equal. That the inferior are subject to the superior, is not 
for the benefit of the superior, but rather to their detriment; because 
since to do evil belongs in a pre-eminent degree to unhappiness, it 
follows that to preside in evil is to be more unhappy.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there is enlightenment in the demons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that enlightenment is in the demons. For 
enlightenment means the manifestation of the truth. But one demon can 
manifest truth to another, because the superior excel in natural 
knowledge. Therefore the superior demons can enlighten the inferior.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a body abounding in light can enlighten a body deficient 
in light, as the sun enlightens the moon. But the superior demons abound 
in the participation of natural light. Therefore it seems that the 
superior demons can enlighten the inferior.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Enlightenment is not without cleansing and perfecting, 
as stated above (<A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But to cleanse does not befit the demons, 
according to the words: "What can be made clean by the unclean?" (Ecclus. 
34:4). Therefore neither can they enlighten.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There can be no enlightenment properly speaking among the 
demons. For, as above explained (<A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107OUTP1">Question [107]</a>, <A Href="FP107.html#FPQ107A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), enlightenment properly 
speaking is the manifestation of the truth in reference to God, Who 
enlightens every intellect. Another kind of manifestation of the truth is 
speech, as when one angel manifests his concept to another. Now the 
demon's perversity does not lead one to order another to God, but rather 
to lead away from the Divine order; and so one demon does not enlighten 
another; but one can make known his mental concept to another by way of 
speech.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not every kind of manifestation of the truth is 
enlightenment, but only that which is above described.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to what belongs to natural knowledge, there is no 
necessary manifestation of the truth either in the angels, or in the 
demons, because, as above explained (<A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FP055.html#FPQ55A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FP058.html#FPQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), they know from the first all that belongs to their natural 
knowledge. So the greater fulness of natural light in the superior demons 
does not prove that they can enlighten others.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the good angels have precedence over the bad angels?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the good angels have no precedence over the 
bad angels. For the angels' precedence is especially connected with 
enlightenment. But the bad angels, being darkness, are not enlightened by 
the good angels. Therefore the good angels do not rule over the bad.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, superiors are responsible as regards negligence for the 
evil deeds of their subjects. But the demons do much evil. Therefore if 
they are subject to the good angels, it seems that negligence is to be 
charged to the good angels; which cannot be admitted. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angels' precedence follows upon the order of nature, 
as above explained (<A Href="FP109.html#FPQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But if the demons fell from every order, as is 
commonly said, many of the demons are superior to many good angels in the 
natural order. Therefore the good angels have no precedence over all the 
bad angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iii), that "the treacherous 
and sinful spirit of life is ruled by the rational, pious, and just 
spirit of life"; and Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv) that "the Powers are the 
angels to whose charge are subjected the hostile powers."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The whole order of precedence is first and originally in 
God; and it is shared by creatures accordingly as they are the nearer to 
God. For those creatures, which are more perfect and nearer to God, have 
the power to act on others. Now the greatest perfection and that which 
brings them nearest to God belongs to the creatures who enjoy God, as the 
holy angels; of which perfection the demons are deprived; and therefore 
the good angels have precedence over the bad, and these are ruled by them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Many things concerning Divine mysteries are made known by 
the holy angels to the bad angels, whenever the Divine justice requires 
the demons to do anything for the punishment of the evil; or for the 
trial of the good; as in human affairs the judge's assessors make known 
his sentence to the executioners. This revelation, if compared to the 
angelic revealers, can be called an enlightenment, forasmuch as they 
direct it to God; but it is not an enlightenment on the part of the 
demons, for these do not direct it to God; but to the fulfilment of their 
own wickedness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The holy angels are the ministers of the Divine wisdom. 
Hence as the Divine wisdom permits some evil to be done by bad angels or 
men, for the sake of the good that follows; so also the good angels do 
not entirely restrain the bad from inflicting harm.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[109] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> An angel who is inferior in the natural order presides over 
demons, although these may be naturally superior; because the power of 
Divine justice to which the good angels cleave, is stronger than the 
natural power of the angels. Hence likewise among men, "the spiritual man 
judgeth all things" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2%3A15">1 Cor. 2:15</a>), and the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 
4; x, 5) that "the virtuous man is the rule and measure of all human 
acts."<br>
