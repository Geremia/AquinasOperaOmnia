    THE MALICE OF THE ANGELS WITH REGARD TO SIN (NINE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider how angels became evil: first of all with
    regard to the evil of fault; and secondly, as to the evil of punishment.
    Under the first heading there are nine points for consideration:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A1THEP1">(1)</a> Can there be evil of fault in the
    angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A2THEP1">(2)</a> What kind of sins can be in them?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A3THEP1">(3)</a> What did the angel seek in
    sinning?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A4THEP1">(4)</a> Supposing that some became evil by
    a sin of their own choosing, are any of them naturally evil?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A5THEP1">(5)</a> Supposing that it is not so, could
    any one of them become evil in the first instant of his creation by an act
    of his own will?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A6THEP1">(6)</a> Supposing that he did not, was
    there any interval between his creation and fall?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A7THEP1">(7)</a> Was the highest of them who fell,
    absolutely the highest among the angels?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A8THEP1">(8)</a> Was the sin of the foremost angel
    the cause of the others sinning?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A9THEP1">(9)</a> Did as many sin as remained
    steadfast?

  <h3 align="left">Whether the evil of fault can be in the angels?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be no evil of fault
    in the angels. For there can be no evil except in things which are in
    potentiality, as is said by the Philosopher (Metaph. ix, text. 19), because
    the subject of privation is a being in potentiality. But the angels have not
    being in potentiality, since they are subsisting forms. Therefore there can
    be no evil in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angels are higher than the heavenly
    bodies. But philosophers say that there cannot be evil in the heavenly
    bodies. Therefore neither can there by in the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is natural to a thing is always in
    it. But it is natural for the angels to be moved by the movement of love
    towards God. Therefore such love cannot be withdrawn from them. But in
    loving God they do not sin. Consequently the angels cannot sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, desire is only of what is good or
    apparently good. Now for the angels there can be no apparent good which is
    not a true good; because in them either there can be no error at all, or at
    least not before guilt. Therefore the angels can desire only what it truly
    good. But no one sins by desiring what is truly good. Consequently the angel
    does not sin by desire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+4%3A18"
      >Job 4:18</a
    >): "In His angels He found wickedness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An angel or any other rational creature
    considered in his own nature, can sin; and to whatever creature it belongs
    not to sin, such creature has it as a gift of grace, and not from the
    condition of nature. The reason of this is, because sinning is nothing else
    than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have; whether we
    speak of sin in nature, art, or morals. That act alone, the rule of which is
    the very virtue of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude. Were the
    craftsman's hand the rule itself engraving, he could not engrave the wood
    otherwise than rightly; but if the rightness of engraving be judged by
    another rule, then the engraving may be right or faulty. Now the Divine will
    is the sole rule of God's act, because it is not referred to any higher end.
    But every created will has rectitude of act so far only as it is regulated
    according to the Divine will, to which the last end is to be referred: as
    every desire of a subordinate ought to be regulated by the will of his
    superior; for instance, the soldier's will, according to the will of his
    commanding officer. Thus only in the Divine will can there be no sin;
    whereas there can be sin in the will of every creature; considering the
    condition of its nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the angels there is no potentiality
    to natural existence. Yet there is potentiality in their intellective part,
    as regards their being inclined to this or the other object. In this respect
    there can be evil in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The heavenly bodies have none but a
    natural operation. Therefore as there can be no evil of corruption in their
    nature; so neither can there be evil of disorder in their natural action.
    But besides their natural action there is the action of free-will in the
    angels, by reason of which evil may be in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is natural for the angel to turn to
    God by the movement of love, according as God is the principle of his
    natural being. But for him to turn to God as the object of supernatural
    beatitude, comes of infused love, from which he could be turned away by
    sinning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Mortal sin occurs in two ways in the act
    of free-will. First, when something evil is chosen; as man sins by choosing
    adultery, which is evil of itself. Such sin always comes of ignorance or
    error; otherwise what is evil would never be chosen as good. The adulterer
    errs in the particular, choosing this delight of an inordinate act as
    something good to be performed now, from the inclination of passion or of
    habit; even though he does not err in his universal judgment, but retains a
    right opinion in this respect. In this way there can be no sin in the angel;
    because there are no passions in the angels to fetter reason or intellect,
    as is manifest from what has been said above (<a
      href="FP059.html#FPQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="FP059.html#FPQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>); nor, again, could any
    habit inclining to sin precede their first sin. In another way sin comes of
    free-will by choosing something good in itself, but not according to proper
    measure or rule; so that the defect which induces sin is only on the part of
    the choice which is not properly regulated, but not on the part of the thing
    chosen; as if one were to pray, without heeding the order established by the
    Church. Such a sin does not presuppose ignorance, but merely absence of
    consideration of the things which ought to be considered. In this way the
    angel sinned, by seeking his own good, from his own free-will,
    insubordinately to the rule of the Divine will.<br />

    Whether only the sin of pride and envy can exist in an angel?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be other sins in the
    angels besides those of pride and envy. Because whosoever can delight in any
    kind of sin, can fall into the sin itself. But the demons delight even in
    the obscenities of carnal sins; as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3).
    Therefore there can also be carnal sins in the demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as pride and envy are spiritual sins, so
    are sloth, avarice, and anger. But spiritual sins are concerned with the
    spirit, just as carnal sins are with the flesh. Therefore not only can there
    be pride and envy in the angels; but likewise sloth and avarice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi), many
    vices spring from pride; and in like manner from envy. But, if the cause is
    granted, the effect follows. If, therefore, there can be pride and envy in
    the angels, for the same reason there can likewise be other vices in
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3) that the
    devil "is not a fornicator nor a drunkard, nor anything of the like sort;
    yet he is proud and envious."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sin can exist in a subject in two ways: first
    of all by actual guilt, and secondly by affection. As to guilt, all sins are
    in the demons; since by leading men to sin they incur the guilt of all sins.
    But as to affection only those sins can be in the demons which can belong to
    a spiritual nature. Now a spiritual nature cannot be affected by such
    pleasures as appertain to bodies, but only by such as are in keeping with
    spiritual things; because nothing is affected except with regard to
    something which is in some way suited to its nature. But there can be no sin
    when anyone is incited to good of the spiritual order; unless in such
    affection the rule of the superior be not kept. Such is precisely the sin of
    pride---not to be subject to a superior when subjection is due. Consequently
    the first sin of the angel can be none other than pride.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, as a consequence, it was possible for envy also to be in them, since
    for the appetite to tend to the desire of something involves on its part
    resistance to anything contrary. Now the envious man repines over the good
    possessed by another, inasmuch as he deems his neighbor's good to be a
    hindrance to his own. But another's good could not be deemed a hindrance to
    the good coveted by the wicked angel, except inasmuch as he coveted a
    singular excellence, which would cease to be singular because of the
    excellence of some other. So, after the sin of pride, there followed the
    evil of envy in the sinning angel, whereby he grieved over man's good, and
    also over the Divine excellence, according as against the devil's will God
    makes use of man for the Divine glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The demons do not delight in the
    obscenities of the sins of the flesh, as if they themselves were disposed to
    carnal pleasures: it is wholly through envy that they take pleasure in all
    sorts of human sins, so far as these are hindrances to a man's good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Avarice, considered as a special kind of
    sin, is the immoderate greed of temporal possessions which serve the use of
    human life, and which can be estimated in value of money; to these demons
    are not at all inclined, any more than they are to carnal pleasures.
    Consequently avarice properly so called cannot be in them. But if every
    immoderate greed of possessing any created good be termed avarice, in this
    way avarice is contained under the pride which is in the demons. Anger
    implies passion, and so does concupiscence; consequently they can only exist
    metaphorically in the demons. Sloth is a kind of sadness, whereby a man
    becomes sluggish in spiritual exercises because they weary the body; which
    does not apply to the demons. So it is evident that pride and envy are the
    only spiritual sins which can be found in demons; yet so that envy is not to
    be taken for a passion, but for a will resisting the good of another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Under envy and pride, as found in the
    demons, are comprised all other sins derived from them.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the devil desired to be as God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the devil did not desire to be
    as God. For what does not fall under apprehension, does not fall under
    desire; because the good which is apprehended moves the appetite, whether
    sensible, rational, or intellectual; and sin consists only in such desire.
    But for any creature to be God's equal does not fall under apprehension,
    because it implies a contradiction; for it the finite equals the infinite,
    then it would itself be infinite. Therefore an angel could not desire to be
    as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the natural end can always be desired
    without sin. But to be likened unto God is the end to which every creature
    naturally tends. If, therefore, the angel desired to be as God, not by
    equality, but by likeness, it would seem that he did not thereby sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angel was created with greater
    fulness of wisdom than man. But no man, save a fool, ever makes choice of
    being the equal of an angel, still less of God; because choice regards only
    things which are possible, regarding which one takes deliberation. Therefore
    much less did the angel sin by desiring to be as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said, in the person of the devil (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++14%3A13,14"
      >Is. 14:13,14</a
    >), "I will ascend into heaven... I will be like the Most High." And
    Augustine (De Qu. Vet. Test. cxiii) says that being "inflated with pride, he
    wished to be called God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Without doubt the angel sinned by seeking to be
    as God. But this can be understood in two ways: first, by equality;
    secondly, by likeness. He could not seek to be as God in the first way;
    because by natural knowledge he knew that this was impossible: and there was
    no habit preceding his first sinful act, nor any passion fettering his mind,
    so as to lead him to choose what was impossible by failing in some
    particular; as sometimes happens in ourselves. And even supposing it were
    possible, it would be against the natural desire; because there exists in
    everything the natural desire of preserving its own nature; which would not
    be preserved were it to be changed into another nature. Consequently, no
    creature of a lower order can ever covet the grade of a higher nature; just
    as an ass does not desire to be a horse: for were it to be so upraised, it
    would cease to be itself. But herein the imagination plays us false; for one
    is liable to think that, because a man seeks to occupy a higher grade as to
    accidentals, which can increase without the destruction of the subject, he
    can also seek a higher grade of nature, to which he could not attain without
    ceasing to exist. Now it is quite evident that God surpasses the angels, not
    merely in accidentals, but also in degree of nature; and one angel, another.
    Consequently it is impossible for one angel of lower degree to desire
    equality with a higher; and still more to covet equality with God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To desire to be as God according to likeness can happen in two ways. In one
    way, as to that likeness whereby everything is made to be likened unto God.
    And so, if anyone desire in this way to be Godlike, he commits no sin;
    provided that he desires such likeness in proper order, that is to say, that
    he may obtain it of God. But he would sin were he to desire to be like unto
    God even in the right way, as of his own, and not of God's power. In another
    way one may desire to be like unto God in some respect which is not natural
    to one; as if one were to desire to create heaven and earth, which is proper
    to God; in which desire there would be sin. It was in this way that the
    devil desired to be as God. Not that he desired to resemble God by being
    subject to no one else absolutely; for so he would be desiring his own
    'not-being'; since no creature can exist except by holding its existence
    under God. But he desired resemblance with God in this respect---by
    desiring, as his last end of beatitude, something which he could attain by
    the virtue of his own nature, turning his appetite away from supernatural
    beatitude, which is attained by God's grace. Or, if he desired as his last
    end that likeness of God which is bestowed by grace, he sought to have it by
    the power of his own nature; and not from Divine assistance according to
    God's ordering. This harmonizes with Anselm's opinion, who says [*De casu
    diaboli, iv.] that "he sought that to which he would have come had he stood
    fast." These two views in a manner coincide; because according to both, he
    sought to have final beatitude of his own power, whereas this is proper to
    God alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, then, what exists of itself is the cause of what exists of another,
    it follows from this furthermore that he sought to have dominion over
    others; wherein he also perversely wished to be like unto God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From this we have the answer to all the objections.</p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether any demons are naturally wicked?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that some demons are naturally
    wicked. For Porphyry says, as quoted by Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 11):
    "There is a class of demons of crafty nature, pretending that they are gods
    and the souls of the dead." But to be deceitful is to be evil. Therefore
    some demons are naturally wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the angels are created by God, so are
    men. But some men are naturally wicked, of whom it is said (Ws. 12:10):
    "Their malice is natural." Therefore some angels may be naturally wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some irrational animals have wicked
    dispositions by nature: thus the fox is naturally sly, and the wolf
    naturally rapacious; yet they are God's creatures. Therefore, although the
    demons are God's creatures, they may be naturally wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the
    demons are not naturally wicked."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Everything which exists, so far as it exists
    and has a particular nature, tends naturally towards some good; since it
    comes from a good principle; because the effect always reverts to its
    principle. Now a particular good may happen to have some evil connected with
    it; thus fire has this evil connected with it that it consumes other things:
    but with the universal good no evil can be connected. If, then, there be
    anything whose nature is inclined towards some particular good, it can tend
    naturally to some evil; not as evil, but accidentally, as connected with
    some good. But if anything of its nature be inclined to good in general,
    then of its own nature it cannot be inclined to evil. Now it is manifest
    that every intellectual nature is inclined towards good in general, which it
    can apprehend and which is the object of the will. Hence, since the demons
    are intellectual substances, they can in no wise have a natural inclination
    towards any evil whatsoever; consequently they cannot be naturally evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine rebukes Porphyry for saying
    that the demons are naturally deceitful; himself maintaining that they are
    not naturally so, but of their own will. Now the reason why Porphyry held
    that they are naturally deceitful was that, as he contended, demons are
    animals with a sensitive nature. Now the sensitive nature is inclined
    towards some particular good, with which evil may be connected. In this way,
    then, it can have a natural inclination to evil; yet only accidentally,
    inasmuch as evil is connected with good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The malice of some men can be called
    natural, either because of custom which is a second nature; or on account of
    the natural proclivity on the part of the sensitive nature to some
    inordinate passion, as some people are said to be naturally wrathful or
    lustful; but not on the part of the intellectual nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Brute beasts have a natural inclination
    in their sensitive nature towards certain particular goods, with which
    certain evils are connected; thus the fox in seeking its food has a natural
    inclination to do so with a certain skill coupled with deceit. Wherefore it
    is not evil in the fox to be sly, since it is natural to him; as it is not
    evil in the dog to be fierce, as Dionysius observes (De Div. Nom. iv).<br />

    Whether the devil was wicked by the fault of his own will in the first
    instant of his creation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the devil was wicked by the
    fault of his own will in the first instant of his creation. For it is said
    of the devil (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++8%3A44"
      >Jn. 8:44</a
    >): "He was a murderer from the beginning."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i,
    15), the lack of form in the creature did not precede its formation in order
    of time, but merely in order of nature. Now according to him (Gen. ad lit.
    ii, 8), the "heaven," which is said to have been created in the beginning,
    signifies the angelic nature while as yet not fully formed: and when it is
    said that God said: "Be light made: and light was made," we are to
    understand the full formation of the angel by turning to the Word.
    Consequently, the nature of the angel was created, and light was made, in
    the one instant. But at the same moment that light was made, it was made
    distinct from "darkness," whereby the angels who sinned are denoted.
    Therefore in the first instant of their creation some of the angels were
    made blessed, and some sinned.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin is opposed to merit. But some
    intellectual nature can merit in the first instant of its creation; as the
    soul of Christ, or also the good angels. Therefore the demons likewise could
    sin in the first instant of their creation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the angelic nature is more powerful than
    the corporeal nature. But a corporeal thing begins to have its operation in
    the first instant of its creation; as fire begins to move upwards in the
    first instant it is produced. Therefore the angel could also have his
    operation in the first instant of his creation. Now this operation was
    either ordinate or inordinate. It ordinate, then, since he had grace, he
    thereby merited beatitude. But with the angels the reward follows
    immediately upon merit; as was said above (<a href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Consequently they
    would have become blessed at once; and so would never have sinned, which is
    false. It remains, then, that they sinned by inordinate action in their
    first instant.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A31"
      >Gn. 1:31</a
    >): "God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good." But
    among them were also the demons. Therefore the demons were at some time
    good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have maintained that the demons were
    wicked straightway in the first instant of their creation; not by their
    nature, but by the sin of their own will; because, as soon as he was made,
    the devil refused righteousness. To this opinion, as Augustine says (De Civ.
    Dei xi, 13), if anyone subscribes, he does not agree with those Manichean
    heretics who say that the devil's nature is evil of itself. Since this
    opinion, however, is in contradiction with the authority of Scripture---for
    it is said of the devil under the figure of the prince of Babylon (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++14%3A12"
      >Is. 14:12</a
    >): "How art thou fallen... O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning!" and
    it is said to the devil in the person of the King of Tyre (Ezech. 28:13):
    "Thou wast in the pleasures of the paradise of God," ---consequently, this
    opinion was reasonably rejected by the masters as erroneous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others have said that the angels, in the first instant of their
    creation, could have sinned, but did not. Yet this view also is repudiated
    by some, because, when two operations follow one upon the other, it seems
    impossible for each operation to terminate in the one instant. Now it is
    clear that the angel's sin was an act subsequent to his creation. But the
    term of the creative act is the angel's very being, while the term of the
    sinful act is the being wicked. It seems, then, an impossibility for the
    angel to have been wicked in the first instant of his existence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This argument, however, does not satisfy. For it holds good only in such
    movements as are measured by time, and take place successively; thus, if
    local movement follows a change, then the change and the local movement
    cannot be terminated in the same instant. But if the changes are
    instantaneous, then all at once and in the same instant there can be a term
    to the first and the second change; thus in the same instant in which the
    moon is lit up by the sun, the atmosphere is lit up by the moon. Now, it is
    manifest that creation is instantaneous; so also is the movement of
    free-will in the angels; for, as has been already stated, they have no
    occasion for comparison or discursive reasoning (<a
      href="FP058.html#FPQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="FP058.html#FPQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Consequently, there
    is nothing to hinder the term of creation and of free-will from existing in
    the same instant.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore reply that, on the contrary, it was impossible for the
    angel to sin in the first instant by an inordinate act of free-will. For
    although a thing can begin to act in the first instant of its existence,
    nevertheless, that operation which begins with the existence comes of the
    agent from which it drew its nature; just as upward movement in fire comes
    of its productive cause. Therefore, if there be anything which derives its
    nature from a defective cause, which can be the cause of a defective action,
    it can in the first instant of its existence have a defective operation;
    just as the leg, which is defective from birth, through a defect in the
    principle of generation, begins at once to limp. But the agent which brought
    the angels into existence, namely, God, cannot be the cause of sin.
    Consequently it cannot be said that the devil was wicked in the first
    instant of his creation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15),
    when it is stated that "the devil sins from the beginning," "he is not to be
    thought of as sinning from the beginning wherein he was created, but from
    the beginning of sin": that is to say, because he never went back from his
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That distinction of light and darkness,
    whereby the sins of the demons are understood by the term darkness, must be
    taken as according to God's foreknowledge. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei
    xi, 15), that "He alone could discern light and darkness, Who also could
    foreknow, before they fell, those who would fall."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All that is in merit is from God; and
    consequently an angel could merit in the first instant of his creation. The
    same reason does not hold good of sin; as has been said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> God did not distinguish between the
    angels before the turning away of some of them, and the turning of others to
    Himself, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15). Therefore, as all were
    created in grace, all merited in their first instant. But some of them at
    once placed an impediment to their beatitude, thereby destroying their
    preceding merit; and consequently they were deprived of the beatitude which
    they had merited.<br />

    Whether there was any interval between the creation and the fall of the
    angel?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was some interval
    between the angel's creation and his fall. For, it is said (Ezech. 28:15):
    "Thou didst walk perfect [*Vulg.: 'Thou hast walked in the midst of the
    stones of fire; thou wast perfect...'] in thy ways from the day of thy
    creation until iniquity was found in thee." But since walking is continuous
    movement, it requires an interval. Therefore there was some interval between
    the devil's creation and his fall.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Origen says (Hom. i in Ezech.) that "the
    serpent of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly"; which
    refers to his sin. Therefore the devil did not sin at once after the first
    instant of his creation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, capability of sinning is common alike to
    man and angel. But there was some delay between man's formation and his sin.
    Therefore, for the like reason there was some interval between the devil's
    formation and his sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the instant wherein the devil sinned was
    distinct from the instant wherein he was created. But there is a middle time
    between every two instants. Therefore there was an interval between his
    creation and his fall.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of the devil (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++8%3A44"
      >Jn. 8:44</a
    >): "He stood not in the truth": and, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi,
    15), "we must understand this in the sense, that he was in the truth, but
    did not remain in it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold opinion on this point. But
    the more probable one, which is also more in harmony with the teachings of
    the Saints, is that the devil sinned at once after the first instant of his
    creation. This must be maintained if it be held that he elicited an act of
    free-will in the first instant of his creation, and that he was created in
    grace; as we have said (<a href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). For since the angels
    attain beatitude by one meritorious act, as was said above (<a
      href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), if the devil, created
    in grace, merited in the first instant, he would at once have received
    beatitude after that first instant, if he had not placed an impediment by
    sinning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, it be contended that the angel was not created in grace, or
    that he could not elicit an act of free-will in the first instant, then
    there is nothing to prevent some interval being interposed between his
    creation and fall.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sometimes in Holy Scripture spiritual
    instantaneous movements are represented by corporeal movements which are
    measured by time. In this way by "walking" we are to understand the movement
    of free-will tending towards good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Origen says, "The serpent of old did not
    from the first walk upon his breast and belly," because of the first instant
    in which he was not wicked.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> An angel has an inflexible free-will
    after once choosing; consequently, if after the first instant, in which he
    had a natural movement to good, he had not at once placed a barrier to
    beatitude, he would have been confirmed in good. It is not so with man; and
    therefore the argument does not hold good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is true to say that there is a middle
    time between every two instants, so far as time is continuous, as it is
    proved Phys. vi, text. 2. But in the angels, who are not subject to the
    heavenly movement, which is primarily measured by continuous time, time is
    taken to mean the succession of their mental acts, or of their affections.
    So the first instant in the angels is understood to respond to the operation
    of the angelic mind, whereby it introspects itself by its evening knowledge
    because on the first day evening is mentioned, but not morning. This
    operation was good in them all. From such operation some of them were
    converted to the praise of the Word by their morning knowledge while others,
    absorbed in themselves, became night, "swelling up with pride," as Augustine
    says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24). Hence the first act was common to them all; but
    in their second they were separated. Consequently they were all of them good
    in the first instant; but in the second the good were set apart from the
    wicked.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the highest angel among those who sinned was the highest of all?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the highest among the angels
    who sinned was not the highest of all. For it is stated (Ezech. 28:14):
    "Thou wast a cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in the
    holy mountain of God." Now the order of the Cherubim is under the order of
    the Seraphim, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vi, vii). Therefore, the
    highest angel among those who sinned was not the highest of all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God made intellectual nature in order
    that it might attain to beatitude. If therefore the highest of the angels
    sinned, it follows that the Divine ordinance was frustrated in the noblest
    creature which is unfitting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more a subject is inclined towards
    anything, so much the less can it fall away from it. But the higher an angel
    is, so much the more is he inclined towards God. Therefore so much the less
    can he turn away from God by sinning. And so it seems that the angel who
    sinned was not the highest of all, but one of the lower angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Hom. xxxiv in Ev.) says that the
    chief angel who sinned, "being set over all the hosts of angels, surpassed
    them in brightness, and was by comparison the most illustrious among
    them."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two things have to be considered in sin,
    namely, the proneness to sin, and the motive for sinning. If, then, in the
    angels we consider the proneness to sin, it seems that the higher angels
    were less likely to sin than the lower. On this account Damascene says (De
    Fide Orth. ii), that the highest of those who sinned was set over the
    terrestrial order. This opinion seems to agree with the view of the
    Platonists, which Augustine quotes (De Civ. Dei vii, 6,7; x, 9,10,11). For
    they said that all the gods were good; whereas some of the demons were good,
    and some bad; naming as 'gods' the intellectual substances which are above
    the lunar sphere, and calling by the name of "demons" the intellectual
    substances which are beneath it, yet higher than men in the order of nature.
    Nor is this opinion to be rejected as contrary to faith; because the whole
    corporeal creation is governed by God through the angels, as Augustine says
    (De Trin. iii, 4,5). Consequently there is nothing to prevent us from saying
    that the lower angels were divinely set aside for presiding over the lower
    bodies, the higher over the higher bodies; and the highest to stand before
    God. And in this sense Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that they who fell
    were of the lower grade of angels; yet in that order some of them remained
    good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if the motive for sinning be considered, we find that it existed in the
    higher angels more than in the lower. For, as has been said (<a
      href="FP063.html#FPQ63A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), the demons' sin was pride; and the motive of pride is excellence, which
    was greater in the higher spirits. Hence Gregory says that he who sinned was
    the very highest of all. This seems to be the more probable view: because
    the angels' sin did not come of any proneness, but of free choice alone.
    Consequently that argument seems to have the more weight which is drawn from
    the motive in sinning. Yet this must not be prejudicial to the other view;
    because there might be some motive for sinning in him also who was the chief
    of the lower angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Cherubim is interpreted "fulness of
    knowledge," while "Seraphim" means "those who are on fire," or "who set on
    fire." Consequently Cherubim is derived from knowledge; which is compatible
    with mortal sin; but Seraphim is derived from the heat of charity, which is
    incompatible with mortal sin. Therefore the first angel who sinned is
    called, not a Seraph, but a Cherub.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Divine intention is not frustrated
    either in those who sin, or in those who are saved; for God knows beforehand
    the end of both; and He procures glory from both, saving these of His
    goodness, and punishing those of His justice. But the intellectual creature,
    when it sins, falls away from its due end. Nor is this unfitting in any
    exalted creature; because the intellectual creature was so made by God, that
    it lies within its own will to act for its end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> However great was the inclination
    towards good in the highest angel, there was no necessity imposed upon him:
    consequently it was in his power not to follow it.<br />

    Whether the sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others sinning?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of the highest angel
    was not the cause of the others sinning. For the cause precedes the effect.
    But, as Damascene observes (De Fide Orth. ii), they all sinned at one time.
    Therefore the sin of one was not the cause of the others' sinning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an angel's first sin can only be pride,
    as was shown above (<a href="FP063.html#FPQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But
    pride seeks excellence. Now it is more contrary to excellence for anyone to
    be subject to an inferior than to a superior; and so it does not appear that
    the angels sinned by desiring to be subject to a higher angel rather than to
    God. Yet the sin of one angel would have been the cause of the others
    sinning, if he had induced them to be his subjects. Therefore it does not
    appear that the sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others
    sinning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a greater sin to wish to be
    subject to another against God, than to wish to be over another against God;
    because there is less motive for sinning. If, therefore, the sin of the
    foremost angel was the cause of the others sinning, in that he induced them
    to subject themselves to him, then the lower angels would have sinned more
    deeply than the highest one; which is contrary to a gloss on Ps. 103:26:
    "This dragon which Thou hast formed---He who was the more excellent than the
    rest in nature, became the greater in malice." Therefore the sin of the
    highest angel was not the cause of the others sinning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++12%3A4"
      >Apoc. 12:4</a
    >) that the dragon "drew" with him "the third part of the stars of
    heaven."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sin of the highest angel was the cause of
    the others sinning; not as compelling them, but as inducing them by a kind
    of exhortation. A token thereof appears in this, that all the demons are
    subjects of that highest one; as is evident from our Lord's words: "Go
    [Vulg. 'Depart from Me'], you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was
    prepared for the devil and his angels" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++25%3A41"
      >Mt. 25:41</a
    >). For the order of Divine justice exacts that whosoever consents to
    another's evil suggestion, shall be subjected to him in his punishment;
    according to (2 Pt. 2:19): "By whom a man is overcome, of the same also he
    is the slave."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the demons all sinned in the
    one instant, yet the sin of one could be the cause of the rest sinning. For
    the angel needs no delay of time for choice, exhortation, or consent, as
    man, who requires deliberation in order to choose and consent, and vocal
    speech in order to exhort; both of which are the work of time. And it is
    evident that even man begins to speak in the very instant when he takes
    thought; and in the last instant of speech, another who catches his meaning
    can assent to what is said; as is especially evident with regard to primary
    concepts, "which everyone accepts directly they are heard" [*Boethius, De
    Hebdom.].
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking away, then, the time for speech and deliberation which is required in
    us; in the same instant in which the highest angel expressed his affection
    by intelligible speech, it was possible for the others to consent
    thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Other things being equal, the proud
    would rather be subject to a superior than to an inferior. Yet he chooses
    rather to be subject to an inferior than to a superior, if he can procure an
    advantage under an inferior which he cannot under a superior. Consequently
    it was not against the demons' pride for them to wish to serve an inferior
    by yielding to his rule; for they wanted to have him as their prince and
    leader, so that they might attain their ultimate beatitude of their own
    natural powers; especially because in the order of nature they were even
    then subject to the highest angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was observed above (<a
      href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FP062.html#FPQ62A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), an angel has nothing
    in him to retard his action, and with his whole might he is moved to
    whatsoever he is moved, be it good or bad. Consequently since the highest
    angel had greater natural energy than the lower angels, he fell into sin
    with intenser energy, and therefore he became the greater in malice.<br />

    Whether those who sinned were as many as those who remained firm?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that more angels sinned than stood
    firm. For, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6): "Evil is in many, but
    good is in few."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, justice and sin are to be found in the
    same way in men and in angels. But there are more wicked men to be found
    than good; according to Eccles. 1:15: "The number of fools is infinite."
    Therefore for the same reason it is so with the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angels are distinguished according
    to persons and orders. Therefore if more angelic persons stood firm, it
    would appear that those who sinned were not from all the orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++6%3A16"
      >4 Kgs. 6:16</a
    >): "There are more with us than with them": which is expounded of the good
    angels who are with us to aid us, and the wicked spirits who are our
    foes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> More angels stood firm than sinned. Because sin
    is contrary to the natural inclination; while that which is against the
    natural order happens with less frequency; for nature procures its effects
    either always, or more often than not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking with regard
    to men, in whom evil comes to pass from seeking after sensible pleasures,
    which are known to most men, and from forsaking the good dictated by reason,
    which good is known to the few. In the angels there is only an intellectual
    nature; hence the argument does not hold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>And from this we have the answer to the second difficulty.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to those who hold that the
    chief devil belonged to the lower order of the angels, who are set over
    earthly affairs, it is evident that some of every order did not fall, but
    only those of the lowest order. According to those who maintain that the
    chief devil was of the highest order, it is probable that some fell of every
    order; just as men are taken up into every order to supply for the angelic
    ruin. In this view the liberty of free-will is more established; which in
    every degree of creature can be turned to evil. In the Sacred Scripture,
    however, the names of some orders, as of Seraphim and Thrones, are not
    attributed to demons; since they are derived from the ardor of love and from
    God's indwelling, which are not consistent with mortal sin. Yet the names of
    Cherubim, Powers, and Principalities are attributed to them; because these
    names are derived from knowledge and from power, which can be common to both
    good and bad.<br />
