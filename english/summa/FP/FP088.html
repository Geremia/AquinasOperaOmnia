</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider how the human soul knows what is above itself, viz. 
immaterial substances. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP088.html#FPQ88A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the human soul in the present state of life can understand 
the immaterial substances called angels, in themselves?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP088.html#FPQ88A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it can arrive at the knowledge thereof by the knowledge of 
material things?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP088.html#FPQ88A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether God is the first object of our knowledge?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human soul in the present state of life 
can understand immaterial substances in themselves. For Augustine (De 
Trin. ix, 3) says: "As the mind itself acquires the knowledge of 
corporeal things by means of the corporeal senses, so it gains from 
itself the knowledge of incorporeal things." But these are the immaterial 
substances. Therefore the human mind understands immaterial substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, like is known by like. But the human mind is more akin 
to immaterial than to material things; since its own nature is 
immaterial, as is clear from what we have said above (<A Href="FP076.html#FPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="FP076.html#FPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Since 
then our mind understands material things, much  more is it able to 
understand immaterial things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fact that objects which are in themselves most 
sensible are not most felt by us, comes from sense being corrupted by 
their very excellence. But the intellect is not subject to such a 
corrupting influence from its object, as is stated De Anima iii, 4. 
Therefore things which are in themselves in the highest degree of 
intelligibility, are likewise to us most intelligible. As material 
things, however, are intelligible only so far as we make them actually so 
by abstracting them from material conditions, it is clear that those 
substances are more intelligible in themselves whose nature is 
immaterial. Therefore they are much more known to us than are material 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Commentator says (Metaph. ii) that "nature would be 
frustrated in its end" were we unable to understand abstract substances, 
"because it would have made what in itself is naturally intelligible not 
to be understood at all." But in nature nothing is idle or purposeless. 
Therefore immaterial substances can be understood by us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as sense is to the sensible, so is intellect to the 
intelligible. But our sight can see all things corporeal, whether 
superior and incorruptible; or lower and corruptible. Therefore our 
intellect can understand all intelligible substances, even the superior 
and immaterial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 9:16): "The things that are in 
heaven, who shall search out?" But these substances are said to be in 
heaven, according to Mt. 18:10, "Their angels in heaven," etc. Therefore 
immaterial substances cannot be known by human investigation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 1/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the opinion of Plato, immaterial substances are not 
only understood by us, but are the objects we understand first of all. 
For Plato taught that immaterial subsisting forms, which he called 
"Ideas," are the proper objects of our intellect, and thus first and "per 
se" understood by us; and, further, that material objects are known by 
the soul inasmuch as phantasy and sense are mixed up with the mind. Hence 
the purer the intellect is, so much the more clearly does it perceive the 
intelligible truth of immaterial things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 2/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in Aristotle's opinion, which experience corroborates, our intellect 
in its present state of life has a natural relationship to the natures of 
material things; and therefore it can only understand by turning to the 
phantasms, as we have said above (<A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Thus it clearly appears 
that immaterial substances which do not fall under sense and imagination, 
cannot first and "per se" be known by us, according to the mode of 
knowledge which experience proves us to have.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 3/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless Averroes (Comment. De Anima iii) teaches that in this 
present life man can in the end arrive at the knowledge of  separate 
substances by being coupled or united to some separate substance, which 
he calls the "active intellect," and which, being a separate substance 
itself, can naturally understand separate substances. Hence, when it is 
perfectly united to us so that by its means we are able to understand 
perfectly, we also shall be able to understand separate substances, as in 
the present life through the medium of the passive intellect united to 
us, we can understand material things. Now he said that the active 
intellect is united to us, thus. For since we understand by means of both 
the active intellect and intelligible objects, as, for instance, we 
understand conclusions by principles understood; it is clear that the 
active intellect must be compared to the objects understood, either as 
the principal agent is to the instrument, or as form to matter. For an 
action is ascribed to two principles in one of these two ways; to a 
principal agent and to an instrument, as cutting to the workman and the 
saw; to a form and its subject, as heating to heat and fire. In both 
these ways the active intellect can be compared to the intelligible 
object as perfection is to the perfectible, and as act is to 
potentiality. Now a subject is made perfect and receives its perfection 
at one and the same time, as the reception of what is actually visible 
synchronizes with the reception of light in the eye. Therefore the 
passive intellect receives the intelligible object and the active 
intellect together; and the more numerous the intelligible objects 
received, so much the nearer do we come to the point of perfect union 
between ourselves and the active intellect; so much so that when we 
understand all the intelligible objects, the active intellect becomes one 
with us, and by its instrumentality we can understand all things material 
and immaterial. In this he makes the ultimate happiness of man to 
consist. Nor, as regards the present inquiry, does it matter whether the 
passive intellect in that state of happiness understands separate 
substances by the instrumentality of the active intellect, as he himself 
maintains, or whether (as he says Alexander holds) the passive intellect 
can never understand separate substances (because according to him it is 
corruptible), but man understands separate substances by means of the 
active intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 4/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This opinion, however, is untrue. First, because, supposing the active 
intellect to be a separate substance, we could not formally understand by 
its instrumentality, for the medium of an agent's formal action consists 
in its form and act, since every agent acts according to its actuality, 
as was said of the passive intellect (<A Href="FP070.html#FPQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="FP070.html#FPQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Secondly, this 
opinion is untrue, because in the above explanation, the active 
intellect, supposing it to be a separate substance, would not be joined 
to us in its substance, but only in its light, as participated in things 
understood; and would not extend to the other acts of the active 
intellect so as to enable us to understand immaterial substances; just as 
when we see colors set off by the sun, we are not united to the substance 
of the sun so as to act like the sun, but its light only is united to us, 
that we may see the colors. Thirdly, this opinion is untrue, because 
granted that, as above explained, the active intellect were united to us 
in substance, still it is not said that it is wholly  so united in regard 
to one intelligible object, or two; but rather in regard to all 
intelligible objects. But all such objects together do not equal the 
force of the active intellect, as it is a much greater thing to 
understand separate substances than to understand all material things. 
Hence it clearly follows that the knowledge of all material things would 
not make the active intellect to be so united to us as to enable us by 
its instrumentality to understand separate substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 5/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, this opinion is untrue, because it is hardly possible for 
anyone in this world to understand all material things: and thus no one, 
or very few, could reach to perfect felicity; which is against what the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 9), that happiness is a "kind of common good, 
communicable to all capable of virtue." Further, it is unreasonable that 
only the few of any species attain to the end of the species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 6/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, the Philosopher expressly says (Ethic. i, 10), that happiness 
is "an operation according to perfect virtue"; and after enumerating many 
virtues in the tenth book, he concludes (Ethic. i, 7) that ultimate 
happiness consisting in the knowledge of the highest things intelligible 
is attained through the virtue of wisdom, which in the sixth chapter he 
had named as the chief of speculative sciences. Hence Aristotle clearly 
places the ultimate felicity of man in the knowledge of separate 
substances, obtainable by speculative science; and not by being united to 
the active intellect as some imagined.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 7/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, as was shown above (<A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="FP079.html#FPQ79A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the active intellect is not a 
separate substance; but a faculty of the soul, extending itself actively 
to the same objects to which the passive intellect extends receptively; 
because, as is stated (De Anima iii, 5), the passive intellect is "all 
things potentially," and the active intellect is "all things in act." 
Therefore both intellects, according to the present state of life, extend 
to material things only, which are made actually intelligible by the 
active intellect, and are received in the passive intellect. Hence in the 
present state of life we cannot understand separate immaterial substances 
in themselves, either by the passive or by the active intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine may be taken to mean that the knowledge of 
incorporeal things in the mind can be gained by the mind itself. This is 
so true that philosophers also say that the knowledge concerning the soul 
is a principle for the knowledge of separate substances. For by knowing 
itself, it attains to some knowledge of incorporeal substances, such as 
is within its compass; not that the knowledge of itself gives it a 
perfect and absolute knowledge of them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of nature is not a sufficient cause of 
knowledge; otherwise what Empedocles said would be true ---that the soul 
needs to have the nature of all in order to know all. But knowledge 
requires that the likeness of the thing known be in the knower, as a kind 
of form thereof. Now our passive intellect, in  the present state of 
life, is such that it can be informed with similitudes abstracted from 
phantasms: and therefore it knows material things rather than immaterial 
substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There must needs be some proportion between the object and 
the faculty of knowledge; such as of the active to the passive, and of 
perfection to the perfectible. Hence that sensible objects of great power 
are not grasped by the senses, is due not merely to the fact that they 
corrupt the organ, but also to their being improportionate to the 
sensitive power. And thus it is that immaterial substances are 
improportionate to our intellect, in our present state of life, so that 
it cannot understand them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument of the Commentator fails in several ways. 
First, because if separate substances are not understood by us, it does 
not follow that they are not understood by any intellect; for they are 
understood by themselves, and by one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to be understood by us is not the end of separate substances: 
while only that is vain and purposeless, which fails to attain its end. 
It does not follow, therefore, that immaterial substances are 
purposeless, even if they are not understood by us at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Sense knows bodies, whether superior or inferior, in the 
same way, that is, by the sensible acting on the organ. But we do not 
understand material and immaterial substances in the same way. The former 
we understand by a process of abstraction, which is impossible in the 
case of the latter, for there are no phantasms of what is immaterial.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that our intellect can know immaterial substances 
through the knowledge of material things. For Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 
i) that "the human mind cannot be raised up to immaterial contemplation 
of the heavenly hierarchies, unless it is led thereto by material 
guidance according to its own nature." Therefore we can be led by 
material things to know immaterial substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, science resides in the intellect. But there are sciences 
and definitions of immaterial substances; for Damascene defines an angel 
(De Fide Orth. ii, 3); and we find angels treated of both in theology and 
philosophy. Therefore immaterial substances can be understood by us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the human soul belongs to the genus of immaterial 
substances. But it can be understood by us through its act by which it 
understands material things. Therefore also other material substances can 
be understood by us, through their material  effects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the only cause which cannot be comprehended through its 
effects is that which is infinitely distant from them, and this belongs 
to God alone. Therefore other created immaterial substances can be 
understood by us through material things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i) that "intelligible things 
cannot be understood through sensible things, nor composite things 
through simple, nor incorporeal through corporeal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Averroes says (De Anima iii) that a philosopher named 
Avempace [*Ibn-Badja, Arabian Philosopher; ob. 1183] taught that by the 
understanding of natural substances we can be led, according to true 
philosophical principles, to the knowledge of immaterial substances. For 
since the nature of our intellect is to abstract the quiddity of material 
things from matter, anything material residing in that abstracted 
quiddity can again be made subject to abstraction; and as the process of 
abstraction cannot go on forever, it must arrive at length at some 
immaterial quiddity, absolutely without matter; and this would be the 
understanding of immaterial substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this opinion would be true, were immaterial substances the forms and 
species of these material things; as the Platonists supposed. But 
supposing, on the contrary, that immaterial substances differ altogether 
from the quiddity of material things, it follows that however much our 
intellect abstract the quiddity of material things from matter, it could 
never arrive at anything akin to immaterial substance. Therefore we are 
not able perfectly to understand immaterial substances through material 
substances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> From material things we can rise to some kind of knowledge 
of immaterial things, but not to the perfect knowledge thereof; for there 
is no proper and adequate proportion between material and immaterial 
things, and the likenesses drawn from material things for the 
understanding of immaterial things are very dissimilar therefrom, as 
Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Science treats of higher things principally by way of 
negation. Thus Aristotle (De Coel. i, 3) explains the heavenly bodies by 
denying to them inferior corporeal properties. Hence it follows that much 
less can immaterial substances be known by us in such a way as to make us 
know their quiddity; but we may have a scientific knowledge of them by 
way of negation and by their relation to material things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The human soul understands itself through its own act of 
understanding, which is proper to it, showing perfectly its power and 
nature. But the power and nature of immaterial substances cannot be 
perfectly known through such act, nor through any other material thing, 
because there is no proportion between the latter and the power of the 
former. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Created immaterial substances are not in the same natural 
genus as material substances, for they do not agree in power or in 
matter; but they belong to the same logical genus, because even 
immaterial substances are in the predicament of substance, as their 
essence is distinct from their existence. But God has no connection with 
material things, as regards either natural genus or logical genus; 
because God is in no genus, as stated above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Hence through 
the likeness derived from material things we can know something positive 
concerning the angels, according to some common notion, though not 
according to the specific nature; whereas we cannot acquire any such 
knowledge at all about God.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God is the first object known by the human 
mind. For that object in which all others are known, and by which we 
judge others, is the first thing known to us; as light is to the eye, and 
first principles to the intellect. But we know all things in the light of 
the first truth, and thereby judge of all things, as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xii, 2; De Vera Relig. xxxi; [*Confess. xii, 25]). Therefore God is 
the first object known to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever causes a thing to be such is more so. But God 
is the cause of all our knowledge; for He is "the true light which 
enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:9">Jn. 1:9</a>). Therefore 
God is our first and most known object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is first known in the image is the exemplar to 
which it is made. But in our mind is the image of God, as Augustine says 
(De Trin. xii, 4,7). Therefore God is the first object known to our mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> "No man hath seen God at any time" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:18">Jn. 1:18</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since the human intellect in the present state of life 
cannot understand even immaterial created substances (<A Href="FP088.html#FPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), much less 
can it understand the essence of the uncreated substance. Hence it must 
be said simply that God is not the first object of our knowledge. Rather 
do we know God through creatures, according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1:20">Rm. 1:20</a>), 
"the invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood by the 
things that are made": while the first object of our knowledge in this 
life is the "quiddity of a material thing," which is the proper object of 
our intellect, as appears above in many passages (<A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="FP085.html#FPQ85A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FP087.html#FPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FP087.html#FPQ87A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2)
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We see and judge of all things in the light of the first 
truth, forasmuch as the light itself of our mind, whether natural or 
gratuitous, is nothing else than the impression of the first truth upon 
it, as stated above (<A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="FP012.html#FPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence, as the light  itself of our 
intellect is not the object it understands, much less can it be said that 
God is the first object known by our intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The axiom, "Whatever causes a thing to be such is more so," 
must be understood of things belonging to one and the same order, as 
explained above (<A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="FP081.html#FPQ81A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). Other things than God are known 
because of God; not as if He were the first known object, but because He 
is the first cause of our faculty of knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If there existed in our souls a perfect image of God, as 
the Son is the perfect image of the Father, our mind would know God at 
once. But the image in our mind is imperfect; hence the argument does not 
prove.<br>
