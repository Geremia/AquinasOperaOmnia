    <br />
    OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THINGS IN GENERAL (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Having considered the creation of things and their distinction, we now
    consider in the third place the government thereof, and (1) the government
    of things in general; (2) in particular, the effects of this government.
    Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the world is governed by
    someone?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A2THEP1">(2)</a> What is the end of this
    government?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the world is governed by
    one?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the effects of this
    government?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether all things are subject to
    Divine government?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether all things are
    immediately governed by God?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the Divine government is
    frustrated in anything?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether anything is contrary to
    the Divine Providence?

  <h3 align="left">Whether the world is governed by anyone?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the world is not governed by
    anyone. For it belongs to those things to be governed, which move or work
    for an end. But natural things which make up the greater part of the world
    do not move, or work for an end; for they have no knowledge of their end.
    Therefore the world is not governed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things are governed which are
    moved towards an object. But the world does not appear to be so directed,
    but has stability in itself. Therefore it is not governed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is necessarily determined by its
    own nature to one particular thing, does not require any external principle
    of government. But the principal parts of the world are by a certain
    necessity determined to something particular in their actions and movements.
    Therefore the world does not require to be governed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 14:3): "But Thou, O
    Father, governest all things by Thy Providence." And Boethius says (De
    Consol. iii): "Thou Who governest this universe by mandate eternal."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that, Certain ancient philosophers denied the government of the
    world, saying that all things happened by chance. But such an opinion can be
    refuted as impossible in two ways. First, by observation of things
    themselves: for we observe that in nature things happen always or nearly
    always for the best; which would not be the case unless some sort of
    providence directed nature towards good as an end; which is to govern.
    Wherefore the unfailing order we observe in things is a sign of their being
    governed; for instance, if we enter a well-ordered house we gather therefrom
    the intention of him that put it in order, as Tullius says (De Nat. Deorum
    ii), quoting Aristotle [*Cleanthes]. Secondly, this is clear from a
    consideration of Divine goodness, which, as we have said above (<a
      href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), was the cause of the
    production of things in existence. For as "it belongs to the best to produce
    the best," it is not fitting that the supreme goodness of God should produce
    things without giving them their perfection. Now a thing's ultimate
    perfection consists in the attainment of its end. Therefore it belongs to
    the Divine goodness, as it brought things into existence, so to lead them to
    their end: and this is to govern.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A thing moves or operates for an end in
    two ways. First, in moving itself to the end, as man and other rational
    creatures; and such things have knowledge of their end, and of the means to
    the end. Secondly, a thing is said to move or operate for an end, as though
    moved or directed by another thereto, as an arrow directed to the target by
    the archer, who knows the end unknown to the arrow. Wherefore, as the
    movement of the arrow towards a definite end shows clearly that it is
    directed by someone with knowledge, so the unvarying course of natural
    things which are without knowledge, shows clearly that the world is governed
    by some reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In all created things there is a stable
    element, at least primary matter; and something belonging to movement, if
    under movement we include operation. And things need governing as to both:
    because even that which is stable, since it is created from nothing, would
    return to nothingness were it not sustained by a governing hand, as will be
    explained later (<a href="FP104.html#FPQ104OUTP1">Question [104]</a>,
    <a href="FP104.html#FPQ104A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The natural necessity inherent in those
    beings which are determined to a particular thing, is a kind of impression
    from God, directing them to their end; as the necessity whereby an arrow is
    moved so as to fly towards a certain point is an impression from the archer,
    and not from the arrow. But there is a difference, inasmuch as that which
    creatures receive from God is their nature, while that which natural things
    receive from man in addition to their nature is somewhat violent. Wherefore,
    as the violent necessity in the movement of the arrow shows the action of
    the archer, so the natural necessity of things shows the government of
    Divine Providence.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the end of the government of the world is something outside the
    world?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the end of the government of
    the world is not something existing outside the world. For the end of the
    government of a thing is that whereto the thing governed is brought. But
    that whereto a thing is brought is some good in the thing itself; thus a
    sick man is brought back to health, which is something good in him.
    Therefore the end of government of things is some good not outside, but
    within the things themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 1):
    "Some ends are an operation; some are a work"---i.e. produced by an
    operation. But nothing can be produced by the whole universe outside itself;
    and operation exists in the agent. Therefore nothing extrinsic can be the
    end of the government of things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of the multitude seems to
    consist in order, and peace which is the "tranquillity of order," as
    Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13). But the world is composed of a
    multitude of things. Therefore the end of the government of the world is the
    peaceful order in things themselves. Therefore the end of the government of
    the world is not an extrinsic good.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++16%3A4"
      >Prov. 16:4</a
    >): "The Lord hath made all things for Himself." But God is outside the
    entire order of the universe. Therefore the end of all things is something
    extrinsic to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the end of a thing corresponds to its
    beginning, it is not possible to be ignorant of the end of things if we know
    their beginning. Therefore, since the beginning of all things is something
    outside the universe, namely, God, it is clear from what has been expounded
    above (<a href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>,
    <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), that we must conclude
    that the end of all things is some extrinsic good. This can be proved by
    reason. For it is clear that good has the nature of an end; wherefore, a
    particular end of anything consists in some particular good; while the
    universal end of all things is the Universal Good; Which is good of Itself
    by virtue of Its Essence, Which is the very essence of goodness; whereas a
    particular good is good by participation. Now it is manifest that in the
    whole created universe there is not a good which is not such by
    participation. Wherefore that good which is the end of the whole universe
    must be a good outside the universe.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We may acquire some good in many ways:
    first, as a form existing in us, such as health or knowledge; secondly, as
    something done by us, as a builder attains his end by building a house;
    thirdly, as something good possessed or acquired by us, as the buyer of a
    field attains his end when he enters into possession. Wherefore nothing
    prevents something outside the universe being the good to which it is
    directed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of the ends
    of various arts; for the end of some arts consists in the operation itself,
    as the end of a harpist is to play the harp; whereas the end of other arts
    consists in something produced, as the end of a builder is not the act of
    building, but the house he builds. Now it may happen that something
    extrinsic is the end not only as made, but also as possessed or acquired or
    even as represented, as if we were to say that Hercules is the end of the
    statue made to represent him. Therefore we may say that some good outside
    the whole universe is the end of the government of the universe, as
    something possessed and represented; for each thing tends to a participation
    thereof, and to an assimilation thereto, as far as is possible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A good existing in the universe, namely,
    the order of the universe, is an end thereof; this. however, is not its
    ultimate end, but is ordered to the extrinsic good as to the end: thus the
    order in an army is ordered to the general, as stated in Metaph. xii, Did.
    xi, 10.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the world is governed by one?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the world is not governed by
    one. For we judge the cause by the effect. Now, we see in the government of
    the universe that things are not moved and do not operate uniformly, but
    some contingently and some of necessity in variously different ways.
    Therefore the world is not governed by one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things which are governed by one do not
    act against each other, except by the incapacity or unskillfulness of the
    ruler; which cannot apply to God. But created things agree not together, and
    act against each other; as is evident in the case of contraries. Therefore
    the world is not governed by one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in nature we always find what is the
    better. But it "is better that two should be together than one" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++4%3A9"
      >Eccles. 4:9</a
    >). Therefore the world is not governed by one, but by many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> We confess our belief in one God and one
    Lord, according to the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++8%3A6"
      >1 Cor. 8:6</a
    >): "To us there is but one God, the Father... and one Lord": and both of
    these pertain to government. For to the Lord belongs dominion over subjects;
    and the name of God is taken from Providence as stated above (<a
      href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="FP013.html#FPQ13A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore the world
    is governed by one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must of necessity say that the world is
    governed by one. For since the end of the government of the world is that
    which is essentially good, which is the greatest good; the government of the
    world must be the best kind of government. Now the best government is the
    government by one. The reason of this is that government is nothing but the
    directing of the things governed to the end; which consists in some good.
    But unity belongs to the idea of goodness, as Boethius proves (De Consol.
    iii, 11) from this, that, as all things desire good, so do they desire
    unity; without which they would cease to exist. For a thing so far exists as
    it is one. Whence we observe that things resist division, as far as they
    can; and the dissolution of a thing arises from defect therein. Therefore
    the intention of a ruler over a multitude is unity, or peace. Now the proper
    cause of unity is one. For it is clear that several cannot be the cause of
    unity or concord, except so far as they are united. Furthermore, what is one
    in itself is a more apt and a better cause of unity than several things
    united. Therefore a multitude is better governed by one than by several.
    From this it follows that the government of the world, being the best form
    of government, must be by one. This is expressed by the Philosopher (Metaph.
    xii, Did. xi, 10): "Things refuse to be ill governed; and multiplicity of
    authorities is a bad thing, therefore there should be one ruler."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Movement is "the act of a thing moved,
    caused by the mover." Wherefore dissimilarity of movements is caused by
    diversity of things moved, which diversity is essential to the perfection of
    the universe (<a href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="FP047.html#FPQ47ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>,
    <a href="FP048.html#FPQ48A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and not by a diversity
    of governors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although contraries do not agree with
    each other in their proximate ends, nevertheless they agree in the ultimate
    end, so far as they are included in the one order of the universe.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If we consider individual goods, then
    two are better than one. But if we consider the essential good, then no
    addition is possible.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the effect of government is one or many?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is but one effect of the
    government of the world and not many. For the effect of government is that
    which is caused in the things governed. This is one, namely, the good which
    consists in order; as may be seen in the example of an army. Therefore the
    government of the world has but one effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, from one there naturally proceeds but
    one. But the world is governed by one as we have proved (<a
      href="FP103.html#FPQ103A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Therefore also the effect of this government is but one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the effect of government is not one
    by reason of the unity of the Governor, it must be many by reason of the
    many things governed. But these are too numerous to be counted. Therefore we
    cannot assign any definite number to the effects of government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii): "God contains
    all and fills all by His providence and perfect goodness." But government
    belongs to providence. Therefore there are certain definite effects of the
    Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of any action may be judged from its
    end; because it is by action that the attainment of the end is effected. Now
    the end of the government of the world is the essential good, to the
    participation and similarity of which all things tend. Consequently the
    effect of the government of the world may be taken in three ways. First, on
    the part of the end itself; and in this way there is but one effect, that
    is, assimilation to the supreme good. Secondly, the effect of the government
    of the world may be considered on the part of those things by means of which
    the creature is made like to God. Thus there are, in general, two effects of
    the government. For the creature is assimilated to God in two things; first,
    with regard to this, that God is good; and so the creature becomes like Him
    by being good; and secondly, with regard to this, that God is the cause of
    goodness in others; and so the creature becomes like God by moving others to
    be good. Wherefore there are two effects of government, the preservation of
    things in their goodness, and the moving of things to good. Thirdly, we may
    consider in the individual the effects of the government of the world; and
    in this way they are without number.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The order of the universe includes both
    the preservation of things created by God and their movement. As regards
    these two things we find order among them, inasmuch as one is better than
    another; and one is moved by another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From what has been said above, we can gather the replies to the other two
    objections.<br />

    Whether all things are subject to the Divine government?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all things are subject to
    the Divine government. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++9%3A11"
      >Eccles. 9:11</a
    >): "I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle
    to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favor
    to the skillful, but time and chance in all." But things subject to the
    Divine government are not ruled by chance. Therefore those things which are
    under the sun are not subject to the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++9%3A9"
      >1 Cor. 9:9</a
    >): "God hath no care for oxen." But he that governs has care for the things
    he governs. Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine
    government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what can govern itself needs not to be
    governed by another. But the rational creature can govern itself; since it
    is master of its own act, and acts of itself; and is not made to act by
    another, which seems proper to things which are governed. Therefore all
    things are not subject to the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 11): "Not only
    heaven and earth, not only man and angel, even the bowels of the lowest
    animal, even the wing of the bird, the flower of the plant, the leaf of the
    tree, hath God endowed with every fitting detail of their nature." Therefore
    all things are subject to His government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> For the same reason is God the ruler of things
    as He is their cause, because the same gives existence as gives perfection;
    and this belongs to government. Now God is the cause not indeed only of some
    particular kind of being, but of the whole universal being, as proved above
    (<a href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>,
    <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Wherefore, as there
    can be nothing which is not created by God, so there can be nothing which is
    not subject to His government. This can also be proved from the nature of
    the end of government. For a man's government extends over all those things
    which come under the end of his government. Now the end of the Divine
    government is the Divine goodness; as we have shown (<a
      href="FP103.html#FPQ103A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Wherefore, as there can be nothing that is not ordered to the Divine
    goodness as its end, as is clear from what we have said above (<a
      href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), so it is impossible for
    anything to escape from the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Foolish therefore was the opinion of those who said that the corruptible
    lower world, or individual things, or that even human affairs, were not
    subject to the Divine government. These are represented as saying, "God hath
    abandoned the earth" (Ezech. 9:9).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These things are said to be under the
    sun which are generated and corrupted according to the sun's movement. In
    all such things we find chance: not that everything is casual which occurs
    in such things; but that in each one there is an element of chance. And the
    very fact that an element of chance is found in those things proves that
    they are subject to government of some kind. For unless corruptible things
    were governed by a higher being, they would tend to nothing definite,
    especially those which possess no kind of knowledge. So nothing would happen
    unintentionally; which constitutes the nature of chance. Wherefore to show
    how things happen by chance and yet according to the ordering of a higher
    cause, he does not say absolutely that he observes chance in all things, but
    "time and chance," that is to say, that defects may be found in these things
    according to some order of time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Government implies a certain change
    effected by the governor in the things governed. Now every movement is the
    act of a movable thing, caused by the moving principle, as is laid down
    Phys. iii, 3. And every act is proportionate to that of which it is an act.
    Consequently, various movable things must be moved variously, even as
    regards movement by one and the same mover. Thus by the one art of the
    Divine governor, various things are variously governed according to their
    variety. Some, according to their nature, act of themselves, having dominion
    over their actions; and these are governed by God, not only in this, that
    they are moved by God Himself, Who works in them interiorly; but also in
    this, that they are induced by Him to do good and to fly from evil, by
    precepts and prohibitions, rewards and punishments. But irrational creatures
    which do not act but are acted upon, are not thus governed by God. Hence,
    when the Apostle says that "God hath no care for oxen," he does not wholly
    withdraw them from the Divine government, but only as regards the way in
    which rational creatures are governed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rational creature governs itself by
    its intellect and will, both of which require to be governed and perfected
    by the Divine intellect and will. Therefore above the government whereby the
    rational creature governs itself as master of its own act, it requires to be
    governed by God.<br />

    Whether all things are immediately governed by God?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all things are governed by God
    immediately. For Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.) reproves the
    opinion of Plato who divides providence into three parts. The first he
    ascribes to the supreme god, who watches over heavenly things and all
    universals; the second providence he attributes to the secondary deities,
    who go the round of the heavens to watch over generation and corruption;
    while he ascribes a third providence to certain spirits who are guardians on
    earth of human actions. Therefore it seems that all things are immediately
    governed by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is better that a thing be done by
    one, if possible, than by many, as the Philosopher says (Phys. viii, 6). But
    God can by Himself govern all things without any intermediary cause.
    Therefore it seems that He governs all things immediately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in God nothing is defective or
    imperfect. But it seems to be imperfect in a ruler to govern by means of
    others; thus an earthly king, by reason of his not being able to do
    everything himself, and because he cannot be everywhere at the same time,
    requires to govern by means of ministers. Therefore God governs all things
    immediately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4): "As the
    lower and grosser bodies are ruled in a certain orderly way by bodies of
    greater subtlety and power; so all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit
    of life; and the sinful and unfaithful spirit is ruled by the good and just
    spirit of life; and this spirit by God Himself."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In government there are two things to be
    considered; the design of government, which is providence itself; and the
    execution of the design. As to the design of government, God governs all
    things immediately; whereas in its execution, He governs some things by
    means of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason of this is that as God is the very essence of goodness, so
    everything must be attributed to God in its highest degree of goodness. Now
    the highest degree of goodness in any practical order, design or knowledge
    (and such is the design of government) consists in knowing the individuals
    acted upon; as the best physician is not the one who can only give his
    attention to general principles, but who can consider the least details; and
    so on in other things. Therefore we must say that God has the design of the
    government of all things, even of the very least.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since things which are governed should be brought to perfection by
    government, this government will be so much the better in the degree the
    things governed are brought to perfection. Now it is a greater perfection
    for a thing to be good in itself and also the cause of goodness in others,
    than only to be good in itself. Therefore God so governs things that He
    makes some of them to be causes of others in government; as a master, who
    not only imparts knowledge to his pupils, but gives also the faculty of
    teaching others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Plato's opinion is to be rejected,
    because he held that God did not govern all things immediately, even in the
    design of government; this is clear from the fact that he divided
    providence, which is the design of government, into three parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If God governed alone, things would be
    deprived of the perfection of causality. Wherefore all that is effected by
    many would not be accomplished by one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That an earthly king should have
    ministers to execute his laws is a sign not only of his being imperfect, but
    also of his dignity; because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power
    is brought into greater evidence.<br />

    Whether anything can happen outside the order of the Divine government?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem possible that something may occur
    outside the order of the Divine government. For Boethius says (De Consol.
    iii) that "God disposes all for good." Therefore, if nothing happens outside
    the order of the Divine government, it would follow that no evil exists.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing that is in accordance with the
    pre-ordination of a ruler occurs by chance. Therefore, if nothing occurs
    outside the order of the Divine government, it follows that there is nothing
    fortuitous and casual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the order of Divine Providence is
    certain and unchangeable; because it is in accordance with the eternal
    design. Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine
    government, it follows that all things happen by necessity, and nothing is
    contingent; which is false. Therefore it is possible for something to occur
    outside the order of the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Esther 13:9): "O Lord, Lord,
    almighty King, all things are in Thy power, and there is none that can
    resist Thy will."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is possible for an effect to result outside
    the order of some particular cause; but not outside the order of the
    universal cause. The reason of this is that no effect results outside the
    order of a particular cause, except through some other impeding cause; which
    other cause must itself be reduced to the first universal cause; as
    indigestion may occur outside the order of the nutritive power by some such
    impediment as the coarseness of the food, which again is to be ascribed to
    some other cause, and so on till we come to the first universal cause.
    Therefore as God is the first universal cause, not of one genus only, but of
    all being in general, it is impossible for anything to occur outside the
    order of the Divine government; but from the very fact that from one point
    of view something seems to evade the order of Divine providence considered
    in regard to one particular cause, it must necessarily come back to that
    order as regards some other cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is nothing wholly evil in the
    world, for evil is ever founded on good, as shown above (<a
      href="FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1"
      >Question [48]</a
    >, <a href="FP048.html#FPQ48A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore something
    is said to be evil through its escaping from the order of some particular
    good. If it wholly escaped from the order of the Divine government, it would
    wholly cease to exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Things are said to be fortuitous as
    regards some particular cause from the order of which they escape. But as to
    the order of Divine providence, "nothing in the world happens by chance," as
    Augustine declares (Questions. 83, qu. 24).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certain effects are said to be
    contingent as compared to their proximate causes, which may fail in their
    effects; and not as though anything could happen entirely outside the order
    of Divine government. The very fact that something occurs outside the order
    of some proximate cause, is owing to some other cause, itself subject to the
    Divine government.<br />

    Whether anything can resist the order of the Divine government?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem possible that some resistance can
    be made to the order of the Divine government. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++3%3A8"
      >Is. 3:8</a
    >): "Their tongue and their devices are against the Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a king does not justly punish those who
    do not rebel against his commands. Therefore if no one rebelled against
    God's commands, no one would be justly punished by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything is subject to the order of
    the Divine government. But some things oppose others. Therefore some things
    rebel against the order of the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. iii): "There is
    nothing that can desire or is able to resist this sovereign good. It is this
    sovereign good therefore that ruleth all mightily and ordereth all sweetly,"
    as is said (Wis. 8) of Divine wisdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider the order of Divine providence
    in two ways: in general, inasmuch as it proceeds from the governing cause of
    all; and in particular, inasmuch as it proceeds from some particular cause
    which executes the order of the Divine government.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Considered in the first way, nothing can resist the order of the Divine
    government. This can be proved in two ways: firstly from the fact that the
    order of the Divine government is wholly directed to good, and everything by
    its own operation and effort tends to good only, "for no one acts intending
    evil," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): secondly from the fact that, as we
    have said above (<a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3;
    <a href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 2), every
    inclination of anything, whether natural or voluntary, is nothing but a kind
    of impression from the first mover; as the inclination of the arrow towards
    a fixed point is nothing but an impulse received from the archer. Wherefore
    every agent, whether natural or free, attains to its divinely appointed end,
    as though of its own accord. For this reason God is said "to order all
    things sweetly."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some are said to think or speak, or act
    against God: not that they entirely resist the order of the Divine
    government; for even the sinner intends the attainment of a certain good:
    but because they resist some particular good, which belongs to their nature
    or state. Therefore they are justly punished by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> is clear from the above.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the fact that one thing opposes
    another, it follows that some one thing can resist the order of a particular
    cause; but not that order which depends on the universal cause of all
    things.<br />
