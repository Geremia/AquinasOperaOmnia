OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THINGS IN GENERAL (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having considered the creation of things and their distinction, we now 
consider in the third place the government thereof, and (1) the 
government of things in general; (2) in particular, the effects of this 
government. Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the world is governed by someone?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A2THEP1">(2)</a> What is the end of this government? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the world is governed by one?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the effects of this government?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether all things are subject to Divine government?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether all things are immediately governed by God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the Divine government is frustrated in anything?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether anything is contrary to the Divine Providence?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the world is not governed by anyone. For it 
belongs to those things to be governed, which move or work for an end. 
But natural things which make up the greater part of the world do not 
move, or work for an end; for they have no knowledge of their end. 
Therefore the world is not governed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things are governed which are moved towards an 
object. But the world does not appear to be so directed, but has 
stability in itself. Therefore it is not governed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is necessarily determined by its own nature to one 
particular thing, does not require any external principle of government. 
But the principal parts of the world are by a certain necessity 
determined to something particular in their actions and movements. 
Therefore the world does not require to be governed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 14:3): "But Thou, O Father, 
governest all things by Thy Providence." And Boethius says (De Consol. 
iii): "Thou Who governest this universe by mandate eternal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  I answer that, Certain ancient philosophers denied the government of 
the world, saying that all things happened by chance. But such an opinion 
can be refuted as impossible in two ways. First, by observation of things 
themselves: for we observe that in nature things happen always or nearly 
always for the best; which would not be the case unless some sort of 
providence directed nature towards good as an end; which is to govern. 
Wherefore the unfailing order we observe in things is a sign of their 
being governed; for instance, if we enter a well-ordered house we gather 
therefrom the intention of him that put it in order, as Tullius says (De 
Nat. Deorum ii), quoting Aristotle [*Cleanthes]. Secondly, this is clear 
from a consideration of Divine goodness, which, as we have said above 
(<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), was the cause of the production of things in 
existence. For as "it belongs to the best to produce the best," it is not 
fitting that the supreme goodness of God should produce things without 
giving them their perfection. Now a thing's ultimate perfection consists 
in the attainment of its end. Therefore it belongs to the Divine 
goodness, as it brought things into existence, so to lead them to their 
end: and this is to govern.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A thing moves or operates for an end in two ways.  First, 
in moving itself to the end, as man and other rational creatures; and 
such things have knowledge of their end, and of the means to the end. 
Secondly, a thing is said to move or operate for an end, as though moved 
or directed by another thereto, as an arrow directed to the target by the 
archer, who knows the end unknown to the arrow. Wherefore, as the 
movement of the arrow towards a definite end shows clearly that it is 
directed by someone with knowledge, so the unvarying course of natural 
things which are without knowledge, shows clearly that the world is 
governed by some reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In all created things there is a stable element, at least 
primary matter; and something belonging to movement, if under movement we 
include operation. And things need governing as to both: because even 
that which is stable, since it is created from nothing, would return to 
nothingness were it not sustained by a governing hand, as will be 
explained later (<A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104OUTP1">Question [104]</a>, <A Href="FP104.html#FPQ104A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The natural necessity inherent in those beings which are 
determined to a particular thing, is a kind of impression from God, 
directing them to their end; as the necessity whereby an arrow is moved 
so as to fly towards a certain point is an impression from the archer, 
and not from the arrow. But there is a difference, inasmuch as that which 
creatures receive from God is their nature, while that which natural 
things receive from man in addition to their nature is somewhat violent. 
Wherefore, as the violent necessity in the movement of the arrow shows 
the action of the archer, so the natural necessity of things shows the 
government of Divine Providence.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the end of the government of the world is something outside the world?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the end of the government of the world is not 
something existing outside the world. For the end of the government of a 
thing is that whereto the thing governed is brought. But that whereto a 
thing is brought is some good in the thing itself; thus a sick man is 
brought back to health, which is something good in him. Therefore the end 
of government of things is some good not outside, but within the things 
themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 1): "Some ends are an 
operation; some are a work"---i.e. produced by an operation. But nothing 
can be produced by the whole universe outside itself; and operation 
exists in the agent. Therefore nothing extrinsic can be the end of the 
government of things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of the multitude seems to consist in order, and 
peace which is the "tranquillity of order," as Augustine says (De Civ. 
Dei xix, 13). But the world is composed of a multitude of things. 
Therefore the end of the government of the world is the peaceful order in 
things themselves. Therefore the end of the government of the world is 
not an extrinsic good. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++16:4">Prov. 16:4</a>): "The Lord hath made all 
things for Himself." But God is outside the entire order of the universe. 
Therefore the end of all things is something extrinsic to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning, it is 
not possible to be ignorant of the end of things if we know their 
beginning. Therefore, since the beginning of all things is something 
outside the universe, namely, God, it is clear from what has been 
expounded above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), that we must conclude that the end of 
all things is some extrinsic good. This can be proved by reason. For it 
is clear that good has the nature of an end; wherefore, a particular end 
of anything consists in some particular good; while the universal end of 
all things is the Universal Good; Which is good of Itself by virtue of 
Its Essence, Which is the very essence of goodness; whereas a particular 
good is good by participation. Now it is manifest that in the whole 
created universe there is not a good which is not such by participation. 
Wherefore that good which is the end of the whole universe must be a good 
outside the universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We may acquire some good in many ways: first, as a form 
existing in us, such as health or knowledge; secondly, as something done 
by us, as a builder attains his end by building a house; thirdly, as 
something good possessed or acquired by us, as the buyer of a field 
attains his end when he enters into possession. Wherefore nothing 
prevents something outside the universe being the good to which it is 
directed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of the ends of various arts; 
for the end of some arts consists in the operation itself, as the end of 
a harpist is to play the harp; whereas the end of other arts consists in 
something produced, as the end of a builder is not the act of building, 
but the house he builds. Now it may happen that something extrinsic is 
the end not only as made, but also as possessed or acquired or even as 
represented, as if we were to say that Hercules is the end of the statue 
made to represent him. Therefore we may say that some good outside the 
whole universe is the end of the government of the universe, as something 
possessed and represented; for each thing tends to a participation 
thereof, and to an assimilation thereto, as far as is possible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A good existing in the universe, namely, the order of the 
universe, is an end thereof; this. however, is not its ultimate end, but 
is ordered to the extrinsic good as to the end: thus the order in an army 
is ordered to the general, as stated in Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the world is not governed by one.  For we 
judge the cause by the effect. Now, we see in the government of the 
universe that things are not moved and do not operate uniformly, but some 
contingently and some of necessity in variously different ways. Therefore 
the world is not governed by one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things which are governed by one do not act against each 
other, except by the incapacity or unskillfulness of the ruler; which 
cannot apply to God. But created things agree not together, and act 
against each other; as is evident in the case of contraries. Therefore 
the world is not governed by one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in nature we always find what is the better. But it "is 
better that two should be together than one" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++4:9">Eccles. 4:9</a>). Therefore the 
world is not governed by one, but by many.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We confess our belief in one God and one Lord, 
according to the words of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++8:6">1 Cor. 8:6</a>): "To us there is but 
one God, the Father . . . and one Lord": and both of these pertain to 
government. For to the Lord belongs dominion over subjects; and the name 
of God is taken from Providence as stated above (<A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FP013.html#FPQ13A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore 
the world is governed by one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We must of necessity say that the world is governed by 
one. For since the end of the government of the world is that which is 
essentially good, which is the greatest good; the government of the world 
must be the best kind of government. Now the best government is the 
government by one. The reason of this is that government is nothing but 
the directing of the things governed to the end; which consists in some 
good. But unity belongs to the idea of goodness, as Boethius proves (De 
Consol. iii, 11) from this, that, as all things desire good, so do they 
desire unity; without which they would cease to exist. For a thing so far 
exists as it is one. Whence we observe that things resist division, as 
far as they can; and the dissolution of a thing arises from defect 
therein. Therefore the intention of a ruler over a multitude is unity, or 
peace. Now the proper cause of unity is one. For it is clear that several 
cannot be the cause of unity or concord, except so far as they are 
united. Furthermore, what is one in itself is a more apt and a better 
cause of unity than several things united. Therefore a multitude is 
better governed by one than by several. From this it follows that the 
government of the world, being the best form of government, must be by 
one. This is expressed by the Philosopher (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10): 
"Things refuse to be ill governed; and multiplicity of authorities is a 
bad thing, therefore there should be one ruler."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Movement is "the act of a thing moved, caused by the 
mover." Wherefore dissimilarity of movements is caused by diversity of 
things moved, which diversity is essential to the perfection of the 
universe (<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2; <A Href="FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="FP048.html#FPQ48A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and not by a diversity of 
governors.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although contraries do not agree with each other in their 
proximate ends, nevertheless they agree in the ultimate  end, so far as 
they are included in the one order of the universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If we consider individual goods, then two are better than 
one. But if we consider the essential good, then no addition is possible.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is but one effect of the government of 
the world and not many. For the effect of government is that which is 
caused in the things governed. This is one, namely, the good which 
consists in order; as may be seen in the example of an army. Therefore 
the government of the world has but one effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, from one there naturally proceeds but one. But the world 
is governed by one as we have proved (<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore also the effect of 
this government is but one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the effect of government is not one by reason of the 
unity of the Governor, it must be many by reason of the many things 
governed. But these are too numerous to be counted. Therefore we cannot 
assign any definite number to the effects of government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii): "God contains all and 
fills all by His providence and perfect goodness." But government belongs 
to providence. Therefore there are certain definite effects of the Divine 
government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of any action may be judged from its end; 
because it is by action that the attainment of the end is effected. Now 
the end of the government of the world is the essential good, to the 
participation and similarity of which all things tend. Consequently the 
effect of the government of the world may be taken in three ways. First, 
on the part of the end itself; and in this way there is but one effect, 
that is, assimilation to the supreme good. Secondly, the effect of the 
government of the world may be considered on the part of those things by 
means of which the creature is made like to God. Thus there are, in 
general, two effects of the government. For the creature is assimilated 
to God in two things; first, with regard to this, that God is good; and 
so the creature becomes like Him by being good; and secondly, with regard 
to this, that God is the cause of goodness in others; and so the creature 
becomes like God by moving others to be good. Wherefore there are two 
effects of government, the preservation of things in their goodness, and 
the moving of things to good. Thirdly, we may consider in the individual 
the effects of the government of the world; and in this way they are 
without number.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The order of the universe includes both the preservation of 
things created by God and their movement. As regards these two things we 
find order among them, inasmuch as one  is better than another; and one 
is moved by another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From what has been said above, we can gather the replies to the other 
two objections.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all things are subject to the Divine 
government. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++9:11">Eccles. 9:11</a>): "I saw that under the sun 
the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to 
the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favor to the skillful, but time 
and chance in all." But things subject to the Divine government are not 
ruled by chance. Therefore those things which are under the sun are not 
subject to the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++9:9">1 Cor. 9:9</a>): "God hath no care for 
oxen." But he that governs has care for the things he governs. Therefore 
all things are not subject to the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what can govern itself needs not to be governed by 
another. But the rational creature can govern itself; since it is master 
of its own act, and acts of itself; and is not made to act by another, 
which seems proper to things which are governed. Therefore all things are 
not subject to the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 11): "Not only heaven 
and earth, not only man and angel, even the bowels of the lowest animal, 
even the wing of the bird, the flower of the plant, the leaf of the tree, 
hath God endowed with every fitting detail of their nature." Therefore 
all things are subject to His government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> For the same reason is God the ruler of things as He is 
their cause, because the same gives existence as gives perfection; and 
this belongs to government. Now God is the cause not indeed only of some 
particular kind of being, but of the whole universal being, as proved 
above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Wherefore, as there can be nothing which is not 
created by God, so there can be nothing which is not subject to His 
government. This can also be proved from the nature of the end of 
government. For a man's government extends over all those things which 
come under the end of his government. Now the end of the Divine 
government is the Divine goodness; as we have shown (<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Wherefore, as 
there can be nothing that is not ordered to the Divine goodness as its 
end, as is clear from what we have said above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FP065.html#FPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), 
so it is impossible for anything to escape from the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Foolish therefore was the opinion of those who said that the corruptible 
lower world, or individual things, or that even human affairs, were not 
subject to the Divine government. These are represented as saying, "God 
hath abandoned the earth" (Ezech. 9:9). 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These things are said to be under the sun which are 
generated and corrupted according to the sun's movement. In all such 
things we find chance: not that everything is casual which occurs in such 
things; but that in each one there is an element of chance. And the very 
fact that an element of chance is found in those things proves that they 
are subject to government of some kind. For unless corruptible things 
were governed by a higher being, they would tend to nothing definite, 
especially those which possess no kind of knowledge. So nothing would 
happen unintentionally; which constitutes the nature of chance. Wherefore 
to show how things happen by chance and yet according to the ordering of 
a higher cause, he does not say absolutely that he observes chance in all 
things, but "time and chance," that is to say, that defects may be found 
in these things according to some order of time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Government implies a certain change effected by the 
governor in the things governed. Now every movement is the act of a 
movable thing, caused by the moving principle, as is laid down Phys. iii, 
3. And every act is proportionate to that of which it is an act. 
Consequently, various movable things must be moved variously, even as 
regards movement by one and the same mover. Thus by the one art of the 
Divine governor, various things are variously governed according to their 
variety. Some, according to their nature, act of themselves, having 
dominion over their actions; and these are governed by God, not only in 
this, that they are moved by God Himself, Who works in them interiorly; 
but also in this, that they are induced by Him to do good and to fly from 
evil, by precepts and prohibitions, rewards and punishments. But 
irrational creatures which do not act but are acted upon, are not thus 
governed by God. Hence, when the Apostle says that "God hath no care for 
oxen," he does not wholly withdraw them from the Divine government, but 
only as regards the way in which rational creatures are governed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rational creature governs itself by its intellect and 
will, both of which require to be governed and perfected by the Divine 
intellect and will. Therefore above the government whereby the rational 
creature governs itself as master of its own act, it requires to be 
governed by God.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all things are governed by God immediately. 
For Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.) reproves the opinion of 
Plato who divides providence into three parts. The first he ascribes to 
the supreme god, who watches over heavenly things and all universals; the 
second providence he attributes to the secondary deities, who go the 
round of the heavens to watch over generation and corruption; while he 
ascribes a third providence to certain spirits who are guardians on earth 
of human actions. Therefore it seems that all things are immediately  
governed by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is better that a thing be done by one, if possible, 
than by many, as the Philosopher says (Phys. viii, 6). But God can by 
Himself govern all things without any intermediary cause. Therefore it 
seems that He governs all things immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in God nothing is defective or imperfect. But it seems 
to be imperfect in a ruler to govern by means of others; thus an earthly 
king, by reason of his not being able to do everything himself, and 
because he cannot be everywhere at the same time, requires to govern by 
means of ministers. Therefore God governs all things immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4): "As the lower and 
grosser bodies are ruled in a certain orderly way by bodies of greater 
subtlety and power; so all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of 
life; and the sinful and unfaithful spirit is ruled by the good and just 
spirit of life; and this spirit by God Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In government there are two things to be considered; the 
design of government, which is providence itself; and the execution of 
the design. As to the design of government, God governs all things 
immediately; whereas in its execution, He governs some things by means of 
others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason of this is that as God is the very essence of goodness, so 
everything must be attributed to God in its highest degree of goodness. 
Now the highest degree of goodness in any practical order, design or 
knowledge (and such is the design of government) consists in knowing the 
individuals acted upon; as the best physician is not the one who can only 
give his attention to general principles, but who can consider the least 
details; and so on in other things. Therefore we must say that God has 
the design of the government of all things, even of the very least.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But since things which are governed should be brought to perfection by 
government, this government will be so much the better in the degree the 
things governed are brought to perfection. Now it is a greater perfection 
for a thing to be good in itself and also the cause of goodness in 
others, than only to be good in itself. Therefore God so governs things 
that He makes some of them to be causes of others in government; as a 
master, who not only imparts knowledge to his pupils, but gives also the 
faculty of teaching others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Plato's opinion is to be rejected, because he held that God 
did not govern all things immediately, even in the design of government; 
this is clear from the fact that he divided providence, which is the 
design of government, into three parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If God governed alone, things would be deprived of the 
perfection of causality. Wherefore all that is effected by  many would 
not be accomplished by one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That an earthly king should have ministers to execute his 
laws is a sign not only of his being imperfect, but also of his dignity; 
because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power is brought into 
greater evidence.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether anything can happen outside the order of the Divine government?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem possible that something may occur outside the order 
of the Divine government. For Boethius says (De Consol. iii) that "God 
disposes all for good." Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order 
of the Divine government, it would follow that no evil exists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing that is in accordance with the pre-ordination of 
a ruler occurs by chance. Therefore, if nothing occurs outside the order 
of the Divine government, it follows that there is nothing fortuitous and 
casual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the order of Divine Providence is certain and 
unchangeable; because it is in accordance with the eternal design. 
Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine government, 
it follows that all things happen by necessity, and nothing is 
contingent; which is false. Therefore it is possible for something to 
occur outside the order of the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Esther 13:9): "O Lord, Lord, almighty 
King, all things are in Thy power, and there is none that can resist Thy 
will."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is possible for an effect to result outside the order 
of some particular cause; but not outside the order of the universal 
cause. The reason of this is that no effect results outside the order of 
a particular cause, except through some other impeding cause; which other 
cause must itself be reduced to the first universal cause; as indigestion 
may occur outside the order of the nutritive power by some such 
impediment as the coarseness of the food, which again is to be ascribed 
to some other cause, and so on till we come to the first universal cause. 
Therefore as God is the first universal cause, not of one genus only, but 
of all being in general, it is impossible for anything to occur outside 
the order of the Divine government; but from the very fact that from one 
point of view something seems to evade the order of Divine providence 
considered in regard to one particular cause, it must necessarily come 
back to that order as regards some other cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is nothing wholly evil in the world, for evil is ever 
founded on good, as shown above (<A Href="FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="FP048.html#FPQ48A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore something is 
said to be evil through its escaping from the order of some particular 
good. If it wholly escaped from the order of the Divine government, it 
would wholly cease to exist. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Things are said to be fortuitous as regards some particular 
cause from the order of which they escape. But as to the order of Divine 
providence, "nothing in the world happens by chance," as Augustine 
declares (Questions. 83, qu. 24).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certain effects are said to be contingent as compared to 
their proximate causes, which may fail in their effects; and not as 
though anything could happen entirely outside the order of Divine 
government. The very fact that something occurs outside the order of some 
proximate cause, is owing to some other cause, itself subject to the 
Divine government.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem possible that some resistance can be made to the 
order of the Divine government. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++3:8">Is. 3:8</a>): "Their 
tongue and their devices are against the Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a king does not justly punish those who do not rebel 
against his commands. Therefore if no one rebelled against God's 
commands, no one would be justly punished by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everything is subject to the order of the Divine 
government. But some things oppose others. Therefore some things rebel 
against the order of the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. iii): "There is nothing that 
can desire or is able to resist this sovereign good. It is this sovereign 
good therefore that ruleth all mightily and ordereth all sweetly," as is 
said (Wis. 8) of Divine wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider the order of Divine providence in two 
ways: in general, inasmuch as it proceeds from the governing cause of 
all; and in particular, inasmuch as it proceeds from some particular 
cause which executes the order of the Divine government.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Considered in the first way, nothing can resist the order of the Divine 
government. This can be proved in two ways: firstly from the fact that 
the order of the Divine government is wholly directed to good, and 
everything by its own operation and effort tends to good only, "for no 
one acts intending evil," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): secondly from 
the fact that, as we have said above (<A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="FP103.html#FPQ103A1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 2), every 
inclination of anything, whether natural or voluntary, is nothing but a 
kind of impression from the first mover; as the inclination of the arrow 
towards a fixed point is nothing but an impulse received from the archer. 
Wherefore every agent, whether natural or free, attains to its divinely 
appointed end, as though of its own accord. For this reason God is said 
"to order all things sweetly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some are said to think or speak, or act against God: not 
that they entirely resist the order of the Divine  government; for even 
the sinner intends the attainment of a certain good: but because they 
resist some particular good, which belongs to their nature or state. 
Therefore they are justly punished by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b>is clear from the above.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[103] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the fact that one thing opposes another, it follows 
that some one thing can resist the order of a particular cause; but not 
that order which depends on the universal cause of all things.<br>
