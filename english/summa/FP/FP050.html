<br>
OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ANGELS ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERED (FIVE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we consider the distinction of corporeal and spiritual creatures: 
firstly, the purely spiritual creature which in Holy Scripture is called 
angel; secondly, the creature wholly corporeal; thirdly, the composite 
creature, corporeal and spiritual, which is man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] Out. Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the angels, we consider first what belongs to their 
substance; secondly, what belongs to their intellect; thirdly, what 
belongs to their will; fourthly, what belongs to their creation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] Out. Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their substance we consider absolutely and in relation to corporeal 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] Out. Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning their substance absolutely considered, there are five points 
of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is any entirely spiritual creature, altogether 
incorporeal?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">(2)</a> Supposing that an angel is such, we ask whether it is composed of 
matter and form?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A3THEP1">(3)</a> We ask concerning their number.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of their difference from each other.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of their immortality or incorruptibility.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an angel is not entirely incorporeal. For what 
is incorporeal only as regards ourselves, and not in relation to God, is 
not absolutely incorporeal. But Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that 
"an angel is said to be incorporeal and immaterial as regards us; but 
compared to God it is corporeal and material. Therefore he is not simply 
incorporeal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is moved except a body, as the Philosopher says 
(Phys. vi, text 32). But Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that "an angel 
is an ever movable intellectual substance." Therefore an angel is a 
corporeal substance. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Spir. Sanct. i, 7): "Every creature is 
limited within its own nature." But to be limited belongs to bodies. 
Therefore, every creature is corporeal. Now angels are God's creatures, 
as appears from Ps. 148:2: "Praise ye" the Lord, "all His angels"; and, 
farther on (verse 4), "For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, 
and they were created." Therefore angels are corporeal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++103%3A4">Ps. 103:4</a>): "Who makes His angels spirits."
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There must be some incorporeal creatures. For what is 
principally intended by God in creatures is good, and this consists in 
assimilation to God Himself. And the perfect assimilation of an effect to 
a cause is accomplished when the effect imitates the cause according to 
that whereby the cause produces the effect; as heat makes heat. Now, God 
produces the creature by His intellect and will (<A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="FP014.html#FPQ14A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence the perfection of the universe requires that there should be 
intellectual creatures. Now intelligence cannot be the action of a body, 
nor of any corporeal faculty; for every body is limited to "here" and 
"now." Hence the perfection of the universe requires the existence of an 
incorporeal creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancients, however, not properly realizing the force of intelligence, 
and failing to make a proper distinction between sense and intellect, 
thought that nothing existed in the world but what could be apprehended 
by sense and imagination. And because bodies alone fall under 
imagination, they supposed that no being existed except bodies, as the 
Philosopher observes (Phys. iv, text 52,57). Thence came the error of the 
Sadducees, who said there was no spirit (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+23%3A8">Acts 23:8</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the very fact that intellect is above sense is a reasonable proof 
that there are some incorporeal things comprehensible by the intellect 
alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Incorporeal substances rank between God and corporeal 
creatures. Now the medium compared to one extreme appears to be the other 
extreme, as what is tepid compared to heat seems to be cold; and thus it 
is said that angels, compared to God, are material and corporeal, not, 
however, as if anything corporeal existed in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Movement is there taken in the sense in which it is applied 
to intelligence and will. Therefore an angel is called an ever mobile 
substance, because he is ever actually intelligent, and not as if he were 
sometimes actually and sometimes potentially, as we are. Hence it is 
clear that the objection rests on an equivocation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To be circumscribed by local limits belongs to bodies only; 
whereas to be circumscribed by essential limits  belongs to all 
creatures, both corporeal and spiritual. Hence Ambrose says (De Spir. 
Sanct. i, 7) that "although some things are not contained in corporeal 
place, still they are none the less circumscribed by their substance."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an angel is composed of matter and form?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an angel is composed of matter and form. For 
everything which is contained under any genus is composed of the genus, 
and of the difference which added to the genus makes the species. But the 
genus comes from the matter, and the difference from the form (Metaph. 
xiii, text 6). Therefore everything which is in a genus is composed of 
matter and form. But an angel is in the genus of substance. Therefore he 
is composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, wherever the properties of matter exist, there is 
matter. Now the properties of matter are to receive and to substand; 
whence Boethius says (De Trin.) that "a simple form cannot be a subject": 
and the above properties are found in the angel. Therefore an angel is 
composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, form is act. So what is form only is pure act. But an 
angel is not pure act, for this belongs to God alone. Therefore an angel 
is not form only, but has a form in matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, form is properly limited and perfected by matter. So the 
form which is not in matter is an infinite form. But the form of an angel 
is not infinite, for every creature is finite. Therefore the form of an 
angel is in matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): "The first creatures are 
understood to be as immaterial as they are incorporeal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some assert that the angels are composed of matter and 
form; which opinion Avicebron endeavored to establish in his book of the 
Fount of Life. For he supposes that whatever things are distinguished by 
the intellect are really distinct. Now as regards incorporeal substance, 
the intellect apprehends that which distinguishes it from corporeal 
substance, and that which it has in common with it. Hence he concludes 
that what distinguishes incorporeal from corporeal substance is a kind of 
form to it, and whatever is subject to this distinguishing form, as it 
were something common, is its matter. Therefore, he asserts the universal 
matter of spiritual and corporeal things is the same; so that it must be 
understood that the form of incorporeal substance is impressed in the 
matter of spiritual things, in the same way as the form of quantity is 
impressed in the matter of corporeal things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But one glance is enough to show that there cannot be one matter of 
spiritual and of corporeal things. For it is not possible  that a 
spiritual and a corporeal form should be received into the same part of 
matter, otherwise one and the same thing would be corporeal and 
spiritual. Hence it would follow that one part of matter receives the 
corporeal form, and another receives the spiritual form. Matter, however, 
is not divisible into parts except as regarded under quantity; and 
without quantity substance is indivisible, as Aristotle says (Phys. i, 
text 15). Therefore it would follow that the matter of spiritual things 
is subject to quantity; which cannot be. Therefore it is impossible that 
corporeal and spiritual things should have the same matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, further, impossible for an intellectual substance to have any 
kind of matter. For the operation belonging to anything is according to 
the mode of its substance. Now to understand is an altogether immaterial 
operation, as appears from its object, whence any act receives its 
species and nature. For a thing is understood according to its degree of 
immateriality; because forms that exist in matter are individual forms 
which the intellect cannot apprehend as such. Hence it must be that every 
individual substance is altogether immaterial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But things distinguished by the intellect are not necessarily 
distinguished in reality; because the intellect does not apprehend things 
according to their mode, but according to its own mode. Hence material 
things which are below our intellect exist in our intellect in a simpler 
mode than they exist in themselves. Angelic substances, on the other 
hand, are above our intellect; and hence our intellect cannot attain to 
apprehend them, as they are in themselves, but by its own mode, according 
as it apprehends composite things; and in this way also it apprehends God 
(<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is difference which constitutes the species. Now 
everything is constituted in a species according as it is determined to 
some special grade of being because "the species of things are like 
numbers," which differ by addition and subtraction of unity, as the 
Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text 10). But in material things there is 
one thing which determines to a special grade, and that is the form; and 
another thing which is determined, and this is the matter; and hence from 
the latter the "genus" is derived, and from the former the "difference." 
Whereas in immaterial things there is no separate determinator and thing 
determined; each thing by its own self holds a determinate grade in 
being; and therefore in them "genus" and "difference" are not derived 
from different things, but from one and the same. Nevertheless, this 
differs in our mode of conception; for, inasmuch as our intellect 
considers it as indeterminate, it derives the idea of their "genus"; and 
inasmuch as it considers it determinately, it derives the idea of their 
"difference."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This reason is given in the book on the Fount of Life, and 
it would be cogent, supposing that the receptive mode of the intellect 
and of matter were the same. But this is clearly false. For matter 
receives the form, that thereby it may be constituted in some species, 
either of air, or of fire, or of  something else. But the intellect does 
not receive the form in the same way; otherwise the opinion of Empedocles 
(De Anima i, 5, text 26) would be true, to the effect that we know earth 
by earth, and fire by fire. But the intelligible form is in the intellect 
according to the very nature of a form; for as such is it so known by the 
intellect. Hence such a way of receiving is not that of matter, but of an 
immaterial substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although there is no composition of matter and form in an 
angel, yet there is act and potentiality. And this can be made evident if 
we consider the nature of material things which contain a twofold 
composition. The first is that of form and matter, whereby the nature is 
constituted. Such a composite nature is not its own existence but 
existence is its act. Hence the nature itself is related to its own 
existence as potentiality to act. Therefore if there be no matter, and 
supposing that the form itself subsists without matter, there 
nevertheless still remains the relation of the form to its very 
existence, as of potentiality to act. And such a kind of composition is 
understood to be in the angels; and this is what some say, that an angel 
is composed of, "whereby he is," and "what is," or "existence," and "what 
is," as Boethius says. For "what is," is the form itself subsisting; and 
the existence itself is whereby the substance is; as the running is 
whereby the runner runs. But in God "existence" and "what is" are not 
different as was explained above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence God alone is pure 
act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Every creature is simply finite, inasmuch as its existence 
is not absolutely subsisting, but is limited to some nature to which it 
belongs. But there is nothing against a creature being considered 
relatively infinite. Material creatures are infinite on the part of 
matter, but finite in their form, which is limited by the matter which 
receives it. But immaterial created substances are finite in their being; 
whereas they are infinite in the sense that their forms are not received 
in anything else; as if we were to say, for example, that whiteness 
existing separate is infinite as regards the nature of whiteness, 
forasmuch as it is not contracted to any one subject; while its "being" 
is finite as determined to some one special nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence it is said (De Causis, prop. 16) that "intelligence is finite 
from above," as receiving its being from above itself, and is "infinite 
from below," as not received in any matter.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels exist in any great number?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels are not in great numbers. For 
number is a species of quantity, and follows the division of a continuous 
body. But this cannot be in the angels, since they are incorporeal, as 
was shown above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the angels cannot exist in any great 
number.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more a thing approaches to unity, so much  the less 
is it multiplied, as is evident in numbers. But among other created 
natures the angelic nature approaches nearest to God. Therefore since God 
is supremely one, it seems that there is the least possible number in the 
angelic nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the proper effect of the separate substances seems to be 
the movements of the heavenly bodies. But the movements of the heavenly 
bodies fall within some small determined number, which we can apprehend. 
Therefore the angels are not in greater number than the movements of the 
heavenly bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "all intelligible and 
intellectual substances subsist because of the rays of the divine 
goodness." But a ray is only multiplied according to the different things 
that receive it. Now it cannot be said that their matter is receptive of 
an intelligible ray, since intellectual substances are immaterial, as was 
shown above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it seems that the multiplication of 
intellectual substances can only be according to the requirements of the 
first bodies---that is, of the heavenly ones, so that in some way the 
shedding form of the aforesaid rays may be terminated in them; and hence 
the same conclusion is to be drawn as before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++7%3A10">Dan. 7:10</a>): "Thousands of thousands 
ministered to Him, and ten thousands times a hundred thousand stood 
before Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There have been various opinions with regard to the 
number of the separate substances. Plato contended that the separate 
substances are the species of sensible things; as if we were to maintain 
that human nature is a separate substance of itself: and according to 
this view it would have to be maintained that the number of the separate 
substances is the number of the species of sensible things. Aristotle, 
however, rejects this view (Metaph. i, text 31) because matter is of the 
very nature of the species of sensible things. Consequently the separate 
substances cannot be the exemplar species of these sensible things; but 
have their own fixed natures, which are higher than the natures of 
sensible things. Nevertheless Aristotle held (Metaph. xi, text 43) that 
those more perfect natures bear relation to these sensible things, as 
that of mover and end; and therefore he strove to find out the number of 
the separate substances according to the number of the first movements.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But since this appears to militate against the teachings of Sacred 
Scripture, Rabbi Moses the Jew, wishing to bring both into harmony, held 
that the angels, in so far as they are styled immaterial substances, are 
multiplied according to the number of heavenly movements or bodies, as 
Aristotle held (Metaph. xi, text 43); while he contended that in the 
Scriptures even men bearing a divine message are styled angels; and 
again, even the powers of natural things, which manifest God's almighty 
power. It is, however, quite foreign to the custom of the Scriptures for 
the powers of irrational things to be designated as angels. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it must be said that the angels, even inasmuch as they are 
immaterial substances, exist in exceeding great number, far beyond all 
material multitude. This is what Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xiv): "There 
are many blessed armies of the heavenly intelligences, surpassing the 
weak and limited reckoning of our material numbers." The reason whereof 
is this, because, since it is the perfection of the universe that God 
chiefly intends in the creation of things, the more perfect some things 
are, in so much greater an excess are they created by God. Now, as in 
bodies such excess is observed in regard to their magnitude, so in things 
incorporeal is it observed in regard to their multitude. We see, in fact, 
that incorruptible bodies, exceed corruptible bodies almost incomparably 
in magnitude; for the entire sphere of things active and passive is 
something very small in comparison with the heavenly bodies. Hence it is 
reasonable to conclude that the immaterial substances as it were 
incomparably exceed material substances as to multitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the angels number is not that of discrete quantity, 
brought about by division of what is continuous, but that which is caused 
by distinction of forms; according as multitude is reckoned among the 
transcendentals, as was said above (<A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FP030.html#FPQ30A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP011.html#FPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the angelic nature being the nighest unto God, it must 
needs have least of multitude in its composition, but not so as to be

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This is Aristotle's argument (Metaph. xii, text 44), and it 
would conclude necessarily if the separate substances were made for 
corporeal substances. For thus the immaterial substances would exist to 
no purpose, unless some movement from them were to appear in corporeal 
things. But it is not true that the immaterial substances exist on 
account of the corporeal, because the end is nobler than the means to the 
end. Hence Aristotle says (Metaph. xii, text 44) that this is not a 
necessary argument, but a probable one. He was forced to make use of this 
argument, since only through sensible things can we come to know 
intelligible ones.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument comes from the opinion of such as hold that 
matter is the cause of the distinction of things; but this was refuted 
above (<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Accordingly, the multiplication of the angels is not 
to be taken according to matter, nor according to bodies, but according 
to the divine wisdom devising the various orders of immaterial substances.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels do not differ in species. For since 
the "difference" is nobler than the 'genus,' all things which agree in 
what is noblest in them, agree likewise in their  ultimate constitutive 
difference; and so they are the same according to species. But all angels 
agree in what is noblest in them---that is to say, in intellectuality. 
Therefore all the angels are of one species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, more and less do not change a species. But the angels 
seem to differ only from one another according to more and less---namely, 
as one is simpler than another, and of keener intellect. Therefore the 
angels do not differ specifically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, soul and angel are contra-distinguished mutually from 
each other. But all souls are of the one species. So therefore are the 
angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the more perfect a thing is in nature, the more ought it 
to be multiplied. But this would not be so if there were but one 
individual under one species. Therefore there are many angels of one 
species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In things of one species there is no such thing as 
"first" and "second" [prius et posterius], as the Philosopher says 
(Metaph. iii, text 2). But in the angels even of the one order there are 
first, middle, and last, as Dionysius says (Hier. Ang. x). Therefore the 
angels are not of the same species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that all spiritual substances, even souls, 
are of the one species. Others, again, that all the angels are of the one 
species, but not souls; while others allege that all the angels of one 
hierarchy, or even of one order, are of the one species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is impossible. For such things as agree in species but differ 
in number, agree in form, but are distinguished materially. If, 
therefore, the angels be not composed of matter and form, as was said 
above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that it is impossible for two angels to be of 
one species; just as it would be impossible for there to be several 
whitenesses apart, or several humanities, since whitenesses are not 
several, except in so far as they are in several substances. And if the 
angels had matter, not even then could there be several angels of one 
species. For it would be necessary for matter to be the principle of 
distinction of one from the other, not, indeed, according to the division 
of quantity, since they are incorporeal, but according to the diversity 
of their powers; and such diversity of matter causes diversity not merely 
of species, but of genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Difference" is nobler than "genus," as the determined is 
more noble than the undetermined, and the proper than the common, but not 
as one nature is nobler than another; otherwise it would be necessary 
that all irrational animals be of the same species; or that there should 
be in them some form which is higher than the sensible soul. Therefore 
irrational animals differ in species according to the various determined 
degrees of sensitive nature; and in like manner all the angels differ in 
species  according to the diverse degrees of intellectual nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> More and less change the species, not according as they are 
caused by the intensity or remissness of one form, but according as they 
are caused by forms of diverse degrees; for instance, if we say that fire 
is more perfect than air: and in this way the angels are diversified 
according to more or less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The good of the species preponderates over the good of the 
individual. Hence it is much better for the species to be multiplied in 
the angels than for individuals to be multiplied in the one species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Numerical multiplication, since it can be drawn out 
infinitely, is not intended by the agent, but only specific 
multiplication, as was said above (<A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="FP047.html#FPQ47A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence the perfection of 
the angelic nature calls for the multiplying of species, but not for the 
multiplying of individuals in one species.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels are incorruptible?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels are not incorruptible; for 
Damascene, speaking of the angel, says (De Fide Orth. ii, 3) that he is 
"an intellectual substance, partaking of immortality by favor, and not by 
nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Plato says in the Timaeus: "O gods of gods, whose maker 
and father am I: You are indeed my works, dissoluble by nature, yet 
indissoluble because I so will it." But gods such as these can only be 
understood to be the angels. Therefore the angels are corruptible by 
their nature<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xvi), "all things would 
tend towards nothing, unless the hand of the Almighty preserved them." 
But what can be brought to nothing is corruptible. Therefore, since the 
angels were made by God, it would appear that they are corruptible of 
their own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that the intellectual 
substances "have unfailing life, being free from all corruption, death, 
matter, and generation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It must necessarily be maintained that the angels are 
incorruptible of their own nature. The reason for this is, that nothing 
is corrupted except by its form being separated from the matter. Hence, 
since an angel is a subsisting form, as is clear from what was said above 
(<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it is impossible for its substance to be corruptible. For what 
belongs to anything considered in itself can never be separated from it; 
but what belongs to a thing, considered in relation to something else, 
can be separated, when that something else is taken away, in view of 
which it belonged to it. Roundness can never be taken from the circle, 
because it belongs to it of itself; but a bronze circle can  lose 
roundness, if the bronze be deprived of its circular shape. Now to be 
belongs to a form considered in itself; for everything is an actual being 
according to its form: whereas matter is an actual being by the form. 
Consequently a subject composed of matter and form ceases to be actually 
when the form is separated from the matter. But if the form subsists in 
its own being, as happens in the angels, as was said above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it 
cannot lose its being. Therefore, the angel's immateriality is the cause 
why it is incorruptible by its own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A token of this incorruptibility can be gathered from its intellectual 
operation; for since everything acts according as it is actual, the 
operation of a thing indicates its mode of being. Now the species and 
nature of the operation is understood from the object. But an 
intelligible object, being above time, is everlasting. Hence every 
intellectual substance is incorruptible of its own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene is dealing with perfect immortality, which 
includes complete immutability; since "every change is a kind of death," 
as Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii). The angels obtain perfect 
immutability only by favor, as will appear later (<A Href="FP062.html#FPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the expression 'gods' Plato understands the heavenly 
bodies, which he supposed to be made up of elements, and therefore 
dissoluble of their own nature; yet they are for ever preserved in 
existence by the Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was observed above (<A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FP044.html#FPQ44A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) there is a kind of 
necessary thing which has a cause of its necessity. Hence it is not 
repugnant to a necessary or incorruptible being to depend for its 
existence on another as its cause. Therefore, when it is said that all 
things, even the angels, would lapse into nothing, unless preserved by 
God, it is not to be gathered therefrom that there is any principle of 
corruption in the angels; but that the nature of the angels is dependent 
upon God as its cause. For a thing is said to be corruptible not merely 
because God can reduce it to non-existence, by withdrawing His act of 
preservation; but also because it has some principle of corruption within 
itself, or some contrariety, or at least the potentiality of matter.<br>
