    OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SEPARATED SOUL (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the knowledge of the separated soul. Under this head
    there are eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the soul separated from
    the body can understand?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it understands separate
    substances?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it understands all natural
    things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it understands individuals
    and singulars?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the habits of knowledge
    acquired in this life remain?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the soul can use the habit
    of knowledge here acquired?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether local distance impedes the
    separated soul's knowledge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether souls separated from the
    body know what happens here?

    Whether the separated soul can understand anything?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul separated from the
    body can understand nothing at all. For the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 4)
    that "the understanding is corrupted together with its interior principle."
    But by death all human interior principles are corrupted. Therefore also the
    intellect itself is corrupted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the human soul is hindered from
    understanding when the senses are tied, and by a distracted imagination, as
    explained above (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a>,8). But death destroys the
    senses and imagination, as we have shown above (<a
      href="FP077.html#FPQ77OUTP1"
      >Question [77]</a
    >, <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore after death
    the soul understands nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the separated soul can understand,
    this must be by means of some species. But it does not understand by means
    of innate species, because it has none such; being at first "like a tablet
    on which nothing is written": nor does it understand by species abstracted
    from things, for it does not then possess organs of sense and imagination
    which are necessary for the abstraction of species: nor does it understand
    by means of species, formerly abstracted and retained in the soul; for if
    that were so, a child's soul would have no means of understanding at all:
    nor does it understand by means of intelligible species divinely infused,
    for such knowledge would not be natural, such as we treat of now, but the
    effect of grace. Therefore the soul apart from the body understands
    nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Anima i, 1), "If the
    soul had no proper operation, it could not be separated from the body." But
    the soul is separated from the body; therefore it has a proper operation and
    above all, that which consists in intelligence. Therefore the soul can
    understand when it is apart from the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The difficulty in solving this question arises
    from the fact that the soul united to the body can understand only by
    turning to the phantasms, as experience shows. Did this not proceed from the
    soul's very nature, but accidentally through its being bound up with the
    body, as the Platonists said, the difficulty would vanish; for in that case
    when the body was once removed, the soul would at once return to its own
    nature, and would understand intelligible things simply, without turning to
    the phantasms, as is exemplified in the case of other separate substances.
    In that case, however, the union of soul and body would not be for the
    soul's good, for evidently it would understand worse in the body than out of
    it; but for the good of the body, which would be unreasonable, since matter
    exists on account of the form, and not the form for the sake of matter. But
    if we admit that the nature of the soul requires it to understand by turning
    to the phantasms, it will seem, since death does not change its nature, that
    it can then naturally understand nothing; as the phantasms are wanting to
    which it may turn.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this difficulty we must consider that as nothing acts except so far
    as it is actual, the mode of action in every agent follows from its mode of
    existence. Now the soul has one mode of being when in the body, and another
    when apart from it, its nature remaining always the same; but this does not
    mean that its union with the body is an accidental thing, for, on the
    contrary, such union belongs to its very nature, just as the nature of a
    light object is not changed, when it is in its proper place, which is
    natural to it, and outside its proper place, which is beside its nature. The
    soul, therefore, when united to the body, consistently with that mode of
    existence, has a mode of understanding, by turning to corporeal phantasms,
    which are in corporeal organs; but when it is separated from the body, it
    has a mode of understanding, by turning to simply intelligible objects, as
    is proper to other separate substances. Hence it is as natural for the soul
    to understand by turning to the phantasms as it is for it to be joined to
    the body; but to be separated from the body is not in accordance with its
    nature, and likewise to understand without turning to the phantasms is not
    natural to it; and hence it is united to the body in order that it may have
    an existence and an operation suitable to its nature. But here again a
    difficulty arises. For since nature is always ordered to what is best, and
    since it is better to understand by turning to simply intelligible objects
    than by turning to the phantasms; God should have ordered the soul's nature
    so that the nobler way of understanding would have been natural to it, and
    it would not have needed the body for that purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to resolve this difficulty we must consider that while it is true
    that it is nobler in itself to understand by turning to something higher
    than to understand by turning to phantasms, nevertheless such a mode of
    understanding was not so perfect as regards what was possible to the soul.
    This will appear if we consider that every intellectual substance possesses
    intellective power by the influence of the Divine light, which is one and
    simple in its first principle, and the farther off intellectual creatures
    are from the first principle so much the more is the light divided and
    diversified, as is the case with lines radiating from the centre of a
    circle. Hence it is that God by His one Essence understands all things;
    while the superior intellectual substances understand by means of a number
    of species, which nevertheless are fewer and more universal and bestow a
    deeper comprehension of things, because of the efficaciousness of the
    intellectual power of such natures: whereas the inferior intellectual
    natures possess a greater number of species, which are less universal, and
    bestow a lower degree of comprehension, in proportion as they recede from
    the intellectual power of the higher natures. If, therefore, the inferior
    substances received species in the same degree of universality as the
    superior substances, since they are not so strong in understanding, the
    knowledge which they would derive through them would be imperfect, and of a
    general and confused nature. We can see this to a certain extent in man, for
    those who are of weaker intellect fail to acquire perfect knowledge through
    the universal conceptions of those who have a better understanding, unless
    things are explained to them singly and in detail. Now it is clear that in
    the natural order human souls hold the lowest place among intellectual
    substances. But the perfection of the universe required various grades of
    being. If, therefore, God had willed souls to understand in the same way as
    separate substances, it would follow that human knowledge, so far from being
    perfect, would be confused and general. Therefore to make it possible for
    human souls to possess perfect and proper knowledge, they were so made that
    their nature required them to be joined to bodies, and thus to receive the
    proper and adequate knowledge of sensible things from the sensible things
    themselves; thus we see in the case of uneducated men that they have to be
    taught by sensible examples.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is clear then that it was for the soul's good that it was united to a
    body, and that it understands by turning to the phantasms. Nevertheless it
    is possible for it to exist apart from the body, and also to understand in
    another way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher's words carefully
    examined will show that he said this on the previous supposition that
    understanding is a movement of body and soul as united, just as sensation
    is, for he had not as yet explained the difference between intellect and
    sense. We may also say that he is referring to the way of understanding by
    turning to phantasms. This is also the meaning of the second objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The separated soul does not understand
    by way of innate species, nor by species abstracted then, nor only by
    species retained, and this the objection proves; but the soul in that state
    understands by means of participated species arising from the influence of
    the Divine light, shared by the soul as by other separate substances; though
    in a lesser degree. Hence as soon as it ceases to act by turning to
    corporeal (phantasms), the soul turns at once to the superior things; nor is
    this way of knowledge unnatural, for God is the author of the influx of both
    of the light of grace and of the light of nature.<br />

    Whether the separated soul understands separate substances?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the separated soul does not
    understand separate substances. For the soul is more perfect when joined to
    the body than when existing apart from it, being an essential part of human
    nature; and every part of a whole is more perfect when it exists in that
    whole. But the soul in the body does not understand separate substances as
    shown above (<a href="FP088.html#FPQ88OUTP1">Question [88]</a>,
    <a href="FP088.html#FPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore much less is
    it able to do so when apart from the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is known is known either by its
    presence or by its species. But separate substances cannot be known to the
    soul by their presence, for God alone can enter into the soul; nor by means
    of species abstracted by the soul from an angel, for an angel is more simple
    than a soul. Therefore the separated soul cannot at all understand separate
    substances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some philosophers said that the ultimate
    happiness of man consists in the knowledge of separate substances. If,
    therefore, the separated soul can understand separate substances, its
    happiness would be secured by its separation alone; which cannot be
    reasonably be said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Souls apart from the body know other
    separated souls; as we see in the case of the rich man in hell, who saw
    Lazarus and Abraham (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A23"
      >Lk. 16:23</a
    >). Therefore separated souls see the devils and the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 3), "our mind
    acquires the knowledge of incorporeal things by itself"---i.e. by knowing
    itself (<a href="FP088.html#FPQ88OUTP1">Question [88]</a>,
    <a href="FP088.html#FPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). Therefore from the
    knowledge which the separated soul has of itself, we can judge how it knows
    other separate things. Now it was said above (<a
      href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), that as long as it is united to the body the soul understands by turning
    to phantasms, and therefore it does not understand itself save through
    becoming actually intelligent by means of ideas abstracted from phantasms;
    for thus it understands itself through its own act, as shown above (<a
      href="FP087.html#FPQ87OUTP1"
      >Question [87]</a
    >, <a href="FP087.html#FPQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). When, however, it is
    separated from the body, it understands no longer by turning to phantasms,
    but by turning to simply intelligible objects; hence in that state it
    understands itself through itself. Now, every separate substance
    "understands what is above itself and what is below itself, according to the
    mode of its substance" (De Causis viii): for a thing is understood according
    as it is in the one who understands; while one thing is in another according
    to the nature of that in which it is. And the mode of existence of a
    separated soul is inferior to that of an angel, but is the same as that of
    other separated souls. Therefore the soul apart from the body has perfect
    knowledge of other separated souls, but it has an imperfect and defective
    knowledge of the angels so far as its natural knowledge is concerned. But
    the knowledge of glory is otherwise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The separated soul is, indeed, less
    perfect considering its nature in which it communicates with the nature of
    the body: but it has a greater freedom of intelligence, since the weight and
    care of the body is a clog upon the clearness of its intelligence in the
    present life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The separated soul understands the
    angels by means of divinely impressed ideas; which, however, fail to give
    perfect knowledge of them, forasmuch as the nature of the soul is inferior
    to that of an angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man's ultimate happiness consists not in
    the knowledge of any separate substances; but in the knowledge of God, Who
    is seen only by grace. The knowledge of other separate substances if
    perfectly understood gives great happiness---not final and ultimate
    happiness. But the separated soul does not understand them perfectly, as was
    shown above in this article.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the separated soul knows all natural things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the separated soul knows all
    natural things. For the types of all natural things exist in separate
    substances. Therefore, as separated souls know separate substances, they
    also know all natural things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever understands the greater
    intelligible, will be able much more to understand the lesser intelligible.
    But the separated soul understands immaterial substances, which are in the
    highest degree of intelligibility. Therefore much more can it understand all
    natural things which are in a lower degree of intelligibility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The devils have greater natural knowledge
    than the separated soul; yet they do not know all natural things, but have
    to learn many things by long experience, as Isidore says (De Summo Bono i).
    Therefore neither can the separated soul know all natural things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FP089.html#FPQ89A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the separated soul, like the angels, understands by means of species,
    received from the influence of the Divine light. Nevertheless, as the soul
    by nature is inferior to an angel, to whom this kind of knowledge is
    natural, the soul apart from the body through such species does not receive
    perfect knowledge, but only a general and confused kind of knowledge.
    Separated souls, therefore, have the same relation through such species to
    imperfect and confused knowledge of natural things as the angels have to the
    perfect knowledge thereof. Now angels through such species know all natural
    things perfectly; because all that God has produced in the respective
    natures of natural things has been produced by Him in the angelic
    intelligence, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). Hence it follows that
    separated souls know all natural things not with a certain and proper
    knowledge, but in a general and confused manner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even an angel does not understand all
    natural things through his substance, but through certain species, as stated
    above (<a href="FP087.html#FPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>,
    <a href="FP087.html#FPQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). So it does not follow
    that the soul knows all natural things because it knows separate substances
    after a fashion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the soul separated from the body does
    not perfectly understand separate substances, so neither does it know all
    natural things perfectly; but it knows them confusedly, as above explained
    in this article.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Isidore speaks of the knowledge of the
    future which neither angels, nor demons, nor separated souls, know except so
    far as future things pre-exist in their causes or are known by Divine
    revelation. But we are here treating of the knowledge of natural things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Knowledge acquired here by study is
    proper and perfect; the knowledge of which we speak is confused. Hence it
    does not follow that to study in order to learn is useless.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the separated soul knows singulars?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the separated soul does not
    know singulars. For no cognitive power besides the intellect remains in the
    separated soul, as is clear from what has been said above (<a
      href="FP077.html#FPQ77OUTP1"
      >Question [77]</a
    >, <a href="FP077.html#FPQ77A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But the intellect
    cannot know singulars, as we have shown (<a href="FP086.html#FPQ86OUTP1"
      >Question [86]</a
    >, <a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the
    separated soul cannot know singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the knowledge of the singular is more
    determinate than knowledge of the universal. But the separated soul has no
    determinate knowledge of the species of natural things, therefore much less
    can it know singulars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it knew the singulars, yet not by
    sense, for the same reason it would know all singulars. But it does not know
    all singulars. Therefore it knows none.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The rich man in hell said: "I have five
    brethren" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A28"
      >Lk. 16:28</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Separated souls know some singulars, but not
    all, not even all present singulars. To understand this, we must consider
    that there is a twofold way of knowing things, one by means of abstraction
    from phantasms, and in this way singulars cannot be directly known by the
    intellect, but only indirectly, as stated above (<a
      href="FP086.html#FPQ86OUTP1"
      >Question [86]</a
    >, <a href="FP086.html#FPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). The other way of
    understanding is by the infusion of species by God, and in that way it is
    possible for the intellect to know singulars. For as God knows all things,
    universal and singular, by His Essence, as the cause of universal and
    individual principles (<a href="FP014.html#FPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>,
    <a href="FP014.html#FPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), so likewise separate
    substances can know singulars by species which are a kind of participated
    similitude of the Divine Essence. There is a difference, however, between
    angels and separated souls in the fact that through these species the angels
    have a perfect and proper knowledge of things; whereas separated have only a
    confused knowledge. Hence the angels, by reason of their perfect intellect,
    through these species, know not only the specific natures of things, but
    also the singulars contained in those species; whereas separated souls by
    these species know only those singulars to which they are determined by
    former knowledge in this life, or by some affection, or by natural aptitude,
    or by the disposition of the Divine order; because whatever is received into
    anything is conditioned according to the mode of the recipient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellect does not know the singular
    by way of abstraction; neither does the separated soul know it thus; but as
    explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The knowledge of the separated soul is
    confined to those species or individuals to which the soul has some kind of
    determinate relation, as we have said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The separated soul has not the same
    relation to all singulars, but one relation to some, and another to others.
    Therefore there is not the same reason why it should know all singulars.<br />

    Whether the habit of knowledge here acquired remains in the separated
    soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the habit of knowledge
    acquired in this life does not remain in the soul separated from the body:
    for the Apostle says: "Knowledge shall be destroyed" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 13:8</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some in this world who are less good
    enjoy knowledge denied to others who are better. If, therefore, the habit of
    knowledge remained in the soul after death, it would follow that some who
    are less good would, even in the future life, excel some who are better;
    which seems unreasonable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, separated souls will possess knowledge
    by influence of the Divine light. Supposing, therefore, that knowledge here
    acquired remained in the separated soul, it would follow that two forms of
    the same species would co-exist in the same subject which cannot be.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Praedic. vi, 4,5),
    that "a habit is a quality hard to remove: yet sometimes knowledge is
    destroyed by sickness or the like." But in this life there is no change so
    thorough as death. Therefore it seems that the habit of knowledge is
    destroyed by death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ep. liii, ad Paulinum), "Let us
    learn on earth that kind of knowledge which will remain with us in
    heaven."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some say that the habit of knowledge resides
    not in the intellect itself, but in the sensitive powers, namely, the
    imaginative, cogitative, and memorative, and that the intelligible species
    are not kept in the passive intellect. If this were true, it would follow
    that when the body is destroyed by death, knowledge here acquired would also
    be entirely destroyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But, since knowledge resides in the intellect, which is "the abode of
    species," as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 4), the habit of knowledge
    here acquired must be partly in the aforesaid sensitive powers and partly in
    the intellect. This can be seen by considering the very actions from which
    knowledge arises. For "habits are like the actions whereby they are
    acquired" (Ethic. ii, 1). Now the actions of the intellect, by which
    knowledge is here acquired, are performed by the mind turning to the
    phantasms in the aforesaid sensitive powers. Hence through such acts the
    passive intellect acquires a certain facility in considering the species
    received: and the aforesaid sensitive powers acquire a certain aptitude in
    seconding the action of the intellect when it turns to them to consider the
    intelligible object. But as the intellectual act resides chiefly and
    formally in the intellect itself, whilst it resides materially and
    dispositively in the inferior powers, the same distinction is to be applied
    to habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Knowledge, therefore, acquired in the present life does not remain in the
    separated soul, as regards what belongs to the sensitive powers; but as
    regards what belongs to the intellect itself, it must remain; because, as
    the Philosopher says (De Long. et Brev. Vitae ii), a form may be corrupted
    in two ways; first, directly, when corrupted by its contrary, as heat, by
    cold; and secondly, indirectly, when its subject is corrupted. Now it is
    evident that human knowledge is not corrupted through corruption of the
    subject, for the intellect is an incorruptible faculty, as above stated (<a
      href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Neither can the
    intelligible species in the passive intellect be corrupted by their
    contrary; for there is no contrary to intelligible "intentions," above all
    as regards simple intelligence of "what a thing is." But contrariety may
    exist in the intellect as regards mental composition and division, or also
    reasoning; so far as what is false in statement or argument is contrary to
    truth. And thus knowledge may be corrupted by its contrary when a false
    argument seduces anyone from the knowledge of truth. For this reason the
    Philosopher in the above work mentions two ways in which knowledge is
    corrupted directly: namely, "forgetfulness" on the part of the memorative
    power, and "deception" on the part of a false argument. But these have no
    place in the separated soul. Therefore we must conclude that the habit of
    knowledge, so far as it is in the intellect, remains in the separated
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle is not speaking of knowledge
    as a habit, but as to the act of knowing; and hence he says, in proof of the
    assertion quoted, "Now, I know in part."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As a less good man may exceed a better
    man in bodily stature, so the same kind of man may have a habit of knowledge
    in the future life which a better man may not have. Such knowledge, however,
    cannot be compared with the other prerogatives enjoyed by the better man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These two kinds of knowledge are not of
    the same species, so there is no impossibility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This objection considers the corruption
    of knowledge on the part of the sensitive powers.<br />

    Whether the act of knowledge acquired here remains in the separated soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the act of knowledge here
    acquired does not remain in the separated soul. For the Philosopher says (De
    Anima i, 4), that when the body is corrupted, "the soul neither remembers
    nor loves." But to consider what is previously known is an act of memory.
    Therefore the separated soul cannot retain an act of knowledge here
    acquired.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, intelligible species cannot have greater
    power in the separated soul than they have in the soul united to the body.
    But in this life we cannot understand by intelligible species without
    turning to phantasms, as shown above (<a href="FP084.html#FPQ84OUTP1"
      >Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FP084.html#FPQ84A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore the
    separated soul cannot do so, and thus it cannot understand at all by
    intelligible species acquired in this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1),
    that "habits produce acts similar to those whereby they are acquired." But
    the habit of knowledge is acquired here by acts of the intellect turning to
    phantasms: therefore it cannot produce any other acts. These acts, however,
    are not adapted to the separated soul. Therefore the soul in the state of
    separation cannot produce any act of knowledge acquired in this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It was said to Dives in hell (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A25"
      >Lk. 16:25</a
    >): "Remember thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Action offers two things for our
    consideration---its species and its mode. Its species comes from the object,
    whereto the faculty of knowledge is directed by the (intelligible) species,
    which is the object's similitude; whereas the mode is gathered from the
    power of the agent. Thus that a person see a stone is due to the species of
    the stone in his eye; but that he see it clearly, is due to the eye's visual
    power. Therefore as the intelligible species remain in the separated soul,
    as stated above (<a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), and
    since the state of the separated soul is not the same as it is in this life,
    it follows that through the intelligible species acquired in this life the
    soul apart from the body can understand what it understood formerly, but in
    a different way; not by turning to phantasms, but by a mode suited to a soul
    existing apart from the body. Thus the act of knowledge here acquired
    remains in the separated soul, but in a different way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher speaks of remembrance,
    according as memory belongs to the sensitive part, but not as belonging in a
    way to the intellect, as explained above (<a href="FP079.html#FPQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="FP079.html#FPQ79A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The different mode of intelligence is
    produced by the different state of the intelligent soul; not by diversity of
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The acts which produce a habit are like
    the acts caused by that habit, in species, but not in mode. For example, to
    do just things, but not justly, that is, pleasurably, causes the habit of
    political justice, whereby we act pleasurably. (Cf. Aristotle, Ethic. v, 8:
    Magn. Moral. i, 34).<br />

    Whether local distance impedes the knowledge in the separated soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that local distance impedes the
    separated soul's knowledge. For Augustine says (De Cura pro Mort. xiii),
    that "the souls of the dead are where they cannot know what is done here."
    But they know what is done among themselves. Therefore local distance
    impedes the knowledge in the separated soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Divin. Daemon. iii),
    that "the demon's rapidity of movement enables them to tell things unknown
    to us." But agility of movement would be useless in that respect unless
    their knowledge was impeded by local distance; which, therefore, is a much
    greater hindrance to the knowledge of the separated soul, whose nature is
    inferior to the demon's.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as there is distance of place, so is
    there distance of time. But distance of time impedes knowledge in the
    separated soul, for the soul is ignorant of the future. Therefore it seems
    that distance of place also impedes its knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A23"
      >Lk. 16:23</a
    >), that Dives, "lifting up his eyes when he was in torment, saw Abraham
    afar off." Therefore local distance does not impede knowledge in the
    separated soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that the separated soul knows
    the singular by abstraction from the sensible. If that were so, it might be
    that local distance would impede its knowledge; for either the sensible
    would need to act upon the soul, or the soul upon the sensible, and in
    either case a determinate distance would be necessary. This is, however,
    impossible because abstraction of the species from the sensible is done
    through the senses and other sensible faculties which do not remain actually
    in the soul apart from the body. But the soul when separated understands
    singulars by species derived from the Divine light, which is indifferent to
    what is near or distant. Hence knowledge in the separated soul is not
    hindered by local distance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine says that the souls of the
    departed cannot see what is done here, not because they are 'there,' as if
    impeded by local distance; but for some other cause, as we shall explain (<a
      href="FP089.html#FPQ89A8THEP1"
      >Article [8]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine speaks there in accordance
    with the opinion that demons have bodies naturally united to them, and so
    have sensitive powers, which require local distance. In the same book he
    expressly sets down this opinion, though apparently rather by way of
    narration than of assertion, as we may gather from De Civ. Dei xxi, 10.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The future, which is distant in time,
    does not actually exist, and therefore is not knowable in itself, because so
    far as a thing falls short of being, so far does it fall short of being
    knowable. But what is locally distant exists actually, and is knowable in
    itself. Hence we cannot argue from distance of time to distance of place.<br />

    Whether separated souls know that takes place on earth?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that separated souls know what
    takes place on earth; for otherwise they would have no care for it, as they
    have, according to what Dives said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A27,28"
      >Lk. 16:27,28</a
    >), "I have five brethren... he may testify unto them, lest they also come
    into the place of torments." Therefore separated souls know what passes on
    earth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the dead often appear to the living,
    asleep or awake, and tell them of what takes place there; as Samuel appeared
    to Saul (1 Kgs. 28:11). But this could not be unless they knew what takes
    place here. Therefore they know what takes place on earth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, separated souls know what happens among
    themselves. If, therefore, they do not know what takes place among us, it
    must be by reason of local distance; which has been shown to be false (<a
      href="FP089.html#FPQ89A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+14%3A21"
      >Job 14:21</a
    >): "He will not understand whether his children come to honor or
    dishonor."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By natural knowledge, of which we are treating
    now, the souls of the dead do not know what passes on earth. This follows
    from what has been laid down (<a href="FP089.html#FPQ89A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), since the separated soul has knowledge of singulars, by being in a way
    determined to them, either by some vestige of previous knowledge or
    affection, or by the Divine order. Now the souls departed are in a state of
    separation from the living, both by Divine order and by their mode of
    existence, whilst they are joined to the world of incorporeal spiritual
    substances; and hence they are ignorant of what goes on among us. Whereof
    Gregory gives the reason thus: "The dead do not know how the living act, for
    the life of the spirit is far from the life of the flesh; and so, as
    corporeal things differ from incorporeal in genus, so they are distinct in
    knowledge" (Moral. xii). Augustine seems to say the same (De Cura pro Mort.
    xiii), when he asserts that, "the souls of the dead have no concern in the
    affairs of the living."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Gregory and Augustine, however, seem to be divided in opinion as regards the
    souls of the blessed in heaven, for Gregory continues the passage above
    quoted: "The case of the holy souls is different, for since they see the
    light of Almighty God, we cannot believe that external things are unknown to
    them." But Augustine (De Cura pro Mort. xiii) expressly says: "The dead,
    even the saints do not know what is done by the living or by their own
    children," as a gloss quotes on the text, "Abraham hath not known us" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++63%3A16"
      >Is. 63:16</a
    >). He confirms this opinion by saying that he was not visited, nor consoled
    in sorrow by his mother, as when she was alive; and he could not think it
    possible that she was less kind when in a happier state; and again by the
    fact that the Lord promised to king Josias that he should die, lest he
    should see his people's afflictions (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++22%3A20"
      >4 Kgs. 22:20</a
    >). Yet Augustine says this in doubt; and premises, "Let every one take, as
    he pleases, what I say." Gregory, on the other hand, is positive, since he
    says, "We cannot believe." His opinion, indeed, seems to be the more
    probable one---that the souls of the blessed who see God do know all that
    passes here. For they are equal to the angels, of whom Augustine says that
    they know what happens among those living on earth. But as the souls of the
    blessed are most perfectly united to Divine justice, they do not suffer from
    sorrow, nor do they interfere in mundane affairs, except in accordance with
    Divine justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The souls of the departed may care for
    the living, even if ignorant of their state; just as we care for the dead by
    pouring forth prayer on their behalf, though we are ignorant of their state.
    Moreover, the affairs of the living can be made known to them not
    immediately, but the souls who pass hence thither, or by angels and demons,
    or even by "the revelation of the Holy Ghost," as Augustine says in the same
    book.

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That the dead appear to the living in
    any way whatever is either by the special dispensation of God; in order that
    the souls of the dead may interfere in affairs of the living---and this is
    to be accounted as miraculous. Or else such apparitions occur through the
    instrumentality of bad or good angels, without the knowledge of the
    departed; as may likewise happen when the living appear, without their own
    knowledge, to others living, as Augustine says in the same book. And so it
    may be said of Samuel that he appeared through Divine revelation; according
    to Ecclus. 46:23, "he slept, and told the king the end of his life." Or,
    again, this apparition was procured by the demons; unless, indeed, the
    authority of Ecclesiasticus be set aside through not being received by the
    Jews as canonical Scripture.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This kind of ignorance does not proceed
    from the obstacle of local distance, but from the cause mentioned above.<br />
