    OF THE DURATION OF THE CEREMONIAL PRECEPTS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the duration of the ceremonial precepts: under which
    head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS103.html#FSQ103A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the ceremonial precepts
    were in existence before the Law?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS103.html#FSQ103A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether at the time of the Law
    the ceremonies of the Old Law had any power of justification?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS103.html#FSQ103A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they ceased at the coming
    of Christ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS103.html#FSQ103A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is a mortal sin to
    observe them after the coming of Christ?<br />

    Whether the ceremonies of the Law were in existence before the Law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the ceremonies of the Law were
    in existence before the Law. For sacrifices and holocausts were ceremonies
    of the Old Law, as stated above (<a href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="FS101.html#FSQ101A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But sacrifices and
    holocausts preceded the Law: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++4%3A3,4"
      >Gn. 4:3,4</a
    >) that "Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord," and
    that "Abel offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat." Noe
    also "offered holocausts" to the Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++18%3A20"
      >Gn. 18:20</a
    >), and Abraham did in like manner (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++22%3A13"
      >Gn. 22:13</a
    >). Therefore the ceremonies of the Old Law preceded the Law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the erecting and consecrating of the
    altar were part of the ceremonies relating to holy things. But these
    preceded the Law. For we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++13%3A18"
      >Gn. 13:18</a
    >) that "Abraham... built... an altar to the Lord"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++28%3A18"
      >Gn. 28:18</a
    >) that "Jacob... took the stone... and set it up for a title, pouring oil
    upon the top of it." Therefore the legal ceremonies preceded the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the first of the legal sacraments seems
    to have been circumcision. But circumcision preceded the Law, as appears
    from Gn. 17. In like manner the priesthood preceded the Law; for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++14%3A18"
      >Gn. 14:18</a
    >) that "Melchisedech... was the priest of the most high God." Therefore the
    sacramental ceremonies preceded the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the distinction of clean from unclean
    animals belongs to the ceremonies of observances, as stated above (<a
      href="FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1"
      >Question [100]</a
    >, 2, <a href="FS100.html#FSQ100A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1). But this
    distinction preceded the Law; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++7%3A2,3"
      >Gn. 7:2,3</a
    >): "Of all clean beasts take seven and seven... but of the beasts that are
    unclean, two and two." Therefore the legal ceremonies preceded the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A1"
      >Dt. 6:1</a
    >): "These are the precepts and ceremonies... which the Lord your God
    commanded that I should teach you." But they would not have needed to be
    taught about these things, if the aforesaid ceremonies had been already in
    existence. Therefore the legal ceremonies did not precede the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is clear from what has been said (<a
      href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="FS101.html#FSQ101A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1">Question [102]</a>,
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the legal ceremonies
    were ordained for a double purpose; the worship of God, and the
    foreshadowing of Christ. Now whoever worships God must needs worship Him by
    means of certain fixed things pertaining to external worship. But the fixing
    of the divine worship belongs to the ceremonies; just as the determining of
    our relations with our neighbor is a matter determined by the judicial
    precepts, as stated above (<a href="FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a
    >, <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Consequently, as
    among men in general there were certain judicial precepts, not indeed
    established by Divine authority, but ordained by human reason; so also there
    were some ceremonies fixed, not by the authority of any law, but according
    to the will and devotion of those that worship God. Since, however, even
    before the Law some of the leading men were gifted with the spirit of
    prophecy, it is to be believed that a heavenly instinct, like a private law,
    prompted them to worship God in a certain definite way, which would be both
    in keeping with the interior worship, and a suitable token of Christ's
    mysteries, which were foreshadowed also by other things that they did,
    according to 1 Cor. 10:11: "All... things happened to them in figure."
    Therefore there were some ceremonies before the Law, but they were not legal
    ceremonies, because they were not as yet established by legislation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The patriarchs offered up these
    oblations, sacrifices and holocausts previously to the Law, out of a certain
    devotion of their own will, according as it seemed proper to them to offer
    up in honor of God those things which they had received from Him, and thus
    to testify that they worshipped God Who is the beginning and end of all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> They also established certain sacred
    things, because they thought that the honor due to God demanded that certain
    places should be set apart from others for the purpose of divine worship.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of circumcision was
    established by command of God before the Law. Hence it cannot be called a
    sacrament of the Law as though it were an institution of the Law, but only
    as an observance included in the Law. Hence Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++7%3A20"
      >Jn. 7:20</a
    >) that circumcision was "not of Moses, but of his fathers." Again, among
    those who worshipped God, the priesthood was in existence before the Law by
    human appointment, for the Law allotted the priestly dignity to the
    firstborn.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The distinction of clean from unclean
    animals was in vogue before the Law, not with regard to eating them, since
    it is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++9%3A3"
      >Gn. 9:3</a
    >): "Everything that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you": but only as
    to the offering of sacrifices because they used only certain animals for
    that purpose. If, however, they did make any distinction in regard to
    eating; it was not that it was considered illegal to eat such animals, since
    this was not forbidden by any law, but from dislike or custom: thus even now
    we see that certain foods are looked upon with disgust in some countries,
    while people partake of them in others.<br />

    Whether, at the time of the Law, the ceremonies of the Old Law had any power
    of justification?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the ceremonies of the Old Law
    had the power of justification at the time of the Law. Because expiation
    from sin and consecration pertains to justification. But it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++39%3A21"
      >Ex. 39:21</a
    >) that the priests and their apparel were consecrated by the sprinkling of
    blood and the anointing of oil; and (Lev. 16:16) that, by sprinkling the
    blood of the calf, the priest expiated "the sanctuary from the uncleanness
    of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions and... their sins."
    Therefore the ceremonies of the Old Law had the power of justification.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that by which man pleases God pertains
    to justification, according to Ps. 10:8: "The Lord is just and hath loved
    justice." But some pleased God by means of ceremonies, according to Lev.
    10:19: "How could I... please the Lord in the ceremonies, having a sorrowful
    heart?" Therefore the ceremonies of the Old Law had the power of
    justification.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things relating to the divine worship
    regard the soul rather than the body, according to Ps. 18:8: "The Law of the
    Lord is unspotted, converting souls." But the leper was cleansed by means of
    the ceremonies of the Old Law, as stated in Lev. 14. Much more therefore
    could the ceremonies of the Old Law cleanse the soul by justifying it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++2"
      >Gal. 2</a
    >) [*The first words of the quotation are from 3:21: St. Thomas probably
    quoting from memory, substituted them for 2:21, which runs thus: 'If justice
    be by the Law, then Christ died in vain.']: "If there had been a law given
    which could justify [Vulg.: 'give life'], Christ died in vain," i.e. without
    cause. But this is inadmissible. Therefore the ceremonies of the Old Law did
    not confer justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1"
      >Question [102]</a
    >, <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4), a twofold
    uncleanness was distinguished in the Old Law. One was spiritual and is the
    uncleanness of sin. The other was corporal, which rendered a man unfit for
    divine worship; thus a leper, or anyone that touched carrion, was said to be
    unclean: and thus uncleanness was nothing but a kind of irregularity. From
    this uncleanness, then, the ceremonies of the Old Law had the power to
    cleanse: because they were ordered by the Law to be employed as remedies for
    the removal of the aforesaid uncleannesses which were contracted in
    consequence of the prescription of the Law. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A13"
      >Heb. 9:13</a
    >) that "the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of a heifer, being
    sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh." And
    just as this uncleanness which was washed away by such like ceremonies,
    affected the flesh rather than the soul, so also the ceremonies themselves
    are called by the Apostle shortly before (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A10"
      >Heb. 9:10</a
    >) justices of the flesh: "justices of the flesh," says he, "being laid on
    them until the time of correction."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, they had no power of cleansing from uncleanness of the
    soul, i.e. from the uncleanness of sin. The reason of this was that at no
    time could there be expiation from sin, except through Christ, "Who taketh
    away the sins [Vulg.: 'sin'] of the world" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A29"
      >Jn. 1:29</a
    >). And since the mystery of Christ's Incarnation and Passion had not yet
    really taken place, those ceremonies of the Old Law could not really contain
    in themselves a power flowing from Christ already incarnate and crucified,
    such as the sacraments of the New Law contain. Consequently they could not
    cleanse from sin: thus the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++10%3A4"
      >Heb. 10:4</a
    >) that "it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should
    be taken away"; and for this reason he calls them (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A9"
      >Gal. 4:9</a
    >) "weak and needy elements": weak indeed, because they cannot take away
    sin; but this weakness results from their being needy, i.e. from the fact
    that they do not contain grace within themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it was possible at the time of the Law, for the minds of the
    faithful, to be united by faith to Christ incarnate and crucified; so that
    they were justified by faith in Christ: of which faith the observance of
    these ceremonies was a sort of profession, inasmuch as they foreshadowed
    Christ. Hence in the Old Law certain sacrifices were offered up for sins,
    not as though the sacrifices themselves washed sins away, but because they
    were professions of faith which cleansed from sin. In fact, the Law itself
    implies this in the terms employed: for it is written (Lev. 4:26; 5:16) that
    in offering the sacrifice for sin "the priest shall pray for him... and it
    shall be forgiven him," as though the sin were forgiven, not in virtue of
    the sacrifices, but through the faith and devotion of those who offered
    them. It must be observed, however, that the very fact that the ceremonies
    of the Old Law washed away uncleanness of the body, was a figure of that
    expiation from sins which was effected by Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore evident that under the state of the Old Law the ceremonies
    had no power of justification.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That sanctification of priests and their
    sons, and of their apparel or of anything else belonging to them, by
    sprinkling them with blood, had no other effect but to appoint them to the
    divine worship, and to remove impediments from them, "to the cleansing of
    the flesh," as the Apostle states (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A13"
      >Heb. 9:13</a
    >) in token of that sanctification whereby "Jesus" sanctified "the people by
    His own blood" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++13%3A12"
      >Heb. 13:12</a
    >). Moreover, the expiation must be understood as referring to the removal
    of these bodily uncleannesses, not to the forgiveness of sin. Hence even the
    sanctuary which could not be the subject of sin is stated to be expiated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The priests pleased God in the
    ceremonies by their obedience and devotion, and by their faith in the
    reality foreshadowed; not by reason of the things considered in
    themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those ceremonies which were prescribed
    in the cleansing of a leper, were not ordained for the purpose of taking
    away the defilement of leprosy. This is clear from the fact that these
    ceremonies were not applied to a man until he was already healed: hence it
    is written (Lev. 14:3,4) that the priest, "going out of the camp, when he
    shall find that the leprosy is cleansed, shall command him that is to be
    purified to offer," etc.; whence it is evident that the priest was appointed
    the judge of leprosy, not before, but after cleansing. But these ceremonies
    were employed for the purpose of taking away the uncleanness of
    irregularity. They do say, however, that if a priest were to err in his
    judgment, the leper would be cleansed miraculously by the power of God, but
    not in virtue of the sacrifice. Thus also it was by miracle that the thigh
    of the adulterous woman rotted, when she had drunk the water "on which" the
    priest had "heaped curses," as stated in Num. 5:19-27.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the ceremonies of the Old Law ceased at the coming of Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the ceremonies of the Old Law
    did not cease at the coming of Christ. For it is written (Bar 4:1): "This is
    the book of the commandments of God, and the law that is for ever." But the
    legal ceremonies were part of the Law. Therefore the legal ceremonies were
    to last for ever.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the offering made by a leper after being
    cleansed was a ceremony of the Law. But the Gospel commands the leper, who
    has been cleansed, to make this offering (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++8%3A4"
      >Mt. 8:4</a
    >). Therefore the ceremonies of the Old Law did not cease at Christ's
    coming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as long as the cause remains, the effect
    remains. But the ceremonies of the Old Law had certain reasonable causes,
    inasmuch as they were ordained to the worship of God, besides the fact that
    they were intended to be figures of Christ. Therefore the ceremonies of the
    Old Law should not have ceased.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, circumcision was instituted as a sign of
    Abraham's faith: the observance of the sabbath, to recall the blessing of
    creation: and other solemnities, in memory of other Divine favors, as state
    above (<a href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1">Question [102]</a>,
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 10;
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A4A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1). But Abraham's
    faith is ever to be imitated even by us: and the blessing of creation and
    other Divine favors should never be forgotten. Therefore at least
    circumcision and the other legal solemnities should not have ceased.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (Col. 2:16,17): "Let no
    man... judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of
    the new moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come": and
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++8%3A13">Heb. 8:13</a>):
    "In saying a new (testament), he hath made the former old: and that which
    decayeth and groweth old, is near its end."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All the ceremonial precepts of the Old Law were
    ordained to the worship of God as stated above (<a
      href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="FS101.html#FSQ101ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Now external
    worship should be in proportion to the internal worship, which consists in
    faith, hope and charity. Consequently exterior worship had to be subject to
    variations according to the variations in the internal worship, in which a
    threefold state may be distinguished. One state was in respect of faith and
    hope, both in heavenly goods, and in the means of obtaining them---in both
    of these considered as things to come. Such was the state of faith and hope
    in the Old Law. Another state of interior worship is that in which we have
    faith and hope in heavenly goods as things to come; but in the means of
    obtaining heavenly goods, as in things present or past. Such is the state of
    the New Law. The third state is that in which both are possessed as present;
    wherein nothing is believed in as lacking, nothing hoped for as being yet to
    come. Such is the state of the Blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In this state of the Blessed, then, nothing in regard to worship of God will
    be figurative; there will be naught but "thanksgiving and voice of praise"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++51%3A3">Is. 51:3</a>).
    Hence it is written concerning the city of the Blessed (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++21%3A22"
      >Apoc. 21:22</a
    >): "I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty is the temple
    thereof, and the Lamb." Proportionately, therefore, the ceremonies of the
    first-mentioned state which foreshadowed the second and third states, had
    need to cease at the advent of the second state; and other ceremonies had to
    be introduced which would be in keeping with the state of divine worship for
    that particular time, wherein heavenly goods are a thing of the future, but
    the Divine favors whereby we obtain the heavenly boons are a thing of the
    present.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Old Law is said to be "for ever"
    simply and absolutely, as regards its moral precepts; but as regards the
    ceremonial precepts it lasts for even in respect of the reality which those
    ceremonies foreshadowed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The mystery of the redemption of the
    human race was fulfilled in Christ's Passion: hence Our Lord said then: "It
    is consummated" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A30"
      >Jn. 19:30</a
    >). Consequently the prescriptions of the Law must have ceased then
    altogether through their reality being fulfilled. As a sign of this, we read
    that at the Passion of Christ "the veil of the temple was rent" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++27%3A51"
      >Mt. 27:51</a
    >). Hence, before Christ's Passion, while Christ was preaching and working
    miracles, the Law and the Gospel were concurrent, since the mystery of
    Christ had already begun, but was not as yet consummated. And for this
    reason Our Lord, before His Passion, commanded the leper to observe the
    legal ceremonies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The literal reasons already given (<a
      href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1"
      >Question [102]</a
    >) for the ceremonies refer to the divine worship, which was founded on
    faith in that which was to come. Hence, at the advent of Him Who was to
    come, both that worship ceased, and all the reasons referring thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The faith of Abraham was commended in
    that he believed in God's promise concerning his seed to come, in which all
    nations were to blessed. Wherefore, as long as this seed was yet to come, it
    was necessary to make profession of Abraham's faith by means of
    circumcision. But now that it is consummated, the same thing needs to be
    declared by means of another sign, viz. Baptism, which, in this respect,
    took the place of circumcision, according to the saying of the Apostle (Col.
    2:11, 12): "You are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand, in
    despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ,
    buried with Him in Baptism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As to the sabbath, which was a sign recalling the first creation, its place
    is taken by the "Lord's Day," which recalls the beginning of the new
    creature in the Resurrection of Christ. In like manner other solemnities of
    the Old Law are supplanted by new solemnities: because the blessings
    vouchsafed to that people, foreshadowed the favors granted us by Christ.
    Hence the feast of the Passover gave place to the feast of Christ's Passion
    and Resurrection: the feast of Pentecost when the Old Law was given, to the
    feast of Pentecost on which was given the Law of the living spirit: the
    feast of the New Moon, to Lady Day, when appeared the first rays of the sun,
    i.e. Christ, by the fulness of grace: the feast of Trumpets, to the feasts
    of the Apostles: the feast of Expiation, to the feasts of Martyrs and
    Confessors: the feast of Tabernacles, to the feast of the Church Dedication:
    the feast of the Assembly and Collection, to feast of the Angels, or else to
    the feast of All Hallows.<br />

    Whether since Christ's Passion the legal ceremonies can be observed without
    committing mortal sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that since Christ's Passion the
    legal ceremonies can be observed without committing mortal sin. For we must
    not believe that the apostles committed mortal sin after receiving the Holy
    Ghost: since by His fulness they were "endued with power from on high" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A49"
      >Lk. 24:49</a
    >). But the apostles observed the legal ceremonies after the coming of the
    Holy Ghost: for it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+16%3A3"
      >Acts 16:3</a
    >) that Paul circumcised Timothy: and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+21%3A26"
      >Acts 21:26</a
    >) that Paul, at the advice of James, "took the men, and... being purified
    with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the accomplishment of
    the days of purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one
    of them." Therefore the legal ceremonies can be observed since the Passion
    of Christ without mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one of the legal ceremonies consisted in
    shunning the fellowship of Gentiles. But the first Pastor of the Church
    complied with this observance; for it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++2%3A12"
      >Gal. 2:12</a
    >) that, "when" certain men "had come" to Antioch, Peter "withdrew and
    separated himself" from the Gentiles. Therefore the legal ceremonies can be
    observed since Christ's Passion without committing mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the commands of the apostles did not
    lead men into sin. But it was commanded by apostolic decree that the
    Gentiles should observe certain ceremonies of the Law: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+15%3A28,29"
      >Acts 15:28,29</a
    >): "It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further
    burden upon you than these necessary things: that you abstain from things
    sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from
    fornication." Therefore the legal ceremonies can be observed since Christ's
    Passion without committing mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A2"
      >Gal. 5:2</a
    >): "If you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." But nothing
    save mortal sin hinders us from receiving Christ's fruit. Therefore since
    Christ's Passion it is a mortal sin to be circumcised, or to observe the
    other legal ceremonies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All ceremonies are professions of faith, in
    which the interior worship of God consists. Now man can make profession of
    his inward faith, by deeds as well as by words: and in either profession, if
    he make a false declaration, he sins mortally. Now, though our faith in
    Christ is the same as that of the fathers of old; yet, since they came
    before Christ, whereas we come after Him, the same faith is expressed in
    different words, by us and by them. For by them was it said: "Behold a
    virgin shall conceive and bear a son," where the verbs are in the future
    tense: whereas we express the same by means of verbs in the past tense, and
    say that she "conceived and bore." In like manner the ceremonies of the Old
    Law betokened Christ as having yet to be born and to suffer: whereas our
    sacraments signify Him as already born and having suffered. Consequently,
    just as it would be a mortal sin now for anyone, in making a profession of
    faith, to say that Christ is yet to be born, which the fathers of old said
    devoutly and truthfully; so too it would be a mortal sin now to observe
    those ceremonies which the fathers of old fulfilled with devotion and
    fidelity. Such is the teaching Augustine (Contra Faust. xix, 16), who says:
    "It is no longer promised that He shall be born, shall suffer and rise
    again, truths of which their sacraments were a kind of image: but it is
    declared that He is already born, has suffered and risen again; of which our
    sacraments, in which Christians share, are the actual representation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> On this point there seems to have been a
    difference of opinion between Jerome and Augustine. For Jerome (Super Galat.
    ii, 11, seqq.) distinguished two periods of time. One was the time previous
    to Christ's Passion, during which the legal ceremonies were neither dead,
    since they were obligatory, and did expiate in their own fashion; nor
    deadly, because it was not sinful to observe them. But immediately after
    Christ's Passion they began to be not only dead, so as no longer to be
    either effectual or binding; but also deadly, so that whoever observed them
    was guilty of mortal sin. Hence he maintained that after the Passion the
    apostles never observed the legal ceremonies in real earnest; but only by a
    kind of pious pretense, lest, to wit, they should scandalize the Jews and
    hinder their conversion. This pretense, however, is to be understood, not as
    though they did not in reality perform those actions, but in the sense that
    they performed them without the mind to observe the ceremonies of the Law:
    thus a man might cut away his foreskin for health's sake, not with the
    intention of observing legal circumcision.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since it seems unbecoming that the apostles, in order to avoid scandal,
    should have hidden things pertaining to the truth of life and doctrine, and
    that they should have made use of pretense, in things pertaining to the
    salvation of the faithful; therefore Augustine (Epist. lxxxii) more
    fittingly distinguished three periods of time. One was the time that
    preceded the Passion of Christ, during which the legal ceremonies were
    neither deadly nor dead: another period was after the publication of the
    Gospel, during which the legal ceremonies are both dead and deadly. The
    third is a middle period, viz. from the Passion of Christ until the
    publication of the Gospel, during which the legal ceremonies were dead
    indeed, because they had neither effect nor binding force; but were not
    deadly, because it was lawful for the Jewish converts to Christianity to
    observe them, provided they did not put their trust in them so as to hold
    them to be necessary unto salvation, as though faith in Christ could not
    justify without the legal observances. On the other hand, there was no
    reason why those who were converted from heathendom to Christianity should
    observe them. Hence Paul circumcised Timothy, who was born of a Jewish
    mother; but was unwilling to circumcise Titus, who was of heathen
    nationality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why the Holy Ghost did not wish the converted Jews to be debarred
    at once from observing the legal ceremonies, while converted heathens were
    forbidden to observe the rites of heathendom, was in order to show that
    there is a difference between these rites. For heathenish ceremonial was
    rejected as absolutely unlawful, and as prohibited by God for all time;
    whereas the legal ceremonial ceased as being fulfilled through Christ's
    Passion, being instituted by God as a figure of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to Jerome, Peter withdrew
    himself from the Gentiles by pretense, in order to avoid giving scandal to
    the Jews, of whom he was the Apostle. Hence he did not sin at all in acting
    thus. On the other hand, Paul in like manner made a pretense of blaming him,
    in order to avoid scandalizing the Gentiles, whose Apostle he was. But
    Augustine disapproves of this solution: because in the canonical Scripture
    (viz. Gal. 2:11), wherein we must not hold anything to be false, Paul says
    that Peter "was to be blamed." Consequently it is true that Peter was at
    fault: and Paul blamed him in very truth and not with pretense. Peter,
    however, did not sin, by observing the legal ceremonial for the time being;
    because this was lawful for him who was a converted Jew. But he did sin by
    excessive minuteness in the observance of the legal rites lest he should
    scandalize the Jews, the result being that he gave scandal to the
    Gentiles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some have held that this prohibition of
    the apostles is not to be taken literally, but spiritually: namely, that the
    prohibition of blood signifies the prohibition of murder; the prohibition of
    things strangled, that of violence and rapine; the prohibition of things
    offered to idols, that of idolatry; while fornication is forbidden as being
    evil in itself: which opinion they gathered from certain glosses, which
    expound these prohibitions in a mystical sense. Since, however, murder and
    rapine were held to be unlawful even by the Gentiles, there would have been
    no need to give this special commandment to those who were converted to
    Christ from heathendom. Hence others maintain that those foods were
    forbidden literally, not to prevent the observance of legal ceremonies, but
    in order to prevent gluttony. Thus Jerome says on Ezech. 44:31 ("The priest
    shall not eat of anything that is dead"): "He condemns those priests who
    from gluttony did not keep these precepts."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But since certain foods are more delicate than these and more conducive to
    gluttony, there seems no reason why these should have been forbidden more
    than the others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore follow the third opinion, and hold that these foods were
    forbidden literally, not with the purpose of enforcing compliance with the
    legal ceremonies, but in order to further the union of Gentiles and Jews
    living side by side. Because blood and things strangled were loathsome to
    the Jews by ancient custom; while the Jews might have suspected the Gentiles
    of relapse into idolatry if the latter had partaken of things offered to
    idols. Hence these things were prohibited for the time being, during which
    the Gentiles and Jews were to become united together. But as time went on,
    with the lapse of the cause, the effect lapsed also, when the truth of the
    Gospel teaching was divulged, wherein Our Lord taught that "not that which
    entereth into the mouth defileth a man" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A11"
      >Mt. 15:11</a
    >); and that "nothing is to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A4">1 Tim. 4:4</a
    >). With regard to fornication a special prohibition was made, because the
    Gentiles did not hold it to be sinful.<br />
