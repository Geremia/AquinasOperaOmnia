  <h3 align="left">Whether many habits can be in one power?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be many habits in
    one power. For when several things are distinguished in respect of the same
    thing, if one of them be multiplied, the others are too. Now habits and
    powers are distinguished in respect of the same thing, viz. their acts and
    objects. Therefore they are multiplied in like manner. Therefore there
    cannot be many habits in one power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a power is a simple force. Now in one
    simple subject there cannot be diversity of accidents; for the subject is
    the cause of its accidents; and it does not appear how diverse effects can
    proceed from one simple cause. Therefore there cannot be many habits in one
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the body is informed by its
    shape, so is a power informed by a habit. But one body cannot be informed at
    the same time by various shapes. Therefore neither can a power be informed
    at the same time by many habits. Therefore several habits cannot be at the
    same time in one power.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The intellect is one power; wherein,
    nevertheless, are the habits of various sciences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS049.html#FSQ49OUTP1"
      >Question [49]</a
    >, <a href="FS049.html#FSQ49A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), habits are
    dispositions of a thing that is in potentiality to something, either to
    nature, or to operation, which is the end of nature. As to those habits
    which are dispositions to nature, it is clear that several can be in one
    same subject: since in one subject we may take parts in various ways,
    according to the various dispositions of which parts there are various
    habits. Thus, if we take the humors as being parts of the human body,
    according to their disposition in respect of human nature, we have the habit
    or disposition of health: while, if we take like parts, such as nerves,
    bones, and flesh, the disposition of these in respect of nature is strength
    or weakness; whereas, if we take the limbs, i.e. the hands, feet, and so on,
    the disposition of these in proportion to nature, is beauty: and thus there
    are several habits or dispositions in the same subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, we speak of those habits that are dispositions to operation,
    and belong properly to the powers; thus, again, there may be several habits
    in one power. The reason for this is that the subject of a habit is a
    passive power, as stated above (<a href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1"
      >Question [51]</a
    >, <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): for it is only an
    active power that cannot be the subject of a habit, as was clearly shown
    above (<a href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>,
    <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now a passive power is
    compared to the determinate act of any species, as matter to form: because,
    just as matter is determinate to one form by one agent, so, too, is a
    passive power determined by the nature of one active object to an act
    specifically one. Wherefore, just as several objects can move one passive
    power, so can one passive power be the subject of several acts or
    perfections specifically diverse. Now habits are qualities or forms adhering
    to a power, and inclining that power to acts of a determinate species.
    Consequently several habits, even as several specifically different acts,
    can belong to one power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even as in natural things, diversity of
    species is according to the form, and diversity of genus, according to
    matter, as stated in Metaph. v, text. 33 (since things that differ in matter
    belong to different genera): so, too, generic diversity of objects entails a
    difference of powers (wherefore the Philosopher says in Ethic. vi, 1, that
    "those objects that differ generically belong to different departments of
    the soul"); while specific difference of objects entails a specific
    difference of acts, and consequently of habits also. Now things that differ
    in genus differ in species, but not vice versa. Wherefore the acts and
    habits of different powers differ in species: but it does not follow that
    different habits are in different powers, for several can be in one power.
    And even as several genera may be included in one genus, and several species
    be contained in one species; so does it happen that there are several
    species of habits and powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although a power is simple as to its
    essence, it is multiple virtually, inasmuch as it extends to many
    specifically different acts. Consequently there is nothing to prevent many
    superficially different habits from being in one power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A body is informed by its shape as by
    its own terminal boundaries: whereas a habit is not the terminal boundary of
    a power, but the disposition of a power to an act as to its ultimate term.
    Consequently one same power cannot have several acts at the same time,
    except in so far as perchance one act is comprised in another; just as
    neither can a body have several shapes, save in so far as one shape enters
    into another, as a three-sided in a four-sided figure. For the intellect
    cannot understand several things at the same time "actually"; and yet it can
    know several things at the same time "habitually."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether habits are distinguished by their objects?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that habits are not distinguished
    by their objects. For contraries differ in species. Now the same habit of
    science regards contraries: thus medicine regards the healthy and the
    unhealthy. Therefore habits are not distinguished by objects specifically
    distinct.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, different sciences are different habits.
    But the same scientific truth belongs to different sciences: thus both the
    physicist and the astronomer prove the earth to be round, as stated in Phys.
    ii, text. 17. Therefore habits are not distinguished by their objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, wherever the act is the same, the object
    is the same. But the same act can belong to different habits of virtue, if
    it be directed to different ends; thus to give money to anyone, if it be
    done for God's sake, is an act of charity; while, if it be done in order to
    pay a debt, it is an act of justice. Therefore the same object can also
    belong to different habits. Therefore diversity of habits does not follow
    diversity of objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Acts differ in species according to the
    diversity of their objects, as stated above (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But habits are
    dispositions to acts. Therefore habits also are distinguished according to
    the diversity of objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A habit is both a form and a habit. Hence the
    specific distinction of habits may be taken in the ordinary way in which
    forms differ specifically; or according to that mode of distinction which is
    proper to habits. Accordingly forms are distinguished from one another in
    reference to the diversity of their active principles, since every agent
    produces its like in species. Habits, however, imply order to something: and
    all things that imply order to something, are distinguished according to the
    distinction of the things to which they are ordained. Now a habit is a
    disposition implying a twofold order: viz. to nature and to an operation
    consequent to nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly habits are specifically distinct in respect of three things.
    First, in respect of the active principles of such dispositions; secondly,
    in respect of nature; thirdly, in respect of specifically different objects,
    as will appear from what follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In distinguishing powers, or also
    habits, we must consider the object not in its material but in its formal
    aspect, which may differ in species or even in genus. And though the
    distinction between specific contraries is a real distinction yet they are
    both known under one aspect, since one is known through the other. And
    consequently in so far as they concur in the one aspect of cognoscibility,
    they belong to one cognitive habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The physicist proves the earth to be
    round by one means, the astronomer by another: for the latter proves this by
    means of mathematics, e.g. by the shapes of eclipses, or something of the
    sort; while the former proves it by means of physics, e.g. by the movement
    of heavy bodies towards the center, and so forth. Now the whole force of a
    demonstration, which is "a syllogism producing science," as stated in
    Poster. i, text. 5, depends on the mean. And consequently various means are
    as so many active principles, in respect of which the habits of science are
    distinguished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, text.
    89; Ethic. vii, 8), the end is, in practical matters, what the principle is
    in speculative matters. Consequently diversity of ends demands a diversity
    of virtues, even as diversity of active principles does. Moreover the ends
    are objects of the internal acts, with which, above all, the virtues are
    concerned, as is evident from what has been said (<a

  <h3 align="left">Whether habits are divided into good and bad?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that habits are not divided into
    good and bad. For good and bad are contraries. Now the same habit regards
    contraries, as was stated above (<a href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, Objection [1]). Therefore habits are not divided into good and bad.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, good is convertible with being; so that,
    since it is common to all, it cannot be accounted a specific difference, as
    the Philosopher declares (Topic. iv). Again, evil, since it is a privation
    and a non-being, cannot differentiate any being. Therefore habits cannot be
    specifically divided into good and evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there can be different evil habits about
    one same object; for instance, intemperance and insensibility about matters
    of concupiscence: and in like manner there can be several good habits; for
    instance, human virtue and heroic or godlike virtue, as the Philosopher
    clearly states (Ethic. vii, 1). Therefore, habits are not divided into good
    and bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A good habit is contrary to a bad habit, as
    virtue to vice. Now contraries are divided specifically into good and bad
    habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), habits are specifically distinct not only in respect of their objects
    and active principles, but also in their relation to nature. Now, this
    happens in two ways. First, by reason of their suitableness or
    unsuitableness to nature. In this way a good habit is specifically distinct
    from a bad habit: since a good habit is one which disposes to an act
    suitable to the agent's nature, while an evil habit is one which disposes to
    an act unsuitable to nature. Thus, acts of virtue are suitable to human
    nature, since they are according to reason, whereas acts of vice are
    discordant from human nature, since they are against reason. Hence it is
    clear that habits are distinguished specifically by the difference of good
    and bad.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, habits are distinguished in relation to nature, from the fact that
    one habit disposes to an act that is suitable to a lower nature, while
    another habit disposes to an act befitting a higher nature. And thus human
    virtue, which disposes to an act befitting human nature, is distinct from
    godlike or heroic virtue, which disposes to an act befitting some higher
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The same habit may be about contraries
    in so far as contraries agree in one common aspect. Never, however, does it
    happen that contrary habits are in one species: since contrariety of habits
    follows contrariety of aspect. Accordingly habits are divided into good and
    bad, namely, inasmuch as one habit is good, and another bad; but not by
    reason of one habit being something good, and another about something
    bad.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not the good which is common to
    every being, that is a difference constituting the species of a habit; but
    some determinate good by reason of suitability to some determinate, viz. the
    human, nature. In like manner the evil that constitutes a difference of
    habits is not a pure privation, but something determinate repugnant to a
    determinate nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Several good habits about one same
    specific thing are distinct in reference to their suitability to various
    natures, as stated above. But several bad habits in respect of one action
    are distinct in reference to their diverse repugnance to that which is in
    keeping with nature: thus, various vices about one same matter are contrary
    to one virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether one habit is made up of many habits?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one habit is made up of many
    habits. For whatever is engendered, not at once, but little by little, seems
    to be made up of several parts. But a habit is engendered, not at once, but
    little by little out of several acts, as stated above (<a
      href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1"
      >Question [51]</a
    >, <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore one habit
    is made up of several.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a whole is made up of its parts. Now
    many parts are assigned to one habit: thus Tully assigns many parts of
    fortitude, temperance, and other virtues. Therefore one habit is made up of
    many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one conclusion suffices both for an act
    and for a habit of scientific knowledge. But many conclusions belong to but
    one science, to geometry, for instance, or to arithmetic. Therefore one
    habit is made up of many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A habit, since it is a quality, is a simple
    form. But nothing simple is made up of many. Therefore one habit is not made
    up of many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A habit directed to operation, such as we are
    chiefly concerned with at present, is a perfection of a power. Now every
    perfection should be in proportion with that which it perfects. Hence, just
    as a power, while it is one, extends to many things, in so far as they have
    something in common, i.e. some general objective aspect, so also a habit
    extends to many things, in so far as they are related to one, for instance,
    to some specific objective aspect, or to one nature, or to one principle, as
    was clearly stated above (<a href="FS054.html#FSQ54ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a
    >,3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If then we consider a habit as to the extent of its object, we shall find a
    certain multiplicity therein. But since this multiplicity is directed to one
    thing, on which the habit is chiefly intent, hence it is that a habit is a
    simple quality, not composed to several habits, even though it extend to
    many things. For a habit does not extend to many things save in relation to
    one, whence it derives its unity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That a habit is engendered little by
    little, is due, not to one part being engendered after another, but to the
    fact that the subject does not acquire all at once a firm and difficultly
    changeable disposition; and also to the fact that it begins by being
    imperfectly in the subject, and is gradually perfected. The same applies to
    other qualities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The parts which are assigned to each
    cardinal virtue, are not integral parts that combine to form a whole; but
    subjective or potential parts, as we shall explain further on (<a
      href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="FS057.html#FSQ57A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 4;
    <a href="../SS.html">SS</a>, Question [48]).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In any science, he who acquires, by
    demonstration, scientific knowledge of one conclusion, has the habit indeed,
    yet imperfectly. And when he obtains, by demonstration, the scientific
    knowledge of another conclusion, no additional habit is engendered in him:
    but the habit which was in him previously is perfected, forasmuch as it has
    increased in extent; because the conclusions and demonstrations of one
    science are coordinate, and one flows from another.
