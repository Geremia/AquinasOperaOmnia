<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was useful for laws to be framed by men?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not useful for laws to be framed by 
men. Because the purpose of every law is that man be made good thereby, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But men are more to be induced to be good 
willingly by means of admonitions, than against their will, by means of 
laws. Therefore there was no need to frame laws.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, As the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 4), "men have 
recourse to a judge as to animate justice." But animate justice is better 
than inanimate justice, which contained in laws. Therefore it would have 
been better for the execution of justice to be entrusted to the decision 
of judges, than to frame laws in addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every law is framed for the direction of human actions, 
as is evident from what has been stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But since 
human actions are about singulars, which are infinite in number, matter 
pertaining to the direction of human actions cannot be taken into 
sufficient consideration except by a wise man, who looks into each one of 
them. Therefore it would have been better for human acts to be directed 
by the judgment of wise men, than by the framing of laws. Therefore there 
was no need of human laws.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. v, 20): "Laws were made  that in 
fear thereof human audacity might be held in check, that innocence might 
be safeguarded in the midst of wickedness, and that the dread of 
punishment might prevent the wicked from doing harm." But these things 
are most necessary to mankind. Therefore it was necessary that human laws 
should be made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS094.html#FSQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>, <A Href="FS094.html#FSQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), man has a 
natural aptitude for virtue; but the perfection of virtue must be 
acquired by man by means of some kind of training. Thus we observe that 
man is helped by industry in his necessities, for instance, in food and 
clothing. Certain beginnings of these he has from nature, viz. his reason 
and his hands; but he has not the full complement, as other animals have, 
to whom nature has given sufficiency of clothing and food. Now it is 
difficult to see how man could suffice for himself in the matter of this 
training: since the perfection of virtue consists chiefly in withdrawing 
man from undue pleasures, to which above all man is inclined, and 
especially the young, who are more capable of being trained. Consequently 
a man needs to receive this training from another, whereby to arrive at 
the perfection of virtue. And as to those young people who are inclined 
to acts of virtue, by their good natural disposition, or by custom, or 
rather by the gift of God, paternal training suffices, which is by 
admonitions. But since some are found to be depraved, and prone to vice, 
and not easily amenable to words, it was necessary for such to be 
restrained from evil by force and fear, in order that, at least, they 
might desist from evil-doing, and leave others in peace, and that they 
themselves, by being habituated in this way, might be brought to do 
willingly what hitherto they did from fear, and thus become virtuous. Now 
this kind of training, which compels through fear of punishment, is the 
discipline of laws. Therefore in order that man might have peace and 
virtue, it was necessary for laws to be framed: for, as the Philosopher 
says (Polit. i, 2), "as man is the most noble of animals if he be perfect 
in virtue, so is he the lowest of all, if he be severed from law and 
righteousness"; because man can use his reason to devise means of 
satisfying his lusts and evil passions, which other animals are unable to 
do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Men who are well disposed are led willingly to virtue by 
being admonished better than by coercion: but men who are evilly disposed 
are not led to virtue unless they are compelled.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 1), "it is better that 
all things be regulated by law, than left to be decided by judges": and 
this for three reasons. First, because it is easier to find a few wise 
men competent to frame right laws, than to find the many who would be 
necessary to judge aright of each single case. Secondly, because those 
who make laws consider long beforehand what laws to make; whereas 
judgment on each single case has to be pronounced as soon as it arises: 
and it is easier for man to see what is right, by taking many instances 
into consideration, than by considering one solitary fact. Thirdly, 
because lawgivers judge in the abstract and of future events; whereas 
those who sit in judgment of things present, towards which they are 
affected by love, hatred, or some kind of cupidity; wherefore their 
judgment is  perverted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then the animated justice of the judge is not found in every man, 
and since it can be deflected, therefore it was necessary, whenever 
possible, for the law to determine how to judge, and for very few matters 
to be left to the decision of men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certain individual facts which cannot be covered by the law 
"have necessarily to be committed to judges," as the Philosopher says in 
the same passage: for instance, "concerning something that has happened 
or not happened," and the like.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether every human law is derived from the natural law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not every human law is derived from the 
natural law. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the legal just 
is that which originally was a matter of indifference." But those things 
which arise from the natural law are not matters of indifference. 
Therefore the enactments of human laws are not derived from the natural 
law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, positive law is contrasted with natural law, as stated 
by Isidore (Etym. v, 4) and the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 7). But those 
things which flow as conclusions from the general principles of the 
natural law belong to the natural law, as stated above (<A Href="FS094.html#FSQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>, <A Href="FS094.html#FSQ94A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). 
Therefore that which is established by human law does not belong to the 
natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the law of nature is the same for all; since the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 7) that "the natural just is that which is 
equally valid everywhere." If therefore human laws were derived from the 
natural law, it would follow that they too are the same for all: which is 
clearly false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is possible to give a reason for things which are 
derived from the natural law. But "it is not possible to give the reason 
for all the legal enactments of the lawgivers," as the jurist says 
[*Pandect. Justin. lib. i, ff, tit. iii, v; De Leg. et Senat.]. Therefore 
not all human laws are derived from the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (Rhet. ii): "Things which emanated from 
nature and were approved by custom, were sanctioned by fear and reverence 
for the laws."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5) "that which is not 
just seems to be no law at all": wherefore the force of a law depends on 
the extent of its justice. Now in human affairs a thing is said to be 
just, from being right, according to the rule of reason. But the first 
rule of reason is the law of nature, as is clear from what has been 
stated above (<A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1">Question [91]</a>, <A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Consequently every human law has just 
so much of the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature. 
But if in any point it deflects  from the law of nature, it is no longer 
a law but a perversion of law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it must be noted that something may be derived from the natural law 
in two ways: first, as a conclusion from premises, secondly, by way of 
determination of certain generalities. The first way is like to that by 
which, in sciences, demonstrated conclusions are drawn from the 
principles: while the second mode is likened to that whereby, in the 
arts, general forms are particularized as to details: thus the craftsman 
needs to determine the general form of a house to some particular shape. 
Some things are therefore derived from the general principles of the 
natural law, by way of conclusions; e.g. that "one must not kill" may be 
derived as a conclusion from the principle that "one should do harm to no 
man": while some are derived therefrom by way of determination; e.g. the 
law of nature has it that the evil-doer should be punished; but that he 
be punished in this or that way, is a determination of the law of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly both modes of derivation are found in the human law. But 
those things which are derived in the first way, are contained in human 
law not as emanating therefrom exclusively, but have some force from the 
natural law also. But those things which are derived in the second way, 
have no other force than that of human law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of those enactments which are 
by way of determination or specification of the precepts of the natural 
law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument avails for those things that are derived from 
the natural law, by way of conclusions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The general principles of the natural law cannot be applied 
to all men in the same way on account of the great variety of human 
affairs: and hence arises the diversity of positive laws among various 
people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> These words of the Jurist are to be understood as referring 
to decisions of rulers in determining particular points of the natural 
law: on which determinations the judgment of expert and prudent men is 
based as on its principles; in so far, to wit, as they see at once what 
is the best thing to decide.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 11) that in such matters, "we 
ought to pay as much attention to the undemonstrated sayings and opinions 
of persons who surpass us in experience, age and prudence, as to their 
demonstrations."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Isidore's description of the quality of positive law is appropriate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Isidore's description of the quality  of 
positive law is not appropriate, when he says (Etym. v, 21): "Law shall 
be virtuous, just, possible to nature, according to the custom of the 
country, suitable to place and time, necessary, useful; clearly 
expressed, lest by its obscurity it lead to misunderstanding; framed for 
no private benefit, but for the common good." Because he had previously 
expressed the quality of law in three conditions, saying that "law is 
anything founded on reason, provided that it foster religion, be helpful 
to discipline, and further the common weal." Therefore it was needless to 
add any further conditions to these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Justice is included in honesty, as Tully says (De Offic. 
vii). Therefore after saying "honest" it was superfluous to add "just."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, written law is condivided with custom, according to 
Isidore (Etym. ii, 10). Therefore it should not be stated in the 
definition of law that it is "according to the custom of the country."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a thing may be necessary in two ways. It may be 
necessary simply, because it cannot be otherwise: and that which is 
necessary in this way, is not subject to human judgment, wherefore human 
law is not concerned with necessity of this kind. Again a thing may be 
necessary for an end: and this necessity is the same as usefulness. 
Therefore it is superfluous to say both "necessary" and "useful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Isidore.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whenever a thing is for an end, its form must be 
determined proportionately to that end; as the form of a saw is such as 
to be suitable for cutting (Phys. ii, text. 88). Again, everything that 
is ruled and measured must have a form proportionate to its rule and 
measure. Now both these conditions are verified of human law: since it is 
both something ordained to an end; and is a rule or measure ruled or 
measured by a higher measure. And this higher measure is twofold, viz. 
the Divine law and the natural law, as explained above (<A Href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93OUTP1">Question [93]</a>, <A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now the end of human law is to be useful to man, as the jurist states 
[*Pandect. Justin. lib. xxv, ff., tit. iii; De Leg. et Senat.]. Wherefore 
Isidore in determining the nature of law, lays down, at first, three 
conditions; viz. that it "foster religion," inasmuch as it is 
proportionate to the Divine law; that it be "helpful to discipline," 
inasmuch as it is proportionate to the nature law; and that it "further 
the common weal," inasmuch as it is proportionate to the utility of 
mankind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the other conditions mentioned by him are reduced to these three. 
For it is called virtuous because it fosters religion. And when he goes 
on to say that it should be "just, possible to nature, according to the 
customs of the country, adapted to place and time," he implies that it 
should be helpful to discipline. For human discipline depends on first on 
the order of reason, to which  he refers by saying "just": secondly, it 
depends on the ability of the agent; because discipline should be adapted 
to each one according to his ability, taking also into account the 
ability of nature (for the same burdens should be not laid on children as 
adults); and should be according to human customs; since man cannot live 
alone in society, paying no heed to others: thirdly, it depends on 
certain circumstances, in respect of which he says, "adapted to place and 
time." The remaining words, "necessary, useful," etc. mean that law 
should further the common weal: so that "necessity" refers to the removal 
of evils; "usefulness" to the attainment of good; "clearness of 
expression," to the need of preventing any harm ensuing from the law 
itself. And since, as stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), law is ordained to the 
common good, this is expressed in the last part of the description.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Isidore's division of human laws is appropriate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Isidore wrongly divided human statutes or 
human law (Etym. v, 4, seqq.). For under this law he includes the "law of 
nations," so called, because, as he says, "nearly all nations use it." 
But as he says, "natural law is that which is common to all nations." 
Therefore the law of nations is not contained under positive human law, 
but rather under natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those laws which have the same force, seem to differ not 
formally but only materially. But "statutes, decrees of the commonalty, 
senatorial decrees," and the like which he mentions (Etym. v, 9), all 
have the same force. Therefore they do not differ, except materially. But 
art takes no notice of such a distinction: since it may go on to 
infinity. Therefore this division of human laws is not appropriate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as, in the state, there are princes, priests and 
soldiers, so are there other human offices. Therefore it seems that, as 
this division includes "military law," and "public law," referring to 
priests and magistrates; so also it should include other laws pertaining 
to other offices of the state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, those things that are accidental should be passed over. 
But it is accidental to law that it be framed by this or that man. 
Therefore it is unreasonable to divide laws according to the names of 
lawgivers, so that one be called the "Cornelian" law, another the 
"Falcidian" law, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of Isidore (Objection [1]) suffices.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing can of itself be divided in respect of something 
contained in the notion of that thing. Thus a soul either rational or 
irrational is contained in the notion of animal: and therefore animal is 
divided properly and of itself in respect of  its being rational or 
irrational; but not in the point of its being white or black, which are 
entirely beside the notion of animal. Now, in the notion of human law, 
many things are contained, in respect of any of which human law can be 
divided properly and of itself. For in the first place it belongs to the 
notion of human law, to be derived from the law of nature, as explained 
above (<A Href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). In this respect positive law is divided into the "law of 
nations" and "civil law," according to the two ways in which something 
may be derived from the law of nature, as stated above (<A Href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Because, 
to the law of nations belong those things which are derived from the law 
of nature, as conclusions from premises, e.g. just buyings and sellings, 
and the like, without which men cannot live together, which is a point of 
the law of nature, since man is by nature a social animal, as is proved 
in Polit. i, 2. But those things which are derived from the law of nature 
by way of particular determination, belong to the civil law, according as 
each state decides on what is best for itself.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it belongs to the notion of human law, to be ordained to the 
common good of the state. In this respect human law may be divided 
according to the different kinds of men who work in a special way for the 
common good: e.g. priests, by praying to God for the people; princes, by 
governing the people; soldiers, by fighting for the safety of the people. 
Wherefore certain special kinds of law are adapted to these men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[95] A[4] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it belongs to the notion of human law, to be framed by that one 
who governs the community of the state, as shown above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). In 
this respect, there are various human laws according to the various forms 
of government. Of these, according to the Philosopher (Polit. iii, 10) 
one is "monarchy," i.e. when the state is governed by one; and then we 
have "Royal Ordinances." Another form is "aristocracy," i.e. government 
by the best men or men of highest rank; and then we have the 
"Authoritative legal opinions" [Responsa Prudentum] and "Decrees of the 
Senate" [Senatus consulta]. Another form is "oligarchy," i.e. government 
by a few rich and powerful men; and then we have "Praetorian," also 
called "Honorary," law. Another form of government is that of the people, 
which is called "democracy," and there we have "Decrees of the 
commonalty" [Plebiscita]. There is also tyrannical government, which is 
altogether corrupt, which, therefore, has no corresponding law. Finally, 
there is a form of government made up of all these, and which is the 
best: and in this respect we have law sanctioned by the "Lords and 
Commons," as stated by Isidore (Etym. v, 4, seqq.).<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, it belongs to the notion of human law to direct human actions. 
In this respect, according to the various matters of which the law 
treats, there are various kinds of laws, which are sometimes named after 
their authors: thus we have the "Lex Julia" about adultery, the "Lex 
Cornelia" concerning assassins, and so on, differentiated in this way, 
not on account of the authors, but on account of the matters to which 
they refer.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The law of nations is indeed, in some way, natural to man, 
in so far as he is a reasonable being, because it is derived from the 
natural law by way of a conclusion that is not very remote from its 
premises. Wherefore men easily agreed thereto. Nevertheless it is 
distinct from the natural law, especially it is distinct from the natural 
law which is common to all animals.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Replies to the other Objections are evident from what has been said.
