  <h3 align="center">OF THE EFFECTS OF LOVE (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>

  <p>
    We now have to consider the effects of love: under which head there are six
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether union is an effect of love?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that union is not an effect of
    love. For absence is incompatible with union. But love is compatible with
    absence; for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A18"
      >Gal. 4:18</a
    >): "Be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always" (speaking of
    himself, according to a gloss), "and not only when I am present with you."
    Therefore union is not an effect of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every union is either according to
    essence, thus form is united to matter, accident to subject, and a part to
    the whole, or to another part in order to make up the whole: or according to
    likeness, in genus, species, or accident. But love does not cause union of
    essence; else love could not be between things essentially distinct. On the
    other hand, love does not cause union of likeness, but rather is caused by
    it, as stated above (<a href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore union is not
    an effect of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sense in act is the sensible in act,
    and the intellect in act is the thing actually understood. But the lover in
    act is not the beloved in act. Therefore union is the effect of knowledge
    rather than of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that every love
    is a "unitive love."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The union of lover and beloved is twofold. The
    first is real union; for instance, when the beloved is present with the
    lover. The second is union of affection: and this union must be considered
    in relation to the preceding apprehension; since movement of the appetite
    follows apprehension. Now love being twofold, viz. love of concupiscence and
    love of friendship; each of these arises from a kind of apprehension of the
    oneness of the thing loved with the lover. For when we love a thing, by
    desiring it, we apprehend it as belonging to our well-being. In like manner
    when a man loves another with the love of friendship, he wills good to him,
    just as he wills good to himself: wherefore he apprehends him as his other
    self, in so far, to wit, as he wills good to him as to himself. Hence a
    friend is called a man's "other self" (Ethic. ix, 4), and Augustine says
    (Confess. iv, 6), "Well did one say to his friend: Thou half of my soul."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first of these unions is caused "effectively" by love; because love
    moves man to desire and seek the presence of the beloved, as of something
    suitable and belonging to him. The second union is caused "formally" by
    love; because love itself is this union or bond. In this sense Augustine
    says (De Trin. viii, 10) that "love is a vital principle uniting, or seeking
    to unite two together, the lover, to wit, and the beloved." For in
    describing it as "uniting" he refers to the union of affection, without
    which there is no love: and in saying that "it seeks to unite," he refers to
    real union.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is true of real union.
    That is necessary to pleasure as being its cause; desire implies the real
    absence of the beloved: but love remains whether the beloved be absent or
    present.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Union has a threefold relation to love.
    There is union which causes love; and this is substantial union, as regards
    the love with which one loves oneself; while as regards the love wherewith
    one loves other things, it is the union of likeness, as stated above (<a
      href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). There is also a union
    which is essentially love itself. This union is according to a bond of
    affection, and is likened to substantial union, inasmuch as the lover stands
    to the object of his love, as to himself, if it be love of friendship; as to
    something belonging to himself, if it be love of concupiscence. Again there
    is a union, which is the effect of love. This is real union, which the lover
    seeks with the object of his love. Moreover this union is in keeping with
    the demands of love: for as the Philosopher relates (Polit. ii, 1),
    "Aristophanes stated that lovers would wish to be united both into one," but
    since "this would result in either one or both being destroyed," they seek a
    suitable and becoming union---to live together, speak together, and be
    united together in other like things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Knowledge is perfected by the thing
    known being united, through its likeness, to the knower. But the effect of
    love is that the thing itself which is loved, is, in a way, united to the
    lover, as stated above. Consequently the union caused by love is closer than
    that which is caused by knowledge.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether mutual indwelling is an effect of love?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that love does not cause mutual
    indwelling, so that the lover be in the beloved and vice versa. For that
    which is in another is contained in it. But the same cannot be container and
    contents. Therefore love cannot cause mutual indwelling, so that the lover
    be in the beloved and vice versa.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing can penetrate within a whole,
    except by means of a division of the whole. But it is the function of the
    reason, not of the appetite where love resides, to divide things that are
    really united. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if love involves the lover being in the
    beloved and vice versa, it follows that the beloved is united to the lover,
    in the same way as the lover is united to the beloved. But the union itself
    is love, as stated above (<a href="FS028.html#FSQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore it follows that the lover is always loved by the object of his
    love; which is evidently false. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect
    of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++4%3A16"
      >1 Jn. 4:16</a
    >): "He that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him." Now charity
    is the love of God. Therefore, for the same reason, every love makes the
    beloved to be in the lover, and vice versa.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This effect of mutual indwelling may be
    understood as referring both to the apprehensive and to the appetitive
    power. Because, as to the apprehensive power, the beloved is said to be in
    the lover, inasmuch as the beloved abides in the apprehension of the lover,
    according to Phil. 1:7, "For that I have you in my heart": while the lover
    is said to be in the beloved, according to apprehension, inasmuch as the
    lover is not satisfied with a superficial apprehension of the beloved, but
    strives to gain an intimate knowledge of everything pertaining to the
    beloved, so as to penetrate into his very soul. Thus it is written
    concerning the Holy Ghost, Who is God's Love, that He "searcheth all things,
    yea the deep things of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 2:10</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As the appetitive power, the object loved is said to be in the lover,
    inasmuch as it is in his affections, by a kind of complacency: causing him
    either to take pleasure in it, or in its good, when present; or, in the
    absence of the object loved, by his longing, to tend towards it with the
    love of concupiscence, or towards the good that he wills to the beloved,
    with the love of friendship: not indeed from any extrinsic cause (as when we
    desire one thing on account of another, or wish good to another on account
    of something else), but because the complacency in the beloved is rooted in
    the lover's heart. For this reason we speak of love as being "intimate"; and
    "of the bowels of charity." On the other hand, the lover is in the beloved,
    by the love of concupiscence and by the love of friendship, but not in the
    same way. For the love of concupiscence is not satisfied with any external
    or superficial possession or enjoyment of the beloved; but seeks to possess
    the beloved perfectly, by penetrating into his heart, as it were. Whereas,
    in the love of friendship, the lover is in the beloved, inasmuch as he
    reckons what is good or evil to his friend, as being so to himself; and his
    friend's will as his own, so that it seems as though he felt the good or
    suffered the evil in the person of his friend. Hence it is proper to friends
    "to desire the same things, and to grieve and rejoice at the same," as the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 3 and Rhet. ii, 4). Consequently in so far as
    he reckons what affects his friend as affecting himself, the lover seems to
    be in the beloved, as though he were become one with him: but in so far as,
    on the other hand, he wills and acts for his friend's sake as for his own
    sake, looking on his friend as identified with himself, thus the beloved is
    in the lover.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In yet a third way, mutual indwelling in the love of friendship can be
    understood in regard to reciprocal love: inasmuch as friends return love for
    love, and both desire and do good things for one another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The beloved is contained in the lover,
    by being impressed on his heart and thus becoming the object of his
    complacency. On the other hand, the lover is contained in the beloved,
    inasmuch as the lover penetrates, so to speak, into the beloved. For nothing
    hinders a thing from being both container and contents in different ways:
    just as a genus is contained in its species, and vice versa.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The apprehension of the reason precedes
    the movement of love. Consequently, just as the reason divides, so does the
    movement of love penetrate into the beloved, as was explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is true of the third kind
    of mutual indwelling, which is not to be found in every kind of love.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether ecstasy is an effect of love?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that ecstasy is not an effect of
    love. For ecstasy seems to imply loss of reason. But love does not always
    result in loss of reason: for lovers are masters of themselves at times.
    Therefore love does not cause ecstasy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the lover desires the beloved to be
    united to him. Therefore he draws the beloved to himself, rather than
    betakes himself into the beloved, going forth out from himself as it
    were.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, love unites the beloved to the lover, as
    stated above (<a href="FS028.html#FSQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). If,
    therefore, the lover goes out from himself, in order to betake himself into
    the beloved, it follows that the lover always loves the beloved more than
    himself: which is evidently false. Therefore ecstasy is not an effect of
    love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the
    Divine love produces ecstasy," and that "God Himself suffered ecstasy
    through love." Since therefore according to the same author (Div. Nom. iv),
    every love is a participated likeness of the Divine Love, it seems that
    every love causes ecstasy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To suffer ecstasy means to be placed outside
    oneself. This happens as to the apprehensive power and as to the appetitive
    power. As to the apprehensive power, a man is said to be placed outside
    himself, when he is placed outside the knowledge proper to him. This may be
    due to his being raised to a higher knowledge; thus, a man is said to suffer
    ecstasy, inasmuch as he is placed outside the connatural apprehension of his
    sense and reason, when he is raised up so as to comprehend things that
    surpass sense and reason: or it may be due to his being cast down into a
    state of debasement; thus a man may be said to suffer ecstasy, when he is
    overcome by violent passion or madness. As to the appetitive power, a man is
    said to suffer ecstasy, when that power is borne towards something else, so
    that it goes forth out from itself, as it were.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first of these ecstasies is caused by love dispositively in so far,
    namely, as love makes the lover dwell on the beloved, as stated above (<a
      href="FS028.html#FSQ28A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), and to dwell intently on one thing draws the mind from other things. The
    second ecstasy is caused by love directly; by love of friendship, simply; by
    love of concupiscence not simply but in a restricted sense. Because in love
    of concupiscence, the lover is carried out of himself, in a certain sense;
    in so far, namely, as not being satisfied with enjoying the good that he
    has, he seeks to enjoy something outside himself. But since he seeks to have
    this extrinsic good for himself, he does not go out from himself simply, and
    this movement remains finally within him. On the other hand, in the love of
    friendship, a man's affection goes out from itself simply; because he wishes
    and does good to his friend, by caring and providing for him, for his
    sake.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is true of the first kind
    of ecstasy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument applies to love of
    concupiscence, which, as stated above, does not cause ecstasy simply.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who loves, goes out from himself, in
    so far as he wills the good of his friend and works for it. Yet he does not
    will the good of his friend more than his own good: and so it does not
    follow that he loves another more than himself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether zeal is an effect of love?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that zeal is not an effect of love.
    For zeal is a beginning of contention; wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor+++3%3A3"
      >1 Cor. 3:3</a
    >): "Whereas there is among you zeal [Douay: 'envying'] and contention,"
    etc. But contention is incompatible with love. Therefore zeal is not an
    effect of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object of love is the good, which
    communicates itself to others. But zeal is opposed to communication; since
    it seems an effect of zeal, that a man refuses to share the object of his
    love with another: thus husbands are said to be jealous of [zelare] their
    wives, because they will not share them with others. Therefore zeal is not
    an effect of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is no zeal without hatred, as
    neither is there without love: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++72%3A3"
      >Ps. 72:3</a
    >): "I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked." Therefore it should not be set
    down as an effect of love any more than of hatred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): "God is said
    to be a zealot, on account of his great love for all things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Zeal, whatever way we take it, arises from the
    intensity of love. For it is evident that the more intensely a power tends
    to anything, the more vigorously it withstands opposition or resistance.
    Since therefore love is "a movement towards the object loved," as Augustine
    says (Questions. 83, qu. 35), an intense love seeks to remove everything
    that opposes it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this happens in different ways according to love of concupiscence, and
    love of friendship. For in love of concupiscence he who desires something
    intensely, is moved against all that hinders his gaining or quietly enjoying
    the object of his love. It is thus that husbands are said to be jealous of
    their wives, lest association with others prove a hindrance to their
    exclusive individual rights. In like manner those who seek to excel, are
    moved against those who seem to excel, as though these were a hindrance to
    their excelling. And this is the zeal of envy, of which it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++36%3A1"
      >Ps. 36:1</a
    >): "Be not emulous of evil doers, nor envy [zelaveris] them that work
    iniquity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, love of friendship seeks the friend's good: wherefore,
    when it is intense, it causes a man to be moved against everything that
    opposes the friend's good. In this respect, a man is said to be zealous on
    behalf of his friend, when he makes a point of repelling whatever may be
    said or done against the friend's good. In this way, too, a man is said to
    be zealous on God's behalf, when he endeavors, to the best of his means, to
    repel whatever is contrary to the honor or will of God; according to 3 Kgs.
    19:14: "With zeal I have been zealous for the Lord of hosts." Again on the
    words of Jn. 2:17: "The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up," a gloss says
    that "a man is eaten up with a good zeal, who strives to remedy whatever
    evil he perceives; and if he cannot, bears with it and laments it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking in this passage
    of the zeal of envy; which is indeed the cause of contention, not against
    the object of love, but for it, and against that which is opposed to it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Good is loved inasmuch as it can be
    communicated to the lover. Consequently whatever hinders the perfection of
    this communication, becomes hateful. Thus zeal arises from love of good. But
    through defect of goodness, it happens that certain small goods cannot, in
    their entirety, be possessed by many at the same time: and from the love of
    such things arises the zeal of envy. But it does not arise, properly
    speaking, in the case of those things which, in their entirety, can be
    possessed by many: for no one envies another the knowledge of truth, which
    can be known entirely by many; except perhaps one may envy another his
    superiority in the knowledge of it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The very fact that a man hates whatever
    is opposed to the object of his love, is the effect of love. Hence zeal is
    set down as an effect of love rather than of hatred.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether love is a passion that wounds the lover?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that love wounds the lover. For
    languor denotes a hurt in the one that languishes. But love causes languor:
    for it is written (Cant 2:5): "Stay me up with flowers, compass me about
    with apples; because I languish with love." Therefore love is a wounding
    passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, melting is a kind of dissolution. But
    love melts that in which it is: for it is written (Cant 5:6): "My soul
    melted when my beloved spoke." Therefore love is a dissolvent: therefore it
    is a corruptive and a wounding passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fervor denotes a certain excess of heat;
    which excess has a corruptive effect. But love causes fervor: for Dionysius
    (Coel. Hier. vii) in reckoning the properties belonging to the Seraphim's
    love, includes "hot" and "piercing" and "most fervent." Moreover it is said
    of love (Cant 8:6) that "its lamps are fire and flames." Therefore love is a
    wounding and corruptive passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that
    "everything loves itself with a love that holds it together," i.e. that
    preserves it. Therefore love is not a wounding passion, but rather one that
    preserves and perfects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1"
      >Question [26]</a
    >, <a href="FS026.html#FSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), love denotes a certain
    adapting of the appetitive power to some good. Now nothing is hurt by being
    adapted to that which is suitable to it; rather, if possible, it is
    perfected and bettered. But if a thing be adapted to that which is not
    suitable to it, it is hurt and made worse thereby. Consequently love of a
    suitable good perfects and betters the lover; but love of a good which is
    unsuitable to the lover, wounds and worsens him. Wherefore man is perfected
    and bettered chiefly by the love of God: but is wounded and worsened by the
    love of sin, according to Osee 9:10: "They became abominable, as those
    things which they loved."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And let this be understood as applying to love in respect of its formal
    element, i.e. in regard to the appetite. But in respect of the material
    element in the passion of love, i.e. a certain bodily change, it happens
    that love is hurtful, by reason of this change being excessive: just as it
    happens in the senses, and in every act of a power of the soul that is
    exercised through the change of some bodily organ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In reply to the objections, it is to be observed that four proximate effects
    may be ascribed to love: viz. melting, enjoyment, languor, and fervor. Of
    these the first is "melting," which is opposed to freezing. For things that
    are frozen, are closely bound together, so as to be hard to pierce. But it
    belongs to love that the appetite is fitted to receive the good which is
    loved, inasmuch as the object loved is in the lover, as stated above (<a
      href="FS028.html#FSQ28A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Consequently the freezing or hardening of the heart is a disposition
    incompatible with love: while melting denotes a softening of the heart,
    whereby the heart shows itself to be ready for the entrance of the beloved.
    If, then, the beloved is present and possessed, pleasure or enjoyment
    ensues. But if the beloved be absent, two passions arise; viz. sadness at
    its absence, which is denoted by "languor" (hence Cicero in De Tusc. Quaest.
    iii, 11 applies the term "ailment" chiefly to sadness); and an intense
    desire to possess the beloved, which is signified by "fervor." And these are
    the effects of love considered formally, according to the relation of the
    appetitive power to its object. But in the passion of love, other effects
    ensue, proportionate to the above, in respect of a change in the organ.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether love is cause of all that the lover does?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the lover does not do
    everything from love. For love is a passion, as stated above (<a
      href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1"
      >Question [26]</a
    >, <a href="FS026.html#FSQ26A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But man does not do
    everything from passion: but some things he does from choice, and some
    things from ignorance, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Therefore not everything
    that a man does, is done from love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the appetite is a principle of movement
    and action in all animals, as stated in De Anima iii, 10. If, therefore,
    whatever a man does is done from love, the other passions of the appetitive
    faculty are superfluous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is produced at one and the same
    time by contrary causes. But some things are done from hatred. Therefore all
    things are not done from love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "all
    things, whatever they do, they do for the love of good."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Every agent acts for an end, as stated above
    (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the end is the good
    desired and loved by each one. Wherefore it is evident that every agent,
    whatever it be, does every action from love of some kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection takes love as a passion
    existing in the sensitive appetite. But here we are speaking of love in a
    general sense, inasmuch as it includes intellectual, rational, animal, and
    natural love: for it is in this sense that Dionysius speaks of love in
    chapter iv of De Divinis Nominibus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS028.html#FSQ28A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >; <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) desire, sadness and
    pleasure, and consequently all the other passions of the soul, result from
    love. Wherefore every act proceeds from any passion, proceeds also from love
    as from a first cause: and so the other passions, which are proximate
    causes, are not superfluous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hatred also is a result of love, as we
    shall state further on (<a href="FS029.html#FSQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>,
    <a href="FS029.html#FSQ29A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
