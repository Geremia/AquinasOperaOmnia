<br>
OF THE ESSENCE OF LAW (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the extrinsic principles of acts. Now the 
extrinsic principle inclining to evil is the devil, of whose temptations 
we have spoken in the FP, Question [114]. But the extrinsic principle moving to 
good is God, Who both instructs us by means of His Law, and assists us by 
His Grace: wherefore in the first place we must speak of law; in the 
second place, of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] Out. Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning law, we must consider: (1) Law itself in general; (2) its 
parts. Concerning law in general three points offer themselves for our 
consideration: (1) Its essence; (2) The different kinds of law; (3) The 
effects of law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] Out. Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether law is something pertaining to reason?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">(2)</a> Concerning the end of law;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A3THEP1">(3)</a> Its cause;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A4THEP1">(4)</a> The promulgation of law.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether law is something pertaining to reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that law is not something pertaining to reason. For 
the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7%3A23">Rm. 7:23</a>): "I see another law in my members," etc. But 
nothing pertaining to reason is in the members; since the reason does not 
make use of a bodily organ. Therefore law is not something pertaining to 
reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the reason there is nothing else but power, habit, 
and act. But law is not the power itself of reason. In like manner, 
neither is it a habit of reason: because the habits of reason are the 
intellectual virtues of which we have spoken above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>). Nor again is 
it an act of reason: because then law would cease, when the act of reason 
ceases, for instance, while we are asleep. Therefore law is nothing 
pertaining to reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the law moves those who are subject to it to act aright. 
But it belongs properly to the will to move to act, as is evident from 
what has been said above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore law pertains, not to the 
reason, but to the will; according to the words of the Jurist (Lib. i, 
ff., De Const. Prin. leg. i): "Whatsoever pleaseth the sovereign, has 
force of law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It belongs to the law to command and to forbid. But it 
belongs to reason to command, as stated above (<A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore 
law is something pertaining to reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Law is a rule and measure of acts, whereby man is induced 
to act or is restrained from acting: for "lex" [law] is derived from 
"ligare" [to bind], because it binds one to act. Now the rule and measure 
of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts, 
as is evident from what has been stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3); since 
it belongs to the reason to direct to the end, which is the first 
principle in all matters of action, according to the Philosopher (Phys. 
ii). Now that which is the principle in any genus, is the rule and 
measure of that genus: for instance, unity in the genus of numbers, and 
the first movement in the genus of movements. Consequently it follows 
that law is something pertaining to reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since law is a kind of rule and measure, it may be in 
something in two ways. First, as in that which measures and rules: and 
since this is proper to reason, it follows that, in this way, law is in 
the reason alone. Secondly, as in that which is measured and ruled. In 
this way, law is in all those things that are inclined to something by 
reason of some law: so that any inclination arising from a law, may be 
called a law, not essentially but by participation as it were. And thus 
the inclination of the members to concupiscence is called "the law of the 
members."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as, in external action, we may consider the work and 
the work done, for instance the work of building and the house built; so 
in the acts of reason, we may consider the act itself of reason, i.e. to 
understand and to reason, and something produced by this act. With regard 
to the speculative reason, this is first of all the definition; secondly, 
the proposition; thirdly, the syllogism or argument. And since also the 
practical reason makes use of a syllogism in respect of the work to be 
done, as stated above (<A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FS076.html#FSQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="FS076.html#FSQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) and since as the 
Philosopher teaches (Ethic. vii, 3); hence we find in the practical 
reason something that holds the same position in regard to operations, 
as, in the speculative intellect, the proposition holds in regard to 
conclusions. Such like universal propositions of the practical intellect 
that are directed to actions have the nature of law. And these 
propositions are sometimes under our actual consideration, while 
sometimes they are retained in the reason by means of a habit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Reason has its power of moving from the will, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): for it is due to the fact that one wills the end, 
that the reason issues its commands as regards things ordained to the 
end. But in order that the volition of what is commanded may have the 
nature of law, it needs to be in accord with some rule of reason. And in 
this sense is to be understood the saying that the will of the sovereign 
has the force of law; otherwise the sovereign's will would savor of 
lawlessness rather than of law.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the law is always something directed to the common good? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the law is not always directed to the common 
good as to its end. For it belongs to law to command and to forbid. But 
commands are directed to certain individual goods. Therefore the end of 
the law is not always the common good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the law directs man in his actions. But human actions 
are concerned with particular matters. Therefore the law is directed to 
some particular good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. v, 3): "If the law is based on 
reason, whatever is based on reason will be a law." But reason is the 
foundation not only of what is ordained to the common good, but also of 
that which is directed private good. Therefore the law is not only 
directed to the good of all, but also to the private good of an 
individual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. v, 21) that "laws are enacted for 
no private profit, but for the common benefit of the citizens."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the law belongs to that which is 
a principle of human acts, because it is their rule and measure. Now as 
reason is a principle of human acts, so in reason itself there is 
something which is the principle in respect of all the rest: wherefore to 
this principle chiefly and mainly law must needs be referred. Now the 
first principle in practical matters, which are the object of the 
practical reason, is the last end: and the last end of human life is 
bliss or happiness, as stated above (<A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Consequently the law must needs regard principally the relationship to 
happiness. Moreover, since every part is ordained to the whole, as 
imperfect to perfect; and since one man is a part of the perfect 
community, the law must needs regard properly the relationship to 
universal happiness. Wherefore the Philosopher, in the above definition 
of legal matters mentions both happiness and the body politic: for he 
says (Ethic. v, 1) that we call those legal matters "just, which are 
adapted to produce and preserve happiness and its parts for the body 
politic": since the state is a perfect community, as he says in Polit. i, 
1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in every genus, that which belongs to it chiefly is the principle of 
the others, and the others belong to that genus in subordination to that 
thing: thus fire, which is chief among hot things, is the cause of heat 
in mixed bodies, and these are said to be hot in so far as they have a 
share of fire. Consequently, since the law is chiefly ordained to the 
common good, any other precept in regard to some individual work, must 
needs be devoid of the nature of a law, save in so far as it regards the 
common good. Therefore every law is ordained to the common good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A command denotes an application of a law to matters 
regulated by the law. Now the order to the common good, at which the law 
aims, is applicable to particular ends. And in this way commands are 
given even concerning particular matters. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Actions are indeed concerned with particular matters: but 
those particular matters are referable to the common good, not as to a 
common genus or species, but as to a common final cause, according as the 
common good is said to be the common end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as nothing stands firm with regard to the speculative 
reason except that which is traced back to the first indemonstrable 
principles, so nothing stands firm with regard to the practical reason, 
unless it be directed to the last end which is the common good: and 
whatever stands to reason in this sense, has the nature of a law.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the reason of any man is competent to make laws?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the reason of any man is competent to make 
laws. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++2%3A14">Rm. 2:14</a>) that "when the Gentiles, who have 
not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law . . . they are 
a law to themselves." Now he says this of all in general. Therefore 
anyone can make a law for himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1), "the intention 
of the lawgiver is to lead men to virtue." But every man can lead another 
to virtue. Therefore the reason of any man is competent to make laws.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the sovereign of a state governs the state, so 
every father of a family governs his household. But the sovereign of a 
state can make laws for the state. Therefore every father of a family can 
make laws for his household.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. v, 10): "A law is an ordinance of 
the people, whereby something is sanctioned by the Elders together with 
the Commonalty."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A law, properly speaking, regards first and foremost the 
order to the common good. Now to order anything to the common good, 
belongs either to the whole people, or to someone who is the viceregent 
of the whole people. And therefore the making of a law belongs either to 
the whole people or to a public personage who has care of the whole 
people: since in all other matters the directing of anything to the end 
concerns him to whom the end belongs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), a law is in a person not only 
as in one that rules, but also by participation as in one that is ruled. 
In the latter way each one is a law to himself, in so far as he shares 
the direction that he receives from one who rules him. Hence the same 
text goes on: "Who show the work of the law written in their hearts."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A private person cannot lead another to virtue 
efficaciously: for he can only advise, and if his advice be not  taken, 
it has no coercive power, such as the law should have, in order to prove 
an efficacious inducement to virtue, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 
9). But this coercive power is vested in the whole people or in some 
public personage, to whom it belongs to inflict penalties, as we shall 
state further on (<A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS064.html#SSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS064.html#SSQ64A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore the 
framing of laws belongs to him alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As one man is a part of the household, so a household is a 
part of the state: and the state is a perfect community, according to 
Polit. i, 1. And therefore, as the good of one man is not the last end, 
but is ordained to the common good; so too the good of one household is 
ordained to the good of a single state, which is a perfect community. 
Consequently he that governs a family, can indeed make certain commands 
or ordinances, but not such as to have properly the force of law.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether promulgation is essential to a law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that promulgation is not essential to a law. For 
the natural law above all has the character of law. But the natural law 
needs no promulgation. Therefore it is not essential to a law that it be 
promulgated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs properly to a law to bind one to do or not to 
do something. But the obligation of fulfilling a law touches not only 
those in whose presence it is promulgated, but also others. Therefore 
promulgation is not essential to a law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the binding force of a law extends even to the future, 
since "laws are binding in matters of the future," as the jurists say 
(Cod. 1, tit. De lege et constit. leg. vii). But promulgation concerns 
those who are present. Therefore it is not essential to a law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is laid down in the Decretals, dist. 4, that "laws 
are established when they are promulgated."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a law is imposed on others by way 
of a rule and measure. Now a rule or measure is imposed by being applied 
to those who are to be ruled and measured by it. Wherefore, in order that 
a law obtain the binding force which is proper to a law, it must needs be 
applied to the men who have to be ruled by it. Such application is made 
by its being notified to them by promulgation. Wherefore promulgation is 
necessary for the law to obtain its force.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus from the four preceding articles, the definition of law may be 
gathered; and it is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the 
common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural law is promulgated by the very fact that God 
instilled it into man's mind so as to be known by him  naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who are not present when a law is promulgated, are 
bound to observe the law, in so far as it is notified or can be notified 
to them by others, after it has been promulgated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[90] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The promulgation that takes place now, extends to future 
time by reason of the durability of written characters, by which means it 
is continually promulgated. Hence Isidore says (Etym. v, 3; ii, 10) that 
"lex [law] is derived from legere [to read] because it is written."<br>
