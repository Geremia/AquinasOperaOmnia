<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Old Law enjoined fitting precepts concerning rulers?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law made unfitting precepts concerning 
rulers. Because, as the Philosopher says (Polit. iii, 4), "the ordering 
of the people depends mostly on the chief ruler." But the Law contains no 
precept relating to the institution of the chief ruler; and yet we find 
therein prescriptions concerning the inferior rulers: firstly (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++18%3A21">Ex. 18:21</a>): "Provide out of all the people wise [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc.; 
again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++11%3A16">Num. 11:16</a>): "Gather unto Me seventy men of the ancients of 
Israel"; and again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt+++1%3A13">Dt.  1:13</a>): "Let Me have from among you wise and 
understanding men," etc. Therefore the Law provided insufficiently in 
regard to the rulers of the people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "The best gives of the best," as Plato states (Tim. ii). 
Now the best ordering of a state or of any nation is to be ruled by a 
king: because this kind of government approaches nearest in resemblance 
to the Divine government, whereby God rules the world from the beginning. 
Therefore the Law should have set a king over the people, and they should 
not have been allowed a choice in the matter, as indeed they were allowed 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A14,15">Dt. 17:14,15</a>): "When thou . . . shalt say: I will set a king over me . . 
. thou shalt set him," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Mt. 12:25: "Every kingdom divided against 
itself shall be made desolate": a saying which was verified in the Jewish 
people, whose destruction was brought about by the division of the 
kingdom. But the Law should aim chiefly at things pertaining to the 
general well-being of the people. Therefore it should have forbidden the 
kingdom to be divided under two kings: nor should this have been 
introduced even by Divine authority; as we read of its being introduced 
by the authority of the prophet Ahias the Silonite (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Kgs++11%3A29,+seqq+">3 Kgs. 11:29, seqq.</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as priests are instituted for the benefit of the 
people in things concerning God, as stated in Heb. 5:1; so are rulers set 
up for the benefit of the people in human affairs. But certain things 
were allotted as a means of livelihood for the priests and Levites of the 
Law: such as the tithes and first-fruits, and many like things. Therefore 
in like manner certain things should have been determined for the 
livelihood of the rulers of the people: the more that they were forbidden 
to accept presents, as is clearly stated in Ex. 23:8: "You shall not 
[Vulg.: 'Neither shalt thou'] take bribes, which even blind the wise, and 
pervert the words of the just."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as a kingdom is the best form of government, so is 
tyranny the most corrupt. But when the Lord appointed the king, He 
established a tyrannical law; for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++8%3A11">1 Kgs. 8:11</a>): "This will 
be the right of the king, that shall reign over you: He will take your 
sons," etc. Therefore the Law made unfitting provision with regard to the 
institution of rulers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The people of Israel is commended for the beauty of its 
order (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++24%3A5">Num. 24:5</a>): "How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy 
tents." But the beautiful ordering of a people depends on the right 
establishment of its rulers. Therefore the Law made right provision for 
the people with regard to its rulers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two points are to be observed concerning the right 
ordering of rulers in a state or nation. One is that all should take some 
share in the government: for this form of constitution ensures peace 
among the people, commends itself to  all, and is most enduring, as 
stated in Polit. ii, 6. The other point is to be observed in respect of 
the kinds of government, or the different ways in which the constitutions 
are established. For whereas these differ in kind, as the Philosopher 
states (Polit. iii, 5), nevertheless the first place is held by the 
"kingdom," where the power of government is vested in one; and 
"aristocracy," which signifies government by the best, where the power of 
government is vested in a few. Accordingly, the best form of government 
is in a state or kingdom, where one is given the power to preside over 
all; while under him are others having governing powers: and yet a 
government of this kind is shared by all, both because all are eligible 
to govern, and because the rules are chosen by all. For this is the best 
form of polity, being partly kingdom, since there is one at the head of 
all; partly aristocracy, in so far as a number of persons are set in 
authority; partly democracy, i.e. government by the people, in so far as 
the rulers can be chosen from the people, and the people have the right 
to choose their rulers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the form of government established by the Divine Law. For Moses 
and his successors governed the people in such a way that each of them 
was ruler over all; so that there was a kind of kingdom. Moreover, 
seventy-two men were chosen, who were elders in virtue: for it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++1%3A15">Dt. 1:15</a>): "I took out of your tribes wise and honorable, and appointed 
them rulers": so that there was an element of aristocracy. But it was a 
democratical government in so far as the rulers were chosen from all the 
people; for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++18%3A21">Ex. 18:21</a>): "Provide out of all the people 
wise [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc.; and, again, in so far as they were 
chosen by the people; wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++1%3A13">Dt. 1:13</a>): "Let me have 
from among you wise [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc. Consequently it is evident 
that the ordering of the rulers was well provided for by the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This people was governed under the special care of God: 
wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++7%3A6">Dt. 7:6</a>): "The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to 
be His peculiar people": and this is why the Lord reserved to Himself the 
institution of the chief ruler. For this too did Moses pray (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++27%3A16">Num. 27:16</a>): 
"May the Lord the God of the spirits of all the flesh provide a man, that 
may be over this multitude." Thus by God's orders Josue was set at the 
head in place of Moses; and we read about each of the judges who 
succeeded Josue that God "raised . . . up a saviour" for the people, and 
that "the spirit of the Lord was" in them (Jgs 3:9,10,15). Hence the Lord 
did not leave the choice of a king to the people; but reserved this to 
Himself, as appears from Dt. 17:15: "Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy 
God shall choose."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A kingdom is the best form of government of the people, so 
long as it is not corrupt. But since the power granted to a king is so 
great, it easily degenerates into tyranny, unless he to whom this power 
is given be a very virtuous man: for it is only the virtuous man that 
conducts himself well in the midst of prosperity, as the Philosopher 
observes (Ethic. iv, 3). Now perfect  virtue is to be found in few: and 
especially were the Jews inclined to cruelty and avarice, which vices 
above all turn men into tyrants. Hence from the very first the Lord did 
not set up the kingly authority with full power, but gave them judges and 
governors to rule them. But afterwards when the people asked Him to do 
so, being indignant with them, so to speak, He granted them a king, as is 
clear from His words to Samuel (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++8%3A7">1 Kgs. 8:7</a>): "They have not rejected 
thee, but Me, that I should not reign over them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, as regards the appointment of a king, He did establish the 
manner of election from the very beginning (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A14,+seqq+">Dt. 17:14, seqq.</a>): and then 
He determined two points: first, that in choosing a king they should wait 
for the Lord's decision; and that they should not make a man of another 
nation king, because such kings are wont to take little interest in the 
people they are set over, and consequently to have no care for their 
welfare: secondly, He prescribed how the king after his appointment 
should behave, in regard to himself; namely, that he should not 
accumulate chariots and horses, nor wives, nor immense wealth: because 
through craving for such things princes become tyrants and forsake 
justice. He also appointed the manner in which they were to conduct 
themselves towards God: namely, that they should continually read and 
ponder on God's Law, and should ever fear and obey God. Moreover, He 
decided how they should behave towards their subjects: namely, that they 
should not proudly despise them, or ill-treat them, and that they should 
not depart from the paths of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The division of the kingdom, and a number of kings, was 
rather a punishment inflicted on that people for their many dissensions, 
specially against the just rule of David, than a benefit conferred on 
them for their profit. Hence it is written (Osee 13:11): "I will give 
thee a king in My wrath"; and (Osee 8:4): "They have reigned, but not by 
Me: they have been princes, and I knew not."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The priestly office was bequeathed by succession from 
father to son: and this, in order that it might be held in greater 
respect, if not any man from the people could become a priest: since 
honor was given to them out of reverence for the divine worship. Hence it 
was necessary to put aside certain things for them both as to tithes and 
as to first-fruits, and, again, as to oblations and sacrifices, that they 
might be afforded a means of livelihood. On the other hand, the rulers, 
as stated above, were chosen from the whole people; wherefore they had 
their own possessions, from which to derive a living: and so much the 
more, since the Lord forbade even a king to have superabundant wealth to 
make too much show of magnificence: both because he could scarcely avoid 
the excesses of pride and tyranny, arising from such things, and because, 
if the rulers were not very rich, and if their office involved much work 
and anxiety, it would not tempt the ambition of the common people; and 
would not become an occasion of sedition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> That right was not given to the king by Divine institution: 
rather was it foretold that kings would usurp that  right, by framing 
unjust laws, and by degenerating into tyrants who preyed on their 
subjects. This is clear from the context that follows: "And you shall be 
his slaves [Douay: 'servants']": which is significative of tyranny, since 
a tyrant rules is subjects as though they were his slaves. Hence Samuel 
spoke these words to deter them from asking for a king; since the 
narrative continues: "But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel." 
It may happen, however, that even a good king, without being a tyrant, 
may take away the sons, and make them tribunes and centurions; and may 
take many things from his subjects in order to secure the common weal.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judicial precepts were suitably framed as to the relations of one man with another?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts were not suitably framed 
as regards the relations of one man with another. Because men cannot live 
together in peace, if one man takes what belongs to another. But this 
seems to have been approved by the Law: since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A24">Dt. 23:24</a>): 
"Going into thy neighbor's vineyard, thou mayest eat as many grapes as 
thou pleasest." Therefore the Old Law did not make suitable provisions 
for man's peace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one of the chief causes of the downfall of states has 
been the holding of property by women, as the Philosopher says (Polit. 
ii, 6). But this was introduced by the Old Law; for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++27%3A8">Num. 27:8</a>): "When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his 
daughter." Therefore the Law made unsuitable provision for the welfare of 
the people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is most conducive to the preservation of human 
society that men may provide themselves with necessaries by buying and 
selling, as stated in Polit. i. But the Old Law took away the force of 
sales; since it prescribes that in the 50th year of the jubilee all that 
is sold shall return to the vendor (Lev. 25:28). Therefore in this matter 
the Law gave the people an unfitting command.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man's needs require that men should be ready to lend: 
which readiness ceases if the creditors do not return the pledges: hence 
it is written (Ecclus. 29:10): "Many have refused to lend, not out of 
wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause." And yet 
this was encouraged by the Law. First, because it prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++15%3A2">Dt. 15:2</a>): 
"He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbor or brother, 
cannot demand it again, because it is the year of remission of the Lord"; 
and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A15">Ex. 22:15</a>) it is stated that if a borrowed animal should die while 
the owner is present, the borrower is not bound to make restitution. 
Secondly, because the security acquired through the pledge is lost: for 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A10">Dt. 24:10</a>): "When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor any 
thing that he oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a 
pledge"; and again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A12,13">Dt. 24:12,13</a>): "The pledge shall not lodge with thee 
that night, but thou shalt restore it to  him presently." Therefore the 
Law made insufficient provision in the matter of loans.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, considerable risk attaches to goods deposited with a 
fraudulent depositary: wherefore great caution should be observed in such 
matters: hence it is stated in 2 Mach 3:15 that "the priests . . . called 
upon Him from heaven, Who made the law concerning things given to be 
kept, that He would preserve them safe, for them that had deposited 
them." But the precepts of the Old Law observed little caution in regard 
to deposits: since it is prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A10,11">Ex. 22:10,11</a>) that when goods 
deposited are lost, the owner is to stand by the oath of the depositary. 
Therefore the Law made unsuitable provision in this matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, just as a workman offers his work for hire, so do men 
let houses and so forth. But there is no need for the tenant to pay his 
rent as soon as he takes a house. Therefore it seems an unnecessarily 
hard prescription (Lev. 19:13) that "the wages of him that hath been 
hired by thee shall not abide with thee until morning."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, since there is often pressing need for a judge, it 
should be easy to gain access to one. It was therefore unfitting that the 
Law (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A8,9">Dt. 17:8,9</a>) should command them to go to a fixed place to ask for 
judgment on doubtful matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, it is possible that not only two, but three or more, 
should agree to tell a lie. Therefore it is unreasonably stated (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++19%3A15">Dt. 19:15</a>) that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall 
stand."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, punishment should be fixed according to the gravity of 
the fault: for which reason also it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25%3A2">Dt. 25:2</a>): "According to 
the measure of the sin, shall the measure also of the stripes be." Yet 
the Law fixed unequal punishments for certain faults: for it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A1">Ex. 22:1</a>) that the thief "shall restore five oxen for one ox, and four 
sheep for one sheep." Moreover, certain slight offenses are severely 
punished: thus (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++15%3A32,+seqq+">Num. 15:32, seqq.</a>) a man is stoned for gathering sticks 
on the sabbath day: and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A18,+seqq+">Dt. 21:18, seqq.</a>) the unruly son is commanded to 
be stoned on account of certain small transgressions, viz. because "he 
gave himself to revelling . . . and banquetings." Therefore the Law 
prescribed punishments in an unreasonable manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 10 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b>: Further, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 11), "Tully writes 
that the laws recognize eight forms of punishment, indemnity, prison, 
stripes, retaliation, public disgrace, exile, death, slavery." Now some 
of these were prescribed by the Law. "Indemnity," as when a thief was 
condemned to make restitution fivefold or fourfold. "Prison," as when 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++15%3A34">Num. 15:34</a>) a certain man is ordered to be imprisoned. "Stripes"; thus 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25%3A2">Dt. 25:2</a>), "if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes; they 
shall lay him down, and shall cause him to be beaten before them." 
"Public disgrace" was brought on to him who refused to take to himself 
the  wife of his deceased brother, for she took "off his shoe from his 
foot, and" did "spit in his face" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25%3A9">Dt. 25:9</a>). It prescribed the "death" 
penalty, as is clear from (Lev. 20:9): "He that curseth his father, or 
mother, dying let him die." The Law also recognized the "lex talionis," 
by prescribing (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A24">Ex. 21:24</a>): "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth." Therefore it 
seems unreasonable that the Law should not have inflicted the two other 
punishments, viz. "exile" and "slavery."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 11 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b>: Further, no punishment is due except for a fault. But dumb 
animals cannot commit a fault. Therefore the Law is unreasonable in 
punishing them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A29">Ex. 21:29</a>): "If the ox . . . shall kill a man or a 
woman," it "shall be stoned": and (Lev. 20:16): "The woman that shall lie 
under any beast, shall be killed together with the same." Therefore it 
seems that matters pertaining to the relations of one man with another 
were unsuitably regulated by the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 12 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b>: Further, the Lord commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A12">Ex. 21:12</a>) a murderer to be 
punished with death. But the death of a dumb animal is reckoned of much 
less account than the slaying of a man. Hence murder cannot be 
sufficiently punished by the slaying of a dumb animal. Therefore it is 
unfittingly prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A1,4">Dt. 21:1,4</a>) that "when there shall be found . . . 
the corpse of a man slain, and it is not known who is guilty of the 
murder . . . the ancients" of the nearest city "shall take a heifer of 
the herd, that hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground, and 
they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that never was 
ploughed, nor sown; and there they shall strike off the head of the 
heifer."<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is recalled as a special blessing (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++147%3A20">Ps. 147:20</a>) that 
"He hath not done in like manner to every nation; and His judgments He 
hath not made manifest to them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21), quoting Tully, "a 
nation is a body of men united together by consent to the law and by 
community of welfare." Consequently it is of the essence of a nation that 
the mutual relations of the citizens be ordered by just laws. Now the 
relations of one man with another are twofold: some are effected under 
the guidance of those in authority: others are effected by the will of 
private individuals. And since whatever is subject to the power of an 
individual can be disposed of according to his will, hence it is that the 
decision of matters between one man and another, and the punishment of 
evildoers, depend on the direction of those in authority, to whom men are 
subject. On the other hand, the power of private persons is exercised 
over the things they possess: and consequently their dealings with one 
another, as regards such things, depend on their own will, for instance 
in buying, selling, giving, and so forth. Now the Law provided 
sufficiently in respect of each of these relations between one man and 
another. For it established judges, as is clearly indicated in Dt. 16:18: 
"Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all its [Vulg.: 'thy'] 
gates . . . that they may judge the people with just judgment." It is 
also directed the  manner of pronouncing just judgments, according to Dt. 
1:16,17: "Judge that which is just, whether he be one of your own country 
or a stranger: there shall be no difference of persons." It also removed 
an occasion of pronouncing unjust judgment, by forbidding judges to 
accept bribes (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++23%3A8;+Dt++16:19">Ex. 23:8; Dt. 16:19</a>). It prescribed the number of 
witnesses, viz. two or three: and it appointed certain punishments to 
certain crimes, as we shall state farther on (ad 10).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But with regard to possessions, it is a very good thing, says the 
Philosopher (Polit. ii, 2) that the things possessed should be distinct, 
and the use thereof should be partly common, and partly granted to others 
by the will of the possessors. These three points were provided for by 
the Law. Because, in the first place, the possessions themselves were 
divided among individuals: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++33%3A53,54">Num. 33:53,54</a>): "I have 
given you" the land "for a possession: and you shall divide it among you 
by lot." And since many states have been ruined through want of 
regulations in the matter of possessions, as the Philosopher observes 
(Polit. ii, 6); therefore the Law provided a threefold remedy against the 
regularity of possessions. The first was that they should be divided 
equally, wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++33%3A54">Num. 33:54</a>): "To the more you shall 
give a larger part, and to the fewer, a lesser." A second remedy was that 
possessions could not be alienated for ever, but after a certain lapse of 
time should return to their former owner, so as to avoid confusion of 
possessions (cf. ad 3). The third remedy aimed at the removal of this 
confusion, and provided that the dead should be succeeded by their next 
of kin: in the first place, the son; secondly, the daughter; thirdly, the 
brother; fourthly, the father's brother; fifthly, any other next of kin. 
Furthermore, in order to preserve the distinction of property, the Law 
enacted that heiresses should marry within their own tribe, as recorded 
in Num. 36:6.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Law commanded that, in some respects, the use of things 
should belong to all in common. Firstly, as regards the care of them; for 
it was prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++22%3A1-4">Dt. 22:1-4</a>): "Thou shalt not pass by, if thou seest 
thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray; but thou shalt bring them back 
to thy brother," and in like manner as to other things. Secondly, as 
regards fruits. For all alike were allowed on entering a friend's 
vineyard to eat of the fruit, but not to take any away. And, specially, 
with respect to the poor, it was prescribed that the forgotten sheaves, 
and the bunches of grapes and fruit, should be left behind for them (Lev. 
19:9; Dt. 24:19). Moreover, whatever grew in the seventh year was common 
property, as stated in Ex. 23:11 and Lev. 25:4.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the law recognized the transference of goods by the owner. 
There was a purely gratuitous transfer: thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++14%3A28,29">Dt. 14:28,29</a>): "The third day thou shalt separate another tithe . . . and the 
Levite . . . and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow . . . 
shall come and shall eat and be filled." And there was a transfer for a 
consideration, for instance, by selling and buying, by letting out and 
hiring, by loan and also by deposit,  concerning all of which we find 
that the Law made ample provision. Consequently it is clear that the Old 
Law provided sufficiently concerning the mutual relations of one man with 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13%3A8">Rm. 13:8</a>), "he that loveth his 
neighbor hath fulfilled the Law": because, to wit, all the precepts of 
the Law, chiefly those concerning our neighbor, seem to aim at the end 
that men should love one another. Now it is an effect of love that men 
give their own goods to others: because, as stated in 1 Jn. 3:17: "He 
that . . . shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels 
from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?" Hence the purpose of 
the Law was to accustom men to give of their own to others readily: thus 
the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++6%3A18">1 Tim. 6:18</a>) commands the rich "to give easily and to 
communicate to others." Now a man does not give easily to others if he 
will not suffer another man to take some little thing from him without 
any great injury to him. And so the Law laid down that it should be 
lawful for a man, on entering his neighbor's vineyard, to eat of the 
fruit there: but not to carry any away, lest this should lead to the 
infliction of a grievous harm, and cause a disturbance of the peace: for 
among well-behaved people, the taking of a little does not disturb the 
peace; in fact, it rather strengthens friendship and accustoms men to 
give things to one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Law did not prescribe that women should succeed to 
their father's estate except in default of male issue: failing which it 
was necessary that succession should be granted to the female line in 
order to comfort the father, who would have been sad to think that his 
estate would pass to strangers. Nevertheless the Law observed due caution 
in the matter, by providing that those women who succeeded to their 
father's estate, should marry within their own tribe, in order to avoid 
confusion of tribal possessions, as stated in Num. 36:7,8.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Polit. ii, 4), the regulation of 
possessions conduces much to the preservation of a state or nation. 
Consequently, as he himself observes, it was forbidden by the law in some 
of the heathen states, "that anyone should sell his possessions, except 
to avoid a manifest loss." For if possessions were to be sold 
indiscriminately, they might happen to come into the hands of a few: so 
that it might become necessary for a state or country to become void of 
inhabitants. Hence the Old Law, in order to remove this danger, ordered 
things in such a way that while provision was made for men's needs, by 
allowing the sale of possessions to avail for a certain period, at the 
same time the said danger was removed, by prescribing the return of those 
possessions after that period had elapsed. The reason for this law was to 
prevent confusion of possessions, and to ensure the continuance of a 
definite distinction among the tribes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the town houses were not allotted to distinct estates, therefore 
the Law allowed them to be sold in perpetuity, like movable goods. 
Because the number of houses in a town was not fixed, whereas there was a 
fixed limit to the amount of estates,  which could not be exceeded, while 
the number of houses in a town could be increased. On the other hand, 
houses situated not in a town, but "in a village that hath no walls," 
could not be sold in perpetuity: because such houses are built merely 
with a view to the cultivation and care of possessions; wherefore the Law 
rightly made the same prescription in regard to both (Lev. 25).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above (ad 1), the purpose of the Law was to 
accustom men to its precepts, so as to be ready to come to one another's 
assistance: because this is a very great incentive to friendship. The Law 
granted these facilities for helping others in the matter not only of 
gratuitous and absolute donations, but also of mutual transfers: because 
the latter kind of succor is more frequent and benefits the greater 
number: and it granted facilities for this purpose in many ways. First of 
all by prescribing that men should be ready to lend, and that they should 
not be less inclined to do so as the year of remission drew nigh, as 
stated in Dt. 15:7, seqq. Secondly, by forbidding them to burden a man to 
whom they might grant a loan, either by exacting usury, or by accepting 
necessities of life in security; and by prescribing that when this had 
been done they should be restored at once. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A19">Dt. 23:19</a>): 
"Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury": and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A6">Dt. 24:6</a>): 
"Thou shalt not take the nether nor the upper millstone to pledge; for he 
hath pledged his life to thee": and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A26">Ex. 22:26</a>): "If thou take of thy 
neighbor a garment in pledge, thou shalt give it him again before 
sunset." Thirdly, by forbidding them to be importunate in exacting 
payment. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A25">Ex. 22:25</a>): "If thou lend money to any of 
my people that is poor that dwelleth with thee, thou shalt not be hard 
upon them as an extortioner." For this reason, too, it is enacted (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A10,11">Dt. 24:10,11</a>): "When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor anything that he oweth 
thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge, but thou 
shalt stand without, and he shall bring out to thee what he hath": both 
because a man's house is his surest refuge, wherefore it is offensive to 
a man to be set upon in his own house; and because the Law does not allow 
the creditor to take away whatever he likes in security, but rather 
permits the debtor to give what he needs least. Fourthly, the Law 
prescribed that debts should cease together after the lapse of seven 
years. For it was probable that those who could conveniently pay their 
debts, would do so before the seventh year, and would not defraud the 
lender without cause. But if they were altogether insolvent, there was 
the same reason for remitting the debt from love for them, as there was 
for renewing the loan on account of their need.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards animals granted in loan, the Law enacted that if, through the 
neglect of the person to whom they were lent, they perished or 
deteriorated in his absence, he was bound to make restitution. But if 
they perished or deteriorated while he was present and taking proper care 
of them, he was not bound to make restitution, especially if they were 
hired for a consideration: because they might have died or deteriorated 
in the same way if they had remained in possession of the lender, so that 
if the animal had been saved through being lent, the lender would have  
gained something by the loan which would no longer have been gratuitous. 
And especially was this to be observed when animals were hired for a 
consideration: because then the owner received a certain price for the 
use of the animals; wherefore he had no right to any profit, by receiving 
indemnity for the animal, unless the person who had charge of it were 
negligent. In the case, however, of animals not hired for a 
consideration, equity demanded that he should receive something by way of 
restitution at least to the value of the hire of the animal that had 
perished or deteriorated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The difference between a loan and a deposit is that a loan 
is in respect of goods transferred for the use of the person to whom they 
are transferred, whereas a deposit is for the benefit of the depositor. 
Hence in certain cases there was a stricter obligation of returning a 
loan than of restoring goods held in deposit. Because the latter might be 
lost in two ways. First, unavoidably: i.e. either through a natural 
cause, for instance if an animal held in deposit were to die or 
depreciate in value; or through an extrinsic cause, for instance, if it 
were taken by an enemy, or devoured by a beast (in which case, however, a 
man was bound to restore to the owner what was left of the animal thus 
slain): whereas in the other cases mentioned above, he was not bound to 
make restitution; but only to take an oath in order to clear himself of 
suspicion. Secondly, the goods deposited might be lost through an 
avoidable cause, for instance by theft: and then the depositary was bound 
to restitution on account of his neglect. But, as stated above (ad 4), he 
who held an animal on loan, was bound to restitution, even if he were 
absent when it depreciated or died: because he was held responsible for 
less negligence than a depositary, who was only held responsible in case 
of theft.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Workmen who offer their labor for hire, are poor men who 
toil for their daily bread: and therefore the Law commanded wisely that 
they should be paid at once, lest they should lack food. But they who 
offer other commodities for hire, are wont to be rich: nor are they in 
such need of their price in order to gain a livelihood: and consequently 
the comparison does not hold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The purpose for which judges are appointed among men, is 
that they may decide doubtful points in matters of justice. Now a matter 
may be doubtful in two ways. First, among simple-minded people: and in 
order to remove doubts of this kind, it was prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++16%3A18">Dt. 16:18</a>) that 
"judges and magistrates" should be appointed in each tribe, "to judge the 
people with just judgment." Secondly, a matter may be doubtful even among 
experts: and therefore, in order to remove doubts of this kind, the Law 
prescribed that all should foregather in some chief place chosen by God, 
where there would be both the high-priest, who would decide doubtful 
matters relating to the ceremonies of divine worship; and the chief judge 
of the people, who would decide matters relating to the judgments of men: 
just as even now cases are taken from a lower to a higher court either by 
appeal or by consultation. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A8,9">Dt. 17:8,9</a>): "If thou 
perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful matter in judgment . 
. . and thou see that the  words of the judges within thy gates do vary; 
arise and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and 
thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to the judge 
that shall be at that time." But such like doubtful matters did not often 
occur for judgment: wherefore the people were not burdened on this 
account.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 8 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> In the business affairs of men, there is no such thing as 
demonstrative and infallible proof, and we must be content with a certain 
conjectural probability, such as that which an orator employs to 
persuade. Consequently, although it is quite possible for two or three 
witnesses to agree to a falsehood, yet it is neither easy nor probable 
that they succeed in so doing: wherefore their testimony is taken as 
being true, especially if they do not waver in giving it, or are not 
otherwise suspect. Moreover, in order that witnesses might not easily 
depart from the truth, the Law commanded that they should be most 
carefully examined, and that those who were found untruthful should be 
severely punished, as stated in Dt. 19:16, seqq.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 8 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was, however, a reason for fixing on this particular number, in 
token of the unerring truth of the Divine Persons, Who are sometimes 
mentioned as two, because the Holy Ghost is the bond of the other two 
Persons; and sometimes as three: as Augustine observes on Jn. 8:17: "In 
your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 9 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> A severe punishment is inflicted not only on account of the 
gravity of a fault, but also for other reasons. First, on account of the 
greatness of the sin, because a greater sin, other things being equal, 
deserves a greater punishment. Secondly, on account of a habitual sin, 
since men are not easily cured of habitual sin except by severe 
punishments. Thirdly, on account of a great desire for or a great 
pleasure in the sin: for men are not easily deterred from such sins 
unless they be severely punished. Fourthly, on account of the facility of 
committing a sin and of concealing it: for such like sins, when 
discovered, should be more severely punished in order to deter others 
from committing them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 9 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, with regard to the greatness of a sin, four degrees may be 
observed, even in respect of one single deed. The first is when a sin is 
committed unwillingly; because then, if the sin be altogether 
involuntary, man is altogether excused from punishment; for it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++22%3A25,+seqq+">Dt. 22:25, seqq.</a>) that a damsel who suffers violence in a field is not 
guilty of death, because "she cried, and there was no man to help her." 
But if a man sinned in any way voluntarily, and yet through weakness, as 
for instance when a man sins from passion, the sin is diminished: and the 
punishment, according to true judgment, should be diminished also; unless 
perchance the common weal requires that the sin be severely punished in 
order to deter others from committing such sins, as stated above. The 
second degree is when a man sins through ignorance: and then he was held 
to be guilty to a certain extent,  on account of his negligence in 
acquiring knowledge: yet he was not punished by the judges but expiated 
his sin by sacrifices. Hence it is written (Lev. 4:2): "The soul that 
sinneth through ignorance," etc. This is, however, to be taken as 
applying to ignorance of fact; and not to ignorance of the Divine 
precept, which all were bound to know. The third degree was when a man 
sinned from pride, i.e. through deliberate choice or malice: and then he 
was punished according to the greatness of the sin [*Cf. Dt. 25:2]. The 
fourth degree was when a man sinned from stubbornness or obstinacy: and 
then he was to be utterly cut off as a rebel and a destroyer of the 
commandment of the Law [*Cf. Num. 15:30,31].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 9 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly we must say that, in appointing the punishment for theft, 
the Law considered what would be likely to happen most frequently (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A1-9">Ex. 22:1-9</a>): wherefore, as regards theft of other things which can easily be 
safeguarded from a thief, the thief restored only twice their value. But 
sheep cannot be easily safeguarded from a thief, because they graze in 
the fields: wherefore it happened more frequently that sheep were stolen 
in the fields. Consequently the Law inflicted a heavier penalty, by 
ordering four sheep to be restored for the theft of one. As to cattle, 
they were yet more difficult to safeguard, because they are kept in the 
fields, and do not graze in flocks as sheep do; wherefore a yet more 
heavy penalty was inflicted in their regard, so that five oxen were to be 
restored for one ox. And this I say, unless perchance the animal itself 
were discovered in the thief's possession: because in that case he had to 
restore only twice the number, as in the case of other thefts: for there 
was reason to presume that he intended to restore the animal, since he 
kept it alive. Again, we might say, according to a gloss, that "a cow is 
useful in five ways: it may be used for sacrifice, for ploughing, for 
food, for milk, and its hide is employed for various purposes": and 
therefore for one cow five had to be restored. But the sheep was useful 
in four ways: "for sacrifice, for meat, for milk, and for its wool." The 
unruly son was slain, not because he ate and drank: but on account of his 
stubbornness and rebellion, which was always punished by death, as stated 
above. As to the man who gathered sticks on the sabbath, he was stoned as 
a breaker of the Law, which commanded the sabbath to be observed, to 
testify the belief in the newness of the world, as stated above (<A Href="FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>, <A Href="FS100.html#FSQ100A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>): wherefore he was slain as an unbeliever.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 10 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>: The Old Law inflicted the death penalty for the more 
grievous crimes, viz. for those which are committed against God, and for 
murder, for stealing a man, irreverence towards one's parents, adultery 
and incest. In the case of thief of other things it inflicted punishment 
by indemnification: while in the case of blows and mutilation it 
authorized punishment by retaliation; and likewise for the sin of bearing 
false witness. In other faults of less degree it prescribed the 
punishment of stripes or of public disgrace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 10 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The punishment of slavery was prescribed by the Law in two cases. First, 
in the case of a slave who was unwilling to avail  himself of the 
privilege granted by the Law, whereby he was free to depart in the 
seventh year of remission: wherefore he was punished by remaining a slave 
for ever. Secondly, in the case of a thief, who had not wherewith to make 
restitution, as stated in Ex. 22:3.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 10 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The punishment of absolute exile was not prescribed by the Law: because 
God was worshipped by that people alone, whereas all other nations were 
given to idolatry: wherefore if any man were exiled from that people 
absolutely, he would be in danger of falling into idolatry. For this 
reason it is related (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++26%3A19">1 Kgs. 26:19</a>) that David said to Saul: "They are 
cursed in the sight of the Lord, who have case me out this day, that I 
should not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve 
strange gods." There was, however, a restricted sort of exile: for it is 
written in Dt. 19:4 [*Cf. Num. 35:25] that "he that striketh [Vulg.: 
'killeth'] his neighbor ignorantly, and is proved to have had no hatred 
against him, shall flee to one of the cities" of refuge and "abide there 
until the death of the high-priest." For then it became lawful for him to 
return home, because when the whole people thus suffered a loss they 
forgot their private quarrels, so that the next of kin of the slain were 
not so eager to kill the slayer.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>: Dumb animals were ordered to be slain, not on account of 
any fault of theirs; but as a punishment to their owners, who had not 
safeguarded their beasts from these offenses. Hence the owner was more 
severely punished if his ox had butted anyone "yesterday or the day 
before" (in which case steps might have been taken to butting suddenly). 
Or again, the animal was slain in detestation of the sin; and lest men 
should be horrified at the sight thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 12 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>: The literal reason for this commandment, as Rabbi Moses 
declares (Doct. Perplex. iii), was because the slayer was frequently from 
the nearest city: wherefore the slaying of the calf was a means of 
investigating the hidden murder. This was brought about in three ways. In 
the first place the elders of the city swore that they had taken every 
measure for safeguarding the roads. Secondly, the owner of the heifer was 
indemnified for the slaying of his beast, and if the murder was 
previously discovered, the beast was not slain. Thirdly, the place, where 
the heifer was slain, remained uncultivated. Wherefore, in order to avoid 
this twofold loss, the men of the city would readily make known the 
murderer, if they knew who he was: and it would seldom happen but that 
some word or sign would escape about the matter. Or again, this was done 
in order to frighten people, in detestation of murder. Because the 
slaying of a heifer, which is a useful animal and full of strength, 
especially before it has been put under the yoke, signified that whoever 
committed murder, however useful and strong he might be, was to forfeit 
his life; and that, by a cruel death, which was implied by the striking 
off of its head; and that the murderer, as vile and abject, was to be cut 
off from the fellowship of men, which was betokened by the fact that the 
heifer after being slain was left to rot in a rough and uncultivated 
place. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 12 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mystically, the heifer taken from the herd signifies the flesh of 
Christ; which had not drawn a yoke, since it had done no sin; nor did it 
plough the ground, i.e. it never knew the stain of revolt. The fact of 
the heifer being killed in an uncultivated valley signified the despised 
death of Christ, whereby all sins are washed away, and the devil is shown 
to be the arch-murderer.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judicial precepts regarding foreigners were framed in a suitable manner?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts regarding foreigners 
were not suitably framed. For Peter said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+10%3A34,35">Acts 10:34,35</a>): "In very deed I 
perceive that God is not a respecter of persons, but in every nation, he 
that feareth Him and worketh justice is acceptable to Him." But those who 
are acceptable to God should not be excluded from the Church of God. 
Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A3">Dt. 23:3</a>) that "the Ammonite and 
the Moabite, even after the tenth generation, shall not enter into the 
church of the Lord for ever": whereas, on the other hand, it is 
prescribed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A7">Dt. 23:7</a>) to be observed with regard to certain other 
nations: "Thou shalt not abhor the Edomite, because he is thy brother; 
nor the Egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we do not deserve to be punished for those things which 
are not in our power. But it is not in man's power to be an eunuch, or 
born of a prostitute. Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A1,2">Dt. 23:1,2</a>) 
that "an eunuch and one born of a prostitute shalt not enter into the 
church of the Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Old Law mercifully forbade strangers to be molested: 
for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A21">Ex. 22:21</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger, nor 
afflict him; for yourselves also were strangers in the land of Egypt": 
and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++23%3A9">Ex. 23:9</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a stranger, for you know the 
hearts of strangers, for you also were strangers in the land of Egypt." 
But it is an affliction to be burdened with usury. Therefore the Law 
unsuitably permitted them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A19,20">Dt. 23:19,20</a>) to lend money to the stranger 
for usury.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, men are much more akin to us than trees. But we should 
show greater care and love for these things that are nearest to us, 
according to Ecclus. 13:19: "Every beast loveth its like: so also every 
man him that is nearest to himself." Therefore the Lord unsuitably 
commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++20%3A13-19">Dt. 20:13-19</a>) that all the inhabitants of a captured hostile 
city were to be slain, but that the fruit-trees should not be cut down.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every one should prefer the common good of virtue to the 
good of the individual. But the common good is sought in a war which men 
fight against their enemies. Therefore it is unsuitably commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++20%3A5-7">Dt. 20:5-7</a>) that certain men should be sent home, for instance a man that had 
built a new house, or who had planted a vineyard, or who had married a 
wife. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, no man should profit by his own fault. But it is a man's 
fault if he be timid or faint-hearted: since this is contrary to the 
virtue of fortitude. Therefore the timid and faint-hearted are 
unfittingly excused from the toil of battle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++20%3A8">Dt. 20:8</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Divine Wisdom declares (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++8%3A8">Prov. 8:8</a>): "All my words are 
just, there is nothing wicked nor perverse in them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man's relations with foreigners are twofold: peaceful, 
and hostile: and in directing both kinds of relation the Law contained 
suitable precepts. For the Jews were offered three opportunities of 
peaceful relations with foreigners. First, when foreigners passed through 
their land as travelers. Secondly, when they came to dwell in their land 
as newcomers. And in both these respects the Law made kind provision in 
its precepts: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A21">Ex. 22:21</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a 
stranger [advenam]"; and again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A9">Ex. 22:9</a>): "Thou shalt not molest a 
stranger [peregrino]." Thirdly, when any foreigners wished to be admitted 
entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. With regard to these a 
certain order was observed. For they were not at once admitted to 
citizenship: just as it was law with some nations that no one was deemed 
a citizen except after two or three generations, as the Philosopher says 
(Polit. iii, 1). The reason for this was that if foreigners were allowed 
to meddle with the affairs of a nation as soon as they settled down in 
its midst, many dangers might occur, since the foreigners not yet having 
the common good firmly at heart might attempt something hurtful to the 
people. Hence it was that the Law prescribed in respect of certain 
nations that had close relations with the Jews (viz., the Egyptians among 
whom they were born and educated, and the Idumeans, the children of Esau, 
Jacob's brother), that they should be admitted to the fellowship of the 
people after the third generation; whereas others (with whom their 
relations had been hostile, such as the Ammonites and Moabites) were 
never to be admitted to citizenship; while the Amalekites, who were yet 
more hostile to them, and had no fellowship of kindred with them, were to 
be held as foes in perpetuity: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++17%3A16">Ex. 17:16</a>): "The war of 
the Lord shall be against Amalec from generation to generation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner with regard to hostile relations with foreigners, the Law 
contained suitable precepts. For, in the first place, it commanded that 
war should be declared for a just cause: thus it is commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++20%3A10">Dt. 20:10</a>) 
that when they advanced to besiege a city, they should at first make an 
offer of peace. Secondly, it enjoined that when once they had entered on 
a war they should undauntedly persevere in it, putting their trust in 
God. And in order that they might be the more heedful of this command, it 
ordered that on the approach of battle the priest should hearten them by 
promising them God's aid. Thirdly, it prescribed the removal of whatever 
might prove an obstacle to the fight, and that certain men, who might be 
in the way, should be sent home. Fourthly, it enjoined that they should 
use moderation in pursuing  the advantage of victory, by sparing women 
and children, and by not cutting down fruit-trees of that country.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Law excluded the men of no nation from the worship of 
God and from things pertaining to the welfare of the soul: for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++12%3A48">Ex. 12:48</a>): "If any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and 
to keep the Phase of the Lord; all his males shall first be circumcised, 
and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner, and he shall be 
as that which is born in the land." But in temporal matters concerning 
the public life of the people, admission was not granted to everyone at 
once, for the reason given above: but to some, i.e. the Egyptians and 
Idumeans, in the third generation; while others were excluded in 
perpetuity, in detestation of their past offense, i.e. the peoples of 
Moab, Ammon, and Amalec. For just as one man is punished for a sin 
committed by him, in order that others seeing this may be deterred and 
refrain from sinning; so too may one nation or city be punished for a 
crime, that others may refrain from similar crimes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless it was possible by dispensation for a man to be admitted to 
citizenship on account of some act of virtue: thus it is related (Judith 
14:6) that Achior, the captain of the children of Ammon, "was joined to 
the people of Israel, with all the succession of his kindred." The same 
applies to Ruth the Moabite who was "a virtuous woman" (Ruth 3:11): 
although it may be said that this prohibition regarded men and not women, 
who are not competent to be citizens absolutely speaking.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Polit. iii, 3), a man is said to 
be a citizen in two ways: first, simply; secondly, in a restricted sense. 
A man is a citizen simply if he has all the rights of citizenship, for 
instance, the right of debating or voting in the popular assembly. On the 
other hand, any man may be called citizen, only in a restricted sense, if 
he dwells within the state, even common people or children or old men, 
who are not fit to enjoy power in matters pertaining to the common weal. 
For this reason bastards, by reason of their base origin, were excluded 
from the "ecclesia," i.e. from the popular assembly, down to the tenth 
generation. The same applies to eunuchs, who were not competent to 
receive the honor due to a father, especially among the Jews, where the 
divine worship was continued through carnal generation: for even among 
the heathens, those who had many children were marked with special honor, 
as the Philosopher remarks (Polit. ii, 6). Nevertheless, in matters 
pertaining to the grace of God, eunuchs were not discriminated from 
others, as neither were strangers, as already stated: for it is written 
(Iss 56:3): "Let not the son of the stranger that adhereth to the Lord 
speak, saying: The Lord will divide and separate me from His people. And 
let not the eunuch say: Behold I am a dry tree."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It was not the intention of the Law to sanction the 
acceptance of usury from strangers, but only to tolerate it on account of 
the proneness of the Jews to avarice; and in order to promote an amicable 
feeling towards those out of whom they made a  profit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A distinction was observed with regard to hostile cities. 
For some of them were far distant, and were not among those which had 
been promised to them. When they had taken these cities, they killed all 
the men who had fought against God's people; whereas the women and 
children were spared. But in the neighboring cities which had been 
promised to them, all were ordered to be slain, on account of their 
former crimes, to punish which God sent the Israelites as executor of 
Divine justice: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++9%3A5">Dt. 9:5</a>) "because they have done 
wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in." The fruit-trees were 
commanded to be left untouched, for the use of the people themselves, to 
whom the city with its territory was destined to be subjected.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The builder of a new house, the planter of a vineyard, the 
newly married husband, were excluded from fighting, for two reasons. 
First, because man is wont to give all his affection to those things 
which he has lately acquired, or is on the point of having, and 
consequently he is apt to dread the loss of these above other things. 
Wherefore it was likely enough that on account of this affection they 
would fear death all the more, and be so much the less brave in battle. 
Secondly, because, as the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 5), "it is a 
misfortune for a man if he is prevented from obtaining something good 
when it is within his grasp." And so lest the surviving relations should 
be the more grieved at the death of these men who had not entered into 
the possession of the good things prepared for them; and also lest the 
people should be horror-stricken at the sight of their misfortune: these 
men were taken away from the danger of death by being removed from the 
battle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The timid were sent back home, not that they might be the 
gainers thereby; but lest the people might be the losers by their 
presence, since their timidity and flight might cause others to be afraid 
and run away.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Old Law set forth suitable precepts about the members of the household?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law set forth unsuitable precepts 
about the members of the household. For a slave "is in every respect his 
master's property," as the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 2). But that 
which is a man's property should be his always. Therefore it was 
unfitting for the Law to command (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A2">Ex. 21:2</a>) that slaves should "go out 
free" in the seventh year.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a slave is his master's property, just as an animal, 
e.g. an ass or an ox. But it is commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++22%3A1-3">Dt. 22:1-3</a>) with regard to 
animals, that they should be brought back to the owner if they be found 
going astray. Therefore it was unsuitably commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++23%3A15">Dt. 23:15</a>): "Thou 
shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to thee." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Divine Law should encourage mercy more even than the 
human law. But according to human laws those who ill-treat their servants 
and maidservants are severely punished: and the worse treatment of all 
seems to be that which results in death. Therefore it is unfittingly 
commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A20,21">Ex. 21:20,21</a>) that "he that striketh his bondman or bondwoman 
with a rod, and they die under his hands . . . if the party remain alive 
a day . . . he shall not be subject to the punishment, because it is his 
money."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the dominion of a master over his slave differs from 
that of the father over his son (Polit. i, 3). But the dominion of master 
over slave gives the former the right to sell his servant or maidservant. 
Therefore it was unfitting for the Law to allow a man to sell his 
daughter to be a servant or handmaid (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A7">Ex. 21:7</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a father has power over his son. But he who has power 
over the sinner has the right to punish him for his offenses. Therefore 
it is unfittingly commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A18,+seqq+">Dt. 21:18, seqq.</a>) that a father should bring 
his son to the ancients of the city for punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the Lord forbade them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++7%3A3,+seqq+">Dt. 7:3, seqq.</a>) to make marriages 
with strange nations; and commanded the dissolution of such as had been 
contracted (1 Esdras 10). Therefore it was unfitting to allow them to 
marry captive women from strange nations (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A10,+seqq+">Dt. 21:10, seqq.</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, the Lord forbade them to marry within certain degrees of 
consanguinity and affinity, according to Lev. 18. Therefore it was 
unsuitably commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25%3A5">Dt. 25:5</a>) that if any man died without issue, his 
brother should marry his wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, as there is the greatest familiarity between man and 
wife, so should there be the staunchest fidelity. But this is impossible 
if the marriage bond can be sundered. Therefore it was unfitting for the 
Lord to allow (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A1-4">Dt. 24:1-4</a>) a man to put his wife away, by writing a bill 
of divorce; and besides, that he could not take her again to wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Obj. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, just as a wife can be faithless to her husband, so can a 
slave be to his master, and a son to his father. But the Law did not 
command any sacrifice to be offered in order to investigate the injury 
done by a servant to his master, or by a son to his father. Therefore it 
seems to have been superfluous for the Law to prescribe the "sacrifice of 
jealousy" in order to investigate a wife's adultery (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++5%3A12,+seqq+">Num. 5:12, seqq.</a>). 
Consequently it seems that the Law put forth unsuitable judicial precepts 
about the members of the household.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++18%3A10">Ps. 18:10</a>): "The judgments of the Lord 
are true, justified in themselves."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The mutual relations of the members of a household regard 
everyday actions directed to the necessities of life, as the Philosopher 
states (Polit. i, 1). Now the preservation of man's life may be 
considered from two points of view. First, from the point of view of the 
individual, i.e. in so far as man preserves his individuality: and for 
the purpose of the preservation of life, considered from this standpoint, 
man has at his service external goods, by means of which he provides 
himself with food and clothing and other such necessaries of life: in the 
handling of which he has need of servants. Secondly man's life is 
preserved from the point of view of the species, by means of generation, 
for which purpose man needs a wife, that she may bear him children. 
Accordingly the mutual relations of the members of a household admit of a 
threefold combination: viz. those of master and servant, those of husband 
and wife, and those of father and son: and in respect of all these 
relationships the Old Law contained fitting precepts. Thus, with regard 
to servants, it commanded them to be treated with moderation---both as to 
their work, lest, to wit, they should be burdened with excessive labor, 
wherefore the Lord commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++5%3A14">Dt. 5:14</a>) that on the Sabbath day "thy 
manservant and thy maidservant" should "rest even as thyself"---and also 
as to the infliction of punishment, for it ordered those who maimed their 
servants, to set them free (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A26,27">Ex. 21:26,27</a>). Similar provision was made in 
favor of a maidservant when married to anyone (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A7,+seqq+">Ex. 21:7, seqq.</a>). 
Moreover, with regard to those servants in particular who were taken from 
among the people, the Law prescribed that they should go out free in the 
seventh year taking whatever they brought with them, even their clothes 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21%3A2,+seqq+">Ex. 21:2, seqq.</a>): and furthermore it was commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++15%3A13">Dt. 15:13</a>) that they 
should be given provision for the journey.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to wives the Law made certain prescriptions as to those who 
were to be taken in marriage: for instance, that they should marry a wife 
from their own tribe (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++36%3A6">Num. 36:6</a>): and this lest confusion should ensue in 
the property of various tribes. Also that a man should marry the wife of 
his deceased brother when the latter died without issue, as prescribed in 
Dt. 25:5,6: and this in order that he who could not have successors 
according to carnal origin, might at least have them by a kind of 
adoption, and that thus the deceased might not be entirely forgotten. It 
also forbade them to marry certain women; to wit, women of strange 
nations, through fear of their losing their faith; and those of their 
near kindred, on account of the natural respect due to them. Furthermore 
it prescribed in what way wives were to be treated after marriage. To 
wit, that they should not be slandered without grave reason: wherefore it 
ordered punishment to be inflicted on the man who falsely accused his 
wife of a crime (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++22%3A13,+seqq+">Dt. 22:13, seqq.</a>). Also that a man's hatred of his wife 
should not be detrimental to his son (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A15,+seqq+">Dt. 21:15, seqq.</a>). Again, that a 
man should not ill-use his wife through hatred of her, but rather that he 
should write a bill of divorce and send her away (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++24%3A1">Dt. 24:1</a>). Furthermore, 
in order to foster conjugal love from the very outset, it was prescribed 
that no public duties should be laid on a recently married man, so that 
he might be free to rejoice with his wife. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to children, the Law commanded parents to educate them by 
instructing them in the faith: hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++12%3A26,+seqq+">Ex. 12:26, seqq.</a>): 
"When your children shall say to you: What is the meaning of this 
service? You shall say to them: It is the victim of the passage of the 
Lord." Moreover, they are commanded to teach them the rules of right 
conduct: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++21%3A20">Dt. 21:20</a>) that the parents had to say: 
"He slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling and 
to debauchery."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the children of Israel had been delivered by the Lord 
from slavery, and for this reason were bound to the service of God, He 
did not wish them to be slaves in perpetuity. Hence it is written (Lev. 
25:39, seqq.): "If thy brother, constrained by poverty, sell himself to 
thee, thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants: but he 
shall be as a hireling and a sojourner . . . for they are My servants, 
and I brought them out of the land of Egypt: let them not be sold as 
bondmen": and consequently, since they were slaves, not absolutely but in 
a restricted sense, after a lapse of time they were set free.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This commandment is to be understood as referring to a 
servant whom his master seeks to kill, or to help him in committing some 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> With regard to the ill-treatment of servants, the Law seems 
to have taken into consideration whether it was certain or not: since if 
it were certain, the Law fixed a penalty: for maiming, the penalty was 
forfeiture of the servant, who was ordered to be given his liberty: while 
for slaying, the punishment was that of a murderer, when the slave died 
under the blow of his master. If, however, the hurt was not certain, but 
only probable, the Law did not impose any penalty as regards a man's own 
servant: for instance if the servant did not die at once after being 
struck, but after some days: for it would be uncertain whether he died as 
a result of the blows he received. For when a man struck a free man, yet 
so that he did not die at once, but "walked abroad again upon his staff," 
he that struck him was quit of murder, even though afterwards he died. 
Nevertheless he was bound to pay the doctor's fees incurred by the victim 
of his assault. But this was not the case if a man killed his own 
servant: because whatever the servant had, even his very person, was the 
property of his master. Hence the reason for his not being subject to a 
pecuniary penalty is set down as being "because it is his money."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above (ad 1), no Jew could own a Jew as a slave 
absolutely: but only in a restricted sense, as a hireling for a fixed 
time. And in this way the Law permitted that through stress of poverty a 
man might sell his son or daughter. This is shown by the very words of 
the Law, where we read: "If any man sell his daughter to be a servant, 
she shall not go out as bondwomen are wont to go out." Moreover, in this 
way a man might sell not only his son, but even himself, rather as a 
hireling than as a slave,  according to Lev. 25:39,40: "If thy brother, 
constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee, thou shalt not oppress him 
with the service of bondservants: but he shall be as a hireling and a 
sojourner."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 9), the paternal 
authority has the power only of admonition; but not that of coercion, 
whereby rebellious and headstrong persons can be compelled. Hence in this 
case the Lord commanded the stubborn son to be punished by the rulers of 
the city.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The Lord forbade them to marry strange women on account of 
the danger of seduction, lest they should be led astray into idolatry. 
And specially did this prohibition apply with respect to those nations 
who dwelt near them, because it was more probable that they would adopt 
their religious practices. When, however, the woman was willing to 
renounce idolatry, and become an adherent of the Law, it was lawful to 
take her in marriage: as was the case with Ruth whom Booz married. 
Wherefore she said to her mother-in-law (Ruth 1:16): "Thy people shall be 
my people, and thy God my God." Accordingly it was not permitted to marry 
a captive woman unless she first shaved her hair, and pared her nails, 
and put off the raiment wherein she was taken, and mourned for her father 
and mother, in token that she renounced idolatry for ever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. xlviii super Matth.), "because 
death was an unmitigated evil for the Jews, who did everything with a 
view to the present life, it was ordained that children should be born to 
the dead man through his brother: thus affording a certain mitigation to 
his death. It was not, however, ordained that any other than his brother 
or one next of kin should marry the wife of the deceased, because" the 
offspring of this union "would not be looked upon as that of the 
deceased: and moreover, a stranger would not be under the obligation to 
support the household of the deceased, as his brother would be bound to 
do from motives of justice on account of his relationship." Hence it is 
evident that in marrying the wife of his dead brother, he took his dead 
brother's place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> The Law permitted a wife to be divorced, not as though it 
were just absolutely speaking, but on account of the Jews' hardness of 
heart, as Our Lord declared (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++19%3A8">Mt. 19:8</a>). Of this, however, we must speak 
more fully in the treatise on Matrimony (SP, <A Href="FS067.html#FSQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[105] A[4] R.O. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> Wives break their conjugal faith by adultery, both easily, 
for motives of pleasure, and hiddenly, since "the eye of the adulterer 
observeth darkness" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+24%3A15">Job 24:15</a>). But this does not apply to a son in 
respect of his father, or to a servant in respect of his master: because 
the latter infidelity is not the result of the lust of pleasure, but 
rather of malice: nor can it remain hidden like the infidelity of an 
adulterous woman.<br>
