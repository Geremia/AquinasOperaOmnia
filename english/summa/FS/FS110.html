    OF THE GRACE OF GOD AS REGARDS ITS ESSENCE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the grace of God as regards its essence; and under this
    head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS110.html#FSQ110A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether grace implies something
    in the soul?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FS110.html#FSQ110A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether grace is a quality?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS110.html#FSQ110A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether grace differs from
    infused virtue?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FS110.html#FSQ110A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the subject of grace.</p>

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether grace implies anything in the soul?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that grace does not imply anything
    in the soul. For man is said to have the grace of God even as the grace of
    man. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++39%3A21"
      >Gn. 39:21</a
    >) that the Lord gave to Joseph "grace [Douay: 'favor'] in the sight of the
    chief keeper of the prison." Now when we say that a man has the favor of
    another, nothing is implied in him who has the favor of the other, but an
    acceptance is implied in him whose favor he has. Hence when we say that a
    man has the grace of God, nothing is implied in his soul; but we merely
    signify the Divine acceptance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the soul quickens the body so does
    God quicken the soul; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++30%3A20"
      >Dt. 30:20</a
    >): "He is thy life." Now the soul quickens the body immediately. Therefore
    nothing can come as a medium between God and the soul. Hence grace implies
    nothing created in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on Rm. 1:7, "Grace to you and peace,"
    the gloss says: "Grace, i.e. the remission of sins." Now the remission of
    sin implies nothing in the soul, but only in God, Who does not impute the
    sin, according to Ps. 31:2: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not
    imputed sin." Hence neither does grace imply anything in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Light implies something in what is
    enlightened. But grace is a light of the soul; hence Augustine says (De
    Natura et Gratia xxii): "The light of truth rightly deserts the prevaricator
    of the law, and those who have been thus deserted become blind." Therefore
    grace implies something in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the common manner of speech, grace
    is usually taken in three ways. First, for anyone's love, as we are
    accustomed to say that the soldier is in the good graces of the king, i.e.
    the king looks on him with favor. Secondly, it is taken for any gift freely
    bestowed, as we are accustomed to say: I do you this act of grace. Thirdly,
    it is taken for the recompense of a gift given "gratis," inasmuch as we are
    said to be "grateful" for benefits. Of these three the second depends on the
    first, since one bestows something on another "gratis" from the love
    wherewith he receives him into his good "graces." And from the second
    proceeds the third, since from benefits bestowed "gratis" arises
    "gratitude."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now as regards the last two, it is clear that grace implies something in him
    who receives grace: first, the gift given gratis; secondly, the
    acknowledgment of the gift. But as regards the first, a difference must be
    noted between the grace of God and the grace of man; for since the
    creature's good springs from the Divine will, some good in the creature
    flows from God's love, whereby He wishes the good of the creature. On the
    other hand, the will of man is moved by the good pre-existing in things; and
    hence man's love does not wholly cause the good of the thing, but
    pre-supposes it either in part or wholly. Therefore it is clear that every
    love of God is followed at some time by a good caused in the creature, but
    not co-eternal with the eternal love. And according to this difference of
    good the love of God to the creature is looked at differently. For one is
    common, whereby He loves "all things that are" (Wis. 11:25), and thereby
    gives things their natural being. But the second is a special love, whereby
    He draws the rational creature above the condition of its nature to a
    participation of the Divine good; and according to this love He is said to
    love anyone simply, since it is by this love that God simply wishes the
    eternal good, which is Himself, for the creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly when a man is said to have the grace of God, there is signified
    something bestowed on man by God. Nevertheless the grace of God sometimes
    signifies God's eternal love, as we say the grace of predestination,
    inasmuch as God gratuitously and not from merits predestines or elects some;
    for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A5"
      >Eph. 1:5</a
    >): "He hath predestinated us into the adoption of children... unto the
    praise of the glory of His grace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even when a man is said to be in
    another's good graces, it is understood that there is something in him
    pleasing to the other; even as anyone is said to have God's grace---with
    this difference, that what is pleasing to a man in another is presupposed to
    his love, but whatever is pleasing to God in a man is caused by the Divine
    love, as was said above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is the life of the soul after the
    manner of an efficient cause; but the soul is the life of the body after the
    manner of a formal cause. Now there is no medium between form and matter,
    since the form, of itself, "informs" the matter or subject; whereas the
    agent "informs" the subject, not by its substance, but by the form, which it
    causes in the matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 25): "When I
    said that grace was for the remission of sins, and peace for our
    reconciliation with God, you must not take it to mean that peace and
    reconciliation do not pertain to general peace, but that the special name of
    grace signifies the remission of sins." Not only grace, therefore, but many
    other of God's gifts pertain to grace. And hence the remission of sins does
    not take place without some effect divinely caused in us, as will appear
    later (<a href="FS113.html#FSQ113OUTP1">Question [113]</a>,

  <h3 align="left">Whether grace is a quality of the soul?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that grace is not a quality of the
    soul. For no quality acts on its subject, since the action of a quality is
    not without the action of its subject, and thus the subject would
    necessarily act upon itself. But grace acts upon the soul, by justifying it.
    Therefore grace is not a quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Furthermore, substance is nobler than quality.
    But grace is nobler than the nature of the soul, since we can do many things
    by grace, to which nature is not equal, as stated above (<a
      href="FS109.html#FSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="FS109.html#FSQ109ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3). Therefore grace
    is not a quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Furthermore, no quality remains after it has
    ceased to be in its subject. But grace remains; since it is not corrupted,
    for thus it would be reduced to nothing, since it was created from nothing;
    hence it is called a "new creature"(<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++6%3A15"
      >Gal. 6:15</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> on Ps. 103:15: "That he may make the face
    cheerful with oil"; the gloss says: "Grace is a certain beauty of soul,
    which wins the Divine love." But beauty of soul is a quality, even as beauty
    of body. Therefore grace is a quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS110.html#FSQ110A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), there is understood to be an effect of God's gratuitous will in whoever
    is said to have God's grace. Now it was stated (<a
      href="FS109.html#FSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="FS109.html#FSQ109A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that man is aided by
    God's gratuitous will in two ways: first, inasmuch as man's soul is moved by
    God to know or will or do something, and in this way the gratuitous effect
    in man is not a quality, but a movement of the soul; for "motion is the act
    of the mover in the moved." Secondly, man is helped by God's gratuitous
    will, inasmuch as a habitual gift is infused by God into the soul; and for
    this reason, that it is not fitting that God should provide less for those
    He loves, that they may acquire supernatural good, than for creatures, whom
    He loves that they may acquire natural good. Now He so provides for natural
    creatures, that not merely does He move them to their natural acts, but He
    bestows upon them certain forms and powers, which are the principles of
    acts, in order that they may of themselves be inclined to these movements,
    and thus the movements whereby they are moved by God become natural and easy
    to creatures, according to Wis. 8:1: "she... ordereth all things sweetly."
    Much more therefore does He infuse into such as He moves towards the
    acquisition of supernatural good, certain forms or supernatural qualities,
    whereby they may be moved by Him sweetly and promptly to acquire eternal
    good; and thus the gift of grace is a quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Grace, as a quality, is said to act upon
    the soul, not after the manner of an efficient cause, but after the manner
    of a formal cause, as whiteness makes a thing white, and justice, just.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every substance is either the nature of
    the thing whereof it is the substance or is a part of the nature, even as
    matter and form are called substance. And because grace is above human
    nature, it cannot be a substance or a substantial form, but is an accidental
    form of the soul. Now what is substantially in God, becomes accidental in
    the soul participating the Divine goodness, as is clear in the case of
    knowledge. And thus because the soul participates in the Divine goodness
    imperfectly, the participation of the Divine goodness, which is grace, has
    its being in the soul in a less perfect way than the soul subsists in
    itself. Nevertheless, inasmuch as it is the expression or participation of
    the Divine goodness, it is nobler than the nature of the soul, though not in
    its mode of being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Boethius [*Pseudo-Bede, Sent. Phil.
    ex Artist] says, the "being of an accident is to inhere." Hence no accident
    is called being as if it had being, but because by it something is; hence it
    is said to belong to a being rather to be a being (Metaph. vii, text. 2).
    And because to become and to be corrupted belong to what is, properly
    speaking, no accident comes into being or is corrupted, but is said to come
    into being and to be corrupted inasmuch as its subject begins or ceases to
    be in act with this accident. And thus grace is said to be created inasmuch
    as men are created with reference to it, i.e. are given a new being out of
    nothing, i.e. not from merits, according to Eph. 2:10, "created in Jesus
    Christ in good works."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether grace is the same as virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that grace is the same as virtue.
    For Augustine says (De Spir. et Lit. xiv) that "operating grace is faith
    that worketh by charity." But faith that worketh by charity is a virtue.
    Therefore grace is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what fits the definition, fits the
    defined. But the definitions of virtue given by saints and philosophers fit
    grace, since "it makes its subject good, and his work good," and "it is a
    good quality of the mind, whereby we live righteously," etc. Therefore grace
    is virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, grace is a quality. Now it is clearly
    not in the "fourth" species of quality; viz. "form" which is the "abiding
    figure of things," since it does not belong to bodies. Nor is it in the
    "third," since it is not a "passion nor a passion-like quality," which is in
    the sensitive part of the soul, as is proved in Physic. viii; and grace is
    principally in the mind. Nor is it in the "second" species, which is
    "natural power" or "impotence"; since grace is above nature and does not
    regard good and evil, as does natural power. Therefore it must be in the
    "first" species which is "habit" or "disposition." Now habits of the mind
    are virtues; since even knowledge itself is a virtue after a manner, as
    stated above (<a href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>,
    <a href="FS057.html#FSQ57ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore grace is the
    same as virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> If grace is a virtue, it would seem before
    all to be one of the three theological virtues. But grace is neither faith
    nor hope, for these can be without sanctifying grace. Nor is it charity,
    since "grace foreruns charity," as Augustine says in his book on the
    Predestination of the Saints (De Dono Persev. xvi). Therefore grace is not
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some held that grace and virtue were identical
    in essence, and differed only logically---in the sense that we speak of
    grace inasmuch as it makes man pleasing to God, or is given
    gratuitously---and of virtue inasmuch as it empowers us to act rightly. And
    the Master seems to have thought this (Sent. ii, D 27).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if anyone rightly considers the nature of virtue, this cannot hold,
    since, as the Philosopher says (Physic. vii, text. 17), "virtue is
    disposition of what is perfect---and I call perfect what is disposed
    according to its nature." Now from this it is clear that the virtue of a
    thing has reference to some pre-existing nature, from the fact that
    everything is disposed with reference to what befits its nature. But it is
    manifest that the virtues acquired by human acts of which we spoke above (<a
      href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, seqq.) are dispositions, whereby a man is fittingly disposed with
    reference to the nature whereby he is a man; whereas infused virtues dispose
    man in a higher manner and towards a higher end, and consequently in
    relation to some higher nature, i.e. in relation to a participation of the
    Divine Nature, according to 2 Pt. 1:4: "He hath given us most great and most
    precious promises; that by these you may be made partakers of the Divine
    Nature." And it is in respect of receiving this nature that we are said to
    be born again sons of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And thus, even as the natural light of reason is something besides the
    acquired virtues, which are ordained to this natural light, so also the
    light of grace which is a participation of the Divine Nature is something
    besides the infused virtues which are derived from and are ordained to this
    light, hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A8"
      >Eph. 5:8</a
    >): "For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then
    as children of the light." For as the acquired virtues enable a man to walk,
    in accordance with the natural light of reason, so do the infused virtues
    enable a man to walk as befits the light of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine calls "faith that worketh by
    charity" grace, since the act of faith of him that worketh by charity is the
    first act by which sanctifying grace is manifested.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Good is placed in the definition of
    virtue with reference to its fitness with some pre-existing nature essential
    or participated. Now good is not attributed to grace in this manner, but as
    to the root of goodness in man, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Grace is reduced to the first species of
    quality; and yet it is not the same as virtue, but is a certain disposition
    which is presupposed to the infused virtues, as their principle and root.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether grace is in the essence of the soul as in a subject, or in one of
    the powers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that grace is not in the essence of
    the soul, as in a subject, but in one of the powers. For Augustine says
    (Hypognosticon iii [*Among the spurious works of St. Augustine]) that grace
    is related to the will or to the free will "as a rider to his horse." Now
    the will or the free will is a power, as stated above (<a href="../FP.html"
      >FP</a
    >, <a href="../FP/FP083.html#FPQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP083.html#FPQ83A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence grace is in
    a power of the soul, as in a subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Man's merit springs from grace" as
    Augustine says (De Gratia et Lib. Arbit. vi). Now merit consists in acts,
    which proceed from a power. Hence it seems that grace is a perfection of a
    power of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the essence of the soul is the proper
    subject of grace, the soul, inasmuch as it has an essence, must be capable
    of grace. But this is false; since it would follow that every soul would be
    capable of grace. Therefore the essence of the soul is not the proper
    subject of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the essence of the soul is prior to its
    powers. Now what is prior may be understood without what is posterior. Hence
    it follows that grace may be taken to be in the soul, although we suppose no
    part or power of the soul---viz. neither the will, nor the intellect, nor
    anything else; which is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> By grace we are born again sons of God. But
    generation terminates at the essence prior to the powers. Therefore grace is
    in the soul's essence prior to being in the powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This question depends on the preceding. For if
    grace is the same as virtue, it must necessarily be in the powers of the
    soul as in a subject; since the soul's powers are the proper subject of
    virtue, as stated above (<a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But if grace differs
    from virtue, it cannot be said that a power of the soul is the subject of
    grace, since every perfection of the soul's powers has the nature of virtue,
    as stated above (<a href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it remains that
    grace, as it is prior to virtue, has a subject prior to the powers of the
    soul, so that it is in the essence of the soul. For as man in his
    intellective powers participates in the Divine knowledge through the virtue
    of faith, and in his power of will participates in the Divine love through
    the virtue of charity, so also in the nature of the soul does he participate
    in the Divine Nature, after the manner of a likeness, through a certain
    regeneration or re-creation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As from the essence of the soul flows
    its powers, which are the principles of deeds, so likewise the virtues,
    whereby the powers are moved to act, flow into the powers of the soul from
    grace. And thus grace is compared to the will as the mover to the moved,
    which is the same comparison as that of a horseman to the horse---but not as
    an accident to a subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And thereby is made clear the Reply to the Second Objection. For grace is
    the principle of meritorious works through the medium of virtues, as the
    essence of the soul is the principal of vital deeds through the medium of
    the powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The soul is the subject of grace, as
    being in the species of intellectual or rational nature. But the soul is not
    classed in a species by any of its powers, since the powers are natural
    properties of the soul following upon the species. Hence the soul differs
    specifically in its essence from other souls, viz. of dumb animals, and of
    plants. Consequently it does not follow that, if the essence of the human
    soul is the subject of grace, every soul may be the subject of grace; since
    it belongs to the essence of the soul, inasmuch as it is of such a
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since the powers of the soul are natural
    properties following upon the species, the soul cannot be without them. Yet,
    granted that it was without them, the soul would still be called
    intellectual or rational in its species, not that it would actually have
    these powers, but on account of the essence of such a species, from which
    these powers naturally flow.<br />
