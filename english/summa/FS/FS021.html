<H3 Align="Center">OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN ACTIONS BY REASON OF THEIR GOODNESS AND MALICE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the consequences of human actions by reason of 
their goodness and malice: and under this head there are four points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a human action is right or sinful by reason of its being 
good or evil?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it thereby deserves praise or blame?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether accordingly, it is meritorious or demeritorious?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is accordingly meritorious or demeritorious before God?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a human action is not right or sinful, in so far as 
it is good or evil. For "monsters are the sins of nature" (Phys. ii, 8). 
But monsters are not actions, but things engendered outside the order of 
nature. Now things that are produced according to art and reason imitate 
those that are produced according to nature (Phys. ii, 8). Therefore an 
action is not sinful by reason of its being inordinate and evil. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin, as stated in Phys. ii, 8 occurs in nature and art, 
when the end intended by nature or art is not attained. But the goodness 
or malice of a human action depends, before all, on the intention of the 
end, and on its achievement. Therefore it seems that the malice of an 
action does not make it sinful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the malice of an action makes it sinful, it follows 
that wherever there is evil, there is sin. But this is false: since 
punishment is not a sin, although it is an evil. Therefore an action is 
not sinful by reason of its being evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As shown above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the goodness of a human 
action depends principally on the Eternal Law: and consequently its 
malice consists in its being in disaccord with the Eternal Law. But this 
is the very nature of sin; for Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) 
that "sin is a word, deed, or desire, in opposition to the Eternal Law." 
Therefore a human action is sinful by reason of its being evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Evil is more comprehensive than sin, as also is good than 
right. For every privation of good, in whatever subject, is an evil: 
whereas sin consists properly in an action done for a certain end, and 
lacking due order to that end. Now the due order to an end is measured by 
some rule. In things that act according to nature, this rule is the 
natural force that inclines them to that end. When therefore an action 
proceeds from a natural force, in accord with the natural inclination to 
an end, then the action is said to be right: since the mean does not 
exceed its limits, viz. the action does not swerve from the order of its 
active principle to the end. But when an action strays from this 
rectitude, it comes under the notion of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in those things that are done by the will, the proximate rule is the 
human reason, while the supreme rule is the Eternal Law. When, therefore, 
a human action tends to the end, according to the order of reason and of 
the Eternal Law, then that action is right: but when it turns aside from 
that rectitude, then it is said to be a sin. Now it is evident from what 
has been said (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4) that every voluntary action that turns 
aside from the order of reason and of the Eternal Law, is evil, and that 
every good action is in accord with reason and the Eternal Law. Hence it 
follows that a human action is right or sinful by reason of its being 
good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Monsters are called sins, inasmuch as they result from a 
sin in nature's action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The end is twofold; the last end, and the proximate end. In 
the sin of nature, the action does indeed fail in respect of the last 
end, which is the perfection of the thing generated; but it does not fail 
in respect of any proximate end whatever; since when nature works it 
forms something. In like manner, the sin of the will always fails as 
regards the last end  intended, because no voluntary evil action can be 
ordained to happiness, which is the last end: and yet it does not fail in 
respect of some proximate end: intended and achieved by the will. 
Wherefore also, since the very intention of this end is ordained to the 
last end, this same intention may be right or sinful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Each thing is ordained to its end by its action: and 
therefore sin, which consists in straying from the order to the end, 
consists properly in an action. On the other hand, punishment regards the 
person of the sinner, as was stated in the FP, Question [48], Article [5], ad 4; Article [6], 
ad 3.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a human action deserves praise or blame, by reason of its being good or evil?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a human action does not deserve praise or 
blame by reason of its being good or evil. For "sin happens even in 
things done by nature" (Phys. ii, 8). And yet natural things are not 
deserving of praise or blame (Ethic. iii, 5). Therefore a human action 
does not deserve blame, by reason of its being evil or sinful; and, 
consequently, neither does it deserve praise, by reason of its being good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as sin occurs in moral actions, so does it happen 
in the productions of art: because as stated in Phys. ii, 8 "it is a sin 
in a grammarian to write badly, and in a doctor to give the wrong 
medicine." But the artist is not blamed for making something bad: because 
the artist's work is such, that he can produce a good or a bad thing, 
just as he lists. Therefore it seems that neither is there any reason for 
blaming a moral action, in the fact that it is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that evil is "weak and 
incapable." But weakness or inability either takes away or diminishes 
guilt. Therefore a human action does not incur guilt from being evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (De Virt. et Vit. i) that 
"virtuous deeds deserve praise, while deeds that are opposed to virtue 
deserve censure and blame." But good actions are virtuous; because 
"virtue makes that which has it, good, and makes its action good" (Ethic. 
ii, 6): wherefore actions opposed to virtue are evil. Therefore a human 
action deserves praise or blame, through being good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as evil is more comprehensive than sin, so is sin 
more comprehensive than blame. For an action is said to deserve praise or 
blame, from its being imputed to the agent: since to praise or to blame 
means nothing else than to impute to someone the malice or goodness of 
his action. Now an action is imputed to an agent, when it is in his 
power, so that he has dominion over it: because it is through his will 
that man has dominion over his actions, as was made clear above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Hence it follows that  good or evil, in voluntary actions 
alone, renders them worthy of praise or blame: and in such like actions, 
evil, sin and guilt are one and the same thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Natural actions are not in the power of the natural agent: 
since the action of nature is determinate. And, therefore, although there 
be sin in natural actions, there is no blame.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Reason stands in different relations to the productions of 
art, and to moral actions. In matters of art, reason is directed to a 
particular end, which is something devised by reason: whereas in moral 
matters, it is directed to the general end of all human life. Now a 
particular end is subordinate to the general end. Since therefore sin is 
a departure from the order to the end, as stated above (<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), sin may 
occur in two ways, in a production of art. First, by a departure from the 
particular end intended by the artist: and this sin will be proper to the 
art; for instance, if an artist produce a bad thing, while intending to 
produce something good; or produce something good, while intending to 
produce something bad. Secondly, by a departure from the general end of 
human life: and then he will be said to sin, if he intend to produce a 
bad work, and does so in effect, so that another is taken in thereby. But 
this sin is not proper to the artist as such, but as man. Consequently 
for the former sin the artist is blamed as an artist; while for the 
latter he is blamed as a man. On the other hand, in moral matters, where 
we take into consideration the order of reason to the general end of 
human life, sin and evil are always due to a departure from the order of 
reason to the general end of human life. Wherefore man is blamed for such 
a sin, both as man and as a moral being. Hence the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. vi, 5) that "in art, he who sins voluntarily is preferable; but 
in prudence, as in the moral virtues," which prudence directs, "he is the 
reverse."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Weakness that occurs in voluntary evils, is subject to 
man's power: wherefore it neither takes away nor diminishes guilt.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a human action is not meritorious or 
demeritorious on account of its goodness or malice. For we speak of merit 
or demerit in relation to retribution, which has no place save in matters 
relating to another person. But good or evil actions are not all related 
to another person, for some are related to the person of the agent. 
Therefore not every good or evil human action is meritorious or 
demeritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one deserves punishment or reward for doing as he 
chooses with that of which he is master: thus if a man destroys what 
belongs to him, he is not punished, as if he had destroyed what belongs 
to another. But man is master of his own  actions. Therefore a man does 
not merit punishment or reward, through putting his action to a good or 
evil purpose.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a man acquire some good for himself, he does not on 
that account deserve to be benefited by another man: and the same applies 
to evil. Now a good action is itself a kind of good and perfection of the 
agent: while an inordinate action is his evil. Therefore a man does not 
merit or demerit, from the fact that he does a good or an evil deed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++3:10,11">Is. 3:10,11</a>): "Say to the just man that 
it is well; for he shall eat the fruit of his doings. Woe to the wicked 
unto evil; for the reward of his hands shall be given him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We speak of merit and demerit, in relation to 
retribution, rendered according to justice. Now, retribution according to 
justice is rendered to a man, by reason of his having done something to 
another's advantage or hurt. It must, moreover, be observed that every 
individual member of a society is, in a fashion, a part and member of the 
whole society. Wherefore, any good or evil, done to the member of a 
society, redounds on the whole society: thus, who hurts the hand, hurts 
the man. When, therefore, anyone does good or evil to another individual, 
there is a twofold measure of merit or demerit in his action: first, in 
respect of the retribution owed to him by the individual to whom he has 
done good or harm; secondly, in respect of the retribution owed to him by 
the whole of society. Now when a man ordains his action directly for the 
good or evil of the whole society, retribution is owed to him, before and 
above all, by the whole society; secondarily, by all the parts of 
society. Whereas when a man does that which conduces to his own benefit 
or disadvantage, then again is retribution owed to him, in so far as this 
too affects the community, forasmuch as he is a part of society: although 
retribution is not due to him, in so far as it conduces to the good or 
harm of an individual, who is identical with the agent: unless, 
perchance, he owe retribution to himself, by a sort of resemblance, in so 
far as man is said to be just to himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore evident that a good or evil action deserves praise or 
blame, in so far as it is in the power of the will: that it is right or 
sinful, according as it is ordained to the end; and that its merit or 
demerit depends on the recompense for justice or injustice towards 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man's good or evil actions, although not ordained to the 
good or evil of another individual, are nevertheless ordained to the good 
or evil of another, i.e. the community.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is master of his actions; and yet, in so far as he 
belongs to another, i.e. the community, of which he forms part, he merits 
or demerits, inasmuch as he disposes his actions well or ill: just as if 
he were to dispense well or ill other  belongings of his, in respect of 
which he is bound to serve the community.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This very good or evil, which a man does to himself by his 
action, redounds to the community, as stated above.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's actions, good or evil, are not 
meritorious or demeritorious in the sight of God. Because, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), merit and demerit imply relation to retribution for good or 
harm done to another. But a man's action, good or evil, does no good or 
harm to God; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+35:6,7">Job 35:6,7</a>): "If thou sin, what shalt 
thou hurt Him? . . . And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give Him?" 
Therefore a human action, good or evil, is not meritorious or 
demeritorious in the sight of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an instrument acquires no merit or demerit in the sight 
of him that uses it; because the entire action of the instrument belongs 
to the user. Now when man acts he is the instrument of the Divine power 
which is the principal cause of his action; hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++10:15">Is. 10:15</a>): "Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it? Or 
shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn?" where man 
while acting is evidently compared to an instrument. Therefore man merits 
or demerits nothing in God's sight, by good or evil deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a human action acquires merit or demerit through being 
ordained to someone else. But not all human actions are ordained to God. 
Therefore not every good or evil action acquires merit or demerit in 
God's sight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++12:14">Eccles. 12:14</a>): "All things that are 
done, God will bring into judgment . . . whether it be good or evil." Now 
judgment implies retribution, in respect of which we speak of merit and 
demerit. Therefore every human action, both good and evil, acquires merit 
or demerit in God's sight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A human action, as stated above (<A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), acquires merit or 
demerit, through being ordained to someone else, either by reason of 
himself, or by reason of the community: and in each way, our actions, 
good and evil, acquire merit or demerit, in the sight of God. On the part 
of God Himself, inasmuch as He is man's last end; and it is our duty to 
refer all our actions to the last end, as stated above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). 
Consequently, whoever does an evil deed, not referable to God, does not 
give God the honor due to Him as our last end. On the part of the whole 
community of the universe, because in every community, he who governs the 
community, cares, first of all, for the common good; wherefore it is his 
business to award retribution for such things as are done well or ill in 
the community. Now God is the governor and ruler of the  whole universe, 
as stated in the FP, Question [103], Article [5]: and especially of rational creatures. 
Consequently it is evident that human actions acquire merit or demerit in 
reference to Him: else it would follow that human actions are no business 
of God's.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[21] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God in Himself neither gains nor losses anything by the 
action of man: but man, for his part, takes something from God, or offers 
something to Him, when he observes or does not observe the order 
instituted by God.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is so moved, as an instrument, by God, that, at the 
same time, he moves himself by his free-will, as was explained above 
(<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 3). Consequently, by his action, he acquires merit or 
demerit in God's sight.<br>

that he is and has; and so it does not follow that every action of his 
acquires merit or demerit in relation to the body politic. But all that 
man is, and can, and has, must be referred to God: and therefore every 
action of man, whether good or bad, acquires merit or demerit in the 
sight of God, as far as the action itself is concerned.<br>
