  <h3 align="left">Whether man's happiness consists in wealth?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in
    wealth. For since happiness is man's last end, it must consist in that which
    has the greatest hold on man's affections. Now this is wealth: for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++10%3A19"
      >Eccles. 10:19</a
    >): "All things obey money." Therefore man's happiness consists in
    wealth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Boethius (De Consol. iii),
    happiness is "a state of life made perfect by the aggregate of all good
    things." Now money seems to be the means of possessing all things: for, as
    the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 5), money was invented, that it might be a
    sort of guarantee for the acquisition of whatever man desires. Therefore
    happiness consists in wealth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since the desire for the sovereign good
    never fails, it seems to be infinite. But this is the case with riches more
    than anything else; since "a covetous man shall not be satisfied with
    riches" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++5%3A9"
      >Eccles. 5:9</a
    >). Therefore happiness consists in wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Man's good consists in retaining happiness
    rather than in spreading it. But as Boethius says (De Consol. ii), "wealth
    shines in giving rather than in hoarding: for the miser is hateful, whereas
    the generous man is applauded." Therefore man's happiness does not consist
    in wealth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for man's happiness to consist
    in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3),
    viz. natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a
    remedy for his natural wants: such as food, drink, clothing, cars,
    dwellings, and such like, while artificial wealth is that which is not a
    direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the
    convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is evident that man's happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For
    wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz. as a
    support of human nature: consequently it cannot be man's last end, rather is
    it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such
    things are below man, and made for him, according to Ps. 8:8: "Thou hast
    subjected all things under his feet."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural
    wealth; since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he
    procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently much less can it
    be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore it is impossible for
    happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All material things obey money, so far
    as the multitude of fools is concerned, who know no other than material
    goods, which can be obtained for money. But we should take our estimation of
    human goods not from the foolish but from the wise: just as it is for a
    person whose sense of taste is in good order, to judge whether a thing is
    palatable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All things salable can be had for money:
    not so spiritual things, which cannot be sold. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++17%3A16"
      >Prov. 17:16</a
    >): "What doth it avail a fool to have riches, seeing he cannot buy
    wisdom."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The desire for natural riches is not
    infinite: because they suffice for nature in a certain measure. But the
    desire for artificial wealth is infinite, for it is the servant of
    disordered concupiscence, which is not curbed, as the Philosopher makes
    clear (Polit. i, 3). Yet this desire for wealth is infinite otherwise than
    the desire for the sovereign good. For the more perfectly the sovereign good
    is possessed, the more it is loved, and other things despised: because the
    more we possess it, the more we know it. Hence it is written (Ecclus.
    24:29): "They that eat me shall yet hunger." Whereas in the desire for
    wealth and for whatsoever temporal goods, the contrary is the case: for when
    we already possess them, we despise them, and seek others: which is the
    sense of Our Lord's words (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A13"
      >Jn. 4:13</a
    >): "Whosoever drinketh of this water," by which temporal goods are
    signified, "shall thirst again." The reason of this is that we realize more
    their insufficiency when we possess them: and this very fact shows that they
    are imperfect, and the sovereign good does not consist therein.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether man's happiness consists in honors?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in
    honors. For happiness or bliss is "the reward of virtue," as the Philosopher
    says (Ethic. i, 9). But honor more than anything else seems to be that by
    which virtue is rewarded, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore
    happiness consists especially in honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which belongs to God and to persons
    of great excellence seems especially to be happiness, which is the perfect
    good. But that is honor, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3). Moreover,
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A17"
      >1 Tim. 1:17</a
    >): "To... the only God be honor and glory." Therefore happiness consists in
    honor.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which man desires above all is
    happiness. But nothing seems more desirable to man than honor: since man
    suffers loss in all other things, lest he should suffer loss of honor.
    Therefore happiness consists in honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Happiness is in the happy. But honor is not
    in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to
    the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore
    happiness does not consist in honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for happiness to consist in
    honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and
    consequently it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the
    person honored. Now a man's excellence is in proportion, especially to his
    happiness, which is man's perfect good; and to its parts, i.e. those goods
    by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result
    from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5),
    honor is not that reward of virtue, for which the virtuous work: but they
    receive honor from men by way of reward, "as from those who have nothing
    greater to offer." But virtue's true reward is happiness itself, for which
    the virtuous work: whereas if they worked for honor, it would no longer be a
    virtue, but ambition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Honor is due to God and to persons of
    great excellence as a sign of attestation of excellence already existing:
    not that honor makes them excellent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That man desires honor above all else,
    arises from his natural desire for happiness, from which honor results, as
    stated above. Wherefore man seeks to be honored especially by the wise, on
    whose judgment he believes himself to be excellent or happy.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether man's happiness consists in fame or glory?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in
    glory. For happiness seems to consist in that which is paid to the saints
    for the trials they have undergone in the world. But this is glory: for the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A18"
      >Rm. 8:18</a
    >): "The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the
    glory to come, that shall be revealed in us." Therefore happiness consists
    in glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, good is diffusive of itself, as stated
    by Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). But man's good is spread abroad in the
    knowledge of others by glory more than by anything else: since, according to
    Ambrose [*Augustine, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii. 13], glory consists "in being
    well known and praised." Therefore man's happiness consists in glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness is the most enduring good. Now
    this seems to be fame or glory; because by this men attain to eternity after
    a fashion. Hence Boethius says (De Consol. ii): "You seem to beget unto
    yourselves eternity, when you think of your fame in future time." Therefore
    man's happiness consists in fame or glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Happiness is man's true good. But it happens
    that fame or glory is false: for as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), "many
    owe their renown to the lying reports spread among the people. Can anything
    be more shameful? For those who receive false fame, must needs blush at
    their own praise." Therefore man's happiness does not consist in fame or
    glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man's happiness cannot consist in human fame or
    glory. For glory consists "in being well known and praised," as Ambrose
    [*Augustine, Contra Maxim. Arian. ii, 13] says. Now the thing known is
    related to human knowledge otherwise than to God's knowledge: for human
    knowledge is caused by the things known, whereas God's knowledge is the
    cause of the things known. Wherefore the perfection of human good, which is
    called happiness, cannot be caused by human knowledge: but rather human
    knowledge of another's happiness proceeds from, and, in a fashion, is caused
    by, human happiness itself, inchoate or perfect. Consequently man's
    happiness cannot consist in fame or glory. On the other hand, man's good
    depends on God's knowledge as its cause. And therefore man's beatitude
    depends, as on its cause, on the glory which man has with God; according to
    Ps. 90:15,16: "I will deliver him, and I will glorify him; I will fill him
    with length of days, and I will show him my salvation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, we must observe that human knowledge often fails, especially in
    contingent singulars, such as are human acts. For this reason human glory is
    frequently deceptive. But since God cannot be deceived, His glory is always
    true; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++10%3A18"
      >2 Cor. 10:18</a
    >): "He... is approved... whom God commendeth."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle speaks, then, not of the
    glory which is with men, but of the glory which is from God, with His
    Angels. Hence it is written (Mk. 8:38): "The Son of Man shall confess him in
    the glory of His Father, before His angels" [*St. Thomas joins Mk. 8:38 with
    Lk. 12:8 owing to a possible variant in his text, or to the fact that he was
    quoting from memory].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man's good which, through fame or
    glory, is in the knowledge of many, if this knowledge be true, must needs be
    derived from good existing in the man himself: and hence it presupposes
    perfect or inchoate happiness. But if the knowledge be false, it does not
    harmonize with the thing: and thus good does not exist in him who is looked
    upon as famous. Hence it follows that fame can nowise make man happy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Fame has no stability; in fact, it is
    easily ruined by false report. And if sometimes it endures, this is by
    accident. But happiness endures of itself, and for ever.

  <h3 align="left">Whether man's happiness consists in power?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness consists in power.
    For all things desire to become like to God, as to their last end and first
    beginning. But men who are in power, seem, on account of the similarity of
    power, to be most like to God: hence also in Scripture they are called
    "gods" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++22%3A28"
      >Ex. 22:28</a
    >), "Thou shalt not speak ill of the gods." Therefore happiness consists in
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, happiness is the perfect good. But the
    highest perfection for man is to be able to rule others; which belongs to
    those who are in power. Therefore happiness consists in power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since happiness is supremely desirable,
    it is contrary to that which is before all to be shunned. But, more than
    aught else, men shun servitude, which is contrary to power. Therefore
    happiness consists in power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Happiness is the perfect good. But power is
    most imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), "the power of man
    cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of
    anxiety": and further on: "Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by
    attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still
    more?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for happiness to consist in
    power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of
    principle, as is stated in Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature
    of last end. Secondly, because power has relation to good and evil: whereas
    happiness is man's proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might
    consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power
    itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now four general reasons may be given to prove that happiness consists in
    none of the foregoing external goods. First, because, since happiness is
    man's supreme good, it is incompatible with any evil. Now all the foregoing
    can be found both in good and in evil men. Secondly, because, since it is
    the nature of happiness to "satisfy of itself," as stated in Ethic. i, 7,
    having gained happiness, man cannot lack any needful good. But after
    acquiring any one of the foregoing, man may still lack many goods that are
    necessary to him; for instance, wisdom, bodily health, and such like.
    Thirdly, because, since happiness is the perfect good, no evil can accrue to
    anyone therefrom. This cannot be said of the foregoing: for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++5%3A12"
      >Eccles. 5:12</a
    >) that "riches" are sometimes "kept to the hurt of the owner"; and the same
    may be said of the other three. Fourthly, because man is ordained to
    happiness through principles that are in him; since he is ordained thereto
    naturally. Now the four goods mentioned above are due rather to external
    causes, and in most cases to fortune; for which reason they are called goods
    of fortune. Therefore it is evident that happiness nowise consists in the
    foregoing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God's power is His goodness: hence He
    cannot use His power otherwise than well. But it is not so with men.
    Consequently it is not enough for man's happiness, that he become like God
    in power, unless he become like Him in goodness also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as it is a very good thing for a
    man to make good use of power in ruling many, so is it a very bad thing if
    he makes a bad use of it. And so it is that power is towards good and
    evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Servitude is a hindrance to the good use
    of power: therefore is it that men naturally shun it; not because man's
    supreme good consists in power.<br />

    Whether man's happiness consists in any bodily good?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in
    bodily goods. For it is written (Ecclus. 30:16): "There is no riches above
    the riches of the health of the body." But happiness consists in that which
    is best. Therefore it consists in the health of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v), that "to
    be" is better than "to live," and "to live" is better than all that follows.
    But for man's being and living, the health of the body is necessary. Since,
    therefore, happiness is man's supreme good, it seems that health of the body
    belongs more than anything else to happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more universal a thing is, the
    higher the principle from which it depends; because the higher a cause is,
    the greater the scope of its power. Now just as the causality of the
    efficient cause consists in its flowing into something, so the causality of
    the end consists in its drawing the appetite. Therefore, just as the First
    Cause is that which flows into all things, so the last end is that which
    attracts the desire of all. But being itself is that which is most desired
    by all. Therefore man's happiness consists most of all in things pertaining
    to his being, such as the health of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Man surpasses all other animals in regard to
    happiness. But in bodily goods he is surpassed by many animals; for
    instance, by the elephant in longevity, by the lion in strength, by the stag
    in fleetness. Therefore man's happiness does not consist in goods of the
    body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for man's happiness to consist
    in the goods of the body; and this for two reasons. First, because, if a
    thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in
    the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last
    end, the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained
    to something else as its end, viz. to navigation. Now just as the ship is
    entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over
    to his will and reason; according to Ecclus. 15:14: "God made man from the
    beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel." Now it is evident
    that man is ordained to something as his end: since man is not the supreme
    good. Therefore the last end of man's reason and will cannot be the
    preservation of man's being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, because, granted that the end of man's will and reason be the
    preservation of man's being, it could not be said that the end of man is
    some good of the body. For man's being consists in soul and body; and though
    the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul
    depends not on the body, as shown above (<a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP075.html#FPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP075.html#FPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); and the very body
    is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man
    that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work.
    Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to
    their end. Consequently happiness, which is man's last end, cannot consist
    in goods of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the body is ordained to the
    soul, as its end, so are external goods ordained to the body itself. And
    therefore it is with reason that the good of the body is preferred to
    external goods, which are signified by "riches," just as the good of the
    soul is preferred to all bodily goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Being taken simply, as including all
    perfection of being, surpasses life and all that follows it; for thus being
    itself includes all these. And in this sense Dionysius speaks. But if we
    consider being itself as participated in this or that thing, which does not
    possess the whole perfection of being, but has imperfect being, such as the
    being of any creature; then it is evident that being itself together with an
    additional perfection is more excellent. Hence in the same passage Dionysius
    says that things that live are better than things that exist, and
    intelligent better than living things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the end corresponds to the
    beginning; this argument proves that the last end is the first beginning of
    being, in Whom every perfection of being is: Whose likeness, according to
    their proportion, some desire as to being only, some as to living being,
    some as to being which is living, intelligent and happy. And this belongs to
    few.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether man's happiness consists in pleasure?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in
    pleasure. For since happiness is the last end, it is not desired for
    something else, but other things for it. But this answers to pleasure more
    than to anything else: "for it is absurd to ask anyone what is his motive in
    wishing to be pleased" (Ethic. x, 2). Therefore happiness consists
    principally in pleasure and delight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "the first cause goes more deeply into
    the effect than the second cause" (De Causis i). Now the causality of the
    end consists in its attracting the appetite. Therefore, seemingly that which
    moves most the appetite, answers to the notion of the last end. Now this is
    pleasure: and a sign of this is that delight so far absorbs man's will and
    reason, that it causes him to despise other goods. Therefore it seems that
    man's last end, which is happiness, consists principally in pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since desire is for good, it seems that
    what all desire is best. But all desire delight; both wise and foolish, and
    even irrational creatures. Therefore delight is the best of all. Therefore
    happiness, which is the supreme good, consists in pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. iii): "Any one that
    chooses to look back on his past excesses, will perceive that pleasures had
    a sad ending: and if they can render a man happy, there is no reason why we
    should not say that the very beasts are happy too."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Because bodily delights are more generally
    known, "the name of pleasure has been appropriated to them" (Ethic. vii,
    13), although other delights excel them: and yet happiness does not consist
    in them. Because in every thing, that which pertains to its essence is
    distinct from its proper accident: thus in man it is one thing that he is a
    mortal rational animal, and another that he is a risible animal. We must
    therefore consider that every delight is a proper accident resulting from
    happiness, or from some part of happiness; since the reason that a man is
    delighted is that he has some fitting good, either in reality, or in hope,
    or at least in memory. Now a fitting good, if indeed it be the perfect good,
    is precisely man's happiness: and if it is imperfect, it is a share of
    happiness, either proximate, or remote, or at least apparent. Therefore it
    is evident that neither is delight, which results from the perfect good, the
    very essence of happiness, but something resulting therefrom as its proper
    accident.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But bodily pleasure cannot result from the perfect good even in that way.
    For it results from a good apprehended by sense, which is a power of the
    soul, which power makes use of the body. Now good pertaining to the body,
    and apprehended by sense, cannot be man's perfect good. For since the
    rational soul excels the capacity of corporeal matter, that part of the soul
    which is independent of a corporeal organ, has a certain infinity in regard
    to the body and those parts of the soul which are tied down to the body:
    just as immaterial things are in a way infinite as compared to material
    things, since a form is, after a fashion, contracted and bounded by matter,
    so that a form which is independent of matter is, in a way, infinite.
    Therefore sense, which is a power of the body, knows the singular, which is
    determinate through matter: whereas the intellect, which is a power
    independent of matter, knows the universal, which is abstracted from matter,
    and contains an infinite number of singulars. Consequently it is evident
    that good which is fitting to the body, and which causes bodily delight
    through being apprehended by sense, is not man's perfect good, but is quite
    a trifle as compared with the good of the soul. Hence it is written (Wis.
    7:9) that "all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand." And
    therefore bodily pleasure is neither happiness itself, nor a proper accident
    of happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It comes to the same whether we desire
    good, or desire delight, which is nothing else than the appetite's rest in
    good: thus it is owing to the same natural force that a weighty body is
    borne downwards and that it rests there. Consequently just as good is
    desired for itself, so delight is desired for itself and not for anything
    else, if the preposition "for" denote the final cause. But if it denote the
    formal or rather the motive cause, thus delight is desirable for something
    else, i.e. for the good, which is the object of that delight, and
    consequently is its principle, and gives it its form: for the reason that
    delight is desired is that it is rest in the thing desired.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The vehemence of desire for sensible
    delight arises from the fact that operations of the senses, through being
    the principles of our knowledge, are more perceptible. And so it is that
    sensible pleasures are desired by the majority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All desire delight in the same way as
    they desire good: and yet they desire delight by reason of the good and not
    conversely, as stated above (ad 1). Consequently it does not follow that
    delight is the supreme and essential good, but that every delight results
    from some good, and that some delight results from that which is the
    essential and supreme good.<br />

    Whether some good of the soul constitutes man's happiness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that some good of the soul
    constitutes man's happiness. For happiness is man's good. Now this is
    threefold: external goods, goods of the body, and goods of the soul. But
    happiness does not consist in external goods, nor in goods of the body, as
    shown above (<a href="FS002.html#FSQ2ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Therefore
    it consists in goods of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we love that for which we desire good,
    more than the good that we desire for it: thus we love a friend for whom we
    desire money, more than we love money. But whatever good a man desires, he
    desires it for himself. Therefore he loves himself more than all other
    goods. Now happiness is what is loved above all: which is evident from the
    fact that for its sake all else is loved and desired. Therefore happiness
    consists in some good of man himself: not, however, in goods of the body;
    therefore, in goods of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, perfection is something belonging to
    that which is perfected. But happiness is a perfection of man. Therefore
    happiness is something belonging to man. But it is not something belonging
    to the body, as shown above (<a href="FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a
    >). Therefore it is something belonging to the soul; and thus it consists in
    goods of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22),
    "that which constitutes the life of happiness is to be loved for its own
    sake." But man is not to be loved for his own sake, but whatever is in man
    is to be loved for God's sake. Therefore happiness consists in no good of
    the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the end is twofold:
    namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely,
    the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man's last
    end, it is impossible for man's last end to be the soul itself or something
    belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something
    existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually, from being
    potentially knowing; and actually virtuous, from being potentially virtuous.
    Now since potentiality is for the sake of act as for its fulfilment, that
    which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore the
    soul itself cannot be its own last end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit,
    or act. For that good which is the last end, is the perfect good fulfilling
    the desire. Now man's appetite, otherwise the will, is for the universal
    good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and
    consequently a portioned good. Therefore none of them can be man's last
    end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we speak of man's last end, as to the attainment or possession
    thereof, or as to any use whatever of the thing itself desired as an end,
    thus does something of man, in respect of his soul, belong to his last end:
    since man attains happiness through his soul. Therefore the thing itself
    which is desired as end, is that which constitutes happiness, and makes man
    happy; but the attainment of this thing is called happiness. Consequently we
    must say that happiness is something belonging to the soul; but that which
    constitutes happiness is something outside the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Inasmuch as this division includes all
    goods that man can desire, thus the good of the soul is not only power,
    habit, or act, but also the object of these, which is something outside. And
    in this way nothing hinders us from saying that what constitutes happiness
    is a good of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As far as the proposed objection is
    concerned, happiness is loved above all, as the good desired; whereas a
    friend is loved as that for which good is desired; and thus, too, man loves
    himself. Consequently it is not the same kind of love in both cases. As to
    whether man loves anything more than himself with the love of friendship
    there will be occasion to inquire when we treat of Charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Happiness, itself, since it is a
    perfection of the soul, is an inherent good of the soul; but that which
    constitutes happiness, viz. which makes man happy, is something outside his
    soul, as stated above.<br />

    Whether any created good constitutes man's happiness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that some created good constitutes
    man's happiness. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that Divine wisdom
    "unites the ends of first things to the beginnings of second things," from
    which we may gather that the summit of a lower nature touches the base of
    the higher nature. But man's highest good is happiness. Since then the angel
    is above man in the order of nature, as stated in FP, Question [111],
    Article [1], it seems that man's happiness consists in man somehow reaching
    the angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the last end of each thing is that
    which, in relation to it, is perfect: hence the part is for the whole, as
    for its end. But the universe of creatures which is called the macrocosm, is
    compared to man who is called the microcosm (Phys. viii, 2), as perfect to
    imperfect. Therefore man's happiness consists in the whole universe of
    creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man is made happy by that which lulls
    his natural desire. But man's natural desire does not reach out to a good
    surpassing his capacity. Since then man's capacity does not include that
    good which surpasses the limits of all creation, it seems that man can be
    made happy by some created good. Consequently some created good constitutes
    man's happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 26): "As the
    soul is the life of the body, so God is man's life of happiness: of Whom it
    is written: 'Happy is that people whose God is the Lord' (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++143%3A15"
      >Ps. 143:15</a
    >)."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for any created good to
    constitute man's happiness. For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls
    the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet
    remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e. of man's appetite,
    is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal
    true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man's will, save the
    universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone;
    because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone
    can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Ps. 102:5: "Who
    satisfieth thy desire with good things." Therefore God alone constitutes
    man's happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The summit of man does indeed touch the
    base of the angelic nature, by a kind of likeness; but man does not rest
    there as in his last end, but reaches out to the universal fount itself of
    good, which is the common object of happiness of all the blessed, as being
    the infinite and perfect good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If a whole be not the last end, but
    ordained to a further end, then the last end of a part thereof is not the
    whole itself, but something else. Now the universe of creatures, to which
    man is compared as part to whole, is not the last end, but is ordained to
    God, as to its last end. Therefore the last end of man is not the good of
    the universe, but God himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Created good is not less than that good
    of which man is capable, as of something intrinsic and inherent to him: but
    it is less than the good of which he is capable, as of an object, and which
    is infinite. And the participated good which is in an angel, and in the
    whole universe, is a finite and restricted good.<br />
