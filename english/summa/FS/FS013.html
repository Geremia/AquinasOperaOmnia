  <h3 align="center">
    OF CHOICE, WHICH IS AN ACT OF THE WILL WITH REGARD TO THE MEANS (SIX
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the acts of the will with regard to the means. There
    are three of them: to choose, to consent, and to use. And choice is preceded
    by counsel. First of all, then, we must consider choice: secondly, counsel;
    thirdly, consent; fourthly, use.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning choice there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Of what power is it the act; of
    the will or of the reason?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether choice is to be found in
    irrational animals?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether choice is only the means,
    or sometimes also of the end?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether choice is only of things
    that we do ourselves?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether choice is only of possible
    things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether man chooses of necessity
    or freely?

  <h3 align="left">Whether choice is an act of will or of reason?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that choice is an act, not of will
    but of reason. For choice implies comparison, whereby one is given
    preference to another. But to compare is an act of reason. Therefore choice
    is an act of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is for the same faculty to form a
    syllogism, and to draw the conclusion. But, in practical matters, it is the
    reason that forms syllogisms. Since therefore choice is a kind of conclusion
    in practical matters, as stated in Ethic. vii, 3, it seems that it is an act
    of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, ignorance does not belong to the will
    but to the cognitive power. Now there is an "ignorance of choice," as is
    stated in Ethic. iii, 1. Therefore it seems that choice does not belong to
    the will but to the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 3) that
    choice is "the desire of things in our power." But desire is an act of will.
    Therefore choice is too.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The word choice implies something belonging to
    the reason or intellect, and something belonging to the will: for the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 2) that choice is either "intellect influenced
    by appetite or appetite influenced by intellect." Now whenever two things
    concur to make one, one of them is formal in regard to the other. Hence
    Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxiii.] says that choice "is
    neither desire only, nor counsel only, but a combination of the two. For
    just as we say that an animal is composed of soul and body, and that it is
    neither a mere body, nor a mere soul, but both; so is it with choice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we must observe, as regards the acts of the soul, that an act belonging
    essentially to some power or habit, receives a form or species from a higher
    power or habit, according as an inferior is ordained by a superior: for if a
    man were to perform an act of fortitude for the love of God, that act is
    materially an act of fortitude, but formally, an act of charity. Now it is
    evident that, in a sense, reason precedes the will and ordains its act: in
    so far as the will tends to its object, according to the order of reason,
    since the apprehensive power presents the object to the appetite.
    Accordingly, that act whereby the will tends to something proposed to it as
    being good, through being ordained to the end by the reason, is materially
    an act of the will, but formally an act of the reason. Now in such like
    matters the substance of the act is as the matter in comparison to the order
    imposed by the higher power. Wherefore choice is substantially not an act of
    the reason but of the will: for choice is accomplished in a certain movement
    of the soul towards the good which is chosen. Consequently it is evidently
    an act of the appetitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Choice implies a previous comparison;
    not that it consists in the comparison itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is quite true that it is for the
    reason to draw the conclusion of a practical syllogism; and it is called "a
    decision" or "judgment," to be followed by "choice." And for this reason the
    conclusion seems to belong to the act of choice, as to that which results
    from it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In speaking "of ignorance of choice," we
    do not mean that choice is a sort of knowledge, but that there is ignorance
    of what ought to be chosen.<br />

    Whether choice is to be found in irrational animals?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that irrational animals are able to
    choose. For choice "is the desire of certain things on account of an end,"
    as stated in Ethic. iii, 2,3. But irrational animals desire something on
    account of an end: since they act for an end, and from desire. Therefore
    choice is in irrational animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the very word "electio" [choice] seems
    to signify the taking of something in preference to others. But irrational
    animals take something in preference to others: thus we can easily see for
    ourselves that a sheep will eat one grass and refuse another. Therefore
    choice is in irrational animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ethic. vi, 12, "it is from
    prudence that a man makes a good choice of means." But prudence is found in
    irrational animals: hence it is said in the beginning of Metaph. i, 1 that
    "those animals which, like bees, cannot hear sounds, are prudent by
    instinct." We see this plainly, in wonderful cases of sagacity manifested in
    the works of various animals, such as bees, spiders, and dogs. For a hound
    in following a stag, on coming to a crossroad, tries by scent whether the
    stag has passed by the first or the second road: and if he find that the
    stag has not passed there, being thus assured, takes to the third road
    without trying the scent; as though he were reasoning by way of exclusion,
    arguing that the stag must have passed by this way, since he did not pass by
    the others, and there is no other road. Therefore it seems that irrational
    animals are able to choose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.
    xxxiii.] says that "children and irrational animals act willingly but not
    from choice." Therefore choice is not in irrational animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since choice is the taking of one thing in
    preference to another it must of necessity be in respect of several things
    that can be chosen. Consequently in those things which are altogether
    determinate to one there is no place for choice. Now the difference between
    the sensitive appetite and the will is that, as stated above (<a
      href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3), the sensitive
    appetite is determinate to one particular thing, according to the order of
    nature; whereas the will, although determinate to one thing in general, viz.
    the good, according to the order of nature, is nevertheless indeterminate in
    respect of particular goods. Consequently choice belongs properly to the
    will, and not to the sensitive appetite which is all that irrational animals
    have. Wherefore irrational animals are not competent to choose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not every desire of one thing on account
    of an end is called choice: there must be a certain discrimination of one
    thing from another. And this cannot be except when the appetite can be moved
    to several things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An irrational animal takes one thing in
    preference to another, because its appetite is naturally determinate to that
    thing. Wherefore as soon as an animal, whether by its sense or by its
    imagination, is offered something to which its appetite is naturally
    inclined, it is moved to that alone, without making any choice. Just as fire
    is moved upwards and not downwards, without its making any choice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated in Phys. iii, 3 "movement is
    the act of the movable, caused by a mover." Wherefore the power of the mover
    appears in the movement of that which it moves. Accordingly, in all things
    moved by reason, the order of reason which moves them is evident, although
    the things themselves are without reason: for an arrow through the motion of
    the archer goes straight towards the target, as though it were endowed with
    reason to direct its course. The same may be seen in the movements of clocks
    and all engines put together by the art of man. Now as artificial things are
    in comparison to human art, so are all natural things in comparison to the
    Divine art. And accordingly order is to be seen in things moved by nature,
    just as in things moved by reason, as is stated in Phys. ii. And thus it is
    that in the works of irrational animals we notice certain marks of sagacity,
    in so far as they have a natural inclination to set about their actions in a
    most orderly manner through being ordained by the Supreme art. For which
    reason, too, certain animals are called prudent or sagacious; and not
    because they reason or exercise any choice about things. This is clear from
    the fact that all that share in one nature, invariably act in the same
    way.<br />

    Whether choice is only of the means, or sometimes also of the end?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that choice is not only of the
    means. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 12) that "virtue makes us choose
    aright; but it is not the part of virtue, but of some other power to direct
    aright those things which are to be done for its sake." But that for the
    sake of which something is done is the end. Therefore choice is of the
    end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, choice implies preference of one thing
    to another. But just as there can be preference of means, so can there be
    preference of ends. Therefore choice can be of ends, just as it can be of
    means.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) that
    "volition is of the end, but choice of the means."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As already stated (<a
      href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2), choice results from the decision or judgment which is, as it were,
    the conclusion of a practical syllogism. Hence that which is the conclusion
    of a practical syllogism, is the matter of choice. Now in practical things
    the end stands in the position of a principle, not of a conclusion, as the
    Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 9). Wherefore the end, as such, is not a matter
    of choice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But just as in speculative knowledge nothing hinders the principle of one
    demonstration or of one science, from being the conclusion of another
    demonstration or science; while the first indemonstrable principle cannot be
    the conclusion of any demonstration or science; so too that which is the end
    in one operation, may be ordained to something as an end. And in this way it
    is a matter of choice. Thus in the work of a physician health is the end:
    wherefore it is not a matter of choice for a physician, but a matter of
    principle. Now the health of the body is ordained to the good of the soul,
    consequently with one who has charge of the soul's health, health or
    sickness may be a matter of choice; for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A10"
      >2 Cor. 12:10</a
    >): "For when I am weak, then am I powerful." But the last end is nowise a
    matter of choice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The proper ends of virtues are ordained
    to Happiness as to their last end. And thus it is that they can be a matter
    of choice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), there is but one last
    end. Accordingly wherever there are several ends, they can be the subject of
    choice, in so far as they are ordained to a further end.<br />

    Whether choice is of those things only that are done by us?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that choice is not only in respect
    of human acts. For choice regards the means. Now, not only acts, but also
    the organs, are means (Phys. ii, 3). Therefore choice is not only concerned
    with human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, action is distinct from contemplation.
    But choice has a place even in contemplation; in so far as one opinion is
    preferred to another. Therefore choice is not concerned with human acts
    alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are chosen for certain posts,
    whether secular or ecclesiastical, by those who exercise no action in their
    regard. Therefore choice is not concerned with human acts alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) that "no
    man chooses save what he can do himself."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as intention regards the end, so does
    choice regard the means. Now the end is either an action or a thing. And
    when the end is a thing, some human action must intervene; either in so far
    as man produces the thing which is the end, as the physician produces health
    (wherefore the production of health is said to be the end of the physician);
    or in so far as man, in some fashion, uses or enjoys the thing which is the
    end; thus for the miser, money or the possession of money is the end. The
    same is to be said of the means. For the means must needs be either an
    action; or a thing, with some action intervening whereby man either makes
    the thing which is the means, or puts it to some use. And thus it is that
    choice is always in regard to human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The organs are ordained to the end,
    inasmuch as man makes use of them for the sake of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In contemplation itself there is the act
    of the intellect assenting to this or that opinion. It is exterior action
    that is put in contradistinction to contemplation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When a man chooses someone for a
    bishopric or some high position in the state, he chooses to name that man to
    that post. Else, if he had no right to act in the appointment of the bishop
    or official, he would have no right to choose. Likewise, whenever we speak
    of one thing being chosen in preference to another, it is in conjunction
    with some action of the chooser.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether choice is only of possible things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that choice in not only of possible
    things. For choice is an act of the will, as stated above (<a
      href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now there is "a willing of impossibilities" (Ethic. iii, 2). Therefore
    there is also a choice of impossibilities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, choice is of things done by us, as
    stated above (<a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore
    it matters not, as far as the act of choosing is concerned, whether one
    choose that which is impossible in itself, or that which is impossible to
    the chooser. Now it often happens that we are unable to accomplish what we
    choose: so that this proves to be impossible to us. Therefore choice is of
    the impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to try to do a thing is to choose to do
    it. But the Blessed Benedict says (Regula lxviii) that if the superior
    command what is impossible, it should be attempted. Therefore choice can be
    of the impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) that
    "there is no choice of impossibilities."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS013.html#FSQ13A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), our choice is always concerned with our actions. Now whatever is done by
    us, is possible to us. Therefore we must needs say that choice is only of
    possible things.<br />
  </p>

    Moreover, the reason for choosing a thing is that it conduces to an end. But
    what is impossible cannot conduce to an end. A sign of this is that when men
    in taking counsel together come to something that is impossible to them,
    they depart, as being unable to proceed with the business.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, this is evident if we examine the previous process of the reason. For
    the means, which are the object of choice, are to the end, as the conclusion
    is to the principle. Now it is clear that an impossible conclusion does not
    follow from a possible principle. Wherefore an end cannot be possible,
    unless the means be possible. Now no one is moved to the impossible.
    Consequently no one would tend to the end, save for the fact that the means
    appear to be possible. Therefore the impossible is not the object of
    choice.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The will stands between the intellect
    and the external action: for the intellect proposes to the will its object,
    and the will causes the external action. Hence the principle of the movement
    in the will is to be found in the intellect, which apprehends something
    under the universal notion of good: but the term or perfection of the will's
    act is to be observed in its relation to the action whereby a man tends to
    the attainment of a thing; for the movement of the will is from the soul to
    the thing. Consequently the perfect act of the will is in respect of
    something that is good for one to do. Now this cannot be something
    impossible. Wherefore the complete act of the will is only in respect of
    what is possible and good for him that wills. But the incomplete act of the
    will is in respect of the impossible; and by some is called "velleity,"
    because, to wit, one would will [vellet] such a thing, were it possible. But
    choice is an act of the will, fixed on something to be done by the chooser.
    And therefore it is by no means of anything but what is possible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the object of the will is the
    apprehended good, we must judge of the object of the will according as it is
    apprehended. And so, just as sometimes the will tends to something which is
    apprehended as good, and yet is not really good; so is choice sometimes made
    of something apprehended as possible to the chooser, and yet impossible to
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reason for this is that the subject
    should not rely on his own judgment to decide whether a certain thing is
    possible; but in each case should stand by his superior's judgment.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether man chooses of necessity or freely?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man chooses of necessity. For
    the end stands in relation to the object of choice, as the principle of that
    which follows from the principles, as declared in Ethic. vii, 8. But
    conclusions follow of necessity from their principles. Therefore man is
    moved of necessity from (willing) the end of the choice (of the means).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2), choice follows the reason's judgment of what is to be done. But
    reason judges of necessity about some things: on account of the necessity of
    the premises. Therefore it seems that choice also follows of necessity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if two things are absolutely equal, man
    is not moved to one more than to the other; thus if a hungry man, as Plato
    says (Cf. De Coelo ii, 13), be confronted on either side with two portions
    of food equally appetizing and at an equal distance, he is not moved towards
    one more than to the other; and he finds the reason of this in the
    immobility of the earth in the middle of the world. Now, if that which is
    equally (eligible) with something else cannot be chosen, much less can that
    be chosen which appears as less (eligible). Therefore if two or more things
    are available, of which one appears to be more (eligible), it is impossible
    to choose any of the others. Therefore that which appears to hold the first
    place is chosen of necessity. But every act of choosing is in regard to
    something that seems in some way better. Therefore every choice is made
    necessarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Choice is an act of a rational power; which
    according to the Philosopher (Metaph. ix, 2) stands in relation to
    opposites.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man does not choose of necessity. And this is
    because that which is possible not to be, is not of necessity. Now the
    reason why it is possible not to choose, or to choose, may be gathered from
    a twofold power in man. For man can will and not will, act and not act;
    again, he can will this or that, and do this or that. The reason of this is
    seated in the very power of the reason. For the will can tend to whatever
    the reason can apprehend as good. Now the reason can apprehend as good, not
    only this, viz. "to will" or "to act," but also this, viz. "not to will" or
    "not to act." Again, in all particular goods, the reason can consider an
    aspect of some good, and the lack of some good, which has the aspect of
    evil: and in this respect, it can apprehend any single one of such goods as
    to be chosen or to be avoided. The perfect good alone, which is Happiness,
    cannot be apprehended by the reason as an evil, or as lacking in any way.
    Consequently man wills Happiness of necessity, nor can he will not to be
    happy, or to be unhappy. Now since choice is not of the end, but of the
    means, as stated above (<a href="FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>);
    it is not of the perfect good, which is Happiness, but of other particular
    goods. Therefore man chooses not of necessity, but freely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The conclusion does not always of
    necessity follow from the principles, but only when the principles cannot be
    true if the conclusion is not true. In like manner, the end does not always
    necessitate in man the choosing of the means, because the means are not
    always such that the end cannot be gained without them; or, if they be such,
    they are not always considered in that light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reason's decision or judgment of
    what is to be done is about things that are contingent and possible to us.
    In such matters the conclusions do not follow of necessity from principles
    that are absolutely necessary, but from such as are so conditionally; as,
    for instance, "If he runs, he is in motion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If two things be proposed as equal under
    one aspect, nothing hinders us from considering in one of them some
    particular point of superiority, so that the will has a bent towards that
    one rather than towards the other.<br />
