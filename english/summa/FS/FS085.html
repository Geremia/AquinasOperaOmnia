    OF THE EFFECTS OF SIN, AND, FIRST, OF THE CORRUPTION OF THE GOOD OF NATURE
    (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the effects of sin; and (1) the corruption of the good
    of nature; (2) the stain on the soul; (3) the debt of punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the good of nature is
    diminished by sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it can be taken away
    altogether?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the four wounds, mentioned by
    Bede, with which human nature is stricken in consequence of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether privation of mode, species
    and order is an effect of sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether death and other bodily
    defects are the result of sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether they are, in any way,
    natural to man?

  <h3 align="left">Whether sin diminishes the good of nature?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sin does not diminish the good
    of nature. For man's sin is no worse than the devil's. But natural good
    remains unimpaired in devils after sin, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv).
    Therefore neither does sin diminish the good of human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, when that which follows is changed, that
    which precedes remains unchanged, since substance remains the same when its
    accidents are changed. But nature exists before the voluntary action.
    Therefore, when sin has caused a disorder in a voluntary act, nature is not
    changed on that account, so that the good of nature be diminished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin is an action, while diminution is a
    passion. Now no agent is passive by the very reason of its acting, although
    it is possible for it to act on one thing, and to be passive as regards
    another. Therefore he who sins, does not, by his sin, diminish the good of
    his nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no accident acts on its subject: because
    that which is patient is a potential being, while that which is subjected to
    an accident, is already an actual being as regards that accident. But sin is
    in the good of nature as an accident in a subject. Therefore sin does not
    diminish the good of nature, since to diminish is to act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "A certain man going down from Jerusalem to
    Jericho (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++10%3A30"
      >Lk. 10:30</a
    >), i.e. to the corruption of sin, was stripped of his gifts, and wounded in
    his nature," as Bede [*The quotation is from the Glossa Ordinaria of Strabo]
    expounds the passage. Therefore sin diminishes the good of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The good of human nature is threefold. First,
    there are the principles of which nature is constituted, and the properties
    that flow from them, such as the powers of the soul, and so forth. Secondly,
    since man has from nature an inclination to virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), this inclination to
    virtue is a good of nature. Thirdly, the gift of original justice, conferred
    on the whole of human nature in the person of the first man, may be called a
    good of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, the first-mentioned good of nature is neither destroyed nor
    diminished by sin. The third good of nature was entirely destroyed through
    the sin of our first parent. But the second good of nature, viz. the natural
    inclination to virtue, is diminished by sin. Because human acts produce an
    inclination to like acts, as stated above (<a href="FS050.html#FSQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="FS050.html#FSQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now from the very
    fact that thing becomes inclined to one of two contraries, its inclination
    to the other contrary must needs be diminished. Wherefore as sin is opposed
    to virtue, from the very fact that a man sins, there results a diminution of
    that good of nature, which is the inclination to virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius is speaking of the
    first-mentioned good of nature, which consists in "being, living and
    understanding," as anyone may see who reads the context.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although nature precedes the voluntary
    action, it has an inclination to a certain voluntary action. Wherefore
    nature is not changed in itself, through a change in the voluntary action:
    it is the inclination that is changed in so far as it is directed to its
    term.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A voluntary action proceeds from various
    powers, active and passive. The result is that through voluntary actions
    something is caused or taken away in the man who acts, as we have stated
    when treating of the production of habits (<a href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1"
      >Question [51]</a
    >, <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> An accident does not act effectively on
    its subject, but it acts on it formally, in the same sense as when we say
    that whiteness makes a thing white. In this way there is nothing to hinder
    sin from diminishing the good of nature; but only in so far as sin is itself
    a diminution of the good of nature, through being an inordinateness of
    action. But as regards the inordinateness of the agent, we must say that
    such like inordinateness is caused by the fact that in the acts of the soul,
    there is an active, and a passive element: thus the sensible object moves
    the sensitive appetite, and the sensitive appetite inclines the reason and
    will, as stated above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>,
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 2). The result of this is
    the inordinateness, not as though an accident acted on its own subject, but
    in so far as the object acts on the power, and one power acts on another and
    puts it out of order.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the entire good of human nature can be destroyed by sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the entire good of human
    nature can be destroyed by sin. For the good of human nature is finite,
    since human nature itself is finite. Now any finite thing is entirely taken
    away, if the subtraction be continuous. Since therefore the good of nature
    can be continually diminished by sin, it seems that in the end it can be
    entirely taken away.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in a thing of one nature, the whole and
    the parts are uniform, as is evidently the case with air, water, flesh and
    all bodies with similar parts. But the good of nature is wholly uniform.
    Since therefore a part thereof can be taken away by sin, it seems that the
    whole can also be taken away by sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of nature, that is weakened by
    sin, is aptitude for virtue. Now this aptitude is destroyed entirely in some
    on account of sin: thus the lost cannot be restored to virtue any more than
    the blind can to sight. Therefore sin can take away the good of nature
    entirely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Enchiridion xiv) that "evil
    does not exist except in some good." But the evil of sin cannot be in the
    good of virtue or of grace, because they are contrary to it. Therefore it
    must be in the good of nature, and consequently it does not destroy it
    entirely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS085.html#FSQ85A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the good of nature, that is diminished by sin, is the natural
    inclination to virtue, which is befitting to man from the very fact that he
    is a rational being; for it is due to this that he performs actions in
    accord with reason, which is to act virtuously. Now sin cannot entirely take
    away from man the fact that he is a rational being, for then he would no
    longer be capable of sin. Wherefore it is not possible for this good of
    nature to be destroyed entirely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, however, this same good of nature may be continually diminished by
    sin, some, in order to illustrate this, have made use of the example of a
    finite thing being diminished indefinitely, without being entirely
    destroyed. For the Philosopher says (Phys. i, text. 37) that if from a
    finite magnitude a continual subtraction be made in the same quantity, it
    will at last be entirely destroyed, for instance if from any finite length I
    continue to subtract the length of a span. If, however, the subtraction be
    made each time in the same proportion, and not in the same quantity, it may
    go on indefinitely, as, for instance, if a quantity be halved, and one half
    be diminished by half, it will be possible to go on thus indefinitely,
    provided that what is subtracted in each case be less than what was
    subtracted before. But this does not apply to the question at issue, since a
    subsequent sin does not diminish the good of nature less than a previous
    sin, but perhaps more, if it be a more grievous sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must, therefore, explain the matter otherwise by saying that the
    aforesaid inclination is to be considered as a middle term between two
    others: for it is based on the rational nature as on its root, and tends to
    the good of virtue, as to its term and end. Consequently its diminution may
    be understood in two ways: first, on the part of its rood, secondly, on the
    part of its term. In the first way, it is not diminished by sin, because sin
    does not diminish nature, as stated above (<a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). But it is diminished in the second way, in so far as an obstacle is
    placed against its attaining its term. Now if it were diminished in the
    first way, it would needs be entirely destroyed at last by the rational
    nature being entirely destroyed. Since, however, it is diminished on the
    part of the obstacle which is place against its attaining its term, it is
    evident that it can be diminished indefinitely, because obstacles can be
    placed indefinitely, inasmuch as man can go on indefinitely adding sin to
    sin: and yet it cannot be destroyed entirely, because the root of this
    inclination always remains. An example of this may be seen in a transparent
    body, which has an inclination to receive light, from the very fact that it
    is transparent; yet this inclination or aptitude is diminished on the part
    of supervening clouds, although it always remains rooted in the nature of
    the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection avails when diminution is
    made by subtraction. But here the diminution is made by raising obstacles,
    and this neither diminishes nor destroys the root of the inclination, as
    stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The natural inclination is indeed wholly
    uniform: nevertheless it stands in relation both to its principle and to its
    term, in respect of which diversity of relation, it is diminished on the one
    hand, and not on the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even in the lost the natural inclination
    to virtue remains, else they would have no remorse of conscience. That it is
    not reduced to act is owing to their being deprived of grace by Divine
    justice. Thus even in a blind man the aptitude to see remains in the very
    root of his nature, inasmuch as he is an animal naturally endowed with
    sight: yet this aptitude is not reduced to act, for the lack of a cause
    capable of reducing it, by forming the organ requisite for sight.<br />

    Whether weakness, ignorance, malice and concupiscence are suitably reckoned
    as the wounds of nature consequent upon sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that weakness, ignorance, malice
    and concupiscence are not suitably reckoned as the wounds of nature
    consequent upon sin. For one same thing is not both effect and cause of the
    same thing. But these are reckoned to be causes of sin, as appears from what
    has been said above (<a href="FS076.html#FSQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FS076.html#FSQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>,
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,5;
    <a href="FS078.html#FSQ78OUTP1">Question [78]</a>,
    <a href="FS078.html#FSQ78A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore they should
    not be reckoned as effects of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, malice is the name of a sin. Therefore
    it should have no place among the effects of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, concupiscence is something natural,
    since it is an act of the concupiscible power. But that which is natural
    should not be reckoned a wound of nature. Therefore concupiscence should not
    be reckoned a wound of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it has been stated (<a
      href="FS077.html#FSQ77OUTP1"
      >Question [77]</a
    >, <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that to sin from
    weakness is the same as to sin from passion. But concupiscence is a passion.
    Therefore it should not be condivided with weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Nat. et Grat. lxvii, 67)
    reckons "two things to be punishments inflicted on the soul of the sinner,
    viz. ignorance and difficulty," from which arise "error and vexation," which
    four do not coincide with the four in question. Therefore it seems that one
    or the other reckoning is incomplete.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of Bede suffices [*Reference
    not known].
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As a result of original justice, the reason had
    perfect hold over the lower parts of the soul, while reason itself was
    perfected by God, and was subject to Him. Now this same original justice was
    forfeited through the sin of our first parent, as already stated (<a
      href="FS081.html#FSQ81OUTP1"
      >Question [81]</a
    >, <a href="FS081.html#FSQ81A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); so that all the
    powers of the soul are left, as it were, destitute of their proper order,
    whereby they are naturally directed to virtue; which destitution is called a
    wounding of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, there are four of the soul's powers that can be subject of virtue, as
    stated above (<a href="FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), viz. the reason, where
    prudence resides, the will, where justice is, the irascible, the subject of
    fortitude, and the concupiscible, the subject of temperance. Therefore in so
    far as the reason is deprived of its order to the true, there is the wound
    of ignorance; in so far as the will is deprived of its order of good, there
    is the wound of malice; in so far as the irascible is deprived of its order
    to the arduous, there is the wound of weakness; and in so far as the
    concupiscible is deprived of its order to the delectable, moderated by
    reason, there is the wound of concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly these are the four wounds inflicted on the whole of human nature
    as a result of our first parent's sin. But since the inclination to the good
    of virtue is diminished in each individual on account of actual sin, as was
    explained above (<a href="FS085.html#FSQ85ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 2),
    these four wounds are also the result of other sins, in so far as, through
    sin, the reason is obscured, especially in practical matters, the will
    hardened to evil, good actions become more difficult and concupiscence more
    impetuous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is no reason why the effect of one
    sin should not be the cause of another: because the soul, through sinning
    once, is more easily inclined to sin again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Malice is not to be taken here as a sin,
    but as a certain proneness of the will to evil, according to the words of
    Gn. 8:21: "Man's senses are prone to evil from his youth" [*Vulgate: 'The
    imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his
    youth.'].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS082.html#FSQ82OUTP1"
      >Question [82]</a
    >, <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), concupiscence
    is natural to man, in so far as it is subject to reason: whereas, in so far
    as it is goes beyond the bounds of reason, it is unnatural to man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Speaking in a general way, every passion
    can be called a weakness, in so far as it weakens the soul's strength and
    clogs the reason. Bede, however, took weakness in the strict sense, as
    contrary to fortitude which pertains to the irascible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The "difficulty" which is mentioned in
    this book of Augustine, includes the three wounds affecting the appetitive
    powers, viz. "malice," "weakness" and "concupiscence," for it is owing to
    these three that a man finds it difficult to tend to the good. "Error" and
    "vexation" are consequent wounds, since a man is vexed through being
    weakened in respect of the objects of his concupiscence.<br />

    Whether privation of mode, species and order is the effect of sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that privation of mode, species and
    order is not the effect of sin. For Augustine says (De Natura Boni iii) that
    "where these three abound, the good is great; where they are less, there is
    less good; where they are not, there is no good at all." But sin does not
    destroy the good of nature. Therefore it does not destroy mode, species and
    order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is its own cause. But sin itself
    is the "privation of mode, species and order," as Augustine states (De
    Natura Boni iv). Therefore privation of mode, species and order is not the
    effect of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different effects result from different
    sins. Now since mode, species and order are diverse, their corresponding
    privations must be diverse also, and, consequently, must be the result of
    different sins. Therefore privation of mode, species and order is not the
    effect of each sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Sin is to the soul what weakness is to the
    body, according to Ps. 6:3, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak." Now
    weakness deprives the body of mode, species and order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [5], Article [5],
    mode, species and order are consequent upon every created good, as such, and
    also upon every being. Because every being and every good as such depends on
    its form from which it derives its "species." Again, any kind of form,
    whether substantial or accidental, of anything whatever, is according to
    some measure, wherefore it is stated in Metaph. viii, that "the forms of
    things are like numbers," so that a form has a certain "mode" corresponding
    to its measure. Lastly owing to its form, each thing has a relation of
    "order" to something else.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly there are different grades of mode, species and order,
    corresponding to the different degrees of good. For there is a good
    belonging to the very substance of nature, which good has its mode, species
    and order, and is neither destroyed nor diminished by sin. There is again
    the good of the natural inclination, which also has its mode, species and
    order; and this is diminished by sin, as stated above (<a
      href="FS085.html#FSQ85ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), but is not entirely destroyed. Again, there is the good of virtue and
    grace: this too has its mode, species and order, and is entirely taken away
    by sin. Lastly, there is a good consisting in the ordinate act itself, which
    also has its mode, species and order, the privation of which is essentially
    sin. Hence it is clear both how sin is privation of mode, species and order,
    and how it destroys or diminishes mode, species and order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the first two Objections.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mode, species and order follow one from
    the other, as explained above: and so they are destroyed or diminished
    together.<br />

    Whether death and other bodily defects are the result of sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that death and other bodily defects
    are not the result of sin. Because equal causes have equal effects. Now
    these defects are not equal in all, but abound in some more than in others,
    whereas original sin, from which especially these defects seem to result, is
    equal in all, as stated above (<a href="FS082.html#FSQ82OUTP1"
      >Question [82]</a
    >, <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore death and
    suchlike defects are not the result of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if the cause is removed, the effect is
    removed. But these defects are not removed, when all sin is removed by
    Baptism or Penance. Therefore they are not the effect of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, actual sin has more of the character of
    guilt than original sin has. But actual sin does not change the nature of
    the body by subjecting it to some defect. Much less, therefore, does
    original sin. Therefore death and other bodily defects are not the result of
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A12"
      >Rm. 5:12</a
    >), "By one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> One thing causes another in two ways: first, by
    reason of itself; secondly, accidentally. By reason of itself, one thing is
    the cause of another, if it produces its effect by reason of the power of
    its nature or form, the result being that the effect is directly intended by
    the cause. Consequently, as death and such like defects are beside the
    intention of the sinner, it is evident that sin is not, of itself, the cause
    of these defects. Accidentally, one thing is the cause of another if it
    causes it by removing an obstacle: thus it is stated in Phys. viii, text.
    32, that "by displacing a pillar a man moves accidentally the stone resting
    thereon." In this way the sin of our first parent is the cause of death and
    all such like defects in human nature, in so far as by the sin of our first
    parent original justice was taken away, whereby not only were the lower
    powers of the soul held together under the control of reason, without any
    disorder whatever, but also the whole body was held together in subjection
    to the soul, without any defect, as stated in the FP, Question [97], Article
    [1]. Wherefore, original justice being forfeited through the sin of our
    first parent; just as human nature was stricken in the soul by the disorder
    among the powers, as stated above (<a href="FS085.html#FSQ85A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >; <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>,
    <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), so also it became
    subject to corruption, by reason of disorder in the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the withdrawal of original justice has the character of punishment, even
    as the withdrawal of grace has. Consequently, death and all consequent
    bodily defects are punishments of original sin. And although the defects are
    not intended by the sinner, nevertheless they are ordered according to the
    justice of God Who inflicts them as punishments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Causes that produce their effects of
    themselves, if equal, produce equal effects: for if such causes be increased
    or diminished, the effect is increased or diminished. But equal causes of an
    obstacle being removed, do not point to equal effects. For supposing a man
    employs equal force in displacing two columns, it does not follow that the
    movements of the stones resting on them will be equal; but that one will
    move with greater velocity, which has the greater weight according to the
    property of its nature, to which it is left when the obstacle to its falling
    is removed. Accordingly, when original justice is removed, the nature of the
    human body is left to itself, so that according to diverse natural
    temperaments, some men's bodies are subject to more defects, some to fewer,
    although original sin is equal in all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Both original and actual sin are removed
    by the same cause that removes these defects, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A11"
      >Rm. 8:11</a
    >): "He... shall quicken... your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that
    dwelleth in you": but each is done according to the order of Divine wisdom,
    at a fitting time. Because it is right that we should first of all be
    conformed to Christ's sufferings, before attaining to the immortality and
    impassibility of glory, which was begun in Him, and by Him acquired for us.
    Hence it behooves that our bodies should remain, for a time, subject to
    suffering, in order that we may merit the impassibility of glory, in
    conformity with Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Two things may be considered in actual
    sin, the substance of the act, and the aspect of fault. As regards the
    substance of the act, actual sin can cause a bodily defect: thus some sicken
    and die through eating too much. But as regards the fault, it deprives us of
    grace which is given to us that we may regulate the acts of the soul, but
    not that we may ward off defects of the body, as original justice did.
    Wherefore actual sin does not cause those defects, as original sin does.<br />

    Whether death and other defects are natural to man?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that death and such like defects
    are natural to man. For "the corruptible and the incorruptible differ
    generically" (Metaph. x, text. 26). But man is of the same genus as other
    animals which are naturally corruptible. Therefore man is naturally
    corruptible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is composed of contraries is
    naturally corruptible, as having within itself the cause of corruption. But
    such is the human body. Therefore it is naturally corruptible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a hot thing naturally consumes moisture.
    Now human life is preserved by hot and moist elements. Since therefore the
    vital functions are fulfilled by the action of natural heat, as stated in De
    Anima ii, text. 50, it seems that death and such like defects are natural to
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> (1) God made in man whatever is natural to
    him. Now "God made not death" (Wis. 1:13). Therefore death is not natural to
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) Further, that which is natural cannot be called either a punishment or
    an evil: since what is natural to a thing is suitable to it. But death and
    such like defects are the punishment of original sin, as stated above (<a
      href="FS085.html#FSQ85A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >). Therefore they are not natural to man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) Further, matter is proportionate to form, and everything to its end. Now
    man's end is everlasting happiness, as stated above (<a
      href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>;
    <a href="FS005.html#FSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>,
    <a href="FS005.html#FSQ5ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4): and the form of the
    human body is the rational soul, as was proved in the FP, Question [75],
    Article [6]. Therefore the human body is naturally incorruptible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of any corruptible thing in two
    ways; first, in respect of its universal nature, secondly, as regards its
    particular nature. A thing's particular nature is its own power of action
    and self-preservation. And in respect of this nature, every corruption and
    defect is contrary to nature, as stated in De Coelo ii, text. 37, since this
    power tends to the being and preservation of the thing to which it
    belongs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the universal nature is an active force in some universal
    principle of nature, for instance in some heavenly body; or again belonging
    to some superior substance, in which sense God is said by some to be "the
    Nature Who makes nature." This force intends the good and the preservation
    of the universe, for which alternate generation and corruption in things are
    requisite: and in this respect corruption and defect in things are natural,
    not indeed as regards the inclination of the form which is the principle of
    being and perfection, but as regards the inclination of matter which is
    allotted proportionately to its particular form according to the discretion
    of the universal agent. And although every form intends perpetual being as
    far as it can, yet no form of a corruptible being can achieve its own
    perpetuity, except the rational soul; for the reason that the latter is not
    entirely subject to matter, as other forms are; indeed it has an immaterial
    operation of its own, as stated in the FP, Question [75], Article [2].
    Consequently as regards his form, incorruption is more natural to man than
    to other corruptible things. But since that very form has a matter composed
    of contraries, from the inclination of that matter there results
    corruptibility in the whole. In this respect man is naturally corruptible as
    regards the nature of his matter left to itself, but not as regards the
    nature of his form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first three objections argue on the side of the matter; while the other
    three argue on the side of the form. Wherefore in order to solve them, we
    must observe that the form of man which is the rational soul, in respect of
    its incorruptibility is adapted to its end, which is everlasting happiness:
    whereas the human body, which is corruptible, considered in respect of its
    nature, is, in a way, adapted to its form, and, in another way, it is not.
    For we may note a twofold condition in any matter, one which the agent
    chooses, and another which is not chosen by the agent, and is a natural
    condition of matter. Thus, a smith in order to make a knife, chooses a
    matter both hard and flexible, which can be sharpened so as to be useful for
    cutting, and in respect of this condition iron is a matter adapted for a
    knife: but that iron be breakable and inclined to rust, results from the
    natural disposition of iron, nor does the workman choose this in the iron,
    indeed he would do without it if he could: wherefore this disposition of
    matter is not adapted to the workman's intention, nor to the purpose of his
    art. In like manner the human body is the matter chosen by nature in respect
    of its being of a mixed temperament, in order that it may be most suitable
    as an organ of touch and of the other sensitive and motive powers. Whereas
    the fact that it is corruptible is due to a condition of matter, and is not
    chosen by nature: indeed nature would choose an incorruptible matter if it
    could. But God, to Whom every nature is subject, in forming man supplied the
    defect of nature, and by the gift of original justice, gave the body a
    certain incorruptibility, as was stated in the FP, Question [97], Article
    [1]. It is in this sense that it is said that "God made not death," and that
    death is the punishment of sin.<br />
