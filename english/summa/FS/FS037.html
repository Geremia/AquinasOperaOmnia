  <h3 align="center">OF THE EFFECTS OF PAIN OR SORROW (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the effects of pain or of sorrow: under which head
    there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS037.html#FSQ37A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether pain deprives one of the
    power to learn?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS037.html#FSQ37A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the effect of sorrow or
    pain is to burden the soul?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS037.html#FSQ37A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether sorrow or pain weakens all
    activity?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS037.html#FSQ37A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether sorrow is more harmful to
    the body than all the other passions of the soul?<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether pain deprives one of the power to learn?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pain does not deprive one of
    the power to learn. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++26%3A9"
      >Is. 26:9</a
    >): "When Thou shalt do Thy judgments on the earth, the inhabitants of the
    world shall learn justice": and further on (verse 16): "In the tribulation
    of murmuring Thy instruction was with them." But the judgments of God and
    tribulation cause sorrow in men's hearts. Therefore pain or sorrow, far from
    destroying, increases the power of learning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++28%3A9"
      >Is. 28:9</a
    >): "Whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand the
    hearing? Them that are weaned from the milk, that are drawn away from the
    breasts," i.e. from pleasures. But pain and sorrow are most destructive of
    pleasure; since sorrow hinders all pleasure, as stated in Ethic. vii, 14:
    and (Ecclus. 11:29) it is stated that "the affliction of an hour maketh one
    forget great delights." Therefore pain, instead of taking away, increases
    the faculty of learning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, inward sorrow surpasses outward pain, as
    stated above (<a href="FS035.html#FSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>,
    <a href="FS035.html#FSQ35A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). But man can learn while
    sorrowful. Much more, therefore, can he learn while in bodily pain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Soliloq. i, 12): "Although
    during those days I was tormented with a violent tooth-ache, I was not able
    to turn over in my mind other things than those I had already learnt; and as
    to learning anything, I was quite unequal to it, because it required
    undivided attention."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since all the powers of the soul are rooted in
    the one essence of the soul, it must needs happen, when the intention of the
    soul is strongly drawn towards the action of one power, that it is withdrawn
    from the action of another power: because the soul, being one, can only have
    one intention. The result is that if one thing draws upon itself the entire
    intention of the soul, or a great portion thereof, anything else requiring
    considerable attention is incompatible therewith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is evident that sensible pain above all draws the soul's attention to
    itself; because it is natural for each thing to tend wholly to repel
    whatever is contrary to it, as may be observed even in natural things. It is
    likewise evident that in order to learn anything new, we require study and
    effort with a strong intention, as is clearly stated in Prov. 2:4,5: "If
    thou shalt seek wisdom as money, and shall dig for her as for a treasure,
    then shalt thou understand learning" [Vulg: 'the fear of the Lord'].
    Consequently if the pain be acute, man is prevented at the time from
    learning anything: indeed it can be so acute, that, as long as it lasts, a
    man is unable to give his attention even to that which he knew already.
    However a difference is to be observed according to the difference of love
    that a man has for learning or for considering: because the greater his
    love, the more will he retain the intention of his mind so as to prevent it
    from turning entirely to the pain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Moderate sorrow, that does not cause the
    mind to wander, can conduce to the acquisition of learning especially in
    regard to those things by which a man hopes to be freed from sorrow. And
    thus, "in the tribulation of murmuring," men are more apt to be taught by
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Both pleasure and pain, in so far as
    they draw upon themselves the soul's intention, hinder the reason from the
    act of consideration, wherefore it is stated in Ethic. vii, 11 that "in the
    moment of sexual pleasure, a man cannot understand anything." Nevertheless
    pain attracts the soul's intention more than pleasure does: thus we observe
    in natural things that the action of a natural body is more intense in
    regard to its contrary; for instance, hot water is more accessible to the
    action of cold, and in consequence freezes harder. If therefore pain or
    sorrow be moderate, it can conduce accidentally to the facility of learning,
    in so far as it takes away an excess of pleasure. But, of itself, it is a
    hindrance; and if it be intense, it prevents it altogether.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> External pain arises from hurt done to
    the body, so that it involves bodily transmutation more than inward sorrow
    does: and yet the latter is greater in regard to the formal element of pain,
    which belongs to the soul. Consequently bodily pain is a greater hindrance
    to contemplation which requires complete repose, than inward sorrow is.
    Nevertheless if inward sorrow be very intense, it attracts the intention, so
    that man is unable to learn anything for the first time: wherefore on
    account of sorrow Gregory interrupted his commentary on Ezechiel (Hom. xxii
    in Ezechiel).<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the effect of sorrow or pain is to burden the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not an effect of sorrow
    to burden the soul. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++7%3A11"
      >2 Cor. 7:11</a
    >): "Behold this self-same thing, that you were made sorrowful according to
    God, how great carefulness it worketh in you: yea, defence, yea
    indignation," etc. Now carefulness and indignation imply that the soul is
    uplifted, which is contrary to being depressed. Therefore depression is not
    an effect of sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sorrow is contrary to pleasure. But the
    effect of pleasure is expansion: the opposite of which is not depression but
    contraction. Therefore depression should not be reckoned as an effect of
    sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sorrow consumes those who are inflicted
    therewith, as may be gathered from the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++2%3A7"
      >2 Cor. 2:7</a
    >): "Lest perhaps such an one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." But
    that which is depressed is not consumed; nay, it is weighed down by
    something heavy, whereas that which is consumed enters within the consumer.
    Therefore depression should not be reckoned an effect of sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.
    xix.] and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 14) speak of "depressing sorrow."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The effects of the soul's passions are
    sometimes named metaphorically, from a likeness to sensible bodies: for the
    reason that the movements of the animal appetite are like the inclinations
    of the natural appetite. And in this way fervor is ascribed to love,
    expansion to pleasure, and depression to sorrow. For a man is said to be
    depressed, through being hindered in his own movement by some weight. Now it
    is evident from what has been said above (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS036.html#FSQ36OUTP1">Question [36]</a>,
    <a href="FS036.html#FSQ36A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that sorrow is caused by
    a present evil: and this evil, from the very fact that it is repugnant to
    the movement of the will, depresses the soul, inasmuch as it hinders it from
    enjoying that which it wishes to enjoy. And if the evil which is the cause
    of sorrow be not so strong as to deprive one of the hope of avoiding it,
    although the soul be depressed in so far as, for the present, it fails to
    grasp that which it craves for; yet it retains the movement whereby to
    repulse that evil. If, on the other hand, the strength of the evil be such
    as to exclude the hope of evasion, then even the interior movement of the
    afflicted soul is absolutely hindered, so that it cannot turn aside either
    this way or that. Sometimes even the external movement of the body is
    paralyzed, so that a man becomes completely stupefied.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That uplifting of the soul ensues from
    the sorrow which is according to God, because it brings with it the hope of
    the forgiveness of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As far as the movement of the appetite
    is concerned, contraction and depression amount to the same: because the
    soul, through being depressed so as to be unable to attend freely to outward
    things, withdraws to itself, closing itself up as it were.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sorrow is said to consume man, when the
    force of the afflicting evil is such as to shut out all hope of evasion: and
    thus also it both depresses and consumes at the same time. For certain
    things, taken metaphorically, imply one another, which taken literally,
    appear to exclude one another.<br />

    ><br />
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether sorrow or pain weakens all activity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sorrow does not weaken all
    activity. Because carefulness is caused by sorrow, as is clear from the
    passage of the Apostle quoted above (<a href="FS037.html#FSQ37A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, Objection [1]). But carefulness conduces to good work: wherefore the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++2%3A15"
      >2 Tim. 2:15</a
    >): "Carefully study to present thyself... a workman that needeth not to be
    ashamed." Therefore sorrow is not a hindrance to work, but helps one to work
    well.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sorrow causes desire in many cases, as
    stated in Ethic. vii, 14. But desire causes intensity of action. Therefore
    sorrow does too.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as some actions are proper to the
    joyful, so are others proper to the sorrowful; for instance, to mourn. Now a
    thing is improved by that which is suitable to it. Therefore certain actions
    are not hindered but improved by reason of sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that
    "pleasure perfects action," whereas on the other hand, "sorrow hinders it"
    (Ethic. x, 5).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS037.html#FSQ37A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), sorrow at times does not depress or consume the soul, so as to shut out
    all movement, internal or external; but certain movements are sometimes
    caused by sorrow itself. Accordingly action stands in a twofold relation to
    sorrow. First, as being the object of sorrow: and thus sorrow hinders any
    action: for we never do that which we do with sorrow, so well as that which
    we do with pleasure, or without sorrow. The reason for this is that the will
    is the cause of human actions: and consequently when we do something that
    gives pain, the action must of necessity be weakened in consequence.
    Secondly, action stands in relation to sorrow, as to its principle and
    cause: and such action must needs be improved by sorrow: thus the more one
    sorrows on account of a certain thing, the more one strives to shake off
    sorrow, provided there is a hope of shaking it off: otherwise no movement or
    action would result from that sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>From what has been said the replies to the objections are evident.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether sorrow is more harmful to the body than the other passions of the
    soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sorrow is not most harmful to
    the body. For sorrow has a spiritual existence in the soul. But those things
    which have only a spiritual existence do not cause a transmutation in the
    body: as is evident with regard to the images of colors, which images are in
    the air and do not give color to bodies. Therefore sorrow is not harmful to
    the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further if it be harmful to the body, this can
    only be due to its having a bodily transmutation in conjunction with it. But
    bodily transmutation takes place in all the passions of the soul, as stated
    above (<a href="FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>,
    <a href="FS022.html#FSQ22ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). Therefore sorrow is
    not more harmful to the body than the other passions of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 3)
    that "anger and desire drive some to madness": which seems to be a very
    great harm, since reason is the most excellent thing in man. Moreover,
    despair seems to be more harmful than sorrow; for it is the cause of sorrow.
    Therefore sorrow is not more harmful to the body than the other passions of
    the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++17%3A22"
      >Prov. 17:22</a
    >): "A joyful mind maketh age flourishing: a sorrowful spirit drieth up the
    bones": and (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++25%3A20"
      >Prov. 25:20</a
    >): "As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of
    a man consumeth the heart": and (Ecclus. 38:19): "Of sadness cometh
    death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Of all the soul's passions, sorrow is most
    harmful to the body. The reason of this is because sorrow is repugnant to
    man's life in respect of the species of its movement, and not merely in
    respect of its measure or quantity, as is the case with the other passions
    of the soul. For man's life consists in a certain movement, which flows from
    the heart to the other parts of the body: and this movement is befitting to
    human nature according to a certain fixed measure. Consequently if this
    movement goes beyond the right measure, it will be repugnant to man's life
    in respect of the measure of quantity; but not in respect of its specific
    character: whereas if this movement be hindered in its progress, it will be
    repugnant to life in respect of its species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it must be noted that, in all the passions of the soul, the bodily
    transmutation which is their material element, is in conformity with and in
    proportion to the appetitive movement, which is the formal element: just as
    in everything matter is proportionate to form. Consequently those passions
    that imply a movement of the appetite in pursuit of something, are not
    repugnant to the vital movement as regards its species, but they may be
    repugnant thereto as regards its measure: such are love, joy, desire and the
    like; wherefore these passions conduce to the well-being of the body;
    though, if they be excessive, they may be harmful to it. On the other hand,
    those passions which denote in the appetite a movement of flight or
    contraction, are repugnant to the vital movement, not only as regards its
    measure, but also as regards its species; wherefore they are simply harmful:
    such are fear and despair, and above all sorrow which depresses the soul by
    reason of a present evil, which makes a stronger impression than future
    evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the soul naturally moves the body,
    the spiritual movement of the soul is naturally the cause of bodily
    transmutation. Nor is there any parallel with spiritual images, because they
    are not naturally ordained to move such other bodies as are not naturally
    moved by the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Other passions imply a bodily
    transmutation which is specifically in conformity with the vital movement:
    whereas sorrow implies a transmutation that is repugnant thereto, as stated
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A lesser cause suffices to hinder the
    use of reason, than to destroy life: since we observe that many ailments
    deprive one of the use of reason, before depriving one of life. Nevertheless
    fear and anger cause very great harm to the body, by reason of the sorrow
    which they imply, and which arises from the absence of the thing desired.
    Moreover sorrow too sometimes deprives man of the use of reason: as may be
    seen in those who through sorrow become a prey to melancholy or madness.<br />
