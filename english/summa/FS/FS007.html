    Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a circumstance is not an
    accident of a human act. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhetor. i) that a
    circumstance is that from "which an orator adds authority and strength to
    his argument." But oratorical arguments are derived principally from things
    pertaining to the essence of a thing, such as the definition, the genus, the
    species, and the like, from which also Tully declares that an orator should
    draw his arguments. Therefore a circumstance is not an accident of a human
    act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "to be in" is proper to an accident. But
    that which surrounds [circumstat] is rather out than in. Therefore the
    circumstances are not accidents of human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an accident has no accident. But human
    acts themselves are accidents. Therefore the circumstances are not accidents
    of acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The particular conditions of any singular
    thing are called its individuating accidents. But the Philosopher (Ethic.
    iii, 1) calls the circumstances particular things [*{ta kath' ekasta}], i.e.
    the particular conditions of each act. Therefore the circumstances are
    individual accidents of human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since, according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm.
    i), "words are the signs of what we understand," it must needs be that in
    naming things we follow the process of intellectual knowledge. Now our
    intellectual knowledge proceeds from the better known to the less known.
    Accordingly with us, names of more obvious things are transferred so as to
    signify things less obvious: and hence it is that, as stated in Metaph. x,
    4, "the notion of distance has been transferred from things that are apart
    locally, to all kinds of opposition": and in like manner words that signify
    local movement are employed to designate all other movements, because bodies
    which are circumscribed by place, are best known to us. And hence it is that
    the word "circumstance" has passed from located things to human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in things located, that is said to surround something, which is outside
    it, but touches it, or is placed near it. Accordingly, whatever conditions
    are outside the substance of an act, and yet in some way touch the human
    act, are called circumstances. Now what is outside a thing's substance,
    while it belongs to that thing, is called its accident. Wherefore the
    circumstances of human acts should be called their accidents.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The orator gives strength to his
    argument, in the first place, from the substance of the act; and secondly,
    from the circumstances of the act. Thus a man becomes indictable, first,
    through being guilty of murder; secondly, through having done it
    fraudulently, or from motives of greed or at a holy time or place, and so
    forth. And so in the passage quoted, it is said pointedly that the orator
    "adds strength to his argument," as though this were something secondary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A thing is said to be an accident of
    something in two ways. First, from being in that thing: thus, whiteness is
    said to be an accident of Socrates. Secondly, because it is together with
    that thing in the same subject: thus, whiteness is an accident of the art of
    music, inasmuch as they meet in the same subject, so as to touch one
    another, as it were. And in this sense circumstances are said to be the
    accidents of human acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (ad 2), an accident is
    said to be the accident of an accident, from the fact that they meet in the
    same subject. But this happens in two ways. First, in so far as two
    accidents are both related to the same subject, without any relation to one
    another; as whiteness and the art of music in Socrates. Secondly, when such
    accidents are related to one another; as when the subject receives one
    accident by means of the other; for instance, a body receives color by means
    of its surface. And thus also is one accident said to be in another; for we
    speak of color as being in the surface.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, circumstances are related to acts in both these ways. For some
    circumstances that have a relation to acts, belong to the agent otherwise
    than through the act; as place and condition of person; whereas others
    belong to the agent by reason of the act, as the manner in which the act is
    done.<br />

    Whether theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that theologians should not take
    note of the circumstances of human acts. Because theologians do not consider
    human acts otherwise than according to their quality of good or evil. But it
    seems that circumstances cannot give quality to human acts; for a thing is
    never qualified, formally speaking, by that which is outside it; but by that
    which is in it. Therefore theologians should not take note of the
    circumstances of acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, circumstances are the accidents of acts.
    But one thing may be subject to an infinity of accidents; hence the
    Philosopher says (Metaph. vi, 2) that "no art or science considers
    accidental being, except only the art of sophistry." Therefore the
    theologian has not to consider circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the consideration of circumstances
    belongs to the orator. But oratory is not a part of theology. Therefore it
    is not a theologian's business to consider circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ignorance of circumstances causes an act to
    be involuntary, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 24) and Gregory of
    Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxxi.]. But involuntariness excuses from sin,
    the consideration of which belongs to the theologian. Therefore
    circumstances also should be considered by the theologian.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Circumstances come under the consideration of
    the theologian, for a threefold reason. First, because the theologian
    considers human acts, inasmuch as man is thereby directed to Happiness. Now,
    everything that is directed to an end should be proportionate to that end.
    But acts are made proportionate to an end by means of a certain
    commensurateness, which results from the due circumstances. Hence the
    theologian has to consider the circumstances. Secondly, because the
    theologian considers human acts according as they are found to be good or
    evil, better or worse: and this diversity depends on circumstances, as we
    shall see further on (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [10]</a>,11;
    <a href="FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="FS073.html#FSQ73A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Thirdly, because the
    theologian considers human acts under the aspect of merit and demerit, which
    is proper to human acts; and for this it is requisite that they be
    voluntary. Now a human act is deemed to be voluntary or involuntary,
    according to knowledge or ignorance of circumstances, as stated above (<a
      href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore the
    theologian has to consider circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Good directed to the end is said to be
    useful; and this implies some kind of relation: wherefore the Philosopher
    says (Ethic. i, 6) that "the good in the genus 'relation' is the useful."
    Now, in the genus "relation" a thing is denominated not only according to
    that which is inherent in the thing, but also according to that which is
    extrinsic to it: as may be seen in the expressions "right" and "left,"
    "equal" and "unequal," and such like. Accordingly, since the goodness of
    acts consists in their utility to the end, nothing hinders their being
    called good or bad according to their proportion to extrinsic things that
    are adjacent to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Accidents which are altogether
    accidental are neglected by every art, by reason of their uncertainty and
    infinity. But such like accidents are not what we call circumstances;
    because circumstances although, as stated above (<a
      href="FS007.html#FSQ7A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), they are extrinsic to the act, nevertheless are in a kind of contact
    with it, by being related to it. Proper accidents, however, come under the
    consideration of art.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The consideration of circumstances
    belongs to the moralist, the politician, and the orator. To the moralist, in
    so far as with respect to circumstances we find or lose the mean of virtue
    in human acts and passions. To the politician and to the orator, in so far
    as circumstances make acts to be worthy of praise or blame, of excuse or
    indictment. In different ways, however: because where the orator persuades,
    the politician judges. To the theologian this consideration belongs, in all
    the aforesaid ways: since to him all the other arts are subservient: for he
    has to consider virtuous and vicious acts, just as the moralist does; and
    with the orator and politician he considers acts according as they are
    deserving of reward or punishment.<br />

    Whether the circumstances are properly set forth in the third book of
    Ethics?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the circumstances are not
    properly set forth in Ethic. iii, 1. For a circumstance of an act is
    described as something outside the act. Now time and place answer to this
    description. Therefore there are only two circumstances, to wit, "when" and
    "where."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we judge from the circumstances whether
    a thing is well or ill done. But this belongs to the mode of an act.
    Therefore all the circumstances are included under one, which is the "mode
    of acting."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, circumstances are not part of the
    substance of an act. But the causes of an act seem to belong to its
    substance. Therefore no circumstance should be taken from the cause of the
    act itself. Accordingly, neither "who," nor "why," nor "about what," are
    circumstances: since "who" refers to the efficient cause, "why" to the final
    cause, and "about what" to the material cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>On the contrary is the authority of the Philosopher in Ethic. iii, 1.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Tully, in his Rhetoric (De Invent. Rhetor. i),
    gives seven circumstances, which are contained in this verse:<br />
  </p>
  <p>"Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando---</p>
  <p>
    Who, what, where, by what aids, why, how, and when." For in acts we must
    take note of "who" did it, "by what aids" or "instruments" he did it, "what"
    he did, "where" he did it, "why" he did it, "how" and "when" he did it. But
    Aristotle in Ethic. iii, 1 adds yet another, to wit, "about what," which
    Tully includes in the circumstance "what."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason of this enumeration may be set down as follows. For a
    circumstance is described as something outside the substance of the act, and
    yet in a way touching it. Now this happens in three ways: first, inasmuch as
    it touches the act itself; secondly, inasmuch as it touches the cause of the
    act; thirdly, inasmuch as it touches the effect. It touches the act itself,
    either by way of measure, as "time" and "place"; or by qualifying the act as
    the "mode of acting." It touches the effect when we consider "what" is done.
    It touches the cause of the act, as to the final cause, by the circumstance
    "why"; as to the material cause, or object, in the circumstance "about
    what"; as to the principal efficient cause, in the circumstance "who"; and
    as to the instrumental efficient cause, in the circumstance "by what
    aids."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Time and place surround [circumstant]
    the act by way of measure; but the others surround the act by touching it in
    any other way, while they are extrinsic to the substance of the act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This mode "well" or "ill" is not a
    circumstance, but results from all the circumstances. But the mode which
    refers to a quality of the act is a special circumstance; for instance, that
    a man walk fast or slowly; that he strike hard or gently, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A condition of the cause, on which the
    substance of the act depends, is not a circumstance; it must be an
    additional condition. Thus, in regard to the object, it is not a
    circumstance of theft that the object is another's property, for this
    belongs to the substance of the act; but that it be great or small. And the
    same applies to the other circumstances which are considered in reference to
    the other causes. For the end that specifies the act is not a circumstance,
    but some additional end. Thus, that a valiant man act "valiantly for the
    sake of" the good of the virtue or fortitude, is not a circumstance; but if
    he act valiantly for the sake of the delivery of the state, or of
    Christendom, or some such purpose. The same is to be said with regard to the
    circumstance "what"; for that a man by pouring water on someone should
    happen to wash him, is not a circumstance of the washing; but that in doing
    so he give him a chill, or scald him; heal him or harm him, these are
    circumstances.<br />

    Whether the most important circumstances are "why" and "in what the act
    consists"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these are not the most
    important circumstances, namely, "why" and those "in which the act is, [*hen
    ois e praxis]" as stated in Ethic. iii, 1. For those in which the act is
    seem to be place and time: and these do not seem to be the most important of
    the circumstances, since, of them all, they are the most extrinsic to the
    act. Therefore those things in which the act is are not the most important
    circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end of a thing is extrinsic to it.
    Therefore it is not the most important circumstance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which holds the foremost place in
    regard to each thing, is its cause and its form. But the cause of an act is
    the person that does it; while the form of an act is the manner in which it
    is done. Therefore these two circumstances seem to be of the greatest
    importance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.
    xxxi.] says that "the most important circumstances" are "why it is done" and
    "what is done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), acts are properly
    called human, inasmuch as they are voluntary. Now, the motive and object of
    the will is the end. Therefore that circumstance is the most important of
    all which touches the act on the part of the end, viz. the circumstance
    "why": and the second in importance, is that which touches the very
    substance of the act, viz. the circumstance "what he did." As to the other
    circumstances, they are more or less important, according as they more or
    less approach to these.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By those things "in which the act is"
    the Philosopher does not mean time and place, but those circumstances that
    are affixed to the act itself. Wherefore Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De
    Nat. Hom. xxxi], as though he were explaining the dictum of the Philosopher,
    instead of the latter's term---"in which the act is"---said, "what is
    done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the end is not part of the
    substance of the act, yet it is the most important cause of the act,
    inasmuch as it moves the agent to act. Wherefore the moral act is specified
    chiefly by the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The person that does the act is the
    cause of that act, inasmuch as he is moved thereto by the end; and it is
    chiefly in this respect that he is directed to the act; while other
    conditions of the person have not such an important relation to the act. As
    to the mode, it is not the substantial form of the act, for in an act the
    substantial form depends on the object and term or end; but it is, as it
    were, a certain accidental quality of the act.<br />
