  <h3 align="center">OF THE SUBJECT OF SIN (TEN ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the subject of vice or sin: under which head there are
    ten points of inquiry:<br />

    non-morose delectation be subjected in the higher reason?<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    act of sin is subjected in the higher reason?<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    the subject of mortal sin?
  </p>
  <p>

    the subject of venial sin?
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the will is a subject of sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will cannot be a subject
    of sin. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "evil is outside the will and
    the intention." But sin has the character of evil. Therefore sin cannot be
    in the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the will is directed either to the good
    or to what seems good. Now from the fact that will wishes the good, it does
    not sin: and that it wishes what seems good but is not truly good, points to
    a defect in the apprehensive power rather than in the will. Therefore sin is
    nowise in the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be both subject
    and efficient cause of sin: because "the efficient and the material cause do
    not coincide" (Phys. 2, text. 70). Now the will is the efficient cause of
    sin: because the first cause of sinning is the will, as Augustine states (De
    Duabus Anim. x, 10,11). Therefore it is not the subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is by
    the will that we sin, and live righteously."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sin is an act, as stated above (<a
      href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1"
      >Question [71]</a
    >, <a href="FS071.html#FSQ71ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,6). Now some acts pass
    into external matter, e.g. "to cut" and "to burn": and such acts have for
    their matter and subject, the thing into which the action passes: thus the
    Philosopher states (Phys. iii, text. 18) that "movement is the act of the
    thing moved, caused by a mover." On the other hand, there are acts which do
    not pass into external matter, but remain in the agent, e.g. "to desire" and
    "to know": and such are all moral acts, whether virtuous or sinful.
    Consequently the proper subject of sin must needs be the power which is the
    principle of the act. Now since it is proper to moral acts that they are
    voluntary, as stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), it follows that the
    will, which is the principle of voluntary acts, both of good acts, and of
    evil acts or sins, is the principle of sins. Therefore it follows that sin
    is in the will as its subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Evil is said to be outside the will,
    because the will does not tend to it under the aspect of evil. But since
    some evil is an apparent good, the will sometimes desires an evil, and in
    this sense is in the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the defect in the apprehensive power
    were nowise subject to the will, there would be no sin, either in the will,
    or in the apprehensive power, as in the case of those whose ignorance is
    invincible. It remains therefore that when there is in the apprehensive
    power a defect that is subject to the will, this defect also is deemed a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument applies to those efficient
    causes whose actions pass into external matter, and which do not move
    themselves, but move other things; the contrary of which is to be observed
    in the will; hence the argument does not prove.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the will alone is the subject of sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will alone is the subject
    of sin. For Augustine says (De Duabus Anim. x, 10) that "no one sins except
    by the will." Now the subject of sin is the power by which we sin. Therefore
    the will alone is the subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin is an evil contrary to reason. Now
    good and evil pertaining to reason are the object of the will alone.
    Therefore the will alone is the subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sin is a voluntary act, because,
    as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18) [*Cf. De Vera Relig. xiv.], "so
    true is it that every sin is voluntary, that unless it be voluntary, it is
    no sin at all." Now the acts of the other powers are not voluntary, except
    in so far as those powers are moved by the will; nor does this suffice for
    them to be the subject of sin, because then even the external members of the
    body, which are moved by the will, would be a subject of sin; which is
    clearly untrue. Therefore the will alone is the subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Sin is contrary to virtue: and contraries are
    about one same thing. But the other powers of the soul, besides the will,
    are the subject of virtues, as stated above (<a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1"
      >Question [56]</a
    >). Therefore the will is not the only subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was shown above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), whatever is the a principle of a voluntary act is a subject of sin. Now
    voluntary acts are not only those which are elicited by the will, but also
    those which are commanded by the will, as we stated above (<a
      href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) in treating of
    voluntariness. Therefore not only the will can be a subject of sin, but also
    all those powers which can be moved to their acts, or restrained from their
    acts, by the will; and these same powers are the subjects of good and evil
    moral habits, because act and habit belong to the same subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We do not sin except by the will as
    first mover; but we sin by the other powers as moved by the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Good and evil pertain to the will as its
    proper objects; but the other powers have certain determinate goods and
    evils, by reason of which they can be the subject of virtue, vice, and sin,
    in so far as they partake of will and reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The members of the body are not
    principles but merely organs of action: wherefore they are compared to the
    soul which moves them, as a slave who is moved but moves no other. On the
    other hand, the internal appetitive powers are compared to reason as free
    agents, because they both act and are acted upon, as is made clear in Polit.
    i, 3. Moreover, the acts of the external members are actions that pass into
    external matter, as may be seen in the blow that is inflicted in the sin of
    murder. Consequently there is no comparison.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there can be sin in the sensuality?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be sin in the
    sensuality. For sin is proper to man who is praised or blamed for his
    actions. Now sensuality is common to us and irrational animals. Therefore
    sin cannot be in the sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "no man sins in what he cannot avoid,"
    as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18). But man cannot prevent the
    movement of the sensuality from being inordinate, since "the sensuality ever
    remains corrupt, so long as we abide in this mortal life; wherefore it is
    signified by the serpent," as Augustine declares (De Trin. xii, 12,13).
    Therefore the inordinate movement of the sensuality is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which man himself does not do is
    not imputed to him as a sin. Now "that alone do we seem to do ourselves,
    which we do with the deliberation of reason," as the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. ix, 8). Therefore the movement of the sensuality, which is without
    the deliberation of reason, is not imputed to a man as a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A19"
      >Rm. 7:19</a
    >): "The good which I will I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I
    do": which words Augustine explains (Contra Julian. iii, 26; De Verb. Apost.
    xii, 2,3), as referring to the evil of concupiscence, which is clearly a
    movement of the sensuality. Therefore there can be sin in the sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,3), sin may be found in any power whose act can be voluntary and
    inordinate, wherein consists the nature of sin. Now it is evident that the
    act of the sensuality, or sensitive appetite, is naturally inclined to be
    moved by the will. Wherefore it follows that sin can be in the
    sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although some of the powers of the
    sensitive part are common to us and irrational animals, nevertheless, in us,
    they have a certain excellence through being united to the reason; thus we
    surpass other animals in the sensitive part for as much as we have the
    powers of cogitation and reminiscence, as stated in the FP, Question [78],
    Article [4]. In the same way our sensitive appetite surpasses that of other
    animals by reason of a certain excellence consisting in its natural aptitude
    to obey the reason; and in this respect it can be the principle of a
    voluntary action, and, consequently, the subject of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The continual corruption of the
    sensuality is to be understood as referring to the "fomes," which is never
    completely destroyed in this life, since, though the stain of original sin
    passes, its effect remains. However, this corruption of the "fomes" does not
    hinder man from using his rational will to check individual inordinate
    movements, if he be presentient to them, for instance by turning his
    thoughts to other things. Yet while he is turning his thoughts to something
    else, an inordinate movement may arise about this also: thus when a man, in
    order to avoid the movements of concupiscence, turns his thoughts away from
    carnal pleasures, to the considerations of science, sometimes an
    unpremeditated movement of vainglory will arise. Consequently, a man cannot
    avoid all such movements, on account of the aforesaid corruption: but it is
    enough, for the conditions of a voluntary sin, that he be able to avoid each
    single one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man does not do perfectly himself what
    he does without the deliberation of reason, since the principal part of man
    does nothing therein: wherefore such is not perfectly a human act; and
    consequently it cannot be a perfect act of virtue or of sin, but is
    something imperfect of that kind. Therefore such movement of the sensuality
    as forestalls the reason, is a venial sin, which is something imperfect in
    the genus of sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether mortal sin can be in the sensuality?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that mortal sin can be in the
    sensuality. Because an act is discerned by its object. Now it is possible to
    commit a mortal sin about the objects of the sensuality, e.g. about carnal
    pleasures. Therefore the act of the sensuality can be a mortal sin, so that
    mortal sin can be found in the sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, mortal sin is opposed to virtue. But
    virtue can be in the sensuality; for temperance and fortitude are virtues of
    the irrational parts, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. iii, 10). Therefore,
    since it is natural to contraries to be about the same subject, sensuality
    can be the subject of mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, venial sin is a disposition to mortal
    sin. Now disposition and habit are in the same subject. Since therefore
    venial sin may be in the sensuality, as stated above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, ad 3), mortal sin can be there also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 23): "The
    inordinate movement of concupiscence, which is the sin of the sensuality,
    can even be in those who are in a state of grace," in whom, however, mortal
    sin is not to be found. Therefore the inordinate movement of the sensuality
    is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as a disorder which destroys the principle
    of the body's life causes the body's death, so too a disorder which destroys
    the principle of spiritual life, viz. the last end, causes spiritual death,
    which is mortal sin, as stated above (<a href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1"
      >Question [72]</a
    >, <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now it belongs to the
    reason alone, and not to the sensuality, to order anything to the end: and
    disorder in respect of the end can only belong to the power whose function
    it is to order others to the end. Wherefore mortal sin cannot be in the
    sensuality, but only in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The act of the sensuality can concur
    towards a mortal sin: yet the fact of its being a mortal sin is due, not to
    its being an act of the sensuality, but to its being an act of reason, to
    whom the ordering to the end belongs. Consequently mortal sin is imputed,
    not to the sensuality, but to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An act of virtue is perfected not only
    in that it is an act of the sensuality, but still more in the fact of its
    being an act of reason and will, whose function it is to choose: for the act
    of moral virtue is not without the exercise of choice: wherefore the act of
    moral virtue, which perfects the appetitive power, is always accompanied by
    an act of prudence, which perfects the rational power; and the same applies
    to mortal sin, as stated (ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A disposition may be related in three
    ways to that to which it disposes: for sometimes it is the same thing and is
    in the same subject; thus inchoate science is a disposition to perfect
    science: sometimes it is in the same subject, but is not the same thing;
    thus heat is a disposition to the form of fire: sometimes it is neither the
    same thing, nor in the same subject, as in those things which are
    subordinate to one another in such a way that we can arrive at one through
    the other, e.g. goodness of the imagination is a disposition to science
    which is in the intellect. In this way the venial sin that is in the
    sensuality, may be a disposition to mortal sin, which is in the reason.<br />

    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sin cannot be in the reason.
    For the sin of any power is a defect thereof. But the fault of the reason is
    not a sin, on the contrary, it excuses sin: for a man is excused from sin on
    account of ignorance. Therefore sin cannot be in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the primary object of sin is the will,
    as stated above (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now
    reason precedes the will, since it directs it. Therefore sin cannot be in
    the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there can be no sin except about things
    which are under our control. Now perfection and defect of reason are not
    among those things which are under our control: since by nature some are
    mentally deficient, and some shrewd-minded. Therefore no sin is in the
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12) that sin is
    in the lower and in the higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sin of any power is an act of that power,
    as we have clearly shown (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a
    >,2,3). Now reason has a twofold act: one is its proper act in respect of
    its proper object, and this is the act of knowing the truth; the other is
    the act of reason as directing the other powers. Now in both of these ways
    there may be sin in the reason. First, in so far as it errs in the knowledge
    of truth, which error is imputed to the reason as a sin, when it is in
    ignorance or error about what it is able and ought to know: secondly, when
    it either commands the inordinate movements of the lower powers, or
    deliberately fails to check them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the defect in
    the proper act of the reason in respect of its proper object, and with
    regard to the case when it is a defect of knowledge about something which
    one is unable to know: for then this defect of reason is not a sin, and
    excuses from sin, as is evident with regard to the actions of madmen. If,
    however, the defect of reason be about something which a man is able and
    ought to know, he is not altogether excused from sin, and the defect is
    imputed to him as a sin. The defect which belongs only to the act of
    directing the other powers, is always imputed to reason as a sin, because it
    can always obviate this defect by means of its proper act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1"
      >Question [17]</a
    >, <a href="FS017.html#FSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), when we were treating
    of the acts of the will and reason, the will moves and precedes the reason,
    in one way, and the reason moves and precedes the will in another: so that
    both the movement of the will can be called rational, and the act of the
    reason, voluntary. Accordingly sin is found in the reason, either through
    being a voluntary defect of the reason, or through the reason being the
    principle of the will's act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Reply to the Third Objection is evident from what has been said (ad
    1).<br />

    Whether the sin of morose delectation is in the reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of morose delectation
    is not in the reason. For delectation denotes a movement of the appetitive
    power, as stated above (<a href="FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>,
    <a href="FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the appetitive power
    is distinct from the reason, which is an apprehensive power. Therefore
    morose delectation is not in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object shows to which power an act
    belongs, since it is through the act that the power is directed to its
    object. Now a morose delectation is sometimes about sensible goods, and not
    about the goods of the reason. Therefore the sin of morose delectation is
    not in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a thing is said to be morose [*From the
    Latin 'mora'---delay] through taking a length of time. But length of time is
    no reason why an act should belong to a particular power. Therefore morose
    delectation does not belong to the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12) that "if
    the consent to a sensual delectation goes no further than the mere thought
    of the pleasure, I deem this to be like as though the woman alone had
    partaken of the forbidden fruit." Now "the woman" denotes the lower reason,
    as he himself explains (De Trin. xii, 12). Therefore the sin of morose
    delectation is in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), sin may be in the reason, not only in respect of reason's proper act,
    but sometimes in respect of its directing human actions. Now it is evident
    that reason directs not only external acts, but also internal passions.
    Consequently when the reason fails in directing the internal passions, sin
    is said to be in the reason, as also when it fails in directing external
    actions. Now it fails, in two ways, in directing internal passions: first,
    when it commands unlawful passions; for instance, when a man deliberately
    provokes himself to a movement of anger, or of lust: secondly, when it fails
    to check the unlawful movement of a passion; for instance, when a man,
    having deliberately considered that a rising movement of passion is
    inordinate, continues, notwithstanding, to dwell [immoratur] upon it, and
    fails to drive it away. And in this sense the sin of morose delectation is
    said to be in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Delectation is indeed in the appetitive
    power as its proximate principle; but it is in the reason as its first
    mover, in accordance with what has been stated above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), viz. that actions which do not pass into external matter are subjected
    in their principles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Reason has its proper elicited act about
    its proper object; but it exercises the direction of all the objects of
    those lower powers that can be directed by the reason: and accordingly
    delectation about sensible objects comes also under the direction of
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Delectation is said to be morose not
    from a delay of time, but because the reason in deliberating dwells
    [immoratur] thereon, and fails to drive it away, "deliberately holding and
    turning over what should have been cast aside as soon as it touched the
    mind," as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12).<br />

    Whether the sin of consent to the act is in the higher reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of consent to the act
    is not in the higher reason. For consent is an act of the appetitive power,
    as stated above (<a href="FS015.html#FSQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>,
    <a href="FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): whereas the reason is an
    apprehensive power. Therefore the sin of consent to the act is not in the
    higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "the higher reason is intent on
    contemplating and consulting the eternal law," as Augustine states (De Trin.
    xii, 7). [*'Rationes aeternae,' cf. FP, Question [15], Articles [2],[3]
    where as in similar passages 'ratio' has been rendered by the English
    'type,' because St. Thomas was speaking of the Divine 'idea' as the
    archetype of the creature. Hence the type or idea is a rule of conduct, and
    is identified with the eternal law, (cf.
    <a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, Objection [1];
    <a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A8A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>)]. But sometimes consent
    is given to an act, without consulting the eternal law: since man does not
    always think about Divine things, whenever he consents to an act. Therefore
    the sin of consent to the act is not always in the higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as man can regulate his external
    actions according to the eternal law, so can he regulate his internal
    pleasures or other passions. But "consent to a pleasure without deciding to
    fulfil it by deed, belongs to the lower reason," as Augustine states (De
    Trin. xii, 2). Therefore the consent to a sinful act should also be
    sometimes ascribed to the lower reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as the higher reason excels the
    lower, so does the reason excel the imagination. Now sometimes man proceeds
    to act through the apprehension of the power of imagination, without any
    deliberation of his reason, as when, without premeditation, he moves his
    hand, or foot. Therefore sometimes also the lower reason may consent to a
    sinful act, independently of the higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12): "If the
    consent to the evil use of things that can be perceived by the bodily
    senses, so far approves of any sin, as to point, if possible, to its
    consummation by deed, we are to understand that the woman has offered the
    forbidden fruit to her husband."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Consent implies a judgment about the thing to
    which consent is given. For just as the speculative reason judges and
    delivers its sentence about intelligible matters, so the practical reason
    judges and pronounces sentence on matters of action. Now we must observe
    that in every case brought up for judgment, the final sentence belongs to
    the supreme court, even as we see that in speculative matters the final
    sentence touching any proposition is delivered by referring it to the first
    principles; since, so long as there remains a yet higher principle, the
    question can yet be submitted to it: wherefore the judgment is still in
    suspense, the final sentence not being as yet pronounced. But it is evident
    that human acts can be regulated by the rule of human reason, which rule is
    derived from the created things that man knows naturally; and further still,
    from the rule of the Divine law, as stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Consequently, since
    the rule of the Divine law is the higher rule, it follows that the ultimate
    sentence, whereby the judgment is finally pronounced, belongs to the higher
    reason which is intent on the eternal types. Now when judgment has to be
    pronounced on several points, the final judgment deals with that which comes
    last; and, in human acts, the action itself comes last, and the delectation
    which is the inducement to the action is a preamble thereto. Therefore the
    consent to an action belongs properly to the higher reason, while the
    preliminary judgment which is about the delectation belongs to the lower
    reason, which delivers judgment in a lower court: although the higher reason
    can also judge of the delectation, since whatever is subject to the judgment
    of the lower court, is subject also to the judgment of the higher court, but
    not conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Consent is an act of the appetitive
    power, not absolutely, but in consequence of an act of reason deliberating
    and judging, as stated above (<a href="FS015.html#FSQ15OUTP1"
      >Question [15]</a
    >, <a href="FS015.html#FSQ15A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Because the fact that
    the consent is finally given to a thing is due to the fact that the will
    tends to that upon which the reason has already passed its judgment. Hence
    consent may be ascribed both to the will and to the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The higher reason is said to consent,
    from the very fact that it fails to direct the human act according to the
    Divine law, whether or not it advert to the eternal law. For if it thinks of
    God's law, it holds it in actual contempt: and if not, it neglects it by a
    kind of omission. Therefore the consent to a sinful act always proceeds from
    the higher reason: because, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12), "the mind
    cannot effectively decide on the commission of a sin, unless by its consent,
    whereby it wields its sovereign power of moving the members to action, or of
    restraining them from action, it become the servant or slave of the evil
    deed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The higher reason, by considering the
    eternal law, can direct or restrain the internal delectation, even as it can
    direct or restrain the external action: nevertheless, before the judgment of
    the higher reason is pronounced the lower reason, while deliberating the
    matter in reference to temporal principles, sometimes approves of this
    delectation: and then the consent to the delectation belongs to the lower
    reason. If, however, after considering the eternal law, man persists in
    giving the same consent, such consent will then belong to the higher
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The apprehension of the power of
    imagination is sudden and indeliberate: wherefore it can cause an act before
    the higher or lower reason has time to deliberate. But the judgment of the
    lower reason is deliberate, and so requires time, during which the higher
    reason can also deliberate; consequently, if by its deliberation it does not
    check the sinful act, this will deservedly by imputed to it.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether consent to delectation is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent to delectation is not
    a mortal sin, for consent to delectation belongs to the lower reason, which
    does not consider the eternal types, i.e. the eternal law, and consequently
    does not turn away from them. Now every mortal sin consists in turning away
    from Augustine's definition of mortal sin, which was quoted above (<a
      href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1"
      >Question [71]</a
    >, <a href="FS071.html#FSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore consent to
    delectation is not a mortal sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, consent to a thing is not evil, unless
    the thing to which consent is given be evil. Now "the cause of anything
    being such is yet more so," or at any rate not less. Consequently the thing
    to which a man consents cannot be a lesser evil than his consent. But
    delectation without deed is not a mortal sin, but only a venial sin.
    Therefore neither is the consent to the delectation a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, delectations differ in goodness and
    malice, according to the difference of the deeds, as the Philosopher states
    (Ethic. x, 3,5). Now the inward thought is one thing, and the outward deed,
    e.g. fornication, is another. Therefore the delectation consequent to the
    act of inward thought, differs in goodness and malice from the pleasure of
    fornication, as much as the inward thought differs from the outward deed;
    and consequently there is a like difference of consent on either hand. But
    the inward thought is not a mortal sin, nor is the consent to that thought:
    and therefore neither is the consent to the delectation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the external act of fornication or
    adultery is a mortal sin, not by reason of the delectation, since this is
    found also in the marriage act, but by reason of an inordinateness in the
    act itself. Now he that consents to the delectation does not, for this
    reason, consent to the inordinateness of the act. Therefore he seems not to
    sin mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the sin of murder is more grievous than
    simple fornication. Now it is not a mortal sin to consent to the delectation
    resulting from the thought of murder. Much less therefore is it a mortal sin
    to consent to the delectation resulting from the thought of fornication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the Lord's prayer is recited every day
    for the remission of venial sins, as Augustine asserts (Enchiridion
    lxxviii). Now Augustine teaches that consent to delectation may be driven
    away by means of the Lord's Prayer: for he says (De Trin. xii, 12) that
    "this sin is much less grievous than if it be decided to fulfil it by deed:
    wherefore we ought to ask pardon for such thoughts also, and we should
    strike our breasts and say: 'Forgive us our trespasses.'" Therefore consent
    to delectation is a venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine adds after a few words: "Man will
    be altogether lost unless, through the grace of the Mediator, he be forgiven
    those things which are deemed mere sins of thought, since without the will
    to do them, he desires nevertheless to enjoy them." But no man is lost
    except through mortal sin. Therefore consent to delectation is a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There have been various opinions on this point,
    for some have held that consent to delectation is not a mortal sin, but only
    a venial sin, while others have held it to be a mortal sin, and this opinion
    is more common and more probable. For we must take note that since every
    delectation results from some action, as stated in Ethic. x, 4, and again,
    that since every delectation may be compared to two things, viz. to the
    operation from which it results, and to the object in which a person takes
    delight. Now it happens that an action, just as a thing, is an object of
    delectation, because the action itself can be considered as a good and an
    end, in which the person who delights in it, rests. Sometimes the action
    itself, which results in delectation, is the object of delectation, in so
    far as the appetitive power, to which it belongs to take delight in
    anything, is brought to bear on the action itself as a good: for instance,
    when a man thinks and delights in his thought, in so far as his thought
    pleases him; while at other times the delight consequent to an action, e.g.
    a thought, has for its object another action, as being the object of his
    thought; and then his thought proceeds from the inclination of the appetite,
    not indeed to the thought, but to the action thought of. Accordingly a man
    who is thinking of fornication, may delight in either of two things: first,
    in the thought itself, secondly, in the fornication thought of. Now the
    delectation in the thought itself results from the inclination of the
    appetite to the thought; and the thought itself is not in itself a mortal
    sin; sometimes indeed it is only a venial sin, as when a man thinks of such
    a thing for no purpose; and sometimes it is no sin at all, as when a man has
    a purpose in thinking of it; for instance, he may wish to preach or dispute
    about it. Consequently such affection or delectation in respect of the
    thought of fornication is not a mortal sin in virtue of its genus, but is
    sometimes a venial sin and sometimes no sin at all: wherefore neither is it
    a mortal sin to consent to such a thought. In this sense the first opinion
    is true.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But that a man in thinking of fornication takes pleasure in the act thought
    of, is due to his desire being inclined to this act. Wherefore the fact that
    a man consents to such a delectation, amounts to nothing less than a consent
    to the inclination of his appetite to fornication: for no man takes pleasure
    except in that which is in conformity with his appetite. Now it is a mortal
    sin, if a man deliberately chooses that his appetite be conformed to what is
    in itself a mortal sin. Wherefore such a consent to delectation in a mortal
    sin, is itself a mortal sin, as the second opinion maintains.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Consent to delectation may be not only
    in the lower reason, but also in the higher reason, as stated above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >). Nevertheless the lower reason may turn away from the eternal types, for,
    though it is not intent on them, as regulating according to them, which is
    proper to the higher reason, yet, it is intent on them, as being regulated
    according to them: and by turning from them in this sense, it may sin
    mortally; since even the acts of the lower powers and of the external
    members may be mortal sins, in so far as the direction of the higher reason
    fails in directing them according to the eternal types.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Consent to a sin that is venial in its
    genus, is itself a venial sin, and accordingly one may conclude that the
    consent to take pleasure in a useless thought about fornication, is a venial
    sin. But delectation in the act itself of fornication is, in its genus, a
    mortal sin: and that it be a venial sin before the consent is given, is
    accidental, viz. on account of the incompleteness of the act: which
    incompleteness ceases when the deliberate consent has been given, so that
    therefore it has its complete nature and is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the delectation
    which has the thought for its object.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The delectation which has an external
    act for its object, cannot be without complacency in the external act as
    such, even though there be no decision to fulfil it, on account of the
    prohibition of some higher authority: wherefore the act is inordinate, and
    consequently the delectation will be inordinate also.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The consent to delectation, resulting
    from complacency in an act of murder thought of, is a mortal sin also: but
    not the consent to delectation resulting from complacency in the thought of
    murder.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The Lord's Prayer is to be said in order
    that we may be preserved not only from venial sin, but also from mortal
    sin.<br />

    Whether there can be venial sin in the higher reason as directing the lower
    powers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be venial sin in
    the higher reason as directing the lower powers, i.e. as consenting to a
    sinful act. For Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 7) that the "higher reason is
    intent on considering and consulting the eternal law." But mortal sin
    consists in turning away from the eternal law. Therefore it seems that there
    can be no other than mortal sin in the higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the higher reason is the principle of
    the spiritual life, as the heart is of the body's life. But the diseases of
    the heart are deadly. Therefore the sins of the higher reason are mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a venial sin becomes a mortal sin if it
    be done out of contempt. But it would seem impossible to commit even a
    venial sin, deliberately, without contempt. Since then the consent of the
    higher reason is always accompanied by deliberate consideration of the
    eternal law, it seems that it cannot be without mortal sin, on account of
    the contempt of the Divine law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Consent to a sinful act belongs to the higher
    reason, as stated above (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>).
    But consent to an act of venial sin is itself a venial sin. Therefore a
    venial sin can be in the higher reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 7), the higher
    reason "is intent on contemplating or consulting the eternal law"; it
    contemplates it by considering its truth; it consults it by judging and
    directing other things according to it: and to this pertains the fact that
    by deliberating through the eternal types, it consents to an act or dissents
    from it. Now it may happen that the inordinateness of the act to which it
    consents, is not contrary to the eternal law, in the same way as mortal sin
    is, because it does not imply aversion from the last end, but is beside that
    law, as an act of venial sin is. Therefore when the higher reason consents
    to the act of a venial sin, it does not turn away from the eternal law:
    wherefore it sins, not mortally, but venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Disease of the heart is twofold: one
    which is in the very substance of the heart, and affects its natural
    consistency, and such a disease is always mortal: the other is a disease of
    the heart consisting in some disorder either of the movement or of the parts
    surrounding the heart, and such a disease is not always mortal. In like
    manner there is mortal sin in the higher reason whenever the order itself of
    the higher reason to its proper object which is the eternal law, is
    destroyed; but when the disorder leaves this untouched, the sin is not
    mortal but venial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Deliberate consent to a sin does not
    always amount to contempt of the Divine law, but only when the sin is
    contrary to the Divine law.<br />

    Whether venial sin can be in the higher reason as such?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin cannot be in the
    higher reason as such, i.e. as considering the eternal law. For the act of a
    power is not found to fail except that power be inordinately disposed with
    regard to its object. Now the object of the higher reason is the eternal
    law, in respect of which there can be no disorder without mortal sin.
    Therefore there can be no venial sin in the higher reason as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since the reason is a deliberative
    power, there can be no act of reason without deliberation. Now every
    inordinate movement in things concerning God, if it be deliberate, is a
    mortal sin. Therefore venial sin is never in the higher reason as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it happens sometimes that a sin which
    takes us unawares, is a venial sin. Now a deliberate sin is a mortal sin,
    through the reason, in deliberating, having recourse to some higher good, by
    acting against which, man sins more grievously; just as when the reason in
    deliberating about an inordinate pleasurable act, considers that it is
    contrary to the law of God, it sins more grievously in consenting, than if
    it only considered that it is contrary to moral virtue. But the higher
    reason cannot have recourse to any higher tribunal than its own object.
    Therefore if a movement that takes us unawares is not a mortal sin, neither
    will the subsequent deliberation make it a mortal sin; which is clearly
    false. Therefore there can be no venial sin in the higher reason as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A sudden movement of unbelief is a venial
    sin. But it belongs to the higher reason as such. Therefore there can be a
    venial sin in the higher reason as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The higher reason regards its own object
    otherwise than the objects of the lower powers that are directed by the
    higher reason. For it does not regard the objects of the lower powers,
    except in so far as it consults the eternal law about them, and so it does
    not regard them save by way of deliberation. Now deliberate consent to what
    is a mortal sin in its genus, is itself a mortal sin; and consequently the
    higher reason always sins mortally, if the acts of the lower powers to which
    it consents are mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to its own object it has a twofold act, viz. simple "intuition,"
    and "deliberation," in respect of which it again consults the eternal law
    about its own object. But in respect of simple intuition, it can have an
    inordinate movement about Divine things, as when a man suffers a sudden
    movement of unbelief. And although unbelief, in its genus, is a mortal sin,
    yet a sudden movement of unbelief is a venial sin, because there is no
    mortal sin unless it be contrary to the law of God. Now it is possible for
    one of the articles of faith to present itself to the reason suddenly under
    some other aspect, before the eternal law, i.e. the law of God, is
    consulted, or can be consulted, on the matter; as, for instance, when a man
    suddenly apprehends the resurrection of the dead as impossible naturally,
    and rejects it, as soon as he had thus apprehended it, before he has had
    time to deliberate and consider that this is proposed to our belief in
    accordance with the Divine law. If, however, the movement of unbelief
    remains after this deliberation, it is a mortal sin. Therefore, in sudden
    movements, the higher reason may sin venially in respect of its proper
    object, even if it be a mortal sin in its genus; or it may sin mortally in
    giving a deliberate consent; but in things pertaining to the lower powers,
    it always sins mortally, in things which are mortal sins in their genus, but
    not in those which are venial sins in their genus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A sin which is against the eternal law,
    though it be mortal in its genus, may nevertheless be venial, on account of
    the incompleteness of a sudden action, as stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In matters of action, the simple
    intuition of the principles from which deliberation proceeds, belongs to the
    reason, as well as the act of deliberation: even as in speculative matters
    it belongs to the reason both to syllogize and to form propositions:
    consequently the reason also can have a sudden movement.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One and the same thing may be the
    subject of different considerations, of which one is higher than the other;
    thus the existence of God may be considered, either as possible to be known
    by the human reason, or as delivered to us by Divine revelation, which is a
    higher consideration. And therefore, although the object of the higher
    reason is, in its nature, something sublime, yet it is reducible to some yet
    higher consideration: and in this way, that which in the sudden movement was
    not a mortal sin, becomes a mortal sin in virtue of the deliberation which
    brought it into the light of a higher consideration, as was explained
    above.<br />
