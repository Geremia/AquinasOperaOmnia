<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts do not differ from the virtues. For 
Gregory commenting on Job 1:2, "There were born to him seven sons," says 
(Moral. i, 12): "Seven sons were born to us, when through the conception 
of heavenly thought, the seven virtues of the Holy Ghost take birth in 
us": and he quotes the words of Is. 11:2,3: "And the Spirit . . . of 
understanding . . . shall rest upon him," etc. where the seven gifts of 
the Holy Ghost are enumerated. Therefore the seven gifts of the Holy 
Ghost are virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine commenting on Mt. 12:45, "Then he goeth and 
taketh with him seven other spirits," etc., says (De Quaest. Evang. i, 
qu. 8): "The seven vices are opposed to the seven virtues of the Holy 
Ghost," i.e. to the seven gifts. Now the seven vices are opposed to the 
seven virtues, commonly so called. Therefore the gifts do not differ from 
the virtues commonly so called.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things whose definitions are the same, are themselves 
the same. But the definition of virtue applies to the gifts; for each 
gift is "a good quality of the mind, whereby we lead a good life," etc. 
[*Cf. Question [55], Article [4]]. Likewise the definition of a gift can apply to the 
infused virtues: for a gift is "an unreturnable giving," according to the 
Philosopher (Topic. iv, 4). Therefore the virtues and gifts do not differ 
from one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Several of the things mentioned among the gifts, are virtues: 
for, as stated above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), wisdom, understanding, and knowledge 
are intellectual virtues, counsel pertains to prudence, piety to a kind 
of justice, and fortitude is a moral virtue. Therefore it seems that the 
gifts do not differ from the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. i, 12) distinguishes seven gifts, which 
he states to be denoted by the seven sons of Job, from the three 
theological virtues, which, he says, are signified by Job's three 
daughters. He also distinguishes (Moral. ii, 26) the  same seven gifts 
from the four cardinal virtues, which he says were signified by the four 
corners of the house.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of gift and virtue with regard to the notion 
conveyed by the words themselves, there is no opposition between them. 
Because the word "virtue" conveys the notion that it perfects man in 
relation to well-doing, while the word "gift" refers to the cause from 
which it proceeds. Now there is no reason why that which proceeds from 
one as a gift should not perfect another in well-doing: especially as we 
have already stated (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that some virtues are infused into us 
by God. Wherefore in this respect we cannot differentiate gifts from 
virtues. Consequently some have held that the gifts are not to be 
distinguished from the virtues. But there remains no less a difficulty 
for them to solve; for they must explain why some virtues are called 
gifts and some not; and why among the gifts there are some, fear, for 
instance, that are not reckoned virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is that others have said that the gifts should be held as being 
distinct from the virtues; yet they have not assigned a suitable reason 
for this distinction, a reason, to wit, which would apply either to all 
the virtues, and to none of the gifts, or vice versa. For, seeing that of 
the seven gifts, four belong to the reason, viz. wisdom, knowledge, 
understanding and counsel, and three to the appetite, viz. fortitude, 
piety and fear; they held that the gifts perfect the free-will according 
as it is a faculty of the reason, while the virtues perfect it as a 
faculty of the will: since they observed only two virtues in the reason 
or intellect, viz. faith and prudence, the others being in the appetitive 
power or the affections. If this distinction were true, all the virtues 
would have to be in the appetite, and all the gifts in the reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others observing that Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, by coming into the soul endows it with prudence, temperance, 
justice, and fortitude, and at the same time strengthens it against every 
kind of temptation by His sevenfold gift," said that the virtues are 
given us that we may do good works, and the gifts, that we may resist 
temptation. But neither is this distinction sufficient. Because the 
virtues also resist those temptations which lead to the sins that are 
contrary to the virtues; for everything naturally resists its contrary: 
which is especially clear with regard to charity, of which it is written 
(Cant 8:7): "Many waters cannot quench charity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others again, seeing that these gifts are set down in Holy Writ as 
having been in Christ, according to Is. 11:2,3, said that the virtues are 
given simply that we may do good works, but the gifts, in order to 
conform us to Christ, chiefly with regard to His Passion, for it was then 
that these gifts shone with the greatest splendor. Yet neither does this 
appear to be a satisfactory distinction. Because Our Lord Himself wished 
us to be conformed to Him, chiefly in humility and meekness, according to 
Mt. 11:29: "Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart," and in  
charity, according to Jn. 15:12: "Love one another, as I have loved you." 
Moreover, these virtues were especially resplendent in Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, in order to differentiate the gifts from the virtues, we 
must be guided by the way in which Scripture expresses itself, for we 
find there that the term employed is "spirit" rather than "gift." For 
thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11:2,3">Is. 11:2,3</a>): "The spirit . . . of wisdom and of 
understanding . . . shall rest upon him," etc.: from which words we are 
clearly given to understand that these seven are there set down as being 
in us by Divine inspiration. Now inspiration denotes motion from without. 
For it must be noted that in man there is a twofold principle of 
movement, one within him, viz. the reason; the other extrinsic to him, 
viz. God, as stated above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,6): moreover the Philosopher says 
this in the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem. vii, 8).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is evident that whatever is moved must be proportionate to its 
mover: and the perfection of the mobile as such, consists in a 
disposition whereby it is disposed to be well moved by its mover. Hence 
the more exalted the mover, the more perfect must be the disposition 
whereby the mobile is made proportionate to its mover: thus we see that a 
disciple needs a more perfect disposition in order to receive a higher 
teaching from his master. Now it is manifest that human virtues perfect 
man according as it is natural for him to be moved by his reason in his 
interior and exterior actions. Consequently man needs yet higher 
perfections, whereby to be disposed to be moved by God. These perfections 
are called gifts, not only because they are infused by God, but also 
because by them man is disposed to become amenable to the Divine 
inspiration, according to Is. 50:5: "The Lord . . . hath opened my ear, 
and I do not resist; I have not gone back." Even the Philosopher says in 
the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem., vii, 8) that for those who 
are moved by Divine instinct, there is no need to take counsel according 
to human reason, but only to follow their inner promptings, since they 
are moved by a principle higher than human reason. This then is what some 
say, viz. that the gifts perfect man for acts which are higher than acts 
of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sometimes these gifts are called virtues, in the broad 
sense of the word. Nevertheless, they have something over and above the 
virtues understood in this broad way, in so far as they are Divine 
virtues, perfecting man as moved by God. Hence the Philosopher (Ethic. 
vii, 1) above virtue commonly so called, places a kind of "heroic" or 
"divine virtue [*{arete heroike kai theia}]," in respect of which some 
men are called "divine."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The vices are opposed to the virtues, in so far as they are 
opposed to the good as appointed by reason; but they are opposed to the 
gifts, in as much as they are opposed to the Divine instinct. For the 
same thing is opposed both to God and to reason, whose light flows from 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This definition applies to virtue taken in its  general 
sense. Consequently, if we wish to restrict it to virtue as distinguished 
from the gifts, we must explain the words, "whereby we lead a good life" 
as referring to the rectitude of life which is measured by the rule of 
reason. Likewise the gifts, as distinct from infused virtue, may be 
defined as something given by God in relation to His motion; something, 
to wit, that makes man to follow well the promptings of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Wisdom is called an intellectual virtue, so far as it 
proceeds from the judgment of reason: but it is called a gift, according 
as its work proceeds from the Divine prompting. The same applies to the 
other virtues.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gifts are necessary to man for salvation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not necessary to man for 
salvation. Because the gifts are ordained to a perfection surpassing the 
ordinary perfection of virtue. Now it is not necessary for man's 
salvation that he should attain to a perfection surpassing the ordinary 
standard of virtue; because such perfection falls, not under the precept, 
but under a counsel. Therefore the gifts are not necessary to man for 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is enough, for man's salvation, that he behave well 
in matters concerning God and matters concerning man. Now man's behavior 
to God is sufficiently directed by the theological virtues; and his 
behavior towards men, by the moral virtues. Therefore gifts are not 
necessary to man for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the Holy Ghost gives 
wisdom against folly, understanding against dullness, counsel against 
rashness, fortitude against fears, knowledge against ignorance, piety 
against hardness of our heart, and fear against pride." But a sufficient 
remedy for all these things is to be found in the virtues. Therefore the 
gifts are not necessary to man for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Of all the gifts, wisdom seems to be the highest, and 
fear the lowest. Now each of these is necessary for salvation: since of 
wisdom it is written (Wis. 7:28): "God loveth none but him that dwelleth 
with wisdom"; and of fear (Ecclus. 1:28): "He that is without fear cannot 
be justified." Therefore the other gifts that are placed between these 
are also necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the gifts are perfections of man, 
whereby he is disposed so as to be amenable to the promptings of God. 
Wherefore in those matters where the prompting of reason is not 
sufficient, and there is need for the prompting of the Holy Ghost, there 
is, in consequence, need for a gift.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now man's reason is perfected by God in two ways: first, with its 
natural perfection, to wit, the natural light of reason;  secondly, with 
a supernatural perfection, to wit, the theological virtues, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And, though this latter perfection is greater than 
the former, yet the former is possessed by man in a more perfect manner 
than the latter: because man has the former in his full possession, 
whereas he possesses the latter imperfectly, since we love and know God 
imperfectly. Now it is evident that anything that has a nature or a form 
or a virtue perfectly, can of itself work according to them: not, 
however, excluding the operation of God, Who works inwardly in every 
nature and in every will. On the other hand, that which has a nature, or 
form, or virtue imperfectly, cannot of itself work, unless it be moved by 
another. Thus the sun which possesses light perfectly, can shine by 
itself; whereas the moon which has the nature of light imperfectly, sheds 
only a borrowed light. Again, a physician, who knows the medical art 
perfectly, can work by himself; but his pupil, who is not yet fully 
instructed, cannot work by himself, but needs to receive instructions 
from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, in matters subject to human reason, and directed to man's 
connatural end, man can work through the judgment of his reason. If, 
however, even in these things man receive help in the shape of special 
promptings from God, this will be out of God's superabundant goodness: 
hence, according to the philosophers, not every one that had the acquired 
moral virtues, had also the heroic or divine virtues. But in matters 
directed to the supernatural end, to which man's reason moves him, 
according as it is, in a manner, and imperfectly, informed by the 
theological virtues, the motion of reason does not suffice, unless it 
receive in addition the prompting or motion of the Holy Ghost, according 
to Rm. 8:14,17: "Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of 
God . . . and if sons, heirs also": and Ps. 142:10: "Thy good Spirit 
shall lead me into the right land," because, to wit, none can receive the 
inheritance of that land of the Blessed, except he be moved and led 
thither by the Holy Ghost. Therefore, in order to accomplish this end, it 
is necessary for man to have the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gifts surpass the ordinary perfection of the virtues, 
not as regards the kind of works (as the counsels surpass the 
commandments), but as regards the manner of working, in respect of man 
being moved by a higher principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the theological and moral virtues, man is not so 
perfected in respect of his last end, as not to stand in continual need 
of being moved by the yet higher promptings of the Holy Ghost, for the 
reason already given.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whether we consider human reason as perfected in its 
natural perfection, or as perfected by the theological virtues, it does 
not know all things, nor all possible things. Consequently it is unable 
to avoid folly and other like things mentioned in the objection. God, 
however, to Whose knowledge and power all things are subject, by His 
motion safeguards us from all folly, ignorance, dullness of mind and 
hardness of heart, and the rest. Consequently the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost, which make us amenable to His  promptings, are said to be given as 
remedies to these defects.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts of the Holy Ghost are not habits. 
Because a habit is a quality abiding in man, being defined as "a quality 
difficult to remove," as stated in the Predicaments (Categor. vi). Now it 
is proper to Christ that the gifts of the Holy Ghost rest in Him, as 
stated in Is. 11:2,3: "He upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending 
and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth"; on which words Gregory 
comments as follows (Moral. ii, 27): "The Holy Ghost comes upon all the 
faithful; but, in a singular way, He dwells always in the Mediator." 
Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost are not habits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gifts of the Holy Ghost perfect man according as he 
is moved by the Spirit of God, as stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But in so far 
as man is moved by the Spirit of God, he is somewhat like an instrument 
in His regard. Now to be perfected by a habit is befitting, not an 
instrument, but a principal agent. Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost 
are not habits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the gifts of the Holy Ghost are due to Divine 
inspiration, so is the gift of prophecy. Now prophecy is not a habit: for 
"the spirit of prophecy does not always reside in the prophets," as 
Gregory states (Hom. i in Ezechiel). Neither, therefore, are the gifts of 
the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord in speaking of the Holy Ghost said to His 
disciples (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14:17">Jn. 14:17</a>): "He shall abide with you, and shall be in you." 
Now the Holy Ghost is not in a man without His gifts. Therefore His gifts 
abide in man. Therefore they are not merely acts or passions but abiding 
habits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the gifts are perfections of man, 
whereby he becomes amenable to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Now it 
is evident from what has been already said (<A Href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>, <A Href="FS056.html#FSQ56A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), 
that the moral virtues perfect the appetitive power according as it 
partakes somewhat of the reason, in so far, to wit, as it has a natural 
aptitude to be moved by the command of reason. Accordingly the gifts of 
the Holy Ghost, as compared with the Holy Ghost Himself, are related to 
man, even as the moral virtues, in comparison with the reason, are 
related to the appetitive power. Now the moral virtues are habits, 
whereby the powers of appetite are disposed to obey reason promptly. 
Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits whereby man is perfected 
to obey readily the Holy Ghost.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory solves this objection (Moral. ii, 27) by saying 
that "by those gifts without which one cannot obtain life, the Holy Ghost 
ever abides in all the elect, but not by His other gifts." Now the seven 
gifts are necessary for salvation, as stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore, 
with regard to them, the Holy Ghost ever abides in holy men. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument holds, in the case of an instrument which has 
no faculty of action, but only of being acted upon. But man is not an 
instrument of that kind; for he is so acted upon, by the Holy Ghost, that 
he also acts himself, in so far as he has a free-will. Therefore he needs 
a habit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prophecy is one of those gifts which are for the 
manifestation of the Spirit, not for the necessity of salvation: hence 
the comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are suitably enumerated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are unsuitably 
enumerated. For in that enumeration four are set down corresponding to 
the intellectual virtues, viz. wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and 
counsel, which corresponds to prudence; whereas nothing is set down 
corresponding to art, which is the fifth intellectual virtue. Moreover, 
something is included corresponding to justice, viz. piety, and something 
corresponding to fortitude, viz. the gift of fortitude; while there is 
nothing to correspond to temperance. Therefore the gifts are enumerated 
insufficiently.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, piety is a part of justice. But no part of fortitude is 
assigned to correspond thereto, but fortitude itself. Therefore justice 
itself, and not piety, ought to have been set down.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues, more than any, direct us to 
God. Since, then, the gifts perfect man according as he is moved by God, 
it seems that some gifts, corresponding to the theological virtues, 
should have been included.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, even as God is an object of fear, so is He of love, of 
hope, and of joy. Now love, hope, and joy are passions condivided with 
fear. Therefore, as fear is set down as a gift, so ought the other three.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, wisdom is added in order to direct understanding; 
counsel, to direct fortitude; knowledge, to direct piety. Therefore, some 
gift should have been added for the purpose of directing fear. Therefore 
the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are unsuitably enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Holy Writ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11:2,3">Is. 11:2,3</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the gifts are habits perfecting 
man so that he is ready to follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, even 
as the moral virtues perfect the appetitive powers so that they obey the 
reason. Now just as it is natural for the appetitive powers to be moved 
by the command of reason, so it is  natural for all the forces in man to 
be moved by the instinct of God, as by a superior power. Therefore 
whatever powers in man can be the principles of human actions, can also 
be the subjects of gifts, even as they are virtues; and such powers are 
the reason and appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the reason is speculative and practical: and in both we find the 
apprehension of truth (which pertains to the discovery of truth), and 
judgment concerning the truth. Accordingly, for the apprehension of 
truth, the speculative reason is perfected by "understanding"; the 
practical reason, by "counsel." In order to judge aright, the speculative 
reason is perfected by "wisdom"; the practical reason by "knowledge." The 
appetitive power, in matters touching a man's relations to another, is 
perfected by "piety"; in matters touching himself, it is perfected by 
"fortitude" against the fear of dangers; and against inordinate lust for 
pleasures, by "fear," according to Prov. 15:27: "By the fear of the Lord 
every one declineth from evil," and Ps. 118:120: "Pierce Thou my flesh 
with Thy fear: for I am afraid of Thy judgments." Hence it is clear that 
these gifts extend to all those things to which the virtues, both 
intellectual and moral, extend.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gifts of the Holy Ghost perfect man in matters 
concerning a good life: whereas art is not directed to such matters, but 
to external things that can be made, since art is the right reason, not 
about things to be done, but about things to be made (Ethic. vi, 4). 
However, we may say that, as regards the infusion of the gifts, the art 
is on the part of the Holy Ghost, Who is the principal mover, and not on 
the part of men, who are His organs when He moves them. The gift of fear 
corresponds, in a manner, to temperance: for just as it belongs to 
temperance, properly speaking, to restrain man from evil pleasures for 
the sake of the good appointed by reason, so does it belong to the gift 
of fear, to withdraw man from evil pleasures through fear of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Justice is so called from the rectitude of the reason, and 
so it is more suitably called a virtue than a gift. But the name of piety 
denotes the reverence which we give to our father and to our country. And 
since God is the Father of all, the worship of God is also called piety, 
as Augustine states (De Civ. Dei x, 1). Therefore the gift whereby a man, 
through reverence for God, works good to all, is fittingly called piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The mind of man is not moved by the Holy Ghost, unless in 
some way it be united to Him: even as the instrument is not moved by the 
craftsman, unless there by contact or some other kind of union between 
them. Now the primal union of man with God is by faith, hope and charity: 
and, consequently, these virtues are presupposed to the gifts, as being 
their roots. Therefore all the gifts correspond to these three virtues, 
as being derived therefrom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Love, hope and joy have good for their object. Now God is 
the Sovereign Good: wherefore the names of these  passions are 
transferred to the theological virtues which unite man to God. On the 
other hand, the object of fear is evil, which can nowise apply to God: 
hence fear does not denote union with God, but withdrawal from certain 
things through reverence for God. Hence it does not give its name to a 
theological virtue, but to a gift, which withdraws us from evil, for 
higher motives than moral virtue does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Wisdom directs both the intellect and the affections of 
man. Hence two gifts are set down as corresponding to wisdom as their 
directing principle; on the part of the intellect, the gift of 
understanding; on the part of the affections, the gift of fear. Because 
the principal reason for fearing God is taken from a consideration of the 
Divine excellence, which wisdom considers.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are connected?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not connected, for the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++12:8">1 Cor. 12:8</a>): "To one . . . by the Spirit, is given the word of 
wisdom, and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same 
Spirit." Now wisdom and knowledge are reckoned among the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost. Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost are given to divers 
men, and are not connected together in the same man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "many of the 
faithful have not knowledge, though they have faith." But some of the 
gifts, at least the gift of fear, accompany faith. Therefore it seems 
that the gifts are not necessarily connected together in one and the same 
man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. i) that wisdom "is of small account 
if it lack understanding, and understanding is wholly useless if it be 
not based upon wisdom . . . Counsel is worthless, when the strength of 
fortitude is lacking thereto . . . and fortitude is very weak if it be 
not supported by counsel . . . Knowledge is nought if it hath not the use 
of piety . . . and piety is very useless if it lack the discernment of 
knowledge . . . and assuredly, unless it has these virtues with it, fear 
itself rises up to the doing of no good action": from which it seems that 
it is possible to have one gift without another. Therefore the gifts of 
the Holy Ghost are not connected.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory prefaces the passage above quoted, with the 
following remark: "It is worthy of note in this feast of Job's sons, that 
by turns they fed one another." Now the sons of Job, of whom he is 
speaking, denote the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost are connected together by strengthening one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The true answer to this question is easily gathered from 
what has been already set down. For it has been stated (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that as the 
powers of the appetite are disposed by the  moral virtues as regards the 
governance of reason, so all the powers of the soul are disposed by the 
gifts as regards the motion of the Holy Ghost. Now the Holy Ghost dwells 
in us by charity, according to Rm. 5:5: "The charity of God is poured 
forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us," even as our 
reason is perfected by prudence. Wherefore, just as the moral virtues are 
united together in prudence, so the gifts of the Holy Ghost are connected 
together in charity: so that whoever has charity has all the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost, none of which can one possess without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Wisdom and knowledge can be considered in one way as 
gratuitous graces, in so far, to wit, as man so far abounds in the 
knowledge of things Divine and human, that he is able both to instruct 
the believer and confound the unbeliever. It is in this sense that the 
Apostle speaks, in this passage, about wisdom and knowledge: hence he 
mentions pointedly the "word" of wisdom and the "word" of knowledge. They 
may be taken in another way for the gifts of the Holy Ghost: and thus 
wisdom and knowledge are nothing else but perfections of the human mind, 
rendering it amenable to the promptings of the Holy Ghost in the 
knowledge of things Divine and human. Consequently it is clear that these 
gifts are in all who are possessed of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of knowledge, while expounding 
the passage of the Apostle quoted above (OBJ 1): hence he is referring to 
knowledge, in the sense already explained, as a gratuitous grace. This is 
clear from the context which follows: "For it is one thing to know only 
what a man must believe in order to gain the blissful life, which is no 
other than eternal life; and another, to know how to impart this to godly 
souls, and to defend it against the ungodly, which latter the Apostle 
seems to have styled by the proper name of knowledge."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the connection of the cardinal virtues is proved in 
one way from the fact that one is, in a manner, perfected by another, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); so Gregory wishes to prove the connection of 
the gifts, in the same way, from the fact that one cannot be perfect 
without the other. Hence he had already observed that "each particular 
virtue is to the last degree destitute, unless one virtue lend its 
support to another." We are therefore not to understand that one gift can 
be without another; but that if understanding were without wisdom, it 
would not be a gift; even as temperance, without justice, would not be a 
virtue.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost remain in heaven?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts of the Holy Ghost do not remain in 
heaven. For Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that by means of His sevenfold 
gift the "Holy Ghost instructs the mind against all temptations." Now 
there will be no temptations in heaven, according to Is. 11:9: "They 
shall not hurt, nor shall they kill in all My holy mountain." Therefore 
there will be no gifts of the Holy Ghost  in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But habits are of no use, where their acts are impossible. Now 
the acts of some gifts are not possible in heaven; for Gregory says 
(Moral. i, 15) that "understanding . . . penetrates the truths heard . . 
. counsel . . . stays us from acting rashly . . . fortitude . . . has no 
fear of adversity . . . piety satisfies the inmost heart with deeds of 
mercy," all of which are incompatible with the heavenly state. Therefore 
these gifts will not remain in the state of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some of the gifts perfect man in the contemplative life, 
e.g. wisdom and understanding: and some in the active life, e.g. piety 
and fortitude. Now the active life ends with this as Gregory states 
(Moral. vi). Therefore not all the gifts of the Holy Ghost will be in the 
state of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Spiritu Sancto i, 20): "The city of 
God, the heavenly Jerusalem is not washed with the waters of an earthly 
river: it is the Holy Ghost, of Whose outpouring we but taste, Who, 
proceeding from the Fount of life, seems to flow more abundantly in those 
celestial spirits, a seething torrent of sevenfold heavenly virtue."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of the gifts in two ways: first, as to their 
essence; and thus they will be most perfectly in heaven, as may be 
gathered from the passage of Ambrose, just quoted. The reason for this is 
that the gifts of the Holy Ghost render the human mind amenable to the 
motion of the Holy Ghost: which will be especially realized in heaven, 
where God will be "all in all" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15:28">1 Cor. 15:28</a>), and man entirely subject 
unto Him. Secondly, they may be considered as regards the matter about 
which their operations are: and thus, in the present life they have an 
operation about a matter, in respect of which they will have no operation 
in the state of glory. Considered in this way, they will not remain in 
the state of glory; just as we have stated to be the case with regard to 
the cardinal virtues (<A Href="FS067.html#FSQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>, <A Href="FS067.html#FSQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is speaking there of the gifts according as they 
are compatible with the present state: for it is thus that they afford us 
protection against evil temptations. But in the state of glory, where all 
evil will have ceased, we shall be perfected in good by the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory, in almost every gift, includes something that 
passes away with the present state, and something that remains in the 
future state. For he says that "wisdom strengthens the mind with the hope 
and certainty of eternal things"; of which two, hope passes, and 
certainty remains. Of understanding, he says "that it penetrates the 
truths heard, refreshing the heart and enlightening its darkness," of 
which, hearing passes away, since "they shall teach no more every man . . 
. his brother" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++31:3,4">Jer. 31:3,4</a>); but the enlightening of the mind remains. 
Of counsel he says that it  "prevents us from being impetuous," which is 
necessary in the present life; and also that "it makes the mind full of 
reason," which is necessary even in the future state. Of fortitude he 
says that it "fears not adversity," which is necessary in the present 
life; and further, that it "sets before us the viands of confidence," 
which remains also in the future life. With regard to knowledge he 
mentions only one thing, viz. that "she overcomes the void of ignorance," 
which refers to the present state. When, however, he adds "in the womb of 
the mind," this may refer figuratively to the fulness of knowledge, which 
belongs to the future state. Of piety he says that "it satisfies the 
inmost heart with deeds of mercy." These words taken literally refer only 
to the present state: yet the inward regard for our neighbor, signified 
by "the inmost heart," belongs also to the future state, when piety will 
achieve, not works of mercy, but fellowship of joy. Of fear he say that 
"it oppresses the mind, lest it pride itself in present things," which 
refers to the present state, and that "it strengthens it with the meat of 
hope for the future," which also belongs to the present state, as regards 
hope, but may also refer to the future state, as regards being 
"strengthened" for things we hope are here, and obtain there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the gifts as to their matter. For 
the matter of the gifts will not be the works of the active life; but all 
the gifts will have their respective acts about things pertaining to the 
contemplative life, which is the life of heavenly bliss.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not set down by Isaias in their 
order of dignity. For the principal gift is, seemingly, that which, more 
than the others, God requires of man. Now God requires of man fear, more 
than the other gifts: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++10:12">Dt. 10:12</a>): "And now, Israel, 
what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that thou fear the Lord 
thy God?" and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Malachi+1:6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If . . . I be a master, where is My fear?" 
Therefore it seems that fear, which is mentioned last, is not the lowest 
but the greatest of the gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, piety seems to be a kind of common good; since the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++4:8">1 Tim. 4:8</a>): "Piety [Douay: 'Godliness'] is profitable to 
all things." Now a common good is preferable to particular goods. 
Therefore piety, which is given the last place but one, seems to be the 
most excellent gift.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, knowledge perfects man's judgment, while counsel 
pertains to inquiry. But judgment is more excellent than inquiry. 
Therefore knowledge is a more excellent gift than counsel; and yet it is 
set down as being below it.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, fortitude pertains to the appetitive power, while 
science belongs to reason. But reason is a more excellent  power than the 
appetite. Therefore knowledge is a more excellent gift than fortitude; 
and yet the latter is given the precedence. Therefore the gifts are not 
set down in their order of dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says [*De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4]: "It 
seems to me that the sevenfold operation of the Holy Ghost, of which 
Isaias speaks, agrees in degrees and expression with these [of which we 
read in Mt. 5:3]: but there is a difference of order, for there [viz. in 
Isaias] the enumeration begins with the more excellent gifts, here, with 
the lower gifts."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The excellence of the gifts can be measured in two ways: 
first, simply, viz. by comparison to their proper acts as proceeding from 
their principles; secondly, relatively, viz. by comparison to their 
matter. If we consider the excellence of the gifts simply, they follow 
the same rule as the virtues, as to their comparison one with another; 
because the gifts perfect man for all the acts of the soul's powers, even 
as the virtues do, as stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence, as the intellectual 
virtues have the precedence of the moral virtues, and among the 
intellectual virtues, the contemplative are preferable to the active, 
viz. wisdom, understanding and science to prudence and art (yet so that 
wisdom stands before understanding, and understanding before science, and 
prudence and synesis before eubulia): so also among the gifts, wisdom, 
understanding, knowledge, and counsel are more excellent than piety, 
fortitude, and fear; and among the latter, piety excels fortitude, and 
fortitude fear, even as justice surpasses fortitude, and fortitude 
temperance. But in regard to their matter, fortitude and counsel precede 
knowledge and piety: because fortitude and counsel are concerned with 
difficult matters, whereas piety and knowledge regard ordinary matters. 
Consequently the excellence of the gifts corresponds with the order in 
which they are enumerated; but so far as wisdom and understanding are 
given the preference to the others, their excellence is considered 
simply, while, so far, as counsel and fortitude are preferred to 
knowledge and piety, it is considered with regard to their matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fear is chiefly required as being the foundation, so to 
speak, of the perfection of the other gifts, for "the fear of the Lord is 
the beginning of wisdom" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++110:10;+Ecclus++1:16">Ps. 110:10; Ecclus. 1:16</a>), and not as though it 
were more excellent than the others. Because, in the order of generation, 
man departs from evil on account of fear (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++16:16">Prov. 16:16</a>), before doing good 
works, and which result from the other gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the words quoted from the Apostle, piety is not compared 
with all God's gifts, but only with "bodily exercise," of which he had 
said it "is profitable to little."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although knowledge stands before counsel by reason of its 
judgment, yet counsel is more excellent by reason of its matter: for 
counsel is only concerned with matters of difficulty (Ethic. iii, 3), 
whereas the judgment of knowledge embraces all matters. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[7] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The directive gifts which pertain to the reason are more 
excellent than the executive gifts, if we consider them in relation to 
their acts as proceeding from their powers, because reason transcends the 
appetite as a rule transcends the thing ruled. But on the part of the 
matter, counsel is united to fortitude as the directive power to the 
executive, and so is knowledge united to piety: because counsel and 
fortitude are concerned with matters of difficulty, while knowledge and 
piety are concerned with ordinary matters. Hence counsel together with 
fortitude, by reason of their matter, are given the preference to 
knowledge and piety.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the virtues are more excellent than the gifts?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the virtues are more excellent than the gifts. 
For Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 18) while speaking of charity: "No gift 
of God is more excellent than this. It is this alone which divides the 
children of the eternal kingdom from the children of eternal damnation. 
Other gifts are bestowed by the Holy Ghost, but, without charity, they 
avail nothing." But charity is a virtue. Therefore a virtue is more 
excellent than the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is first naturally, seems to be more 
excellent. Now the virtues precede the gifts of the Holy Ghost; for 
Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the gift of the Holy Ghost in the mind 
it works on, forms first of all justice, prudence, fortitude, temperance 
. . . and doth afterwards give it a temper in the seven virtues" [viz. 
the gifts], so "as against folly to bestow wisdom; against dullness, 
understanding; against rashness, counsel; against fear, fortitude; 
against ignorance, knowledge; against hardness of heart, piety; against 
piety, fear." Therefore the virtues are more excellent than the gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19) that "the virtues 
cannot be used to evil purpose." But it is possible to make evil use of 
the gifts, for Gregory says (Moral. i, 18): "We offer up the sacrifice of 
prayer . . . lest wisdom may uplift; or understanding, while it runs 
nimbly, deviate from the right path; or counsel, while it multiplies 
itself, grow into confusion; that fortitude, while it gives confidence, 
may not make us rash; lest knowledge, while it knows and yet loves not, 
may swell the mind; lest piety, while it swerves from the right line, may 
become distorted; and lest fear, while it is unduly alarmed, may plunge 
us into the pit of despair." Therefore the virtues are more excellent 
than the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The gifts are bestowed to assist the virtues and to 
remedy certain defects, as is shown in the passage quoted (OBJ 2), so 
that, seemingly, they accomplish what the virtues cannot. Therefore the 
gifts are more excellent than the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was shown above (<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), there are 
three kinds of virtues: for some are theological, some intellectual, and 
some moral. The theological virtues are those whereby man's mind is 
united to God; the intellectual virtues are those whereby reason itself 
is perfected; and the moral virtues are those which perfect the powers of 
appetite in obedience to the reason. On the other hand the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost dispose all the powers of the soul to be amenable to the 
Divine motion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the gifts seem to be compared to the theological virtues, by 
which man is united to the Holy Ghost his Mover, in the same way as the 
moral virtues are compared to the intellectual virtues, which perfect the 
reason, the moving principle of the moral virtues. Wherefore as the 
intellectual virtues are more excellent than the moral virtues and 
control them, so the theological virtues are more excellent than the 
gifts of the Holy Ghost and regulate them. Hence Gregory says (Moral. i, 
12) that "the seven sons," i.e. the seven gifts, "never attain the 
perfection of the number ten, unless all they do be done in faith, hope, 
and charity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we compare the gifts to the other virtues, intellectual and 
moral, then the gifts have the precedence of the virtues. Because the 
gifts perfect the soul's powers in relation to the Holy Ghost their 
Mover; whereas the virtues perfect, either the reason itself, or the 
other powers in relation to reason: and it is evident that the more 
exalted the mover, the more excellent the disposition whereby the thing 
moved requires to be disposed. Therefore the gifts are more perfect than 
the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity is a theological virtue; and such we grant to be 
more perfect than the gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are two ways in which one thing precedes another. One 
is in order of perfection and dignity, as love of God precedes love of 
our neighbor: and in this way the gifts precede the intellectual and 
moral virtues, but follow the theological virtues. The other is the order 
of generation or disposition: thus love of one's neighbor precedes love 
of God, as regards the act: and in this way moral and intellectual 
virtues precede the gifts, since man, through being well subordinate to 
his own reason, is disposed to be rightly subordinate to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[68] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Wisdom and understanding and the like are gifts of the Holy 
Ghost, according as they are quickened by charity, which "dealeth not 
perversely" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13:4">1 Cor. 13:4</a>). Consequently wisdom and understanding and the 
like cannot be used to evil purpose, in so far as they are gifts of the 
Holy Ghost. But, lest they depart from the perfection of charity, they 
assist one another. This is what Gregory means to say.<br>
