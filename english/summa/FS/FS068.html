  <h3 align="left">Whether the Gifts differ from the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts do not differ from
    the virtues. For Gregory commenting on Job 1:2, "There were born to him
    seven sons," says (Moral. i, 12): "Seven sons were born to us, when through
    the conception of heavenly thought, the seven virtues of the Holy Ghost take
    birth in us": and he quotes the words of Is. 11:2,3: "And the Spirit... of
    understanding... shall rest upon him," etc. where the seven gifts of the
    Holy Ghost are enumerated. Therefore the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine commenting on Mt. 12:45, "Then
    he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits," etc., says (De Quaest.
    Evang. i, qu. 8): "The seven vices are opposed to the seven virtues of the
    Holy Ghost," i.e. to the seven gifts. Now the seven vices are opposed to the
    seven virtues, commonly so called. Therefore the gifts do not differ from
    the virtues commonly so called.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things whose definitions are the same,
    are themselves the same. But the definition of virtue applies to the gifts;
    for each gift is "a good quality of the mind, whereby we lead a good life,"
    etc. [*Cf. Question [55], Article [4]]. Likewise the definition of a gift
    can apply to the infused virtues: for a gift is "an unreturnable giving,"
    according to the Philosopher (Topic. iv, 4). Therefore the virtues and gifts
    do not differ from one another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Several of the things mentioned among the gifts,
    are virtues: for, as stated above (<a href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="FS057.html#FSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), wisdom,
    understanding, and knowledge are intellectual virtues, counsel pertains to
    prudence, piety to a kind of justice, and fortitude is a moral virtue.
    Therefore it seems that the gifts do not differ from the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. i, 12) distinguishes seven
    gifts, which he states to be denoted by the seven sons of Job, from the
    three theological virtues, which, he says, are signified by Job's three
    daughters. He also distinguishes (Moral. ii, 26) the same seven gifts from
    the four cardinal virtues, which he says were signified by the four corners
    of the house.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of gift and virtue with regard to
    the notion conveyed by the words themselves, there is no opposition between
    them. Because the word "virtue" conveys the notion that it perfects man in
    relation to well-doing, while the word "gift" refers to the cause from which
    it proceeds. Now there is no reason why that which proceeds from one as a
    gift should not perfect another in well-doing: especially as we have already
    stated (<a href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that some virtues are
    infused into us by God. Wherefore in this respect we cannot differentiate
    gifts from virtues. Consequently some have held that the gifts are not to be
    distinguished from the virtues. But there remains no less a difficulty for
    them to solve; for they must explain why some virtues are called gifts and
    some not; and why among the gifts there are some, fear, for instance, that
    are not reckoned virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is that others have said that the gifts should be held as being
    distinct from the virtues; yet they have not assigned a suitable reason for
    this distinction, a reason, to wit, which would apply either to all the
    virtues, and to none of the gifts, or vice versa. For, seeing that of the
    seven gifts, four belong to the reason, viz. wisdom, knowledge,
    understanding and counsel, and three to the appetite, viz. fortitude, piety
    and fear; they held that the gifts perfect the free-will according as it is
    a faculty of the reason, while the virtues perfect it as a faculty of the
    will: since they observed only two virtues in the reason or intellect, viz.
    faith and prudence, the others being in the appetitive power or the
    affections. If this distinction were true, all the virtues would have to be
    in the appetite, and all the gifts in the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others observing that Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the gift of the
    Holy Ghost, by coming into the soul endows it with prudence, temperance,
    justice, and fortitude, and at the same time strengthens it against every
    kind of temptation by His sevenfold gift," said that the virtues are given
    us that we may do good works, and the gifts, that we may resist temptation.
    But neither is this distinction sufficient. Because the virtues also resist
    those temptations which lead to the sins that are contrary to the virtues;
    for everything naturally resists its contrary: which is especially clear
    with regard to charity, of which it is written (Cant 8:7): "Many waters
    cannot quench charity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others again, seeing that these gifts are set down in Holy Writ as having
    been in Christ, according to Is. 11:2,3, said that the virtues are given
    simply that we may do good works, but the gifts, in order to conform us to
    Christ, chiefly with regard to His Passion, for it was then that these gifts
    shone with the greatest splendor. Yet neither does this appear to be a
    satisfactory distinction. Because Our Lord Himself wished us to be conformed
    to Him, chiefly in humility and meekness, according to Mt. 11:29: "Learn of
    Me, because I am meek and humble of heart," and in charity, according to Jn.
    15:12: "Love one another, as I have loved you." Moreover, these virtues were
    especially resplendent in Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, in order to differentiate the gifts from the virtues, we must
    be guided by the way in which Scripture expresses itself, for we find there
    that the term employed is "spirit" rather than "gift." For thus it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++11%3A2,3"
      >Is. 11:2,3</a
    >): "The spirit... of wisdom and of understanding... shall rest upon him,"
    etc.: from which words we are clearly given to understand that these seven
    are there set down as being in us by Divine inspiration. Now inspiration
    denotes motion from without. For it must be noted that in man there is a
    twofold principle of movement, one within him, viz. the reason; the other
    extrinsic to him, viz. God, as stated above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,6): moreover the
    Philosopher says this in the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem. vii,
    8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is evident that whatever is moved must be proportionate to its mover:
    and the perfection of the mobile as such, consists in a disposition whereby
    it is disposed to be well moved by its mover. Hence the more exalted the
    mover, the more perfect must be the disposition whereby the mobile is made
    proportionate to its mover: thus we see that a disciple needs a more perfect
    disposition in order to receive a higher teaching from his master. Now it is
    manifest that human virtues perfect man according as it is natural for him
    to be moved by his reason in his interior and exterior actions. Consequently
    man needs yet higher perfections, whereby to be disposed to be moved by God.
    These perfections are called gifts, not only because they are infused by
    God, but also because by them man is disposed to become amenable to the
    Divine inspiration, according to Is. 50:5: "The Lord... hath opened my ear,
    and I do not resist; I have not gone back." Even the Philosopher says in the
    chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem., vii, 8) that for those who are moved
    by Divine instinct, there is no need to take counsel according to human
    reason, but only to follow their inner promptings, since they are moved by a
    principle higher than human reason. This then is what some say, viz. that
    the gifts perfect man for acts which are higher than acts of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sometimes these gifts are called
    virtues, in the broad sense of the word. Nevertheless, they have something
    over and above the virtues understood in this broad way, in so far as they
    are Divine virtues, perfecting man as moved by God. Hence the Philosopher
    (Ethic. vii, 1) above virtue commonly so called, places a kind of "heroic"
    or "divine virtue [*{arete heroike kai theia}]," in respect of which some
    men are called "divine."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The vices are opposed to the virtues, in
    so far as they are opposed to the good as appointed by reason; but they are
    opposed to the gifts, in as much as they are opposed to the Divine instinct.
    For the same thing is opposed both to God and to reason, whose light flows
    from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This definition applies to virtue taken
    in its general sense. Consequently, if we wish to restrict it to virtue as
    distinguished from the gifts, we must explain the words, "whereby we lead a
    good life" as referring to the rectitude of life which is measured by the
    rule of reason. Likewise the gifts, as distinct from infused virtue, may be
    defined as something given by God in relation to His motion; something, to
    wit, that makes man to follow well the promptings of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Wisdom is called an intellectual virtue,
    so far as it proceeds from the judgment of reason: but it is called a gift,
    according as its work proceeds from the Divine prompting. The same applies
    to the other virtues.<br />

    Whether the gifts are necessary to man for salvation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not necessary to
    man for salvation. Because the gifts are ordained to a perfection surpassing
    the ordinary perfection of virtue. Now it is not necessary for man's
    salvation that he should attain to a perfection surpassing the ordinary
    standard of virtue; because such perfection falls, not under the precept,
    but under a counsel. Therefore the gifts are not necessary to man for
    salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is enough, for man's salvation, that
    he behave well in matters concerning God and matters concerning man. Now
    man's behavior to God is sufficiently directed by the theological virtues;
    and his behavior towards men, by the moral virtues. Therefore gifts are not
    necessary to man for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the
    Holy Ghost gives wisdom against folly, understanding against dullness,
    counsel against rashness, fortitude against fears, knowledge against
    ignorance, piety against hardness of our heart, and fear against pride." But
    a sufficient remedy for all these things is to be found in the virtues.
    Therefore the gifts are not necessary to man for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Of all the gifts, wisdom seems to be the
    highest, and fear the lowest. Now each of these is necessary for salvation:
    since of wisdom it is written (Wis. 7:28): "God loveth none but him that
    dwelleth with wisdom"; and of fear (Ecclus. 1:28): "He that is without fear
    cannot be justified." Therefore the other gifts that are placed between
    these are also necessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the gifts are perfections of man, whereby he is disposed so as to be
    amenable to the promptings of God. Wherefore in those matters where the
    prompting of reason is not sufficient, and there is need for the prompting
    of the Holy Ghost, there is, in consequence, need for a gift.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now man's reason is perfected by God in two ways: first, with its natural
    perfection, to wit, the natural light of reason; secondly, with a
    supernatural perfection, to wit, the theological virtues, as stated above
    (<a href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And, though this latter
    perfection is greater than the former, yet the former is possessed by man in
    a more perfect manner than the latter: because man has the former in his
    full possession, whereas he possesses the latter imperfectly, since we love
    and know God imperfectly. Now it is evident that anything that has a nature
    or a form or a virtue perfectly, can of itself work according to them: not,
    however, excluding the operation of God, Who works inwardly in every nature
    and in every will. On the other hand, that which has a nature, or form, or
    virtue imperfectly, cannot of itself work, unless it be moved by another.
    Thus the sun which possesses light perfectly, can shine by itself; whereas
    the moon which has the nature of light imperfectly, sheds only a borrowed
    light. Again, a physician, who knows the medical art perfectly, can work by
    himself; but his pupil, who is not yet fully instructed, cannot work by
    himself, but needs to receive instructions from him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, in matters subject to human reason, and directed to man's
    connatural end, man can work through the judgment of his reason. If,
    however, even in these things man receive help in the shape of special
    promptings from God, this will be out of God's superabundant goodness:
    hence, according to the philosophers, not every one that had the acquired
    moral virtues, had also the heroic or divine virtues. But in matters
    directed to the supernatural end, to which man's reason moves him, according
    as it is, in a manner, and imperfectly, informed by the theological virtues,
    the motion of reason does not suffice, unless it receive in addition the
    prompting or motion of the Holy Ghost, according to Rm. 8:14,17: "Whosoever
    are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God... and if sons, heirs
    also": and Ps. 142:10: "Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the right land,"
    because, to wit, none can receive the inheritance of that land of the
    Blessed, except he be moved and led thither by the Holy Ghost. Therefore, in
    order to accomplish this end, it is necessary for man to have the gift of
    the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gifts surpass the ordinary
    perfection of the virtues, not as regards the kind of works (as the counsels
    surpass the commandments), but as regards the manner of working, in respect
    of man being moved by a higher principle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the theological and moral virtues,
    man is not so perfected in respect of his last end, as not to stand in
    continual need of being moved by the yet higher promptings of the Holy
    Ghost, for the reason already given.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whether we consider human reason as
    perfected in its natural perfection, or as perfected by the theological
    virtues, it does not know all things, nor all possible things. Consequently
    it is unable to avoid folly and other like things mentioned in the
    objection. God, however, to Whose knowledge and power all things are
    subject, by His motion safeguards us from all folly, ignorance, dullness of
    mind and hardness of heart, and the rest. Consequently the gifts of the Holy
    Ghost, which make us amenable to His promptings, are said to be given as
    remedies to these defects.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts of the Holy Ghost
    are not habits. Because a habit is a quality abiding in man, being defined
    as "a quality difficult to remove," as stated in the Predicaments (Categor.
    vi). Now it is proper to Christ that the gifts of the Holy Ghost rest in
    Him, as stated in Is. 11:2,3: "He upon Whom thou shalt see the Spirit
    descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth"; on which words
    Gregory comments as follows (Moral. ii, 27): "The Holy Ghost comes upon all
    the faithful; but, in a singular way, He dwells always in the Mediator."
    Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost are not habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gifts of the Holy Ghost perfect man
    according as he is moved by the Spirit of God, as stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2). But in so far as man is moved by the Spirit of God, he is somewhat
    like an instrument in His regard. Now to be perfected by a habit is
    befitting, not an instrument, but a principal agent. Therefore the gifts of
    the Holy Ghost are not habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the gifts of the Holy Ghost are due
    to Divine inspiration, so is the gift of prophecy. Now prophecy is not a
    habit: for "the spirit of prophecy does not always reside in the prophets,"
    as Gregory states (Hom. i in Ezechiel). Neither, therefore, are the gifts of
    the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord in speaking of the Holy Ghost said
    to His disciples (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A17"
      >Jn. 14:17</a
    >): "He shall abide with you, and shall be in you." Now the Holy Ghost is
    not in a man without His gifts. Therefore His gifts abide in man. Therefore
    they are not merely acts or passions but abiding habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the gifts are perfections of man, whereby he becomes amenable to the
    promptings of the Holy Ghost. Now it is evident from what has been already
    said (<a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="FS058.html#FSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), that the moral virtues
    perfect the appetitive power according as it partakes somewhat of the
    reason, in so far, to wit, as it has a natural aptitude to be moved by the
    command of reason. Accordingly the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as compared with
    the Holy Ghost Himself, are related to man, even as the moral virtues, in
    comparison with the reason, are related to the appetitive power. Now the
    moral virtues are habits, whereby the powers of appetite are disposed to
    obey reason promptly. Therefore the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits
    whereby man is perfected to obey readily the Holy Ghost.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory solves this objection (Moral.
    ii, 27) by saying that "by those gifts without which one cannot obtain life,
    the Holy Ghost ever abides in all the elect, but not by His other gifts."
    Now the seven gifts are necessary for salvation, as stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Therefore, with regard to them, the Holy Ghost ever abides in holy men.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument holds, in the case of an
    instrument which has no faculty of action, but only of being acted upon. But
    man is not an instrument of that kind; for he is so acted upon, by the Holy
    Ghost, that he also acts himself, in so far as he has a free-will. Therefore
    he needs a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prophecy is one of those gifts which are
    for the manifestation of the Spirit, not for the necessity of salvation:
    hence the comparison fails.<br />

    Whether the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are suitably enumerated?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that seven gifts of the Holy Ghost
    are unsuitably enumerated. For in that enumeration four are set down
    corresponding to the intellectual virtues, viz. wisdom, understanding,
    knowledge, and counsel, which corresponds to prudence; whereas nothing is
    set down corresponding to art, which is the fifth intellectual virtue.
    Moreover, something is included corresponding to justice, viz. piety, and
    something corresponding to fortitude, viz. the gift of fortitude; while
    there is nothing to correspond to temperance. Therefore the gifts are
    enumerated insufficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, piety is a part of justice. But no part
    of fortitude is assigned to correspond thereto, but fortitude itself.
    Therefore justice itself, and not piety, ought to have been set down.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues, more than any,
    direct us to God. Since, then, the gifts perfect man according as he is
    moved by God, it seems that some gifts, corresponding to the theological
    virtues, should have been included.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, even as God is an object of fear, so is
    He of love, of hope, and of joy. Now love, hope, and joy are passions
    condivided with fear. Therefore, as fear is set down as a gift, so ought the
    other three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, wisdom is added in order to direct
    understanding; counsel, to direct fortitude; knowledge, to direct piety.
    Therefore, some gift should have been added for the purpose of directing
    fear. Therefore the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are unsuitably
    enumerated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Holy Writ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++11%3A2,3"
      >Is. 11:2,3</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), the gifts are habits perfecting man so that he is ready to follow the
    promptings of the Holy Ghost, even as the moral virtues perfect the
    appetitive powers so that they obey the reason. Now just as it is natural
    for the appetitive powers to be moved by the command of reason, so it is
    natural for all the forces in man to be moved by the instinct of God, as by
    a superior power. Therefore whatever powers in man can be the principles of
    human actions, can also be the subjects of gifts, even as they are virtues;
    and such powers are the reason and appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the reason is speculative and practical: and in both we find the
    apprehension of truth (which pertains to the discovery of truth), and
    judgment concerning the truth. Accordingly, for the apprehension of truth,
    the speculative reason is perfected by "understanding"; the practical
    reason, by "counsel." In order to judge aright, the speculative reason is
    perfected by "wisdom"; the practical reason by "knowledge." The appetitive
    power, in matters touching a man's relations to another, is perfected by
    "piety"; in matters touching himself, it is perfected by "fortitude" against
    the fear of dangers; and against inordinate lust for pleasures, by "fear,"
    according to Prov. 15:27: "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from
    evil," and Ps. 118:120: "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear: for I am afraid
    of Thy judgments." Hence it is clear that these gifts extend to all those
    things to which the virtues, both intellectual and moral, extend.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gifts of the Holy Ghost perfect man
    in matters concerning a good life: whereas art is not directed to such
    matters, but to external things that can be made, since art is the right
    reason, not about things to be done, but about things to be made (Ethic. vi,
    4). However, we may say that, as regards the infusion of the gifts, the art
    is on the part of the Holy Ghost, Who is the principal mover, and not on the
    part of men, who are His organs when He moves them. The gift of fear
    corresponds, in a manner, to temperance: for just as it belongs to
    temperance, properly speaking, to restrain man from evil pleasures for the
    sake of the good appointed by reason, so does it belong to the gift of fear,
    to withdraw man from evil pleasures through fear of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Justice is so called from the rectitude
    of the reason, and so it is more suitably called a virtue than a gift. But
    the name of piety denotes the reverence which we give to our father and to
    our country. And since God is the Father of all, the worship of God is also
    called piety, as Augustine states (De Civ. Dei x, 1). Therefore the gift
    whereby a man, through reverence for God, works good to all, is fittingly
    called piety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The mind of man is not moved by the Holy
    Ghost, unless in some way it be united to Him: even as the instrument is not
    moved by the craftsman, unless there by contact or some other kind of union
    between them. Now the primal union of man with God is by faith, hope and
    charity: and, consequently, these virtues are presupposed to the gifts, as
    being their roots. Therefore all the gifts correspond to these three
    virtues, as being derived therefrom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Love, hope and joy have good for their
    object. Now God is the Sovereign Good: wherefore the names of these passions
    are transferred to the theological virtues which unite man to God. On the
    other hand, the object of fear is evil, which can nowise apply to God: hence
    fear does not denote union with God, but withdrawal from certain things
    through reverence for God. Hence it does not give its name to a theological
    virtue, but to a gift, which withdraws us from evil, for higher motives than
    moral virtue does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Wisdom directs both the intellect and
    the affections of man. Hence two gifts are set down as corresponding to
    wisdom as their directing principle; on the part of the intellect, the gift
    of understanding; on the part of the affections, the gift of fear. Because
    the principal reason for fearing God is taken from a consideration of the
    Divine excellence, which wisdom considers.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost are connected?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not connected,
    for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 12:8</a
    >): "To one... by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom, and to another,
    the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit." Now wisdom and
    knowledge are reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the
    gifts of the Holy Ghost are given to divers men, and are not connected
    together in the same man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that
    "many of the faithful have not knowledge, though they have faith." But some
    of the gifts, at least the gift of fear, accompany faith. Therefore it seems
    that the gifts are not necessarily connected together in one and the same
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. i) that wisdom "is
    of small account if it lack understanding, and understanding is wholly
    useless if it be not based upon wisdom... Counsel is worthless, when the
    strength of fortitude is lacking thereto... and fortitude is very weak if it
    be not supported by counsel... Knowledge is nought if it hath not the use of
    piety... and piety is very useless if it lack the discernment of
    knowledge... and assuredly, unless it has these virtues with it, fear itself
    rises up to the doing of no good action": from which it seems that it is
    possible to have one gift without another. Therefore the gifts of the Holy
    Ghost are not connected.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory prefaces the passage above quoted,
    with the following remark: "It is worthy of note in this feast of Job's
    sons, that by turns they fed one another." Now the sons of Job, of whom he
    is speaking, denote the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the gifts of the
    Holy Ghost are connected together by strengthening one another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The true answer to this question is easily
    gathered from what has been already set down. For it has been stated (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >) that as the powers of the appetite are disposed by the moral virtues as
    regards the governance of reason, so all the powers of the soul are disposed
    by the gifts as regards the motion of the Holy Ghost. Now the Holy Ghost
    dwells in us by charity, according to Rm. 5:5: "The charity of God is poured
    forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us," even as our
    reason is perfected by prudence. Wherefore, just as the moral virtues are
    united together in prudence, so the gifts of the Holy Ghost are connected
    together in charity: so that whoever has charity has all the gifts of the
    Holy Ghost, none of which can one possess without charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Wisdom and knowledge can be considered
    in one way as gratuitous graces, in so far, to wit, as man so far abounds in
    the knowledge of things Divine and human, that he is able both to instruct
    the believer and confound the unbeliever. It is in this sense that the
    Apostle speaks, in this passage, about wisdom and knowledge: hence he
    mentions pointedly the "word" of wisdom and the "word" of knowledge. They
    may be taken in another way for the gifts of the Holy Ghost: and thus wisdom
    and knowledge are nothing else but perfections of the human mind, rendering
    it amenable to the promptings of the Holy Ghost in the knowledge of things
    Divine and human. Consequently it is clear that these gifts are in all who
    are possessed of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of
    knowledge, while expounding the passage of the Apostle quoted above (OBJ 1):
    hence he is referring to knowledge, in the sense already explained, as a
    gratuitous grace. This is clear from the context which follows: "For it is
    one thing to know only what a man must believe in order to gain the blissful
    life, which is no other than eternal life; and another, to know how to
    impart this to godly souls, and to defend it against the ungodly, which
    latter the Apostle seems to have styled by the proper name of knowledge."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the connection of the cardinal
    virtues is proved in one way from the fact that one is, in a manner,
    perfected by another, as stated above (<a href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); so Gregory wishes to
    prove the connection of the gifts, in the same way, from the fact that one
    cannot be perfect without the other. Hence he had already observed that
    "each particular virtue is to the last degree destitute, unless one virtue
    lend its support to another." We are therefore not to understand that one
    gift can be without another; but that if understanding were without wisdom,
    it would not be a gift; even as temperance, without justice, would not be a
    virtue.<br />

    Whether the gifts of the Holy Ghost remain in heaven?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts of the Holy Ghost do
    not remain in heaven. For Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that by means of His
    sevenfold gift the "Holy Ghost instructs the mind against all temptations."
    Now there will be no temptations in heaven, according to Is. 11:9: "They
    shall not hurt, nor shall they kill in all My holy mountain." Therefore
    there will be no gifts of the Holy Ghost in heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habits,
    as stated above (<a href="FS068.html#FSQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But
    habits are of no use, where their acts are impossible. Now the acts of some
    gifts are not possible in heaven; for Gregory says (Moral. i, 15) that
    "understanding... penetrates the truths heard... counsel... stays us from
    acting rashly... fortitude... has no fear of adversity... piety satisfies
    the inmost heart with deeds of mercy," all of which are incompatible with
    the heavenly state. Therefore these gifts will not remain in the state of
    glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some of the gifts perfect man in the
    contemplative life, e.g. wisdom and understanding: and some in the active
    life, e.g. piety and fortitude. Now the active life ends with this as
    Gregory states (Moral. vi). Therefore not all the gifts of the Holy Ghost
    will be in the state of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Spiritu Sancto i, 20): "The
    city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem is not washed with the waters of an
    earthly river: it is the Holy Ghost, of Whose outpouring we but taste, Who,
    proceeding from the Fount of life, seems to flow more abundantly in those
    celestial spirits, a seething torrent of sevenfold heavenly virtue."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of the gifts in two ways: first,
    as to their essence; and thus they will be most perfectly in heaven, as may
    be gathered from the passage of Ambrose, just quoted. The reason for this is
    that the gifts of the Holy Ghost render the human mind amenable to the
    motion of the Holy Ghost: which will be especially realized in heaven, where
    God will be "all in all" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A28"
      >1 Cor. 15:28</a
    >), and man entirely subject unto Him. Secondly, they may be considered as
    regards the matter about which their operations are: and thus, in the
    present life they have an operation about a matter, in respect of which they
    will have no operation in the state of glory. Considered in this way, they
    will not remain in the state of glory; just as we have stated to be the case
    with regard to the cardinal virtues (<a href="FS067.html#FSQ67OUTP1"
      >Question [67]</a
    >, <a href="FS067.html#FSQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is speaking there of the gifts
    according as they are compatible with the present state: for it is thus that
    they afford us protection against evil temptations. But in the state of
    glory, where all evil will have ceased, we shall be perfected in good by the
    gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory, in almost every gift, includes
    something that passes away with the present state, and something that
    remains in the future state. For he says that "wisdom strengthens the mind
    with the hope and certainty of eternal things"; of which two, hope passes,
    and certainty remains. Of understanding, he says "that it penetrates the
    truths heard, refreshing the heart and enlightening its darkness," of which,
    hearing passes away, since "they shall teach no more every man... his
    brother" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++31%3A3,4"
      >Jer. 31:3,4</a
    >); but the enlightening of the mind remains. Of counsel he says that it
    "prevents us from being impetuous," which is necessary in the present life;
    and also that "it makes the mind full of reason," which is necessary even in
    the future state. Of fortitude he says that it "fears not adversity," which
    is necessary in the present life; and further, that it "sets before us the
    viands of confidence," which remains also in the future life. With regard to
    knowledge he mentions only one thing, viz. that "she overcomes the void of
    ignorance," which refers to the present state. When, however, he adds "in
    the womb of the mind," this may refer figuratively to the fulness of
    knowledge, which belongs to the future state. Of piety he says that "it
    satisfies the inmost heart with deeds of mercy." These words taken literally
    refer only to the present state: yet the inward regard for our neighbor,
    signified by "the inmost heart," belongs also to the future state, when
    piety will achieve, not works of mercy, but fellowship of joy. Of fear he
    say that "it oppresses the mind, lest it pride itself in present things,"
    which refers to the present state, and that "it strengthens it with the meat
    of hope for the future," which also belongs to the present state, as regards
    hope, but may also refer to the future state, as regards being
    "strengthened" for things we hope are here, and obtain there.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the gifts as to
    their matter. For the matter of the gifts will not be the works of the
    active life; but all the gifts will have their respective acts about things
    pertaining to the contemplative life, which is the life of heavenly
    bliss.<br />

    Whether the gifts are set down by Isaias in their order of dignity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gifts are not set down by
    Isaias in their order of dignity. For the principal gift is, seemingly, that
    which, more than the others, God requires of man. Now God requires of man
    fear, more than the other gifts: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++10%3A12"
      >Dt. 10:12</a
    >): "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that
    thou fear the Lord thy God?" and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Malachi+1%3A6"
      >Malachi 1:6</a
    >): "If... I be a master, where is My fear?" Therefore it seems that fear,
    which is mentioned last, is not the lowest but the greatest of the gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, piety seems to be a kind of common good;
    since the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A8"
      >1 Tim. 4:8</a
    >): "Piety [Douay: 'Godliness'] is profitable to all things." Now a common
    good is preferable to particular goods. Therefore piety, which is given the
    last place but one, seems to be the most excellent gift.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, knowledge perfects man's judgment, while
    counsel pertains to inquiry. But judgment is more excellent than inquiry.
    Therefore knowledge is a more excellent gift than counsel; and yet it is set
    down as being below it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, fortitude pertains to the appetitive
    power, while science belongs to reason. But reason is a more excellent power
    than the appetite. Therefore knowledge is a more excellent gift than
    fortitude; and yet the latter is given the precedence. Therefore the gifts
    are not set down in their order of dignity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says [*De Serm. Dom. in Monte i,
    4]: "It seems to me that the sevenfold operation of the Holy Ghost, of which
    Isaias speaks, agrees in degrees and expression with these [of which we read
    in Mt. 5:3]: but there is a difference of order, for there [viz. in Isaias]
    the enumeration begins with the more excellent gifts, here, with the lower
    gifts."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The excellence of the gifts can be measured in
    two ways: first, simply, viz. by comparison to their proper acts as
    proceeding from their principles; secondly, relatively, viz. by comparison
    to their matter. If we consider the excellence of the gifts simply, they
    follow the same rule as the virtues, as to their comparison one with
    another; because the gifts perfect man for all the acts of the soul's
    powers, even as the virtues do, as stated above (<a
      href="FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). Hence, as the intellectual virtues have the precedence of the moral
    virtues, and among the intellectual virtues, the contemplative are
    preferable to the active, viz. wisdom, understanding and science to prudence
    and art (yet so that wisdom stands before understanding, and understanding
    before science, and prudence and synesis before eubulia): so also among the
    gifts, wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and counsel are more excellent than
    piety, fortitude, and fear; and among the latter, piety excels fortitude,
    and fortitude fear, even as justice surpasses fortitude, and fortitude
    temperance. But in regard to their matter, fortitude and counsel precede
    knowledge and piety: because fortitude and counsel are concerned with
    difficult matters, whereas piety and knowledge regard ordinary matters.
    Consequently the excellence of the gifts corresponds with the order in which
    they are enumerated; but so far as wisdom and understanding are given the
    preference to the others, their excellence is considered simply, while, so
    far, as counsel and fortitude are preferred to knowledge and piety, it is
    considered with regard to their matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fear is chiefly required as being the
    foundation, so to speak, of the perfection of the other gifts, for "the fear
    of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++110%3A10;+Ecclus++1:16"
      >Ps. 110:10; Ecclus. 1:16</a
    >), and not as though it were more excellent than the others. Because, in
    the order of generation, man departs from evil on account of fear (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++16%3A16"
      >Prov. 16:16</a
    >), before doing good works, and which result from the other gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the words quoted from the Apostle,
    piety is not compared with all God's gifts, but only with "bodily exercise,"
    of which he had said it "is profitable to little."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although knowledge stands before counsel
    by reason of its judgment, yet counsel is more excellent by reason of its
    matter: for counsel is only concerned with matters of difficulty (Ethic.
    iii, 3), whereas the judgment of knowledge embraces all matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The directive gifts which pertain to the
    reason are more excellent than the executive gifts, if we consider them in
    relation to their acts as proceeding from their powers, because reason
    transcends the appetite as a rule transcends the thing ruled. But on the
    part of the matter, counsel is united to fortitude as the directive power to
    the executive, and so is knowledge united to piety: because counsel and
    fortitude are concerned with matters of difficulty, while knowledge and
    piety are concerned with ordinary matters. Hence counsel together with
    fortitude, by reason of their matter, are given the preference to knowledge
    and piety.<br />

    Whether the virtues are more excellent than the gifts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the virtues are more excellent
    than the gifts. For Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 18) while speaking of
    charity: "No gift of God is more excellent than this. It is this alone which
    divides the children of the eternal kingdom from the children of eternal
    damnation. Other gifts are bestowed by the Holy Ghost, but, without charity,
    they avail nothing." But charity is a virtue. Therefore a virtue is more
    excellent than the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is first naturally, seems to
    be more excellent. Now the virtues precede the gifts of the Holy Ghost; for
    Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the gift of the Holy Ghost in the mind it
    works on, forms first of all justice, prudence, fortitude, temperance... and
    doth afterwards give it a temper in the seven virtues" [viz. the gifts], so
    "as against folly to bestow wisdom; against dullness, understanding; against
    rashness, counsel; against fear, fortitude; against ignorance, knowledge;
    against hardness of heart, piety; against piety, fear." Therefore the
    virtues are more excellent than the gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19)
    that "the virtues cannot be used to evil purpose." But it is possible to
    make evil use of the gifts, for Gregory says (Moral. i, 18): "We offer up
    the sacrifice of prayer... lest wisdom may uplift; or understanding, while
    it runs nimbly, deviate from the right path; or counsel, while it multiplies
    itself, grow into confusion; that fortitude, while it gives confidence, may
    not make us rash; lest knowledge, while it knows and yet loves not, may
    swell the mind; lest piety, while it swerves from the right line, may become
    distorted; and lest fear, while it is unduly alarmed, may plunge us into the
    pit of despair." Therefore the virtues are more excellent than the gifts of
    the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The gifts are bestowed to assist the virtues
    and to remedy certain defects, as is shown in the passage quoted (OBJ 2), so
    that, seemingly, they accomplish what the virtues cannot. Therefore the
    gifts are more excellent than the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was shown above (<a
      href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="FS058.html#FSQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), there are three kinds of
    virtues: for some are theological, some intellectual, and some moral. The
    theological virtues are those whereby man's mind is united to God; the
    intellectual virtues are those whereby reason itself is perfected; and the
    moral virtues are those which perfect the powers of appetite in obedience to
    the reason. On the other hand the gifts of the Holy Ghost dispose all the
    powers of the soul to be amenable to the Divine motion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the gifts seem to be compared to the theological virtues, by
    which man is united to the Holy Ghost his Mover, in the same way as the
    moral virtues are compared to the intellectual virtues, which perfect the
    reason, the moving principle of the moral virtues. Wherefore as the
    intellectual virtues are more excellent than the moral virtues and control
    them, so the theological virtues are more excellent than the gifts of the
    Holy Ghost and regulate them. Hence Gregory says (Moral. i, 12) that "the
    seven sons," i.e. the seven gifts, "never attain the perfection of the
    number ten, unless all they do be done in faith, hope, and charity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we compare the gifts to the other virtues, intellectual and moral,
    then the gifts have the precedence of the virtues. Because the gifts perfect
    the soul's powers in relation to the Holy Ghost their Mover; whereas the
    virtues perfect, either the reason itself, or the other powers in relation
    to reason: and it is evident that the more exalted the mover, the more
    excellent the disposition whereby the thing moved requires to be disposed.
    Therefore the gifts are more perfect than the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity is a theological virtue; and
    such we grant to be more perfect than the gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are two ways in which one thing
    precedes another. One is in order of perfection and dignity, as love of God
    precedes love of our neighbor: and in this way the gifts precede the
    intellectual and moral virtues, but follow the theological virtues. The
    other is the order of generation or disposition: thus love of one's neighbor
    precedes love of God, as regards the act: and in this way moral and
    intellectual virtues precede the gifts, since man, through being well
    subordinate to his own reason, is disposed to be rightly subordinate to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Wisdom and understanding and the like
    are gifts of the Holy Ghost, according as they are quickened by charity,
    which "dealeth not perversely" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 13:4</a
    >). Consequently wisdom and understanding and the like cannot be used to
    evil purpose, in so far as they are gifts of the Holy Ghost. But, lest they
    depart from the perfection of charity, they assist one another. This is what
    Gregory means to say.<br />
