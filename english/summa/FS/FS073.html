</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all sins are connected. For it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+2%3A10">James 2:10</a>): "Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, but offend in one 
point, is become guilty of all." Now to be guilty of transgressing all 
the precepts of Law, is the same as to commit all sins, because, as 
Ambrose says (De Parad. viii), "sin is a transgression of the Divine law, 
and disobedience of the heavenly commandments." Therefore whoever commits 
one sin is guilty of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, each sin banishes its opposite virtue. Now whoever lacks 
one virtue lacks them all, as was shown above (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore 
whoever commits one sin, is deprived of all the virtues. Therefore 
whoever commits one sin, is guilty of all sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all virtues are connected, because they have a principle 
in common, as stated above (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Now as the virtues have a 
common principle, so have sins, because, as the love of God, which builds 
the city of God, is the beginning and root of all the virtues, so 
self-love, which builds the city of Babylon, is the root of all sins, as 
Augustine declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28). Therefore all vices and sins 
are also connected so that whoever has one, has them all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Some vices are contrary to one another, as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 8). But contraries cannot be together in 
the same subject. Therefore it is impossible for all sins and vices to be 
connected with one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The intention of the man who acts according to virtue in 
pursuance of his reason, is different from the intention of the sinner in 
straying from the path of reason. For the intention of every man acting 
according to virtue is to follow the rule of reason, wherefore the 
intention of all the virtues is directed to the same end, so that all the 
virtues are connected  together in the right reason of things to be done, 
viz. prudence, as stated above (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the intention of the 
sinner is not directed to the point of straying from the path of reason; 
rather is it directed to tend to some appetible good whence it derives 
its species. Now these goods, to which the sinner's intention is directed 
when departing from reason, are of various kinds, having no mutual 
connection; in fact they are sometimes contrary to one another. Since, 
therefore, vices and sins take their species from that to which they 
turn, it is evident that, in respect of that which completes a sin's 
species, sins are not connected with one another. For sin does not 
consist in passing from the many to the one, as is the case with virtues, 
which are connected, but rather in forsaking the one for the many.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> James is speaking of sin, not as regards the thing to which 
it turns and which causes the distinction of sins, as stated above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), but as regards that from which sin turns away, in as much as 
man, by sinning, departs from a commandment of the law. Now all the 
commandments of the law are from one and the same, as he also says in the 
same passage, so that the same God is despised in every sin; and in this 
sense he says that whoever "offends in one point, is become guilty of 
all," for as much as, by committing one sin, he incurs the debt of 
punishment through his contempt of God, which is the origin of all sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the opposite virtue is not 
banished by every act of sin; because venial sin does not destroy virtue; 
while mortal sin destroys infused virtue, by turning man away from God. 
Yet one act, even of mortal sin, does not destroy the habit of acquired 
virtue; though if such acts be repeated so as to engender a contrary 
habit, the habit of acquired virtue is destroyed, the destruction of 
which entails the loss of prudence, since when man acts against any 
virtue whatever, he acts against prudence, without which no moral virtue 
is possible, as stated above (<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently all 
the moral virtues are destroyed as to the perfect and formal being of 
virtue, which they have in so far as they partake of prudence, yet there 
remain the inclinations to virtuous acts, which inclinations, however, 
are not virtues. Nevertheless it does not follow that for this reason man 
contracts all vices of sins---first, because several vices are opposed to 
one virtue, so that a virtue can be destroyed by one of them, without the 
others being present; secondly, because sin is directly opposed to 
virtue, as regards the virtue's inclination to act, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore, as long as any virtuous inclinations remain, it 
cannot be said that man has the opposite vices or sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The love of God is unitive, in as much as it draws man's 
affections from the many to the one; so that the virtues, which flow from 
the love of God, are connected together. But self-love disunites man's 
affections among different things, in so far as man loves himself, by 
desiring for himself temporal goods, which are various and of many kinds: 
hence vices and sins, which arise from self-love, are not connected 
together.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all sins are equal?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all sins are equal. Because sin is to do what 
is unlawful. Now to do what is unlawful is reproved in one and the same 
way in all things. Therefore sin is reproved in one and the same way. 
Therefore one sin is not graver than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sin is a transgression of the rule of reason, 
which is to human acts what a linear rule is in corporeal things. 
Therefore to sin is the same as to pass over a line. But passing over a 
line occurs equally and in the same way, even if one go a long way from 
it or stay near it, since privations do not admit of more or less. 
Therefore all sins are equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sins are opposed to virtues. But all virtues are equal, 
as Cicero states (Paradox. iii). Therefore all sins are equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said to Pilate (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A11">Jn. 19:11</a>): "He that hath 
delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin," and yet it is evident that 
Pilate was guilty of some sin. Therefore one sin is greater than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The opinion of the Stoics, which Cicero adopts in the 
book on Paradoxes (Paradox. iii), was that all sins are equal: from which 
opinion arose the error of certain heretics, who not only hold all sins 
to be equal, but also maintain that all the pains of hell are equal. So 
far as can be gathered from the words of Cicero the Stoics arrived at 
their conclusion through looking at sin on the side of the privation 
only, in so far, to wit, as it is a departure from reason; wherefore 
considering simply that no privation admits of more or less, they held 
that all sins are equal. Yet, if we consider the matter carefully, we 
shall see that there are two kinds of privation. For there is a simple 
and pure privation, which consists, so to speak, in "being" corrupted; 
thus death is privation of life, and darkness is privation of light. Such 
like privations do not admit of more or less, because nothing remains of 
the opposite habit; hence a man is not less dead on the first day after 
his death, or on the third or fourth days, than after a year, when his 
corpse is already dissolved; and, in like manner, a house is no darker if 
the light be covered with several shades, than if it were covered by a 
single shade shutting out all the light. There is, however, another 
privation which is not simple, but retains something of the opposite 
habit; it consists in "becoming" corrupted rather than in "being" 
corrupted, like sickness which is a privation of the due commensuration 
of the humors, yet so that something remains of that commensuration, else 
the animal would cease to live: and the same applies to deformity and the 
like. Such privations admit of more or less on the part of what remains 
or the contrary habit. For it matters much in sickness or deformity, 
whether one departs more or less from the due commensuration of humors or 
members. The same applies to vices and sins: because in them the 
privation of the due commensuration of  reason is such as not to destroy 
the order of reason altogether; else evil, if total, destroys itself, as 
stated in Ethic. iv, 5. For the substance of the act, or the affection of 
the agent could not remain, unless something remained of the order of 
reason. Therefore it matters much to the gravity of a sin whether one 
departs more or less from the rectitude of reason: and accordingly we 
must say that sins are not all equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To commit sin is lawful on account of some inordinateness 
therein: wherefore those which contain a greater inordinateness are more 
unlawful, and consequently graver sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument looks upon sin as though it were a pure 
privation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Virtues are proportionately equal in one and the same 
subject: yet one virtue surpasses another in excellence according to its 
species; and again, one man is more virtuous than another, in the same 
species of virtue, as stated above (<A Href="FS066.html#FSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="FS066.html#FSQ66ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Moreover, even if 
virtues were equal, it would not follow that vices are equal, since 
virtues are connected, and vices or sins are not.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gravity of sins varies according to their objects?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gravity of sins does not vary according to 
their objects. Because the gravity of a sin pertains to its mode or 
quality: whereas the object is the matter of the sin. Therefore the 
gravity of sins does not vary according to their various objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gravity of a sin is the intensity of its malice. Now 
sin does not derive its malice from its proper object to which it turns, 
and which is some appetible good, but rather from that which it turns 
away from. Therefore the gravity of sins does not vary according to their 
various objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sins that have different objects are of different kinds. 
But things of different kinds cannot be compared with one another, as is 
proved in Phys. vii, text. 30, seqq. Therefore one sin is not graver than 
another by reason of the difference of objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Sins take their species from their objects, as was 
shown above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But some sins are graver than others in 
respect of their species, as murder is graver than theft. Therefore the 
gravity of sins varies according to their objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is clear from what has been said (<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the 
gravity of sins varies in the same way as one sickness is graver than 
another: for just as the good of health consists in a certain 
commensuration of the humors, in keeping with an animal's nature, so the 
good of virtue consists in a certain commensuration  of the human act in 
accord with the rule of reason. Now it is evident that the higher the 
principle the disorder of which causes the disorder in the humors, the 
graver is the sickness: thus a sickness which comes on the human body 
from the heart, which is the principle of life, or from some neighboring 
part, is more dangerous. Wherefore a sin must needs be so much the 
graver, as the disorder occurs in a principle which is higher in the 
order of reason. Now in matters of action the reason directs all things 
in view of the end: wherefore the higher the end which attaches to sins 
in human acts, the graver the sin. Now the object of an act is its end, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2); and consequently the difference of 
gravity in sins depends on their objects. Thus it is clear that external 
things are directed to man as their end, while man is further directed to 
God as his end. Wherefore a sin which is about the very substance of man, 
e.g. murder, is graver than a sin which is about external things, e.g. 
theft; and graver still is a sin committed directly against God, e.g. 
unbelief, blasphemy, and the like: and in each of these grades of sin, 
one sin will be graver than another according as it is about a higher or 
lower principle. And forasmuch as sins take their species from their 
objects, the difference of gravity which is derived from the objects is 
first and foremost, as resulting from the species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the object is the matter about which an act is 
concerned, yet it has the character of an end, in so far as the intention 
of the agent is fixed on it, as stated above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2). Now the 
form of a moral act depends on the end, as was shown above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the very fact that man turns unduly to some mutable 
good, it follows that he turns away from the immutable Good, which 
aversion completes the nature of evil. Hence the various degrees of 
malice in sins must needs follow the diversity of those things to which 
man turns.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All the objects of human acts are related to one another, 
wherefore all human acts are somewhat of one kind, in so far as they are 
directed to the last end. Therefore nothing prevents all sins from being 
compared with one another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gravity of sins depends on the excellence of the virtues to which they are opposed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gravity of sins does not vary according to 
the excellence of the virtues to which they are opposed, so that, to wit, 
the graver the sin is opposed to the greater virtue. For, according to 
Prov. 15:5, "In abundant justice there is the greatest strength." Now, as 
Our Lord says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A20,+seqq+">Mt. 5:20, seqq.</a>) abundant justice restrains anger, which 
is a less grievous sin than murder, which less abundant justice 
restrains. Therefore the least grievous sin is opposed to the greatest 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated in Ethic. ii, 3 that "virtue is  about the 
difficult and the good": whence it seems to follow that the greater 
virtue is about what is more difficult. But it is a less grievous sin to 
fail in what is more difficult, than in what is less difficult. Therefore 
the less grievous sin is opposed to the greater virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a greater virtue than faith or hope (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A13">1 Cor. 13:13</a>). Now hatred which is opposed to charity is a less grievous sin 
than unbelief or despair which are opposed to faith and hope. Therefore 
the less grievous sin is opposed to the greater virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. 8:10) that the "worst is 
opposed to the best." Now in morals the best is the greatest virtue; and 
the worst is the most grievous sin. Therefore the most grievous sin is 
opposed to the greatest virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A sin is opposed to a virtue in two ways: first, 
principally and directly; that sin, to with, which is about the same 
object: because contraries are about the same thing. In this way, the 
more grievous sin must needs be opposed to the greater virtue: because, 
just as the degrees of gravity in a sin depend on the object, so also 
does the greatness of a virtue, since both sin and virtue take their 
species from the object, as shown above (<A Href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Wherefore the greatest sin must needs be directly opposed to the greatest 
virtue, as being furthest removed from it in the same genus. Secondly, 
the opposition of virtue to sin may be considered in respect of a certain 
extension of the virtue in checking sin. For the greater a virtue is, the 
further it removes man from the contrary sin, so that it withdraws man 
not only from that sin, but also from whatever leads to it. And thus it 
is evident that the greater a virtue is, the more it withdraws man also 
from less grievous sins: even as the more perfect health is, the more 
does it ward off even minor ailments. And in this way the less grievous 
sin is opposed to the greater virtue, on the part of the latter's effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the opposition which consists in 
restraining from sin; for thus abundant justice checks even minor sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The greater virtue that is about a more difficult good is 
opposed directly to the sin which is about a more difficult evil. For in 
each case there is a certain superiority, in that the will is shown to be 
more intent on good or evil, through not being overcome by the difficulty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Charity is not any kind of love, but the love of God: hence 
not any kind of hatred is opposed to it directly, but the hatred of God, 
which is the most grievous of all sins.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether carnal sins are of less guilt than spiritual sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that carnal sins are not of less guilt than 
spiritual sins. Because adultery is a more grievous sin than theft: for 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++6%3A30,32">Prov. 6:30,32</a>): "The fault is not so great when a man has 
stolen . . . but he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart 
shall destroy his own soul." Now theft belongs to covetousness, which is 
a spiritual sin; while adultery pertains to lust, which is a carnal sin. 
Therefore carnal sins are of greater guilt than spiritual sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in his commentary on Leviticus [*The 
quotation is from De Civ. Dei ii, 4 and iv, 31.] that "the devil rejoices 
chiefly in lust and idolatry." But he rejoices more in the greater sin. 
Therefore, since lust is a carnal sin, it seems that the carnal sins are 
of most guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher proves (Ethic. vii, 6) that "it is more 
shameful to be incontinent in lust than in anger." But anger is a 
spiritual sin, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 17); while lust 
pertains to carnal sins. Therefore carnal sin is more grievous than 
spiritual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxiii, 11) that carnal sins are 
of less guilt, but of more shame than spiritual sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Spiritual sins are of greater guilt than carnal sins: yet 
this does not mean that each spiritual sin is of greater guilt than each 
carnal sin; but that, considering the sole difference between spiritual 
and carnal, spiritual sins are more grievous than carnal sins, other 
things being equal. Three reasons may be assigned for this. The first is 
on the part of the subject: because spiritual sins belong to the spirit, 
to which it is proper to turn to God, and to turn away from Him; whereas 
carnal sins are consummated in the carnal pleasure of the appetite, to 
which it chiefly belongs to turn to goods of the body; so that carnal 
sin, as such, denotes more a "turning to" something, and for that reason, 
implies a closer cleaving; whereas spiritual sin denotes more a "turning 
from" something, whence the notion of guilt arises; and for this reason 
it involves greater guilt. A second reason may be taken on the part of 
the person against whom sin is committed: because carnal sin, as such, is 
against the sinner's own body, which he ought to love less, in the order 
of charity, than God and his neighbor, against whom he commits spiritual 
sins, and consequently spiritual sins, as such, are of greater guilt. A 
third reason may be taken from the motive, since the stronger the impulse 
to sin, the less grievous the sin, as we shall state further on (<A Href="FS073.html#FSQ73A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). 
Now carnal sins have a stronger impulse, viz. our innate concupiscence of 
the flesh. Therefore spiritual sins, as such, are of greater guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Adultery belongs not only to the sin of lust, but also to 
the sin of injustice, and in this respect may be brought under the head 
of covetousness, as a gloss observes on Eph. 5:5. "No fornicator, or 
unclean, or covetous person," etc.; so that adultery is so much more 
grievous than theft, as a man loves his  wife more than his chattels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The devil is said to rejoice chiefly in the sin of lust, 
because it is of the greatest adhesion, and man can with difficulty be 
withdrawn from it. "For the desire of pleasure is insatiable," as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. iii, 12).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher himself says (Ethic. vii, 6), the reason 
why it is more shameful to be incontinent in lust than in anger, is that 
lust partakes less of reason; and in the same sense he says (Ethic. iii, 
10) that "sins of intemperance are most worthy of reproach, because they 
are about those pleasures which are common to us and irrational minds": 
hence, by these sins man is, so to speak, brutalized; for which same 
reason Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 17) that they are more shameful.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gravity of a sin depends on its cause?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gravity of a sin does not depend on its 
cause. Because the greater a sin's cause, the more forcibly it moves to 
sin, and so the more difficult is it to resist. But sin is lessened by 
the fact that it is difficult to resist; for it denotes weakness in the 
sinner, if he cannot easily resist sin; and a sin that is due to weakness 
is deemed less grievous. Therefore sin does not derive its gravity from 
its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, concupiscence is a general cause of sin; wherefore a 
gloss on Rm. 7:7, "For I had not known concupiscence," says: "The law is 
good, since by forbidding concupiscence, it forbids all evils." Now the 
greater the concupiscence by which man is overcome, the less grievous his 
sin. Therefore the gravity of a sin is diminished by the greatness of its 
cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as rectitude of the reason is the cause of a virtuous 
act, so defect in the reason seems to be the cause of sin. Now the 
greater the defect in the reason, the less grievous the sin: so much so 
that he who lacks the use of reason, is altogether excused from sin, and 
he who sins through ignorance, sins less grievously. Therefore the 
gravity of a sin is not increased by the greatness of its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> If the cause be increased, the effect is increased. 
Therefore the greater the cause of sin, the more grievous the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the genus of sin, as in every other genus, two causes 
may be observed. The first is the direct and proper cause of sin, and is 
the will to sin: for it is compared to the sinful act, as a tree to its 
fruit, as a gloss observes on Mt. 7:18, "A good tree cannot bring forth 
evil fruit": and the greater this cause is, the more grievous will the 
sin be, since the greater the will to sin, the more grievously does man 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other causes of sin are extrinsic and remote, as it were, being 
those whereby the will is inclined to sin. Among these causes we must 
make a distinction; for some of them induce the will to sin in accord 
with the very nature of the will: such is the end, which is the proper 
object of the will; and by a such like cause sin is made more grievous, 
because a man sins more grievously if his will is induced to sin by the 
intention of a more evil end. Other causes incline the will to sin, 
against the nature and order of the will, whose natural inclination is to 
be moved freely of itself in accord with the judgment of reason. 
Wherefore those causes which weaken the judgment of reason (e.g. 
ignorance), or which weaken the free movement of the will, (e.g. 
weakness, violence, fear, or the like), diminish the gravity of sin, even 
as they diminish its voluntariness; and so much so, that if the act be 
altogether involuntary, it is no longer sinful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the extrinsic moving cause, which 
diminishes voluntariness. The increase of such a cause diminishes the 
sin, as stated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If concupiscence be understood to include the movement of 
the will, then, where there is greater concupiscence, there is a greater 
sin. But if by concupiscence we understand a passion, which is a movement 
of the concupiscible power, then a greater concupiscence, forestalling 
the judgment of reason and the movement of the will, diminishes the sin, 
because the man who sins, being stimulated by a greater concupiscence, 
falls through a more grievous temptation, wherefore he is less to be 
blamed. On the other hand, if concupiscence be taken in this sense 
follows the judgment of reason, and the movement of the will, then the 
greater concupiscence, the graver the sin: because sometimes the movement 
of concupiscence is redoubled by the will tending unrestrainedly to its 
object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the cause which renders the act 
involuntary, and such a cause diminishes the gravity of sin, as stated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a circumstance aggravates a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a circumstance does not aggravate a sin. 
Because sin takes its gravity from its species. Now a circumstance does 
not specify a sin, for it is an accident thereof. Therefore the gravity 
of a sin is not taken from a circumstance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a circumstance is either evil or not: if it is evil, it 
causes, of itself, a species of evil; and if it is not evil, it cannot 
make a thing worse. Therefore a circumstance nowise aggravates a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the malice of a sin is derived from its turning away 
(from God). But circumstances affect sin on the part of the object to 
which it turns. Therefore they do not add to the  sin's malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ignorance of a circumstance diminishes sin: for he who 
sins through ignorance of a circumstance, deserves to be forgiven (Ethic. 
iii, 1). Now this would not be the case unless a circumstance aggravated 
a sin. Therefore a circumstance makes a sin more grievous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher says in speaking of habits of virtue 
(Ethic. ii, 1,2), "it is natural for a thing to be increased by that 
which causes it." Now it is evident that a sin is caused by a defect in 
some circumstance: because the fact that a man departs from the order of 
reason is due to his not observing the due circumstances in his action. 
Wherefore it is evident that it is natural for a sin to be aggravated by 
reason of its circumstances. This happens in three ways. First, in so far 
as a circumstance draws a sin from one kind to another: thus fornication 
is the intercourse of a man with one who is not his wife: but if to this 
be added the circumstance that the latter is the wife of another, the sin 
is drawn to another kind of sin, viz. injustice, in so far as he usurps 
another's property; and in this respect adultery is a more grievous sin 
than fornication. Secondly, a circumstance aggravates a sin, not by 
drawing it into another genus, but only by multiplying the ratio of sin: 
thus if a wasteful man gives both when he ought not, and to whom he ought 
not to give, he commits the same kind of sin in more ways than if he were 
to merely to give to whom he ought not, and for that very reason his sin 
is more grievous; even as that sickness is the graver which affects more 
parts of the body. Hence Cicero says (Paradox. iii) that "in taking his 
father's life a man commits many sins; for he outrages one who begot him, 
who fed him, who educated him, to whom he owes his lands, his house, his 
position in the republic." Thirdly, a circumstance aggravates a sin by 
adding to the deformity which the sin derives from another circumstance: 
thus, taking another's property constitutes the sin of theft; but if to 
this be added the circumstance that much is taken of another's property, 
the sin will be more grievous; although in itself, to take more or less 
has not the character of a good or of an evil act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some circumstances do specify a moral act, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). Nevertheless a circumstance which does not give the 
species, may aggravate a sin; because, even as the goodness of a thing is 
weighed, not only in reference to its species, but also in reference to 
an accident, so the malice of an act is measured, not only according to 
the species of that act, but also according to a circumstance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A circumstance may aggravate a sin either way. For if it is 
evil, it does not follow that it constitutes the sin's species; because 
it may multiply the ratio of evil within the same species, as stated 
above. And if it be not evil, it may aggravate a sin in relation to the 
malice of another circumstance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Reason should direct the action not only as  regards the 
object, but also as regards every circumstance. Therefore one may turn 
aside from the rule of reason through corruption of any single 
circumstance; for instance, by doing something when one ought not or 
where one ought not; and to depart thus from the rule of reason suffices 
to make the act evil. This turning aside from the rule of reason results 
from man's turning away from God, to Whom man ought to be united by right 
reason.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sin is aggravated by reason of its causing more harm?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a sin is not aggravated by reason of its 
causing more harm. Because the harm done is an issue consequent to the 
sinful act. But the issue of an act does not add to its goodness or 
malice, as stated above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore a sin is not aggravated 
on account of its causing more harm.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, harm is inflicted by sins against our neighbor. Because 
no one wishes to harm himself: and no one can harm God, according to Job 
35:6,8: "If thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him? 
. . . Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee." If, therefore, 
sins were aggravated through causing more harm, it would follow that sins 
against our neighbor are more grievous than sins against God or oneself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, greater harm is inflicted on a man by depriving him of 
the life of grace, than by taking away his natural life; because the life 
of grace is better than the life of nature, so far that man ought to 
despise his natural life lest he lose the life of grace. Now, speaking 
absolutely, a man who leads a woman to commit fornication deprives her of 
the life of grace by leading her into mortal sin. If therefore a sin were 
more grievous on account of its causing a greater harm, it would follow 
that fornication, absolutely speaking, is a more grievous sin than 
murder, which is evidently untrue. Therefore a sin is not more grievous 
on account of its causing a greater harm.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 14): "Since vice is 
contrary to nature, a vice is the more grievous according as it 
diminishes the integrity of nature." Now the diminution of the integrity 
of nature is a harm. Therefore a sin is graver according as it does more 
harm.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Harm may bear a threefold relation to sin. Because 
sometimes the harm resulting from a sin is foreseen and intended, as when 
a man does something with a mind to harm another, e.g. a murderer or a 
thief. In this case the quantity of harm aggravates the sin directly, 
because then the harm is the direct object of the sin. Sometimes the harm 
is foreseen, but not intended; for instance, when a man takes a short cut 
through a field, the result being that he knowingly injures the growing 
crops, although his intention is not to do this harm, but to commit 
fornication. In this case again the quantity of the harm done  aggravates 
the sin; indirectly, however, in so far, to wit, as it is owing to his 
will being strongly inclined to sin, that a man does not forbear from 
doing, to himself or to another, a harm which he would not wish simply. 
Sometimes, however, the harm is neither foreseen nor intended: and then 
if this harm is connected with the sin accidentally, it does not 
aggravate the sin directly; but, on account of his neglecting to consider 
the harm that might ensue, a man is deemed punishable for the evil 
results of his action if it be unlawful. If, on the other hand, the harm 
follow directly from the sinful act, although it be neither foreseen nor 
intended, it aggravates the sin directly, because whatever is directly 
consequent to a sin, belongs, in a manner, to the very species of that 
sin: for instance, if a man is a notorious fornicator, the result is that 
many are scandalized; and although such was not his intention, nor was it 
perhaps foreseen by him, yet it aggravates his sin directly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this does not seem to apply to penal harm, which the sinner himself 
incurs. Such like harm, if accidentally connected with the sinful act, 
and if neither foreseen nor intended, does not aggravate a sin, nor does 
it correspond with the gravity of the sin: for instance, if a man in 
running to slay, slips and hurts his foot. If, on the other hand, this 
harm is directly consequent to the sinful act, although perhaps it be 
neither foreseen nor intended, then greater harm does not make greater 
sin, but, on the contrary, a graver sin calls for the infliction of a 
greater harm. Thus, an unbeliever who has heard nothing about the pains 
of hell, would suffer greater pain in hell for a sin of murder than for a 
sin of theft: but his sin is not aggravated on account of his neither 
intending nor foreseeing this, as it would be in the case of a believer, 
who, seemingly, sins more grievously in the very fact that he despises a 
greater punishment, that he may satisfy his desire to sin; but the 
gravity of this harm is caused by the sole gravity of sin.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we have already stated (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), in treating of the 
goodness and malice of external actions, the result of an action if 
foreseen and intended adds to the goodness and malice of an act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the harm done aggravates a sin, it does not follow 
that this alone renders a sin more grievous: in fact, it is 
inordinateness which of itself aggravates a sin. Wherefore the harm 
itself that ensues aggravates a sin, in so far only as it renders the act 
more inordinate. Hence it does not follow, supposing harm to be inflicted 
chiefly by sins against our neighbor, that such sins are the most 
grievous, since a much greater inordinateness is to be found against 
which man commits against God, and in some which he commits against 
himself. Moreover we might say that although no man can do God any harm 
in His substance, yet he can endeavor to do so in things concerning Him, 
e.g. by destroying faith, by outraging holy things, which are most 
grievous sins. Again, a man sometimes knowingly and freely inflicts harm 
on himself, as in the case of suicide, though this be referred  finally 
to some apparent good, for example, delivery from some anxiety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument does not prove, for two reasons: first, 
because the murderer intends directly to do harm to his neighbors; 
whereas the fornicator who solicits the woman intends not to harm but 
pleasure; secondly, because murder is the direct and sufficient cause of 
bodily death; whereas no man can of himself be the sufficient cause of 
another's spiritual death, because no man dies spiritually except by 
sinning of his own will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a sin is aggravated by reason of the condition of the person against whom it is committed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sin is not aggravated by reason of the 
condition of the person against whom it is committed. For if this were 
the case a sin would be aggravated chiefly by being committed against a 
just and holy man. But this does not aggravate a sin: because a virtuous 
man who bears a wrong with equanimity is less harmed by the wrong done 
him, than others, who, through being scandalized, are also hurt inwardly. 
Therefore the condition of the person against whom a sin is committed 
does not aggravate the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if the condition of the person aggravated the sin, this 
would be still more the case if the person be near of kin, because, as 
Cicero says (Paradox. iii): "The man who kills his slave sins once: he 
that takes his father's life sins many times." But the kinship of a 
person sinned against does not apparently aggravate a sin, because every 
man is most akin to himself; and yet it is less grievous to harm oneself 
than another, e.g. to kill one's own, than another's horse, as the 
Philosopher declares (Ethic. v, 11). Therefore kinship of the person 
sinned against does not aggravate the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the condition of the person who sins aggravates a sin 
chiefly on account of his position or knowledge, according to Wis. 6:7: 
"The mighty shall be mightily tormented," and Lk. 12:47: "The servant who 
knew the will of his lord . . . and did it not . . . shall be beaten with 
many stripes." Therefore, in like manner, on the part of the person 
sinned against, the sin is made more grievous by reason of his position 
and knowledge. But, apparently, it is not a more grievous sin to inflict 
an injury on a rich and powerful person than on a poor man, since "there 
is no respect of persons with God" (Col. 3:25), according to Whose 
judgment the gravity of a sin is measured. Therefore the condition of the 
person sinned against does not aggravate the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Holy Writ censures especially those sins that are 
committed against the servants of God. Thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Kgs++19%3A14">3 Kgs. 19:14</a>): 
"They have destroyed Thy altars, they have slain Thy prophets with the 
sword." Moreover much blame is attached to the sin committed by a man 
against those who are akin to him, according to Micah 7:6: "the son 
dishonoreth the father, and the daughter  riseth up against her mother." 
Furthermore sins committed against persons of rank are expressly 
condemned: thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+34%3A18">Job 34:18</a>): "Who saith to the king: 'Thou 
art an apostate'; who calleth rulers ungodly." Therefore the condition of 
the person sinned against aggravates the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The person sinned against is, in a manner, the object of 
the sin. Now it has been stated above (<A Href="FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that the primary gravity of 
a sin is derived from its object; so that a sin is deemed to be so much 
the more grave, as its object is a more principal end. But the principal 
ends of human acts are God, man himself, and his neighbor: for whatever 
we do, it is on account of one of these that we do it; although one of 
them is subordinate to the other. Therefore the greater or lesser gravity 
of a sin, in respect of the person sinned against, may be considered on 
the part of these three.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the part of God, to Whom man is the more closely united, as he 
is more virtuous or more sacred to God: so that an injury inflicted on 
such a person redounds on to God according to Zach. 2:8: "He that 
toucheth you, toucheth the apple of My eye." Wherefore a sin is the more 
grievous, according as it is committed against a person more closely 
united to God by reason of personal sanctity, or official station. On the 
part of man himself, it is evident that he sins all the more grievously, 
according as the person against whom he sins, is more united to him, 
either through natural affinity or kindness received or any other bond; 
because he seems to sin against himself rather than the other, and, for 
this very reason, sins all the more grievously, according to Ecclus. 
14:5: "He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?" On the part 
of his neighbor, a man sins the more grievously, according as his sin 
affects more persons: so that a sin committed against a public personage, 
e.g. a sovereign prince who stands in the place of the whole people, is 
more grievous than a sin committed against a private person; hence it is 
expressly prohibited (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A28">Ex. 22:28</a>): "The prince of thy people thou shalt 
not curse." In like manner it would seem that an injury done to a person 
of prominence, is all the more grave, on account of the scandal and the 
disturbance it would cause among many people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who inflicts an injury on a virtuous person, so far as 
he is concerned, disturbs him internally and externally; but that the 
latter is not disturbed internally is due to his goodness, which does not 
extenuate the sin of the injurer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The injury which a man inflicts on himself in those things 
which are subject to the dominion of his will, for instance his 
possessions, is less sinful than if it were inflicted on another, because 
he does it of his own will; but in those things that are not subject to 
the dominion of his will, such as natural and spiritual goods, it is a 
graver sin to inflict an injury on oneself: for it is more grievous for a 
man to kill himself than another. Since, however, things belonging to our 
neighbor are not subject to the dominion of our will, the argument fails 
to prove,  in respect of injuries done to such like things, that it is 
less grievous to sin in their regard, unless indeed our neighbor be 
willing, or give his approval.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is no respect for persons if God punishes more 
severely those who sin against a person of higher rank; for this is done 
because such an injury redounds to the harm of many.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the excellence of the person sinning aggravates the sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the excellence of the person sinning does not 
aggravate the sin. For man becomes great chiefly by cleaving to God, 
according to Ecclus. 25:13: "How great is he that findeth wisdom and 
knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord." Now the 
more a man cleaves to God, the less is a sin imputed to him: for it is 
written (2 Paral. 30: 18,19): "The Lord Who is good will show mercy to 
all them, who with their whole heart seek the Lord the God of their 
fathers; and will not impute it to them that they are not sanctified." 
Therefore a sin is not aggravated by the excellence of the person sinning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "there is no respect of persons with God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++2%3A11">Rm. 2:11</a>). 
Therefore He does not punish one man more than another, for one and the 
same sin. Therefore a sin is not aggravated by the excellence of the 
person sinning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one should reap disadvantage from good. But he would, 
if his action were the more blameworthy on account of his goodness. 
Therefore a sin is not aggravated by reason of the excellence of the 
person sinning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (De Summo Bono ii, 18): "A sin is deemed 
so much the more grievous as the sinner is held to be a more excellent 
person."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sin is twofold. There is a sin which takes us unawares on 
account of the weakness of human nature: and such like sins are less 
imputable to one who is more virtuous, because he is less negligent in 
checking those sins, which nevertheless human weakness does not allow us 
to escape altogether. But there are other sins which proceed from 
deliberation: and these sins are all the more imputed to man according as 
he is more excellent. Four reasons may be assigned for this. First, 
because a more excellent person, e.g. one who excels in knowledge and 
virtue, can more easily resist sin; hence Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++12%3A47">Lk. 12:47</a>) that 
the "servant who knew the will of his lord . . . and did it not . . . 
shall be beaten with many stripes." Secondly, on account of ingratitude, 
because every good in which a man excels, is a gift of God, to Whom man 
is ungrateful when he sins: and in this respect any excellence, even in 
temporal goods, aggravates a sin, according to Wis. 6:7: "The mighty 
shall be mightily tormented." Thirdly, on account of the sinful act being 
specially inconsistent with the excellence of the person sinning: for 
instance, if a prince were to  violate justice, whereas he is set up as 
the guardian of justice, or if a priest were to be a fornicator, whereas 
he has taken the vow of chastity. Fourthly, on account of the example or 
scandal; because, as Gregory says (Pastor. i, 2): "Sin becomes much more 
scandalous, when the sinner is honored for his position": and the sins of 
the great are much more notorious and men are wont to bear them with more 
indignation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted alludes to those things which are done 
negligently when we are taken unawares through human weakness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God does not respect persons in punishing the great more 
severely, because their excellence conduces to the gravity of their sin, 
as stated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[73] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The man who excels in anything reaps disadvantage, not from 
the good which he has, but from his abuse thereof.<br>
