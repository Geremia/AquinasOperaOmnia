</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all sorrow is evil. For Gregory of Nyssa 
[*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xix.] says: "All sorrow is evil, from its very 
nature." Now what is naturally evil, is evil always and everywhere. 
Therefore, all sorrow is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which all, even the virtuous, avoid, is evil. But 
all avoid sorrow, even the virtuous, since as stated in Ethic. vii, 11, 
"though the prudent man does not aim at pleasure, yet he aims at avoiding 
sorrow." Therefore sorrow is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as bodily evil is the object and cause of bodily 
pain, so spiritual evil is the object and cause of sorrow in the soul. 
But every bodily pain is a bodily evil. Therefore every spiritual sorrow 
is an evil of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Sorrow for evil is contrary to pleasure in evil. But 
pleasure in evil is evil: wherefore in condemnation of certain men, it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++2:14">Prov. 2:14</a>), that "they were glad when they had done evil." 
Therefore sorrow for evil is good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be good or evil in two ways: first considered 
simply and in itself; and thus all sorrow is an evil, because the mere 
fact of a man's appetite being uneasy about a present evil, is itself an 
evil, because it hinders the response of the appetite in good. Secondly, 
a thing is said to be good or evil, on the supposition of something else: 
thus shame is said to be good, on the supposition of a shameful deed 
done, as stated in Ethic. iv, 9. Accordingly, supposing the presence of 
something saddening or painful, it is a sign of goodness if a man is in 
sorrow or pain on account of this present evil. For if he were not to be 
in sorrow or pain, this could only be either because he feels it not, or 
because he does not reckon it as something unbecoming, both of which are 
manifest evils. Consequently it is a condition of goodness, that, 
supposing an evil to be present, sorrow or pain should ensue. Wherefore 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 14): "It is also a good thing that he 
sorrows for the good he has lost: for had not some good remained in his 
nature, he could not be punished by the loss of good." Because, however, 
in the science of Morals, we consider things individually---for actions 
are concerned about individuals---that which is good on some supposition, 
should be considered as good: just as that which is voluntary on some 
supposition, is judged to be voluntary, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1, and 
likewise above (<A Href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="FS006.html#FSQ6A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius] is speaking of sorrow on the 
part of the evil that causes it, but not on the part of the subject that 
feels and rejects the evil. And from this point of view, all shun sorrow, 
inasmuch as they shun evil: but they do not shun the perception and 
rejection of evil. The same also applies to bodily pain: because the 
perception and rejection of bodily evil is the proof of the goodness of 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Second and Third Objections.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sorrow can be a virtuous good?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sorrow is not a virtuous good. For that which 
leads to hell is not a virtuous good. But, as Augustine says (Gen. ad 
lit. xii, 33), "Jacob seems to have feared lest he should be troubled 
overmuch by sorrow, and so, instead of entering into the rest of the 
blessed, be consigned to the hell of sinners." Therefore sorrow is not a 
virtuous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the virtuous good is praiseworthy and meritorious. But 
sorrow lessens praise or merit: for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++9:7">2 Cor. 9:7</a>): 
"Everyone, as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of 
necessity." Therefore sorrow is not a virtuous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15), "sorrow is 
concerned about those things which happen against our will." But not to 
will those things which are actually taking place, is to have a will 
opposed to the decree of God, to Whose providence whatever is done is 
subject. Since, then, conformity of the human to the Divine will is a 
condition of the rectitude of the will, as stated above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), it 
seems that sorrow is incompatible with rectitude of the will, and that 
consequently it is not virtuous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever merits the reward of eternal life is virtuous. 
But such is sorrow; as is evident from Mt. 5:5: "Blessed are they that 
mourn, for they shall be comforted." Therefore sorrow is a virtuous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In so far as sorrow is good, it can be a virtuous good. 
For it has been said above (<A Href="FS039.html#FSQ39A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that sorrow is a good inasmuch as it 
denotes perception and rejection of evil. These two things, as regards 
bodily pain, are a proof of the goodness of nature, to which it is due 
that the senses perceive, and that nature shuns, the harmful thing that 
causes pain. As regards interior sorrow, perception of the evil is 
sometimes due to a right judgment of reason; while the rejection of the 
evil is the act of the will, well disposed and detesting that evil. Now 
every virtuous good results from these two things, the rectitude of the 
reason and the will. Wherefore it is evident that sorrow may be a 
virtuous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the passions of the soul should be regulated according 
to the rule of reason, which is the root of the virtuous good; but 
excessive sorrow, of which Augustine is speaking, oversteps this rule, 
and therefore it fails to be a virtuous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as sorrow for an evil arises from a right will and 
reason, which detest the evil, so sorrow for a good is due to a perverse 
reason and will, which detest the good. Consequently such sorrow is an 
obstacle to the praise and merit of the virtuous good; for instance, when 
a man gives an alms sorrowfully. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some things do actually happen, not because God wills, but 
because He permits them to happen---such as sins. Consequently a will 
that is opposed to sin, whether in oneself or in another, is not 
discordant from the Divine will. Penal evils happen actually, even by 
God's will. But it is not necessary for the rectitude of his will, that 
man should will them in themselves: but only that he should not revolt 
against the order of Divine justice, as stated above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sorrow can be a useful good?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sorrow cannot be a useful good. For it is 
written (Ecclus. 30:25): "Sadness hath killed many, and there is no 
profit in it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, choice is of that which is useful to an end. But sorrow 
is not an object of choice; in fact, "a thing without sorrow is to be 
chosen rather than the same thing with sorrow" (Topic. iii, 2). Therefore 
sorrow is not a useful good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Everything is for the sake of its own operation," as 
stated in De Coel. ii, 3. But "sorrow hinders operation," as stated in 
Ethic. x, 5. Therefore sorrow is not a useful good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The wise man seeks only that which is useful. But 
according to Eccles. 7:5, "the heart of the wise is where there is 
mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth." Therefore sorrow 
is useful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A twofold movement of the appetite ensues from a present 
evil. One is that whereby the appetite is opposed to the present evil; 
and, in this respect, sorrow is of no use; because that which is present, 
cannot be not present. The other movement arises in the appetite to the 
effect of avoiding or expelling the saddening evil: and, in this respect, 
sorrow is of use, if it be for something which ought to be avoided. 
Because there are two reasons for which it may be right to avoid a thing. 
First, because it should be avoided in itself, on account of its being 
contrary to good; for instance, sin. Wherefore sorrow for sin is useful 
as inducing a man to avoid sin: hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++7:9">2 Cor. 7:9</a>): "I 
am glad: not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made 
sorrowful unto penance." Secondly, a thing is to be avoided, not as 
though it were evil in itself, but because it is an occasion of evil; 
either through one's being attached to it, and loving it too much, or 
through one's being thrown headlong thereby into an evil, as is evident 
in the case of temporal goods. And, in this respect, sorrow for temporal 
goods may be useful; according to Eccles. 7:3: "It is better to go to the 
house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put 
in mind of the end of all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, sorrow for that which ought to be avoided is always useful, 
since it adds another motive for avoiding it. Because the very evil is in 
itself a thing to be avoided: while everyone avoids sorrow for its own 
sake, just as everyone seeks the good, and pleasure in the good. 
Therefore just as pleasure in the good makes one seek the good more 
earnestly, so sorrow for evil makes one avoid evil more eagerly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This passage is to be taken as referring to excessive 
sorrow, which consumes the soul: for such sorrow paralyzes the soul, and 
hinders it from shunning evil, as stated above (<A Href="FS037.html#FSQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="FS037.html#FSQ37A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as any object of choice becomes less eligible by 
reason of sorrow, so that which ought to be shunned is still more to be 
shunned by reason of sorrow: and, in this respect, sorrow is useful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sorrow caused by an action hinders that action: but sorrow 
for the cessation of an action, makes one do it more earnestly.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether bodily pain is the greatest evil?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pain is the greatest evil. Because "the worst 
is contrary to the best" (Ethic. viii, 10). But a certain pleasure is the 
greatest good, viz. the pleasure of bliss. Therefore a certain pain is 
the greatest evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, happiness is man's greatest good, because it is his last 
end. But man's Happiness consists in his "having whatever he will, and in 
willing naught amiss," as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, Objection [5]; <A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>, <A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, Objection [3]). Therefore man's greatest good consists in the fulfilment of his 
will. Now pain consists in something happening contrary to the will, as 
Augustine declares (De Civ. Dei xiv, 6,15). Therefore pain is man's 
greatest evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine argues thus (Soliloq. i, 12): "We are composed 
of two parts, i.e. of a soul and a body, whereof the body is the 
inferior. Now the sovereign good is the greatest good of the better part: 
while the supreme evil is the greatest evil of the inferior part. But 
wisdom is the greatest good of the soul; while the worst thing in the 
body is pain. Therefore man's greatest good is to be wise: while his 
greatest evil is to suffer pain."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Guilt is a greater evil than punishment, as was stated 
in the FP, Question [48], Article [6]. But sorrow or pain belongs to the punishment of 
sin, just as the enjoyment of changeable things is an evil of guilt. For 
Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xii): "What is pain of the soul, except 
for the soul to be deprived of that which it was wont to enjoy, or had 
hoped to enjoy? And this is all that is called evil, i.e. sin, and the 
punishment of sin." Therefore sorrow or pain is not man's greatest evil. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for any sorrow or pain to be man's 
greatest evil. For all sorrow or pain is either for something that is 
truly evil, or for something that is apparently evil, but good in 
reality. Now pain or sorrow for that which is truly evil cannot be the 
greatest evil: for there is something worse, namely, either not to reckon 
as evil that which is really evil, or not to reject it. Again, sorrow or 
pain, for that which is apparently evil, but really good, cannot be the 
greatest evil, for it would be worse to be altogether separated from that 
which is truly good. Hence it is impossible for any sorrow or pain to be 
man's greatest evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Pleasure and sorrow have two good points in common: namely, 
a true judgment concerning good and evil; and the right order of the will 
in approving of good and rejecting evil. Thus it is clear that in pain or 
sorrow there is a good, by the removal of which they become worse: and 
yet there is not an evil in every pleasure, by the removal of which the 
pleasure is better. Consequently, a pleasure can be man's highest good, 
in the way above stated (<A Href="FS034.html#FSQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>, <A Href="FS034.html#FSQ34A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): whereas sorrow cannot be man's 
greatest evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The very fact of the will being opposed to evil is a good. 
And for this reason, sorrow or pain cannot be the greatest evil; because 
it has an admixture of good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[39] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which harms the better thing is worse than that which 
harms the worse. Now a thing is called evil "because it harms," as 
Augustine says (Enchiridion xii). Therefore that which is an evil to the 
soul is a greater evil than that which is an evil to the body. Therefore 
this argument does not prove: nor does Augustine give it as his own, but 
as taken from another [*Cornelius Celsus].<br>
