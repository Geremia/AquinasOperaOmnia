    HOW THE MORAL VIRTUES DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider how the moral virtues differ from one another: under
    which head there are five points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is only one moral
    virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether those moral virtues which
    are about operations, are distinct from those which are about passions?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether there is but one moral
    virtue about operations?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether there are different moral
    virtues about different passions?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the moral virtues differ
    in point of the various objects of the passions?<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is only one moral virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is only one moral
    virtue. Because just as the direction of moral actions belongs to reason
    which is the subject of the intellectual virtues; so does their inclination
    belong to the appetite which is the subject of moral virtues. But there is
    only one intellectual virtue to direct all moral acts, viz. prudence.
    Therefore there is also but one moral virtue to give all moral acts their
    respective inclinations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, habits differ, not in respect of their
    material objects, but according to the formal aspect of their objects. Now
    the formal aspect of the good to which moral virtue is directed, is one
    thing, viz. the mean defined by reason. Therefore, seemingly, there is but
    one moral virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things pertaining to morals are
    specified by their end, as stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now there is but one
    common end of all moral virtues, viz. happiness, while the proper and
    proximate ends are infinite in number. But the moral virtues themselves are
    not infinite in number. Therefore it seems that there is but one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> One habit cannot be in several powers, as
    stated above (<a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the subject of the
    moral virtues is the appetitive part of the soul, which is divided into
    several powers, as stated in the FP, Question [80], Article [2]; FP,
    Question [81], Article [2]. Therefore there cannot be only one moral
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="FS058.html#FSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3), the moral virtues
    are habits of the appetitive faculty. Now habits differ specifically
    according to the specific differences of their objects, as stated above (<a
      href="FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1"
      >Question [54]</a
    >, <a href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Again, the species of
    the object of appetite, as of any thing, depends on its specific form which
    it receives from the agent. But we must observe that the matter of the
    passive subject bears a twofold relation to the agent. For sometimes it
    receives the form of the agent, in the same kind specifically as the agent
    has that form, as happens with all univocal agents, so that if the agent be
    one specifically, the matter must of necessity receive a form specifically
    one: thus the univocal effect of fire is of necessity something in the
    species of fire. Sometimes, however, the matter receives the form from the
    agent, but not in the same kind specifically as the agent, as is the case
    with non-univocal causes of generation: thus an animal is generated by the
    sun. In this case the forms received into matter are not of one species, but
    vary according to the adaptability of the matter to receive the influx of
    the agent: for instance, we see that owing to the one action of the sun,
    animals of various species are produced by putrefaction according to the
    various adaptability of matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is evident that in moral matters the reason holds the place of
    commander and mover, while the appetitive power is commanded and moved. But
    the appetite does not receive the direction of reason univocally so to say;
    because it is rational, not essentially, but by participation (Ethic. i,
    13). Consequently objects made appetible by the direction of reason belong
    to various species, according to their various relations to reason: so that
    it follows that moral virtues are of various species and are not one
    only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The object of the reason is truth. Now
    in all moral matters, which are contingent matters of action, there is but
    one kind of truth. Consequently, there is but one virtue to direct all such
    matters, viz. prudence. On the other hand, the object of the appetitive
    power is the appetible good, which varies in kind according to its various
    relations to reason, the directing power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This formal element is one generically,
    on account of the unity of the agent: but it varies in species, on account
    of the various relations of the receiving matter, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Moral matters do not receive their
    species from the last end, but from their proximate ends: and these,
    although they be infinite in number, are not infinite in species.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether moral virtues about operations are different from those that are
    about passions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that moral virtues are not divided
    into those which are about operations and those which are about passions.
    For the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3) that moral virtue is "an operative
    habit whereby we do what is best in matters of pleasure or sorrow." Now
    pleasure and sorrow are passions, as stated above (<a
      href="FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1"
      >Question [31]</a
    >, <a href="FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS035.html#FSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>,
    <a href="FS035.html#FSQ35A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the same
    virtue which is about passions is also about operations, since it is an
    operative habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the passions are principles of external
    action. If therefore some virtues regulate the passions, they must, as a
    consequence, regulate operations also. Therefore the same moral virtues are
    about both passions and operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sensitive appetite is moved well or
    ill towards every external operation. Now movements of the sensitive
    appetite are passions. Therefore the same virtues that are about operations
    are also about passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher reckons justice to be about
    operations; and temperance, fortitude and gentleness, about passions (Ethic.
    ii, 3,7; v, 1, seqq.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Operation and passion stand in a twofold
    relation to virtue. First, as its effects; and in this way every moral
    virtue has some good operations as its product; and a certain pleasure or
    sorrow which are passions, as stated above (<a href="FS059.html#FSQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="FS059.html#FSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, operation may be compared to moral virtue as the matter about
    which virtue is concerned: and in this sense those moral virtues which are
    about operations must needs differ from those which are about passions. The
    reason for this is that good and evil, in certain operations, are taken from
    the very nature of those operations, no matter how man may be affected
    towards them: viz. in so far as good and evil in them depend on their being
    commensurate with someone else. In operations of this kind there needs to be
    some power to regulate the operations in themselves: such are buying and
    selling, and all such operations in which there is an element of something
    due or undue to another. For this reason justice and its parts are properly
    about operations as their proper matter. On the other hand, in some
    operations, good and evil depend only on commensuration with the agent.
    Consequently good and evil in these operations depend on the way in which
    man is affected to them. And for this reason in such like operations virtue
    must needs be chiefly about internal emotions which are called the passions
    of the soul, as is evidently the case with temperance, fortitude and the
    like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It happens, however, in operations which are directed to another, that the
    good of virtue is overlooked by reason of some inordinate passion of the
    soul. In such cases justice is destroyed in so far as the due measure of the
    external act is destroyed: while some other virtue is destroyed in so far as
    the internal passions exceed their due measure. Thus when through anger, one
    man strikes another, justice is destroyed in the undue blow; while
    gentleness is destroyed by the immoderate anger. The same may be clearly
    applied to other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first considers
    operations as the effect of virtue, while the other two consider operation
    and passion as concurring in the same effect. But in some cases virtue is
    chiefly about operations, in others, about passions, for the reason given
    above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether there is only one moral virtue about operations?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is but one moral virtue
    about operations. Because the rectitude of all external operations seems to
    belong to justice. Now justice is but one virtue. Therefore there is but one
    virtue about operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those operations seem to differ most,
    which are directed on the one side to the good of the individual, and on the
    other to the good of the many. But this diversity does not cause diversity
    among the moral virtues: for the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that legal
    justice, which directs human acts to the common good, does not differ, save
    logically, from the virtue which directs a man's actions to one man only.
    Therefore diversity of operations does not cause a diversity of moral
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there are various moral virtues about
    various operations, diversity of moral virtues would needs follow diversity
    of operations. But this is clearly untrue: for it is the function of justice
    to establish rectitude in various kinds of commutations, and again in
    distributions, as is set down in Ethic. v, 2. Therefore there are not
    different virtues about different operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Religion is a moral virtue distinct from
    piety, both of which are about operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All the moral virtues that are about operations
    agree in one general notion of justice, which is in respect of something due
    to another: but they differ in respect of various special notions. The
    reason for this is that in external operations, the order of reason is
    established, as we have stated (<a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), not according as how man is affected towards such operations, but
    according to the becomingness of the thing itself; from which becomingness
    we derive the notion of something due which is the formal aspect of justice:
    for, seemingly, it pertains to justice that a man give another his due.
    Wherefore all such virtues as are about operations, bear, in some way, the
    character of justice. But the thing due is not of the same kind in all these
    virtues: for something is due to an equal in one way, to a superior, in
    another way, to an inferior, in yet another; and the nature of a debt
    differs according as it arises from a contract, a promise, or a favor
    already conferred. And corresponding to these various kinds of debt there
    are various virtues: e.g. "Religion" whereby we pay our debt to God;
    "Piety," whereby we pay our debt to our parents or to our country;
    "Gratitude," whereby we pay our debt to our benefactors, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Justice properly so called is one
    special virtue, whose object is the perfect due, which can be paid in the
    equivalent. But the name of justice is extended also to all cases in which
    something due is rendered: in this sense it is not as a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That justice which seeks the common good
    is another virtue from that which is directed to the private good of an
    individual: wherefore common right differs from private right; and Tully (De
    Inv. ii) reckons as a special virtue, piety which directs man to the good of
    his country. But that justice which directs man to the common good is a
    general virtue through its act of command: since it directs all the acts of
    the virtues to its own end, viz. the common good. And the virtues, in so far
    as they are commanded by that justice, receive the name of justice: so that
    virtue does not differ, save logically, from legal justice; just as there is
    only a logical difference between a virtue that is active of itself, and a
    virtue that is active through the command of another virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is the same kind of due in all the
    operations belonging to special justice. Consequently, there is the same
    virtue of justice, especially in regard to commutations. For it may be that
    distributive justice is of another species from commutative justice; but
    about this we shall inquire later on (<a href="../SS.html">SS</a>,

    Whether there are different moral virtues about different passions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not different moral
    virtues about different passions. For there is but one habit about things
    that concur in their source and end: as is evident especially in the case of
    sciences. But the passions all concur in one source, viz. love; and they all
    terminate in the same end, viz. joy or sorrow, as we stated above (<a
      href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,4;
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore there is but
    one moral virtue about all the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if there were different moral virtues
    about different passions, it would follow that there are as many moral
    virtues as passions. But this clearly is not the case: since there is one
    moral virtue about contrary passions; namely, fortitude, about fear and
    daring; temperance, about pleasure and sorrow. Therefore there is no need
    for different moral virtues about different passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, love, desire, and pleasure are passions
    of different species, as stated above (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now there is but one
    virtue about all these three, viz. temperance. Therefore there are not
    different moral virtues about different passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Fortitude is about fear and daring;
    temperance about desire; meekness about anger; as stated in Ethic. iii,
    6,10; iv, 5.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It cannot be said that there is only one moral
    virtue about all the passions: since some passions are not in the same power
    as other passions; for some belong to the irascible, others to the
    concupiscible faculty, as stated above (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, neither does every diversity of passions necessarily
    suffice for a diversity of moral virtues. First, because some passions are
    in contrary opposition to one another, such as joy and sorrow, fear and
    daring, and so on. About such passions as are thus in opposition to one
    another there must needs be one same virtue. Because, since moral virtue
    consists in a kind of mean, the mean in contrary passions stands in the same
    ratio to both, even as in the natural order there is but one mean between
    contraries, e.g. between black and white. Secondly, because there are
    different passions contradicting reason in the same manner, e.g. by
    impelling to that which is contrary to reason, or by withdrawing from that
    which is in accord with reason. Wherefore the different passions of the
    concupiscible faculty do not require different moral virtues, because their
    movements follow one another in a certain order, as being directed to the
    one same thing, viz. the attainment of some good or the avoidance of some
    evil: thus from love proceeds desire, and from desire we arrive at pleasure;
    and it is the same with the opposite passions, for hatred leads to avoidance
    or dislike, and this leads to sorrow. On the other hand, the irascible
    passions are not all of one order, but are directed to different things: for
    daring and fear are about some great danger; hope and despair are about some
    difficult good; while anger seeks to overcome something contrary which has
    wrought harm. Consequently there are different virtues about such like
    passions: e.g. temperance, about the concupiscible passions; fortitude,
    about fear and daring; magnanimity, about hope and despair; meekness, about
    anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the passions concur in one common
    principle and end; but not in one proper principle or end: and so this does
    not suffice for the unity of moral virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as in the natural order the same
    principle causes movement from one extreme and movement towards the other;
    and as in the intellectual order contraries have one common ratio; so too
    between contrary passions there is but one moral virtue, which, like a
    second nature, consents to reason's dictates.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those three passions are directed to the
    same object in a certain order, as stated above: and so they belong to the
    same virtue.<br />

    Whether the moral virtues differ in point of the various objects of the
    passions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the moral virtues do not
    differ according to the objects of the passions. For just as there are
    objects of passions, so are there objects of operations. Now those moral
    virtues that are about operations, do not differ according to the objects of
    those operations: for the buying and selling either of a house or of a horse
    belong to the one same virtue of justice. Therefore neither do those moral
    virtues that are about passions differ according to the objects of those
    passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the passions are acts or movements of
    the sensitive appetite. Now it needs a greater difference to differentiate
    habits than acts. Hence diverse objects which do not diversify the species
    of passions, do not diversify the species of moral virtue: so that there is
    but one moral virtue about all objects of pleasure, and the same applies to
    the other passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, more or less do not change a species.
    Now various objects of pleasure differ only by reason of being more or less
    pleasurable. Therefore all objects of pleasure belong to one species of
    virtue: and for the same reason so do all fearful objects, and the same
    applies to others. Therefore moral virtue is not diversified according to
    the objects of the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, virtue hinders evil, even as it produces
    good. But there are various virtues about the desires for good things: thus
    temperance is about desires for the pleasure of touch, and "eutrapelia"
    [*{eutrapelia}] about pleasures in games. Therefore there should be
    different virtues about fears of evils.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Chastity is about sexual pleasures,
    abstinence about pleasures of the table, and "eutrapelia" about pleasures in
    games.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The perfection of a virtue depends on the
    reason; whereas the perfection of a passion depends on the sensitive
    appetite. Consequently virtues must needs be differentiated according to
    their relation to reason, but the passions according to their relation to
    the appetite. Hence the objects of the passions, according as they are
    variously related to the sensitive appetite, cause the different species of
    passions: while, according as they are related to reason, they cause the
    different species of virtues. Now the movement of reason is not the same as
    that of the sensitive appetite. Wherefore nothing hinders a difference of
    objects from causing diversity of passions, without causing diversity of
    virtues, as when one virtue is about several passions, as stated above (<a
      href="FS060.html#FSQ60A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >); and again, a difference of objects from causing different virtues,
    without causing a difference of passions, since several virtues are directed
    about one passion, e.g. pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And because diverse passions belonging to diverse powers, always belong to
    diverse virtues, as stated above (<a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >); therefore a difference of objects that corresponds to a difference of
    powers always causes a specific difference of virtues---for instance the
    difference between that which is good absolutely speaking, and that which is
    good and difficult to obtain. Moreover since the reason rules man's lower
    powers in a certain order, and even extends to outward things; hence, one
    single object of the passions, according as it is apprehended by sense,
    imagination, or reason, and again, according as it belongs to the soul,
    body, or external things, has various relations to reason, and consequently
    is of a nature to cause a difference of virtues. Consequently man's good
    which is the object of love, desire and pleasure, may be taken as referred
    either to a bodily sense, or to the inner apprehension of the mind: and this
    same good may be directed to man's good in himself, either in his body or in
    his soul, or to man's good in relation to other men. And every such
    difference, being differently related to reason, differentiates virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, if we take a good, and it be something discerned by the sense
    of touch, and something pertaining to the upkeep of human life either in the
    individual or in the species, such as the pleasures of the table or of
    sexual intercourse, it will belong to the virtue of "temperance." As regards
    the pleasures of the other senses, they are not intense, and so do not
    present much difficulty to the reason: hence there is no virtue
    corresponding to them; for virtue, "like art, is about difficult things"
    (Ethic. ii, 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, good discerned not by the senses, but by an inner power,
    and belonging to man in himself, is like money and honor; the former, by its
    very nature, being employable for the good of the body, while the latter is
    based on the apprehension of the mind. These goods again may be considered
    either absolutely, in which way they concern the concupiscible faculty, or
    as being difficult to obtain, in which way they belong to the irascible
    part: which distinction, however, has no place in pleasurable objects of
    touch; since such are of base condition, and are becoming to man in so far
    as he has something in common with irrational animals. Accordingly in
    reference to money considered as a good absolutely, as an object of desire,
    pleasure, or love, there is "liberality": but if we consider this good as
    difficult to get, and as being the object of our hope, there is
    "magnificence" [*{megaloprepeia}]. With regard to that good which we call
    honor, taken absolutely, as the object of love, we have a virtue called
    "philotimia" [*{philotimia}], i.e. "love of honor": while if we consider it
    as hard to attain, and as an object of hope, then we have "magnanimity."
    Wherefore liberality and "philotimia" seem to be in the concupiscible part,
    while magnificence and magnanimity are in the irascible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards man's good in relation to other men, it does not seem hard to
    obtain, but is considered absolutely, as the object of the concupiscible
    passions. This good may be pleasurable to a man in his behavior towards
    another either in some serious matter, in actions, to wit, that are directed
    by reason to a due end, or in playful actions, viz. that are done for mere
    pleasure, and which do not stand in the same relation to reason as the
    former. Now one man behaves towards another in serious matters, in two ways.
    First, as being pleasant in his regard, by becoming speech and deeds: and
    this belongs to a virtue which Aristotle (Ethic. ii, 7) calls "friendship"
    [*{philia}], and may be rendered "affability." Secondly, one man behaves
    towards another by being frank with him, in words and deeds: this belongs to
    another virtue which (Ethic. iv, 7) he calls "truthfulness" [*{aletheia}].
    For frankness is more akin to the reason than pleasure, and serious matters
    than play. Hence there is another virtue about the pleasures of games, which
    the Philosopher "eutrapelia" [*{eutrapelia}] (Ethic. iv, 8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore evident that, according to Aristotle, there are ten moral
    virtues about the passions, viz. fortitude, temperance, liberality,
    magnificence, magnanimity, "philotimia," gentleness, friendship,
    truthfulness, and "eutrapelia," all of which differ in respect of their
    diverse matter, passions, or objects: so that if we add "justice," which is
    about operations, there will be eleven in all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All objects of the same specific
    operation have the same relation to reason: not so all the objects of the
    same specific passion; because operations do not thwart reason as the
    passions do.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passions are not differentiated by the
    same rule as virtues are, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> More and less do not cause a difference
    of species, unless they bear different relations to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Good is a more potent mover than evil:
    because evil does not cause movement save in virtue of good, as Dionysius
    states (Div. Nom. iv). Hence an evil does not prove an obstacle to reason,
    so as to require virtues unless that evil be great; there being, seemingly,
    one such evil corresponding to each kind of passion. Hence there is but one
    virtue, meekness, for every form of anger; and, again, but one virtue,
    fortitude, for all forms of daring. On the other hand, good involves
    difficulty, which requires virtue, even if it be not a great good in that
    particular kind of passion. Consequently there are various moral virtues
    about desires, as stated above.<br />
