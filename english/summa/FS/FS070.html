<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the Fruits of the Holy Ghost: under which head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS070.html#FSQ70A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost are acts?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they differ from the beatitudes?

<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits of the Holy Ghost, enumerated by 
the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A22,23">Gal. 5:22,23</a>), are not acts. For that which bears fruit, 
should not itself be called a fruit, else we should go on indefinitely. 
But our actions bear fruit: for it is written (Wis. 3:15): "The fruit of 
good labor is glorious," and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4%3A36">Jn. 4:36</a>): "He that reapeth receiveth 
wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting." Therefore our actions 
are not to be called fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Trin. x, 10), "we enjoy 
[*'Fruimur', from which verb we have the Latin 'fructus' and the English 
'fruit'] the things we know, when the will rests by rejoicing in them." 
But our will should not rest in our actions for their own sake. Therefore 
our actions should not be called fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the fruits of the Holy Ghost, the Apostle numbers 
certain virtues, viz. charity, meekness, faith, and chastity. Now virtues 
are not actions but habits, as stated above (<A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the 
fruits are not actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++12%3A33">Mt. 12:33</a>): "By the fruit the tree is 
known"; that is to say, man is known by his works, as holy men explain 
the passage. Therefore human actions are called fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The word "fruit" has been transferred from the material 
to the spiritual world. Now fruit, among material things, is the product 
of a plant when it comes to perfection, and has a certain sweetness. This 
fruit has a twofold relation: to the tree that produces it, and to the 
man who gathers the fruit from the tree. Accordingly, in spiritual 
matters, we may take the word "fruit" in two ways: first, so that the 
fruit of man, who is likened to the tree, is that which he produces; 
secondly, so that man's fruit is what he gathers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet not all that man gathers is fruit, but only that which is last and 
gives pleasure. For a man has both a field and a tree, and yet these are 
not called fruits; but that only which is last, to wit, that which man 
intends to derive from the field and from the tree. In this sense man's 
fruit is his last end which is intended for his enjoyment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, by man's fruit we understand a product of man, then human 
actions are called fruits: because operation is the second act of the 
operator, and gives pleasure if it is suitable to him. If then man's 
operation proceeds from man in virtue of his reason, it is said to be the 
fruit of his reason: but if it proceeds from him in respect of a higher 
power, which is the power of the Holy Ghost, then man's operation is said 
to be the fruit of the Holy Ghost, as of a Divine seed, for it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3%3A9">1 Jn. 3:9</a>): "Whosoever is born of God, committeth no sin, for His seed 
abideth in him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since fruit is something last and final, nothing hinders 
one fruit bearing another fruit, even as one end is subordinate to 
another. And so our works, in so far as they are produced by the Holy 
Ghost working in us, are fruits: but, in so far as they are referred to 
the end which is eternal life, they should rather be called flowers: 
hence it is written (Ecclus. 24:23): "My flowers are the fruits of honor 
and riches."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the will is said to delight in a thing for its own 
sake, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that the expression 
"for the sake of" be taken to designate the final cause; and in this way, 
man delights in nothing for its own sake, except the last end. Secondly, 
so that it expresses the formal cause; and in this way, a man may delight 
in anything that is delightful by reason of its form. Thus it is clear 
that a sick man delights in health, for its own sake, as in an end; in a 
nice medicine, not as in an end, but as in something tasty; and in a 
nasty medicine, nowise for its own sake, but only for the sake of 
something else. Accordingly we must say that man must delight in God for 
His own sake, as being his last end, and in virtuous deeds, not as being 
his end, but for the sake of their inherent goodness which is delightful 
to the virtuous. Hence Ambrose says (De Parad.  xiii) that virtuous deeds 
are called fruits because "they refresh those that have them, with a holy 
and genuine delight."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes the names of the virtues are applied to their 
actions: thus Augustine writes (Tract. xl in Joan.): "Faith is to believe 
what thou seest not"; and (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 10): "Charity is the 
movement of the soul in loving God and our neighbor." It is thus that the 
names of the virtues are used in reckoning the fruits.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the fruits differ from the beatitudes?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits do not differ from the beatitudes. 
For the beatitudes are assigned to the gifts, as stated above (<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). But the gifts perfect man in so far as he is moved by the 
Holy Ghost. Therefore the beatitudes themselves are fruits of the Holy 
Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the fruit of eternal life is to future beatitude 
which is that of actual possession, so are the fruits of the present life 
to the beatitudes of the present life, which are based on hope. Now the 
fruit of eternal life is identified with future beatitude. Therefore the 
fruits of the present life are the beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fruit is essentially something ultimate and delightful. 
Now this is the very nature of beatitude, as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore fruit and beatitude have the same nature, and 
consequently should not be distinguished from one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things divided into different species, differ from one 
another. But fruits and beatitudes are divided into different parts, as 
is clear from the way in which they are enumerated. Therefore the fruits 
differ from the beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> More is required for a beatitude than for a fruit. 
Because it is sufficient for a fruit to be something ultimate and 
delightful; whereas for a beatitude, it must be something perfect and 
excellent. Hence all the beatitudes may be called fruits, but not vice 
versa. For the fruits are any virtuous deeds in which one delights: 
whereas the beatitudes are none but perfect works, and which, by reason 
of their perfection, are assigned to the gifts rather than to the 
virtues, as already stated (<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves the beatitudes to be fruits, but not 
that all the fruits are beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fruit of eternal life is ultimate and perfect simply: 
hence it nowise differs from future beatitude. On the other hand the 
fruits of the present life are not simply ultimate and perfect; wherefore 
not all the fruits are beatitudes. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> More is required for a beatitude than for a fruit, as 
stated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the fruits are suitably enumerated by the Apostle?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits are unsuitably enumerated by the 
Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A22,23">Gal. 5:22,23</a>). Because, elsewhere, he says that there is only 
one fruit of the present life; according to Rm. 6:22: "You have your 
fruit unto sanctification." Moreover it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++27%3A9">Is. 27:9</a>): "This is 
all the fruit . . . that the sin . . . be taken away." Therefore we 
should not reckon twelve fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fruit is the product of spiritual seed, as stated (<A Href="FS070.html#FSQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But Our Lord mentions (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++13%3A23">Mt. 13:23</a>) a threefold fruit as growing from a 
spiritual seed in a good ground, viz. "hundredfold, sixtyfold," and 
"thirtyfold." Therefore one should not reckon twelve fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the very nature of fruit is to be something ultimate and 
delightful. But this does not apply to all the fruits mentioned by the 
Apostle: for patience and long-suffering seem to imply a painful object, 
while faith is not something ultimate, but rather something primary and 
fundamental. Therefore too many fruits are enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the other hand, It seems that they are enumerated 
insufficiently and incompletely. For it has been stated (<A Href="FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that all 
the beatitudes may be called fruits; yet not all are mentioned here. Nor 
is there anything corresponding to the acts of wisdom, and of many other 
virtues. Therefore it seems that the fruits are insufficiently enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The number of the twelve fruits enumerated by the Apostle 
is suitable, and that there may be a reference to them in the twelve 
fruits of which it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++22%3A2">Apoc. 22:2</a>): "On both sides of the river 
was the tree bearing twelve fruits." Since, however, a fruit is something 
that proceeds from a source as from a seed or root, the difference 
between these fruits must be gathered from the various ways in which the 
Holy Ghost proceeds in us: which process consists in this, that the mind 
of man is set in order, first of all, in regard to itself; secondly, in 
regard to things that are near it; thirdly, in regard to things that are 
below it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly man's mind is well disposed in regard to itself when it has 
a good disposition towards good things and towards evil things. Now the 
first disposition of the human mind towards the good is effected by love, 
which is the first of our emotions and the root of them all, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Wherefore among the fruits of the Holy Ghost, we 
reckon "charity," wherein the Holy Ghost is given in a special manner, as 
in His own likeness, since He Himself is love. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A5">Rm. 5:5</a>): "The charity of  God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy 
Ghost, Who is given to us." The necessary result of the love of charity 
is joy: because every lover rejoices at being united to the beloved. Now 
charity has always actual presence in God Whom it loves, according to 1 
Jn. 4:16: "He that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in Him": 
wherefore the sequel of charity is "joy." Now the perfection of joy is 
peace in two respects. First, as regards freedom from outward 
disturbance; for it is impossible to rejoice perfectly in the beloved 
good, if one is disturbed in the enjoyment thereof; and again, if a man's 
heart is perfectly set at peace in one object, he cannot be disquieted by 
any other, since he accounts all others as nothing; hence it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118%3A165">Ps. 118:165</a>): "Much peace have they that love Thy Law, and to them there 
is no stumbling-block," because, to wit, external things do not disturb 
them in their enjoyment of God. Secondly, as regards the calm of the 
restless desire: for he does not perfectly rejoice, who is not satisfied 
with the object of his joy. Now peace implies these two things, namely, 
that we be not disturbed by external things, and that our desires rest 
altogether in one object. Wherefore after charity and joy, "peace" is 
given the third place. In evil things the mind has a good disposition, in 
respect of two things. First, by not being disturbed whenever evil 
threatens: which pertains to "patience"; secondly, by not being 
disturbed, whenever good things are delayed; which belongs to "long 
suffering," since "to lack good is a kind of evil" (Ethic. v, 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's mind is well disposed as regards what is near him, viz. his 
neighbor, first, as to the will to do good; and to this belongs 
"goodness." Secondly, as to the execution of well-doing; and to this 
belongs "benignity," for the benign are those in whom the salutary flame 
[bonus ignis] of love has enkindled the desire to be kind to their 
neighbor. Thirdly, as to his suffering with equanimity the evils his 
neighbor inflicts on him. To this belongs "meekness," which curbs anger. 
Fourthly, in the point of our refraining from doing harm to our neighbor 
not only through anger, but also through fraud or deceit. To this 
pertains "faith," if we take it as denoting fidelity. But if we take it 
for the faith whereby we believe in God, then man is directed thereby to 
that which is above him, so that he subject his intellect and, 
consequently, all that is his, to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Man is well disposed in respect of that which is below him, as regards 
external action, by "modesty," whereby we observe the "mode" in all our 
words and deeds: as regards internal desires, by "contingency" and 
"chastity": whether these two differ because chastity withdraws man from 
unlawful desires, contingency also from lawful desires: or because the 
continent man is subject to concupiscence, but is not led away; whereas 
the chaste man is neither subject to, nor led away from them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sanctification is effected by all the virtues, by which 
also sins are taken away. Consequently fruit is mentioned there in the 
singular, on account of its being generically one, though divided into 
many species which are spoken of as so many  fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold fruits do not 
differ as various species of virtuous acts, but as various degrees of 
perfection, even in the same virtue. Thus contingency of the married 
state is said to be signified by the thirtyfold fruit; the contingency of 
widowhood, by the sixtyfold; and virginal contingency, by the hundredfold 
fruit. There are, moreover, other ways in which holy men distinguish 
three evangelical fruits according to the three degrees of virtue: and 
they speak of three degrees, because the perfection of anything is 
considered with respect to its beginning, its middle, and its end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact of not being disturbed by painful things is 
something to delight in. And as to faith, if we consider it as the 
foundation, it has the aspect of being ultimate and delightful, in as 
much as it contains certainty: hence a gloss expounds thus: "Faith, which 
is certainly about the unseen."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine says on Gal. 5:22,23, "the Apostle had no 
intention of teaching us how many [either works of the flesh, or fruits 
of the Spirit] there are; but to show how the former should be avoided, 
and the latter sought after." Hence either more or fewer fruits might 
have been mentioned. Nevertheless, all the acts of the gifts and virtues 
can be reduced to these by a certain kind of fittingness, in so far as 
all the virtues and gifts must needs direct the mind in one of the 
above-mentioned ways. Wherefore the acts of wisdom and of any gifts 
directing to good, are reduced to charity, joy and peace. The reason why 
he mentions these rather than others, is that these imply either 
enjoyment of good things, or relief from evils, which things seem to 
belong to the notion of fruit.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits of the Holy Ghost are not contrary 
to the works of the flesh, which the Apostle enumerates (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A19,+seqq+">Gal. 5:19, seqq.</a>). Because contraries are in the same genus. But the works of the 
flesh are not called fruits. Therefore the fruits of the Spirit are not 
contrary to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one thing has a contrary. Now the Apostle mentions more 
works of the flesh than fruits of the Spirit. Therefore the fruits of the 
Spirit and the works of the flesh are not contrary to one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the fruits of the Spirit, the first place is given 
to charity, joy, and peace: to which, fornication, uncleanness, and 
immodesty, which are the first of the works of the flesh are not opposed. 
Therefore the fruits of the Spirit are not contrary to the works of the 
flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A17">Gal. 5:17</a>) that "the flesh lusteth 
against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit may 
be taken in two ways. First, in general: and in this way the fruits of 
the Holy Ghost considered in general are contrary to the works of the 
flesh. Because the Holy Ghost moves the human mind to that which is in 
accord with reason, or rather to that which surpasses reason: whereas the 
fleshly, viz. the sensitive, appetite draws man to sensible goods which 
are beneath him. Wherefore, since upward and downward are contrary 
movements in the physical order, so in human actions the works of the 
flesh are contrary to the fruits of the Spirit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, both fruits and fleshly works as enumerated may be considered 
singly, each according to its specific nature. And in this they are not 
of necessity contrary each to each: because, as stated above (<A Href="FS070.html#FSQ70A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4), the Apostle did not intend to enumerate all the works, whether 
spiritual or carnal. However, by a kind of adaptation, Augustine, 
commenting on Gal. 5:22,23, contrasts the fruits with the carnal works, 
each to each. Thus "to fornication, which is the love of satisfying lust 
outside lawful wedlock, we may contrast charity, whereby the soul is 
wedded to God: wherein also is true chastity. By uncleanness we must 
understand whatever disturbances arise from fornication: and to these the 
joy of tranquillity is opposed. Idolatry, by reason of which war was 
waged against the Gospel of God, is opposed to peace. Against 
witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths and quarrels, 
there is longsuffering, which helps us to bear the evils inflicted on us 
by those among whom we dwell; while kindness helps us to cure those 
evils; and goodness, to forgive them. In contrast to heresy there is 
faith; to envy, mildness; to drunkenness and revellings, contingency."<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which proceeds from a tree against the tree's nature, 
is not called its fruit, but rather its corruption. And since works of 
virtue are connatural to reason, while works of vice are contrary to 
nature, therefore it is that works of virtue are called fruits, but not 
so works of vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[70] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Good happens in one way, evil in all manner of ways," as 
Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): so that to one virtue many vices are 
contrary. Consequently we must not be surprised if the works of the flesh 
are more numerous than the fruits of the spirit.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.
