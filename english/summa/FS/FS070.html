  <h3 align="center">OF THE FRUITS OF THE HOLY GHOST (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the Fruits of the Holy Ghost: under which head there
    are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS070.html#FSQ70A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the fruits of the Holy
    Ghost are acts?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they differ from the
    beatitudes?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FS070.html#FSQ70A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of their number?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS070.html#FSQ70A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of their opposition to the works
    of the flesh.

    Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost which the Apostle enumerates (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5"
      >Gal. 5</a
    >) are acts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits of the Holy Ghost,
    enumerated by the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A22,23"
      >Gal. 5:22,23</a
    >), are not acts. For that which bears fruit, should not itself be called a
    fruit, else we should go on indefinitely. But our actions bear fruit: for it
    is written (Wis. 3:15): "The fruit of good labor is glorious," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A36"
      >Jn. 4:36</a
    >): "He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life
    everlasting." Therefore our actions are not to be called fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Trin. x, 10), "we
    enjoy [*'Fruimur', from which verb we have the Latin 'fructus' and the
    English 'fruit'] the things we know, when the will rests by rejoicing in
    them." But our will should not rest in our actions for their own sake.
    Therefore our actions should not be called fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the fruits of the Holy Ghost, the
    Apostle numbers certain virtues, viz. charity, meekness, faith, and
    chastity. Now virtues are not actions but habits, as stated above (<a
      href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the fruits
    are not actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++12%3A33"
      >Mt. 12:33</a
    >): "By the fruit the tree is known"; that is to say, man is known by his
    works, as holy men explain the passage. Therefore human actions are called
    fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The word "fruit" has been transferred from the
    material to the spiritual world. Now fruit, among material things, is the
    product of a plant when it comes to perfection, and has a certain sweetness.
    This fruit has a twofold relation: to the tree that produces it, and to the
    man who gathers the fruit from the tree. Accordingly, in spiritual matters,
    we may take the word "fruit" in two ways: first, so that the fruit of man,
    who is likened to the tree, is that which he produces; secondly, so that
    man's fruit is what he gathers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet not all that man gathers is fruit, but only that which is last and gives
    pleasure. For a man has both a field and a tree, and yet these are not
    called fruits; but that only which is last, to wit, that which man intends
    to derive from the field and from the tree. In this sense man's fruit is his
    last end which is intended for his enjoyment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, by man's fruit we understand a product of man, then human
    actions are called fruits: because operation is the second act of the
    operator, and gives pleasure if it is suitable to him. If then man's
    operation proceeds from man in virtue of his reason, it is said to be the
    fruit of his reason: but if it proceeds from him in respect of a higher
    power, which is the power of the Holy Ghost, then man's operation is said to
    be the fruit of the Holy Ghost, as of a Divine seed, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++3%3A9"
      >1 Jn. 3:9</a
    >): "Whosoever is born of God, committeth no sin, for His seed abideth in
    him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since fruit is something last and final,
    nothing hinders one fruit bearing another fruit, even as one end is
    subordinate to another. And so our works, in so far as they are produced by
    the Holy Ghost working in us, are fruits: but, in so far as they are
    referred to the end which is eternal life, they should rather be called
    flowers: hence it is written (Ecclus. 24:23): "My flowers are the fruits of
    honor and riches."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the will is said to delight in a
    thing for its own sake, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that
    the expression "for the sake of" be taken to designate the final cause; and
    in this way, man delights in nothing for its own sake, except the last end.
    Secondly, so that it expresses the formal cause; and in this way, a man may
    delight in anything that is delightful by reason of its form. Thus it is
    clear that a sick man delights in health, for its own sake, as in an end; in
    a nice medicine, not as in an end, but as in something tasty; and in a nasty
    medicine, nowise for its own sake, but only for the sake of something else.
    Accordingly we must say that man must delight in God for His own sake, as
    being his last end, and in virtuous deeds, not as being his end, but for the
    sake of their inherent goodness which is delightful to the virtuous. Hence
    Ambrose says (De Parad. xiii) that virtuous deeds are called fruits because
    "they refresh those that have them, with a holy and genuine delight."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes the names of the virtues are
    applied to their actions: thus Augustine writes (Tract. xl in Joan.): "Faith
    is to believe what thou seest not"; and (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 10):
    "Charity is the movement of the soul in loving God and our neighbor." It is
    thus that the names of the virtues are used in reckoning the fruits.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the fruits differ from the beatitudes?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits do not differ from
    the beatitudes. For the beatitudes are assigned to the gifts, as stated
    above (<a href="FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>,
    <a href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). But the gifts
    perfect man in so far as he is moved by the Holy Ghost. Therefore the
    beatitudes themselves are fruits of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the fruit of eternal life is to
    future beatitude which is that of actual possession, so are the fruits of
    the present life to the beatitudes of the present life, which are based on
    hope. Now the fruit of eternal life is identified with future beatitude.
    Therefore the fruits of the present life are the beatitudes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fruit is essentially something ultimate
    and delightful. Now this is the very nature of beatitude, as stated above
    (<a href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FS004.html#FSQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore fruit and
    beatitude have the same nature, and consequently should not be distinguished
    from one another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things divided into different species, differ
    from one another. But fruits and beatitudes are divided into different
    parts, as is clear from the way in which they are enumerated. Therefore the
    fruits differ from the beatitudes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> More is required for a beatitude than for a
    fruit. Because it is sufficient for a fruit to be something ultimate and
    delightful; whereas for a beatitude, it must be something perfect and
    excellent. Hence all the beatitudes may be called fruits, but not vice
    versa. For the fruits are any virtuous deeds in which one delights: whereas
    the beatitudes are none but perfect works, and which, by reason of their
    perfection, are assigned to the gifts rather than to the virtues, as already
    stated (<a href="FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>,
    <a href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves the beatitudes to
    be fruits, but not that all the fruits are beatitudes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fruit of eternal life is ultimate
    and perfect simply: hence it nowise differs from future beatitude. On the
    other hand the fruits of the present life are not simply ultimate and
    perfect; wherefore not all the fruits are beatitudes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> More is required for a beatitude than
    for a fruit, as stated.<br />

    Whether the fruits are suitably enumerated by the Apostle?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits are unsuitably
    enumerated by the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A22,23"
      >Gal. 5:22,23</a
    >). Because, elsewhere, he says that there is only one fruit of the present
    life; according to Rm. 6:22: "You have your fruit unto sanctification."
    Moreover it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++27%3A9"
      >Is. 27:9</a
    >): "This is all the fruit... that the sin... be taken away." Therefore we
    should not reckon twelve fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fruit is the product of spiritual seed,
    as stated (<a href="FS070.html#FSQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But Our Lord
    mentions (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++13%3A23"
      >Mt. 13:23</a
    >) a threefold fruit as growing from a spiritual seed in a good ground, viz.
    "hundredfold, sixtyfold," and "thirtyfold." Therefore one should not reckon
    twelve fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the very nature of fruit is to be
    something ultimate and delightful. But this does not apply to all the fruits
    mentioned by the Apostle: for patience and long-suffering seem to imply a
    painful object, while faith is not something ultimate, but rather something
    primary and fundamental. Therefore too many fruits are enumerated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the other hand, It seems that they are
    enumerated insufficiently and incompletely. For it has been stated (<a
      href="FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) that all the beatitudes may be called fruits; yet not all are mentioned
    here. Nor is there anything corresponding to the acts of wisdom, and of many
    other virtues. Therefore it seems that the fruits are insufficiently
    enumerated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The number of the twelve fruits enumerated by
    the Apostle is suitable, and that there may be a reference to them in the
    twelve fruits of which it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++22%3A2"
      >Apoc. 22:2</a
    >): "On both sides of the river was the tree bearing twelve fruits." Since,
    however, a fruit is something that proceeds from a source as from a seed or
    root, the difference between these fruits must be gathered from the various
    ways in which the Holy Ghost proceeds in us: which process consists in this,
    that the mind of man is set in order, first of all, in regard to itself;
    secondly, in regard to things that are near it; thirdly, in regard to things
    that are below it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly man's mind is well disposed in regard to itself when it has a
    good disposition towards good things and towards evil things. Now the first
    disposition of the human mind towards the good is effected by love, which is
    the first of our emotions and the root of them all, as stated above (<a
      href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Wherefore among the
    fruits of the Holy Ghost, we reckon "charity," wherein the Holy Ghost is
    given in a special manner, as in His own likeness, since He Himself is love.
    Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5"
      >Rm. 5:5</a
    >): "The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Who
    is given to us." The necessary result of the love of charity is joy: because
    every lover rejoices at being united to the beloved. Now charity has always
    actual presence in God Whom it loves, according to 1 Jn. 4:16: "He that
    abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in Him": wherefore the sequel of
    charity is "joy." Now the perfection of joy is peace in two respects. First,
    as regards freedom from outward disturbance; for it is impossible to rejoice
    perfectly in the beloved good, if one is disturbed in the enjoyment thereof;
    and again, if a man's heart is perfectly set at peace in one object, he
    cannot be disquieted by any other, since he accounts all others as nothing;
    hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++118%3A165"
      >Ps. 118:165</a
    >): "Much peace have they that love Thy Law, and to them there is no
    stumbling-block," because, to wit, external things do not disturb them in
    their enjoyment of God. Secondly, as regards the calm of the restless
    desire: for he does not perfectly rejoice, who is not satisfied with the
    object of his joy. Now peace implies these two things, namely, that we be
    not disturbed by external things, and that our desires rest altogether in
    one object. Wherefore after charity and joy, "peace" is given the third
    place. In evil things the mind has a good disposition, in respect of two
    things. First, by not being disturbed whenever evil threatens: which
    pertains to "patience"; secondly, by not being disturbed, whenever good
    things are delayed; which belongs to "long suffering," since "to lack good
    is a kind of evil" (Ethic. v, 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Man's mind is well disposed as regards what is near him, viz. his neighbor,
    first, as to the will to do good; and to this belongs "goodness." Secondly,
    as to the execution of well-doing; and to this belongs "benignity," for the
    benign are those in whom the salutary flame [bonus ignis] of love has
    enkindled the desire to be kind to their neighbor. Thirdly, as to his
    suffering with equanimity the evils his neighbor inflicts on him. To this
    belongs "meekness," which curbs anger. Fourthly, in the point of our
    refraining from doing harm to our neighbor not only through anger, but also
    through fraud or deceit. To this pertains "faith," if we take it as denoting
    fidelity. But if we take it for the faith whereby we believe in God, then
    man is directed thereby to that which is above him, so that he subject his
    intellect and, consequently, all that is his, to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Man is well disposed in respect of that which is below him, as regards
    external action, by "modesty," whereby we observe the "mode" in all our
    words and deeds: as regards internal desires, by "contingency" and
    "chastity": whether these two differ because chastity withdraws man from
    unlawful desires, contingency also from lawful desires: or because the
    continent man is subject to concupiscence, but is not led away; whereas the
    chaste man is neither subject to, nor led away from them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sanctification is effected by all the
    virtues, by which also sins are taken away. Consequently fruit is mentioned
    there in the singular, on account of its being generically one, though
    divided into many species which are spoken of as so many fruits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The hundredfold, sixtyfold, and
    thirtyfold fruits do not differ as various species of virtuous acts, but as
    various degrees of perfection, even in the same virtue. Thus contingency of
    the married state is said to be signified by the thirtyfold fruit; the
    contingency of widowhood, by the sixtyfold; and virginal contingency, by the
    hundredfold fruit. There are, moreover, other ways in which holy men
    distinguish three evangelical fruits according to the three degrees of
    virtue: and they speak of three degrees, because the perfection of anything
    is considered with respect to its beginning, its middle, and its end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact of not being disturbed by
    painful things is something to delight in. And as to faith, if we consider
    it as the foundation, it has the aspect of being ultimate and delightful, in
    as much as it contains certainty: hence a gloss expounds thus: "Faith, which
    is certainly about the unseen."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine says on Gal. 5:22,23, "the
    Apostle had no intention of teaching us how many [either works of the flesh,
    or fruits of the Spirit] there are; but to show how the former should be
    avoided, and the latter sought after." Hence either more or fewer fruits
    might have been mentioned. Nevertheless, all the acts of the gifts and
    virtues can be reduced to these by a certain kind of fittingness, in so far
    as all the virtues and gifts must needs direct the mind in one of the
    above-mentioned ways. Wherefore the acts of wisdom and of any gifts
    directing to good, are reduced to charity, joy and peace. The reason why he
    mentions these rather than others, is that these imply either enjoyment of
    good things, or relief from evils, which things seem to belong to the notion
    of fruit.<br />

    Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost are contrary to the works of the
    flesh?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fruits of the Holy Ghost
    are not contrary to the works of the flesh, which the Apostle enumerates (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A19,+seqq+"
      >Gal. 5:19, seqq.</a
    >). Because contraries are in the same genus. But the works of the flesh are
    not called fruits. Therefore the fruits of the Spirit are not contrary to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one thing has a contrary. Now the
    Apostle mentions more works of the flesh than fruits of the Spirit.
    Therefore the fruits of the Spirit and the works of the flesh are not
    contrary to one another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the fruits of the Spirit, the
    first place is given to charity, joy, and peace: to which, fornication,
    uncleanness, and immodesty, which are the first of the works of the flesh
    are not opposed. Therefore the fruits of the Spirit are not contrary to the
    works of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A17"
      >Gal. 5:17</a
    >) that "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
    flesh."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The works of the flesh and the fruits of the
    Spirit may be taken in two ways. First, in general: and in this way the
    fruits of the Holy Ghost considered in general are contrary to the works of
    the flesh. Because the Holy Ghost moves the human mind to that which is in
    accord with reason, or rather to that which surpasses reason: whereas the
    fleshly, viz. the sensitive, appetite draws man to sensible goods which are
    beneath him. Wherefore, since upward and downward are contrary movements in
    the physical order, so in human actions the works of the flesh are contrary
    to the fruits of the Spirit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, both fruits and fleshly works as enumerated may be considered
    singly, each according to its specific nature. And in this they are not of
    necessity contrary each to each: because, as stated above (<a
      href="FS070.html#FSQ70A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, ad 4), the Apostle did not intend to enumerate all the works, whether
    spiritual or carnal. However, by a kind of adaptation, Augustine, commenting
    on Gal. 5:22,23, contrasts the fruits with the carnal works, each to each.
    Thus "to fornication, which is the love of satisfying lust outside lawful
    wedlock, we may contrast charity, whereby the soul is wedded to God: wherein
    also is true chastity. By uncleanness we must understand whatever
    disturbances arise from fornication: and to these the joy of tranquillity is
    opposed. Idolatry, by reason of which war was waged against the Gospel of
    God, is opposed to peace. Against witchcrafts, enmities, contentions,
    emulations, wraths and quarrels, there is longsuffering, which helps us to
    bear the evils inflicted on us by those among whom we dwell; while kindness
    helps us to cure those evils; and goodness, to forgive them. In contrast to
    heresy there is faith; to envy, mildness; to drunkenness and revellings,
    contingency."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which proceeds from a tree against
    the tree's nature, is not called its fruit, but rather its corruption. And
    since works of virtue are connatural to reason, while works of vice are
    contrary to nature, therefore it is that works of virtue are called fruits,
    but not so works of vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Good happens in one way, evil in all
    manner of ways," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): so that to one virtue
    many vices are contrary. Consequently we must not be surprised if the works
    of the flesh are more numerous than the fruits of the spirit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.</p>
