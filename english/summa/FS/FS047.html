<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the cause that provokes anger, and its  remedies. 
Under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the motive of anger is always something done against the one 
who is angry?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether slight or contempt is the sole motive of anger?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the cause of anger on the part of the angry person;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the cause of anger on the part of the person with whom one is 
angry.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the motive of anger is not always something 
done against the one who is angry. Because man, by sinning, can do 
nothing against God; since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+35%3A6">Job 35:6</a>): "If thy iniquities 
be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him?" And yet God is spoken of 
as being angry with man on account of sin, according to Ps. 105:40: "The 
Lord was exceedingly angry with His people." Therefore it is not always 
on account of something done against him, that a man is angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, anger is a desire for vengeance. But one may desire 
vengeance for things done against others. Therefore we are not always 
angry on account of something done against us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) man is angry 
especially with those "who despise what he takes a great interest in; 
thus men who study philosophy are angry with those who despise 
philosophy," and so forth. But contempt of philosophy does not harm the 
philosopher. Therefore it is not always a harm done to us that makes us 
angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, he that holds his tongue when another insults him, 
provokes him to greater anger, as Chrysostom observes (Hom. xxii, in Ep. 
ad Rom.). But by holding his tongue he does the other no harm. Therefore 
a man is not always provoked to anger by something done against him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "anger is 
always due to something done to oneself: whereas hatred may arise without 
anything being done to us, for we hate a man simply because we think him 
such."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS046.html#FSQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="FS046.html#FSQ46A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), anger is the desire to 
hurt another for the purpose of just vengeance. Now unless some injury 
has been done, there is no question of vengeance: nor does any injury 
provoke one to vengeance, but only that which is done to the person who 
seeks vengeance: for just as everything naturally seeks its own good, so 
does it naturally repel its own evil. But injury done by anyone does not 
affect a man unless in some way it be something done against him. 
Consequently the motive of a man's anger is always something done against 
him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We speak of anger in God, not as of a passion of  the soul 
but as of judgment of justice, inasmuch as He wills to take vengeance on 
sin. Because the sinner, by sinning, cannot do God any actual harm: but 
so far as he himself is concerned, he acts against God in two ways. 
First, in so far as he despises God in His commandments. Secondly, in so 
far as he harms himself or another; which injury redounds to God, 
inasmuch as the person injured is an object of God's providence and 
protection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If we are angry with those who harm others, and seek to be 
avenged on them, it is because those who are injured belong in some way 
to us: either by some kinship or friendship, or at least because of the 
nature we have in common.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When we take a very great interest in a thing, we look upon 
it as our own good; so that if anyone despise it, it seems as though we 
ourselves were despised and injured.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Silence provokes the insulter to anger when he thinks it is 
due to contempt, as though his anger were slighted: and a slight is an 
action.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sole motive of anger is slight or contempt?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that slight or contempt is not the sole motive of 
anger. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that we are angry "when 
we suffer, or think that we are suffering, an injury." But one may suffer 
an injury without being despised or slighted. Therefore a slight is not 
the only motive of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, desire for honor and grief for a slight belong to the 
same subject. But dumb animals do not desire honor. Therefore they are 
not grieved by being slighted. And yet "they are roused to anger, when 
wounded," as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8). Therefore a slight is 
not the sole motive of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher (Rhet. ii, 2) gives many other causes of 
anger, for instance, "being forgotten by others; that others should 
rejoice in our misfortunes; that they should make known our evils; being 
hindered from doing as we like." Therefore being slighted is not the only 
motive for being angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that anger is "a 
desire, with sorrow, for vengeance, on account of a seeming slight done 
unbecomingly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All the causes of anger are reduced to slight. For slight 
is of three kinds, as stated in Rhet. ii, 2, viz. "contempt," "despiteful 
treatment," i.e. hindering one from doing one's will, and "insolence": 
and all motives of anger are reduced to these three. Two reasons may be 
assigned for this. First, because anger seeks another's hurt as being a 
means of just vengeance: wherefore it seeks vengeance in so far as it 
seems just. Now just vengeance is taken only for that which is done 
unjustly;  hence that which provokes anger is always something considered 
in the light of an injustice. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 
3) that "men are not angry---if they think they have wronged some one and 
are suffering justly on that account; because there is no anger at what 
is just." Now injury is done to another in three ways: namely, through 
ignorance, through passion, and through choice. Then, most of all, a man 
does an injustice, when he does an injury from choice, on purpose, or 
from deliberate malice, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Wherefore we are most 
of all angry with those who, in our opinion, have hurt us on purpose. For 
if we think that some one has done us an injury through ignorance or 
through passion, either we are not angry with them at all, or very much 
less: since to do anything through ignorance or through passion takes 
away from the notion of injury, and to a certain extent calls for mercy 
and forgiveness. Those, on the other hand, who do an injury on purpose, 
seem to sin from contempt; wherefore we are angry with them most of all. 
Hence the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "we are either not angry at 
all, or not very angry with those who have acted through anger, because 
they do not seem to have acted slightingly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason is because a slight is opposed to a man's excellence: 
because "men think little of things that are not worth much ado" (Rhet. 
ii, 2). Now we seek for some kind of excellence from all our goods. 
Consequently whatever injury is inflicted on us, in so far as it is 
derogatory to our excellence, seems to savor of a slight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Any other cause, besides contempt, through which a man 
suffers an injury, takes away from the notion of injury: contempt or 
slight alone adds to the motive of anger, and consequently is of itself 
the cause of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although a dumb animal does not seek honor as such, yet it 
naturally seeks a certain superiority, and is angry with anything 
derogatory thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Each of those causes amounts to some kind of slight. Thus 
forgetfulness is a clear sign of slight esteem, for the more we think of 
a thing the more is it fixed in our memory. Again if a man does not 
hesitate by his remarks to give pain to another, this seems to show that 
he thinks little of him: and those too who show signs of hilarity when 
another is in misfortune, seem to care little about his good or evil. 
Again he that hinders another from carrying out his will, without 
deriving thereby any profit to himself, seems not to care much for his 
friendship. Consequently all those things, in so far as they are signs of 
contempt, provoke anger.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man's excellence is the cause of his being angry?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man's excellence is not the cause of his 
being more easily angry. For the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii,  2) that 
"some are angry especially when they are grieved, for instance, the sick, 
the poor, and those who are disappointed." But these things seem to 
pertain to defect. Therefore defect rather than excellence makes one 
prone to anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "some are very 
much inclined to be angry when they are despised for some failing or 
weakness of the existence of which there are grounds for suspicion; but 
if they think they excel in those points, they do not trouble." But a 
suspicion of this kind is due to some defect. Therefore defect rather 
than excellence is a cause of a man being angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever savors of excellence makes a man agreeable and 
hopeful. But the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "men are not angry 
when they play, make jokes, or take part in a feast, nor when they are 
prosperous or successful, nor in moderate pleasures and well-founded 
hope." Therefore excellence is not a cause of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 9) that excellence 
makes men prone to anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The cause of anger, in the man who is angry, may be taken 
in two ways. First in respect of the motive of anger: and thus excellence 
is the cause of a man being easily angered. Because the motive of anger 
is an unjust slight, as stated above (<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now it is evident that the 
more excellent a man is, the more unjust is a slight offered him in the 
matter in which he excels. Consequently those who excel in any matter, 
are most of all angry, if they be slighted in that matter; for instance, 
a wealthy man in his riches, or an orator in his eloquence, and so forth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the cause of anger, in the man who is angry, may be considered 
on the part of the disposition produced in him by the motive aforesaid. 
Now it is evident that nothing moves a man to anger except a hurt that 
grieves him: while whatever savors of defect is above all a cause of 
grief; since men who suffer from some defect are more easily hurt. And 
this is why men who are weak, or subject to some other defect, are more 
easily angered, since they are more easily grieved.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If a man be despised in a matter in which he evidently 
excels greatly, he does not consider himself the loser thereby, and 
therefore is not grieved: and in this respect he is less angered. But in 
another respect, in so far as he is more undeservedly despised, he has 
more reason for being angry: unless perhaps he thinks that he is envied 
or insulted not through contempt but through ignorance, or some other 
like cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All these things hinder anger in so far as they hinder 
sorrow. But in another respect they are naturally apt to  provoke anger, 
because they make it more unseemly to insult anyone.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a person's defect is a reason for being more easily angry with him?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a person's defect is not a reason for being 
more easily angry with him. For the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that 
"we are not angry with those who confess and repent and humble 
themselves; on the contrary, we are gentle with them. Wherefore dogs bite 
not those who sit down." But these things savor of littleness and defect. 
Therefore littleness of a person is a reason for being less angry with 
him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no greater defect than death. But anger ceases 
at the sight of death. Therefore defect of a person does not provoke 
anger against him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one thinks little of a man through his being friendly 
towards him. But we are more angry with friends, if they offend us or 
refuse to help us; hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++54%3A13">Ps. 54:13</a>): "If my enemy had 
reviled me I would verily have borne with it." Therefore a person's 
defect is not a reason for being more easily angry with him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "the rich man 
is angry with the poor man, if the latter despise him; and in like manner 
the prince is angry with his subject."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS047.html#FSQ47ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3) unmerited contempt more than 
anything else is a provocative of anger. Consequently deficiency or 
littleness in the person with whom we are angry, tends to increase our 
anger, in so far as it adds to the unmeritedness of being despised. For 
just as the higher a man's position is, the more undeservedly he is 
despised; so the lower it is, the less reason he has for despising. Thus 
a nobleman is angry if he be insulted by a peasant; a wise man, if by a 
fool; a master, if by a servant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, the littleness or deficiency lessens the unmerited 
contempt, then it does not increase but lessens anger. In this way those 
who repent of their ill-deeds, and confess that they have done wrong, who 
humble themselves and ask pardon, mitigate anger, according to Prov. 
15:1: "A mild answer breaketh wrath": because, to wit, they seem not to 
despise, but rather to think much of those before whom they humble 
themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are two reasons why anger ceases at the sight of 
death. One is because the dead are incapable of sorrow and sensation; and 
this is chiefly what the angry seek in those with whom they are angered. 
Another reason is because the dead seem to have attained to the limit of 
evils. Hence anger ceases in regard  to all who are grievously hurt, in 
so far as this hurt surpasses the measure of just retaliation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[47] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To be despised by one's friends seems also a greater 
indignity. Consequently if they despise us by hurting or by failing to 
help, we are angry with them for the same reason for which we are angry 
with those who are beneath us.<br>
