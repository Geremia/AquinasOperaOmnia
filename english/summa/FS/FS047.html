    OF THE CAUSE THAT PROVOKES ANGER, AND OF THE REMEDIES OF ANGER (FOUR
    ARTICLES) [*There is no further mention of these remedies in the text,
    except in Article [4].]<br />
    <br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the cause that provokes anger, and its remedies. Under
    this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS047.html#FSQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the motive of anger is
    always something done against the one who is angry?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS047.html#FSQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether slight or contempt is the
    sole motive of anger?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS047.html#FSQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the cause of anger on the part
    of the angry person;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS047.html#FSQ47A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the cause of anger on the part
    of the person with whom one is angry.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the motive of anger is always something done against the one who is
    angry?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the motive of anger is not
    always something done against the one who is angry. Because man, by sinning,
    can do nothing against God; since it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+35%3A6"
      >Job 35:6</a
    >): "If thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against Him?" And
    yet God is spoken of as being angry with man on account of sin, according to
    Ps. 105:40: "The Lord was exceedingly angry with His people." Therefore it
    is not always on account of something done against him, that a man is
    angry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, anger is a desire for vengeance. But one
    may desire vengeance for things done against others. Therefore we are not
    always angry on account of something done against us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2)
    man is angry especially with those "who despise what he takes a great
    interest in; thus men who study philosophy are angry with those who despise
    philosophy," and so forth. But contempt of philosophy does not harm the
    philosopher. Therefore it is not always a harm done to us that makes us
    angry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, he that holds his tongue when another
    insults him, provokes him to greater anger, as Chrysostom observes (Hom.
    xxii, in Ep. ad Rom.). But by holding his tongue he does the other no harm.
    Therefore a man is not always provoked to anger by something done against
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that
    "anger is always due to something done to oneself: whereas hatred may arise
    without anything being done to us, for we hate a man simply because we think
    him such."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS046.html#FSQ46OUTP1"
      >Question [46]</a
    >, <a href="FS046.html#FSQ46A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), anger is the desire
    to hurt another for the purpose of just vengeance. Now unless some injury
    has been done, there is no question of vengeance: nor does any injury
    provoke one to vengeance, but only that which is done to the person who
    seeks vengeance: for just as everything naturally seeks its own good, so
    does it naturally repel its own evil. But injury done by anyone does not
    affect a man unless in some way it be something done against him.
    Consequently the motive of a man's anger is always something done against
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We speak of anger in God, not as of a
    passion of the soul but as of judgment of justice, inasmuch as He wills to
    take vengeance on sin. Because the sinner, by sinning, cannot do God any
    actual harm: but so far as he himself is concerned, he acts against God in
    two ways. First, in so far as he despises God in His commandments. Secondly,
    in so far as he harms himself or another; which injury redounds to God,
    inasmuch as the person injured is an object of God's providence and
    protection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If we are angry with those who harm
    others, and seek to be avenged on them, it is because those who are injured
    belong in some way to us: either by some kinship or friendship, or at least
    because of the nature we have in common.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When we take a very great interest in a
    thing, we look upon it as our own good; so that if anyone despise it, it
    seems as though we ourselves were despised and injured.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Silence provokes the insulter to anger
    when he thinks it is due to contempt, as though his anger were slighted: and
    a slight is an action.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the sole motive of anger is slight or contempt?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that slight or contempt is not the
    sole motive of anger. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that we are
    angry "when we suffer, or think that we are suffering, an injury." But one
    may suffer an injury without being despised or slighted. Therefore a slight
    is not the only motive of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, desire for honor and grief for a slight
    belong to the same subject. But dumb animals do not desire honor. Therefore
    they are not grieved by being slighted. And yet "they are roused to anger,
    when wounded," as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8). Therefore a slight
    is not the sole motive of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher (Rhet. ii, 2) gives many
    other causes of anger, for instance, "being forgotten by others; that others
    should rejoice in our misfortunes; that they should make known our evils;
    being hindered from doing as we like." Therefore being slighted is not the
    only motive for being angry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that anger
    is "a desire, with sorrow, for vengeance, on account of a seeming slight
    done unbecomingly."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All the causes of anger are reduced to slight.
    For slight is of three kinds, as stated in Rhet. ii, 2, viz. "contempt,"
    "despiteful treatment," i.e. hindering one from doing one's will, and
    "insolence": and all motives of anger are reduced to these three. Two
    reasons may be assigned for this. First, because anger seeks another's hurt
    as being a means of just vengeance: wherefore it seeks vengeance in so far
    as it seems just. Now just vengeance is taken only for that which is done
    unjustly; hence that which provokes anger is always something considered in
    the light of an injustice. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that
    "men are not angry---if they think they have wronged some one and are
    suffering justly on that account; because there is no anger at what is
    just." Now injury is done to another in three ways: namely, through
    ignorance, through passion, and through choice. Then, most of all, a man
    does an injustice, when he does an injury from choice, on purpose, or from
    deliberate malice, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Wherefore we are most of all
    angry with those who, in our opinion, have hurt us on purpose. For if we
    think that some one has done us an injury through ignorance or through
    passion, either we are not angry with them at all, or very much less: since
    to do anything through ignorance or through passion takes away from the
    notion of injury, and to a certain extent calls for mercy and forgiveness.
    Those, on the other hand, who do an injury on purpose, seem to sin from
    contempt; wherefore we are angry with them most of all. Hence the
    Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "we are either not angry at all, or not
    very angry with those who have acted through anger, because they do not seem
    to have acted slightingly."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason is because a slight is opposed to a man's excellence:
    because "men think little of things that are not worth much ado" (Rhet. ii,
    2). Now we seek for some kind of excellence from all our goods. Consequently
    whatever injury is inflicted on us, in so far as it is derogatory to our
    excellence, seems to savor of a slight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Any other cause, besides contempt,
    through which a man suffers an injury, takes away from the notion of injury:
    contempt or slight alone adds to the motive of anger, and consequently is of
    itself the cause of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although a dumb animal does not seek
    honor as such, yet it naturally seeks a certain superiority, and is angry
    with anything derogatory thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Each of those causes amounts to some
    kind of slight. Thus forgetfulness is a clear sign of slight esteem, for the
    more we think of a thing the more is it fixed in our memory. Again if a man
    does not hesitate by his remarks to give pain to another, this seems to show
    that he thinks little of him: and those too who show signs of hilarity when
    another is in misfortune, seem to care little about his good or evil. Again
    he that hinders another from carrying out his will, without deriving thereby
    any profit to himself, seems not to care much for his friendship.
    Consequently all those things, in so far as they are signs of contempt,
    provoke anger.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether a man's excellence is the cause of his being angry?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man's excellence is not the
    cause of his being more easily angry. For the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2)
    that "some are angry especially when they are grieved, for instance, the
    sick, the poor, and those who are disappointed." But these things seem to
    pertain to defect. Therefore defect rather than excellence makes one prone
    to anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that
    "some are very much inclined to be angry when they are despised for some
    failing or weakness of the existence of which there are grounds for
    suspicion; but if they think they excel in those points, they do not
    trouble." But a suspicion of this kind is due to some defect. Therefore
    defect rather than excellence is a cause of a man being angry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever savors of excellence makes a
    man agreeable and hopeful. But the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that "men
    are not angry when they play, make jokes, or take part in a feast, nor when
    they are prosperous or successful, nor in moderate pleasures and
    well-founded hope." Therefore excellence is not a cause of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 9) that
    excellence makes men prone to anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The cause of anger, in the man who is angry,
    may be taken in two ways. First in respect of the motive of anger: and thus
    excellence is the cause of a man being easily angered. Because the motive of
    anger is an unjust slight, as stated above (<a
      href="FS047.html#FSQ47A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Now it is evident that the more excellent a man is, the more unjust is a
    slight offered him in the matter in which he excels. Consequently those who
    excel in any matter, are most of all angry, if they be slighted in that
    matter; for instance, a wealthy man in his riches, or an orator in his
    eloquence, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the cause of anger, in the man who is angry, may be considered on
    the part of the disposition produced in him by the motive aforesaid. Now it
    is evident that nothing moves a man to anger except a hurt that grieves him:
    while whatever savors of defect is above all a cause of grief; since men who
    suffer from some defect are more easily hurt. And this is why men who are
    weak, or subject to some other defect, are more easily angered, since they
    are more easily grieved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If a man be despised in a matter in
    which he evidently excels greatly, he does not consider himself the loser
    thereby, and therefore is not grieved: and in this respect he is less
    angered. But in another respect, in so far as he is more undeservedly
    despised, he has more reason for being angry: unless perhaps he thinks that
    he is envied or insulted not through contempt but through ignorance, or some
    other like cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All these things hinder anger in so far
    as they hinder sorrow. But in another respect they are naturally apt to
    provoke anger, because they make it more unseemly to insult anyone.<br />

    Whether a person's defect is a reason for being more easily angry with
    him?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a person's defect is not a
    reason for being more easily angry with him. For the Philosopher says (Rhet.
    ii, 3) that "we are not angry with those who confess and repent and humble
    themselves; on the contrary, we are gentle with them. Wherefore dogs bite
    not those who sit down." But these things savor of littleness and defect.
    Therefore littleness of a person is a reason for being less angry with
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no greater defect than death.
    But anger ceases at the sight of death. Therefore defect of a person does
    not provoke anger against him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one thinks little of a man through
    his being friendly towards him. But we are more angry with friends, if they
    offend us or refuse to help us; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++54%3A13"
      >Ps. 54:13</a
    >): "If my enemy had reviled me I would verily have borne with it."
    Therefore a person's defect is not a reason for being more easily angry with
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that "the
    rich man is angry with the poor man, if the latter despise him; and in like
    manner the prince is angry with his subject."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS047.html#FSQ47ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,3) unmerited contempt more than anything else is a provocative of anger.
    Consequently deficiency or littleness in the person with whom we are angry,
    tends to increase our anger, in so far as it adds to the unmeritedness of
    being despised. For just as the higher a man's position is, the more
    undeservedly he is despised; so the lower it is, the less reason he has for
    despising. Thus a nobleman is angry if he be insulted by a peasant; a wise
    man, if by a fool; a master, if by a servant.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, the littleness or deficiency lessens the unmerited contempt,
    then it does not increase but lessens anger. In this way those who repent of
    their ill-deeds, and confess that they have done wrong, who humble
    themselves and ask pardon, mitigate anger, according to Prov. 15:1: "A mild
    answer breaketh wrath": because, to wit, they seem not to despise, but
    rather to think much of those before whom they humble themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are two reasons why anger ceases
    at the sight of death. One is because the dead are incapable of sorrow and
    sensation; and this is chiefly what the angry seek in those with whom they
    are angered. Another reason is because the dead seem to have attained to the
    limit of evils. Hence anger ceases in regard to all who are grievously hurt,
    in so far as this hurt surpasses the measure of just retaliation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To be despised by one's friends seems
    also a greater indignity. Consequently if they despise us by hurting or by
    failing to help, we are angry with them for the same reason for which we are
    angry with those who are beneath us.<br />
