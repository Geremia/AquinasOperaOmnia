    OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE NEW LAW (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider those things that are contained in the New Law: under
    which head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS108.html#FSQ108A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the New Law ought to
    prescribe or to forbid any outward works?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS108.html#FSQ108A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the New Law makes
    sufficient provision in prescribing and forbidding external acts?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS108.html#FSQ108A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether in the matter of internal
    acts it directs man sufficiently?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS108.html#FSQ108A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it fittingly adds
    counsels to precepts?

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the New Law ought to prescribe or prohibit any external acts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the New Law should not
    prescribe or prohibit any external acts. For the New Law is the Gospel of
    the kingdom, according to Mt. 24:14: "This Gospel of the kingdom shall be
    preached in the whole world." But the kingdom of God consists not in
    exterior, but only in interior acts, according to Lk. 17:21: "The kingdom of
    God is within you"; and Rm. 14:17: "The kingdom of God is not meat and
    drink; but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." Therefore the New
    Law should not prescribe or forbid any external acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the New Law is "the law of the Spirit"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A2">Rm. 8:2</a>). But
    "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3%3A17"
      >2 Cor. 3:17</a
    >). Now there is no liberty when man is bound to do or avoid certain
    external acts. Therefore the New Law does not prescribe or forbid any
    external acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all external acts are understood as
    referable to the hand, just as interior acts belong to the mind. But this is
    assigned as the difference between the New and Old Laws that the "Old Law
    restrains the hand, whereas the New Law curbs the will" [*Peter Lombard,
    Sent. iii, D, 40]. Therefore the New Law should not contain prohibitions and
    commands about exterior deeds, but only about interior acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Through the New Law, men are made "children
    of light": wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++12%3A36"
      >Jn. 12:36</a
    >): "Believe in the light that you may be the children of light." Now it is
    becoming that children of the light should do deeds of light and cast aside
    deeds of darkness, according to Eph. 5:8: "You were heretofore darkness, but
    now light in the Lord. Walk... as children of the light." Therefore the New
    Law had to forbid certain external acts and prescribe others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS106.html#FSQ106OUTP1"
      >Question [106]</a
    >, <a href="FS106.html#FSQ106ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), the New Law
    consists chiefly in the grace of the Holy Ghost, which is shown forth by
    faith that worketh through love. Now men become receivers of this grace
    through God's Son made man, Whose humanity grace filled first, and thence
    flowed forth to us. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A14"
      >Jn. 1:14</a
    >): "The Word was made flesh," and afterwards: "full of grace and truth";
    and further on: "Of His fulness we all have received, and grace for grace."
    Hence it is added that "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ." Consequently
    it was becoming that the grace flows from the incarnate Word should be given
    to us by means of certain external sensible objects; and that from this
    inward grace, whereby the flesh is subjected to the Spirit, certain external
    works should ensue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly external acts may have a twofold connection with grace. In the
    first place, as leading in some way to grace. Such are the sacramental acts
    which are instituted in the New Law, e.g. Baptism, the Eucharist, and the
    like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second place there are those external acts which ensue from the
    promptings of grace: and herein we must observe a difference. For there are
    some which are necessarily in keeping with, or in opposition to inward grace
    consisting in faith that worketh through love. Such external works are
    prescribed or forbidden in the New Law; thus confession of faith is
    prescribed, and denial of faith is forbidden; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++10%3A32,33"
      >Mt. 10:32,33</a
    >) "(Every one) that shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him
    before My Father... But he that shall deny Me before men, I will also deny
    him before My Father." On the other hand, there are works which are not
    necessarily opposed to, or in keeping with faith that worketh through love.
    Such works are not prescribed or forbidden in the New Law, by virtue of its
    primitive institution; but have been left by the Lawgiver, i.e. Christ, to
    the discretion of each individual. And so to each one it is free to decide
    what he should do or avoid; and to each superior, to direct his subjects in
    such matters as regards what they must do or avoid. Wherefore also in this
    respect the Gospel is called the "law of liberty" [*Cf. Reply Objection
    [2]]: since the Old Law decided many points and left few to man to decide as
    he chose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The kingdom of God consists chiefly in
    internal acts: but as a consequence all things that are essential to
    internal acts belong also to the kingdom of God. Thus if the kingdom of God
    is internal righteousness, peace, and spiritual joy, all external acts that
    are incompatible with righteousness, peace, and spiritual joy, are in
    opposition to the kingdom of God; and consequently should be forbidden in
    the Gospel of the kingdom. On the other hand, those things that are
    indifferent as regards the aforesaid, for instance, to eat of this or that
    food, are not part of the kingdom of God; wherefore the Apostle says before
    the words quoted: "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Metaph. i,
    2), what is "free is cause of itself." Therefore he acts freely, who acts of
    his own accord. Now man does of his own accord that which he does from a
    habit that is suitable to his nature: since a habit inclines one as a second
    nature. If, however, a habit be in opposition to nature, man would not act
    according to his nature, but according to some corruption affecting that
    nature. Since then the grace of the Holy Ghost is like an interior habit
    bestowed on us and inclining us to act aright, it makes us do freely those
    things that are becoming to grace, and shun what is opposed to it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the New Law is called the law of liberty in two respects. First,
    because it does not bind us to do or avoid certain things, except such as
    are of themselves necessary or opposed to salvation, and come under the
    prescription or prohibition of the law. Secondly, because it also makes us
    comply freely with these precepts and prohibitions, inasmuch as we do so
    through the promptings of grace. It is for these two reasons that the New
    Law is called "the law of perfect liberty" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A25"
      >James 1:25</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The New Law, by restraining the mind
    from inordinate movements, must needs also restrain the hand from inordinate
    acts, which ensue from inward movements.<br />

    Whether the New Law made sufficient ordinations about external acts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the New Law made insufficient
    ordinations about external acts. Because faith that worketh through charity
    seems chiefly to belong to the New Law, according to Gal. 5:6: "In Christ
    Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision: but faith
    that worketh through charity." But the New Law declared explicitly certain
    points of faith which were not set forth explicitly in the Old Law; for
    instance, belief in the Trinity. Therefore it should also have added certain
    outward moral deeds, which were not fixed in the Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the Old Law not only were sacraments
    instituted, but also certain sacred things, as stated above (<a
      href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="FS101.html#FSQ101A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1">Question [102]</a>,
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But in the New Law,
    although certain sacraments are instituted by Our Lord; for instance,
    pertaining either to the sanctification of a temple or of the vessels, or to
    the celebration of some particular feast. Therefore the New Law made
    insufficient ordinations about external matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the Old Law, just as there were
    certain observances pertaining to God's ministers, so also were there
    certain observances pertaining to the people: as was stated above when we
    were treating of the ceremonial of the Old Law (<a
      href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="FS101.html#FSQ101A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1">Question [102]</a>,
    <a href="FS102.html#FSQ102A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Now in the New Law
    certain observances seem to have been prescribed to the ministers of God; as
    may be gathered from Mt. 10:9: "Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money
    in your purses," nor other things which are mentioned here and Lk. 9,10.
    Therefore certain observances pertaining to the faithful should also have
    been instituted in the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in the Old Law, besides moral and
    ceremonial precepts, there were certain judicial precepts. But in the New
    Law there are no judicial precepts. Therefore the New Law made insufficient
    ordinations about external works.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++7%3A24"
      >Mt. 7:24</a
    >): "Every one... that heareth these My words, and doth them, shall be
    likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock." But a wise builder
    leaves out nothing that is necessary to the building. Therefore Christ's
    words contain all things necessary for man's salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> as stated above (<a
      href="FS108.html#FSQ108A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the New Law had to make such prescriptions or prohibitions alone as are
    essential for the reception or right use of grace. And since we cannot of
    ourselves obtain grace, but through Christ alone, hence Christ of Himself
    instituted the sacraments whereby we obtain grace: viz. Baptism, Eucharist,
    Orders of the ministers of the New Law, by the institution of the apostles
    and seventy-two disciples, Penance, and indissoluble Matrimony. He promised
    Confirmation through the sending of the Holy Ghost: and we read that by His
    institution the apostles healed the sick by anointing them with oil (Mk.
    6:13). These are the sacraments of the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The right use of grace is by means of works of charity. These, in so far as
    they are essential to virtue, pertain to the moral precepts, which also
    formed part of the Old Law. Hence, in this respect, the New Law had nothing
    to add as regards external action. The determination of these works in their
    relation to the divine worship, belongs to the ceremonial precepts of the
    Law; and, in relation to our neighbor, to the judicial precepts, as stated
    above (<a href="FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>,
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). And therefore, since
    these determinations are not in themselves necessarily connected with inward
    grace wherein the Law consists, they do not come under a precept of the New
    Law, but are left to the decision of man; some relating to inferiors---as
    when a precept is given to an individual; others, relating to superiors,
    temporal or spiritual, referring, namely, to the common good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the New Law had no other external works to determine, by
    prescribing or forbidding, except the sacraments, and those moral precepts
    which have a necessary connection with virtue, for instance, that one must
    not kill, or steal, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Matters of faith are above human reason,
    and so we cannot attain to them except through grace. Consequently, when
    grace came to be bestowed more abundantly, the result was an increase in the
    number of explicit points of faith. On the other hand, it is through human
    reason that we are directed to works of virtue, for it is the rule of human
    action, as stated above (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Wherefore in such
    matters as these there was no need for any precepts to be given besides the
    moral precepts of the Law, which proceed from the dictate of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the sacraments of the New Law grace
    is bestowed, which cannot be received except through Christ: consequently
    they had to be instituted by Him. But in the sacred things no grace is
    given: for instance, in the consecration of a temple, an altar or the like,
    or, again, in the celebration of feasts. Wherefore Our Lord left the
    institution of such things to the discretion of the faithful, since they
    have not of themselves any necessary connection with inward grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our Lord gave the apostles those
    precepts not as ceremonial observances, but as moral statutes: and they can
    be understood in two ways. First, following Augustine (De Consensu Evang.
    30), as being not commands but permissions. For He permitted them to set
    forth to preach without scrip or stick, and so on, since they were empowered
    to accept their livelihood from those to whom they preached: wherefore He
    goes on to say: "For the laborer is worthy of his hire." Nor is it a sin,
    but a work of supererogation for a preacher to take means of livelihood with
    him, without accepting supplies from those to whom he preaches; as Paul did
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++9%3A4,+seqq+"
      >1 Cor. 9:4, seqq.</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, according to the explanation of other holy men, they may be
    considered as temporal commands laid upon the apostles for the time during
    which they were sent to preach in Judea before Christ's Passion. For the
    disciples, being yet as little children under Christ's care, needed to
    receive some special commands from Christ, such as all subjects receive from
    their superiors: and especially so, since they were to be accustomed little
    by little to renounce the care of temporalities, so as to become fitted for
    the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world. Nor must we wonder
    if He established certain fixed modes of life, as long as the state of the
    Old Law endured and the people had not as yet achieved the perfect liberty
    of the Spirit. These statutes He abolished shortly before His Passion, as
    though the disciples had by their means become sufficiently practiced. Hence
    He said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A35,36"
      >Lk. 22:35,36</a
    >) "When I sent you without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want
    anything? But they said: Nothing. Then said He unto them: But now, he that
    hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip." Because the time of
    perfect liberty was already at hand, when they would be left entirely to
    their own judgment in matters not necessarily connected with virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Judicial precepts also, are not
    essential to virtue in respect of any particular determination, but only in
    regard to the common notion of justice. Consequently Our Lord left the
    judicial precepts to the discretion of those who were to have spiritual or
    temporal charge of others. But as regards the judicial precepts of the Old
    Law, some of them He explained, because they were misunderstood by the
    Pharisees, as we shall state later on (<a href="FS108.html#FSQ108A3THEP1"

    Whether the New Law directed man sufficiently as regards interior
    actions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the New Law directed man
    insufficiently as regards interior actions. For there are ten commandments
    of the decalogue directing man to God and his neighbor. But Our Lord partly
    fulfilled only three of them: as regards, namely, the prohibition of murder,
    of adultery, and of perjury. Therefore it seems that, by omitting to fulfil
    the other precepts, He directed man insufficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as regards the judicial precepts, Our
    Lord ordained nothing in the Gospel, except in the matter of divorcing of
    wife, of punishment by retaliation, and of persecuting one's enemies. But
    there are many other judicial precepts of the Old Law, as stated above (<a
      href="FS104.html#FSQ104OUTP1"
      >Question [104]</a
    >, <a href="FS104.html#FSQ104A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS105.html#FSQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>). Therefore, in this
    respect, He directed human life insufficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the Old Law, besides moral and
    judicial, there were ceremonial precepts about which Our Lord made no
    ordination. Therefore it seems that He ordained insufficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in order that the mind be inwardly well
    disposed, man should do no good deed for any temporal whatever. But there
    are many other temporal goods besides the favor of man: and there are many
    other good works besides fasting, alms-deeds, and prayer. Therefore Our Lord
    unbecomingly taught that only in respect of these three works, and of no
    other earthly goods ought we to shun the glory of human favor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, solicitude for the necessary means of
    livelihood is by nature instilled into man, and this solicitude even other
    animals share with man: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A6,8"
      >Prov. 6:6,8</a
    >): "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways... she provideth her
    meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest." But
    every command issued against the inclination of nature is an unjust command,
    forasmuch as it is contrary to the law of nature. Therefore it seems that
    Our Lord unbecomingly forbade solicitude about food and raiment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, no act of virtue should be the subject
    of a prohibition. Now judgment is an act of justice, according to Ps. 18:15:
    "Until justice be turned into judgment." Therefore it seems that Our Lord
    unbecomingly forbade judgment: and consequently that the New Law directed
    man insufficiently in the matter of interior acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 1):
    We should take note that, when He said: "'He that heareth these My words,'
    He indicates clearly that this sermon of the Lord is replete with all the
    precepts whereby a Christian's life is formed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is evident from Augustine's words just
    quoted, the sermon, contains the whole process of forming the life of a
    Christian. Therein man's interior movements are ordered. Because after
    declaring that his end is Beatitude; and after commending the authority of
    the apostles, through whom the teaching of the Gospel was to be promulgated,
    He orders man's interior movements, first in regard to man himself, secondly
    in regard to his neighbor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This he does in regard to man himself, in two ways, corresponding to man's
    two interior movements in respect of any prospective action, viz. volition
    of what has to be done, and intention of the end. Wherefore, in the first
    place, He directs man's will in respect of the various precepts of the Law:
    by prescribing that man should refrain not merely from those external works
    that are evil in themselves, but also from internal acts, and from the
    occasions of evil deeds. In the second place He directs man's intention, by
    teaching that in our good works, we should seek neither human praise, nor
    worldly riches, which is to lay up treasures on earth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Afterwards He directs man's interior movement in respect of his neighbor, by
    forbidding us, on the one hand, to judge him rashly, unjustly, or
    presumptuously; and, on the other, to entrust him too readily with sacred
    things if he be unworthy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, He teaches us how to fulfil the teaching of the Gospel; viz. by
    imploring the help of God; by striving to enter by the narrow door of
    perfect virtue; and by being wary lest we be led astray by evil influences.
    Moreover, He declares that we must observe His commandments, and that it is
    not enough to make profession of faith, or to work miracles, or merely to
    hear His words.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord explained the manner of
    fulfilling those precepts which the Scribes and Pharisees did not rightly
    understand: and this affected chiefly those precepts of the decalogue. For
    they thought that the prohibition of adultery and murder covered the
    external act only, and not the internal desire. And they held this opinion
    about murder and adultery rather than about theft and false witness, because
    the movement of anger tending to murder, and the movement of desire tending
    to adultery, seem to be in us from nature somewhat, but not the desire of
    stealing or bearing false witness. They held a false opinion about perjury,
    for they thought that perjury indeed was a sin; but that oaths were of
    themselves to be desired and to be taken frequently, since they seem to
    proceed from reverence to God. Hence Our Lord shows that an oath is not
    desirable as a good thing; and that it is better to speak without oaths,
    unless necessity forces us to have recourse to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Scribes and Pharisees erred about
    the judicial precepts in two ways. First, because they considered certain
    matters contained in the Law of Moses by way of permission, to be right in
    themselves: namely, divorce of a wife, and the taking of usury from
    strangers. Wherefore Our Lord forbade a man to divorce his wife (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A32"
      >Mt. 5:32</a
    >); and to receive usury (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++6%3A35"
      >Lk. 6:35</a
    >), when He said: "Lend, hoping for nothing thereby."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In another way they erred by thinking that certain things which the Old Law
    commanded to be done for justice's sake, should be done out of desire for
    revenge, or out of lust for temporal goods, or out of hatred of one's
    enemies; and this in respect of three precepts. For they thought that desire
    for revenge was lawful, on account of the precept concerning punishment by
    retaliation: whereas this precept was given that justice might be
    safeguarded, not that man might seek revenge. Wherefore, in order to do away
    with this, Our Lord teaches that man should be prepared in his mind to
    suffer yet more if necessary. They thought that movements of covetousness
    were lawful on account of those judicial precepts which prescribed
    restitution of what had been purloined, together with something added
    thereto, as stated above (<a href="FS105.html#FSQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a
    >, <a href="FS105.html#FSQ105A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 9); whereas the
    Law commanded this to be done in order to safeguard justice, not to
    encourage covetousness. Wherefore Our Lord teaches that we should not demand
    our goods from motives of cupidity, and that we should be ready to give yet
    more if necessary. They thought that the movement of hatred was lawful, on
    account of the commandments of the Law about the slaying of one's enemies:
    whereas the Law ordered this for the fulfilment of justice, as stated above
    (<a href="FS105.html#FSQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>,
    <a href="FS105.html#FSQ105A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4), not to satisfy
    hatred. Wherefore Our Lord teaches us that we ought to love our enemies, and
    to be ready to do good to them if necessary. For these precepts are to be
    taken as binding "the mind to be prepared to fulfil them," as Augustine says
    (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 19).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The moral precepts necessarily retained
    their force under the New Law, because they are of themselves essential to
    virtue: whereas the judicial precepts did not necessarily continue to bind
    in exactly the same way as had been fixed by the Law: this was left to man
    to decide in one way or another. Hence Our Lord directed us becomingly with
    regard to these two kinds of precepts. On the other hand, the observance of
    the ceremonial precepts was totally abolished by the advent of the reality;
    wherefore in regard to these precepts He commanded nothing on this occasion
    when He was giving the general points of His doctrine. Elsewhere, however,
    He makes it clear that the entire bodily worship which was fixed by the Law,
    was to be changed into spiritual worship: as is evident from Jn. 4:21,23,
    where He says: "The hour cometh when you shall neither on this mountain, nor
    in Jerusalem adore the Father... but... the true adorers shall adore the
    Father in spirit and in truth."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> All worldly goods may be reduced to
    three---honors, riches, and pleasures; according to 1 Jn. 2:16: "All that is
    in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh," which refers to pleasures
    of the flesh, "and the concupiscence of the eyes," which refers to riches,
    "and the pride of life," which refers to ambition for renown and honor. Now
    the Law did not promise an abundance of carnal pleasures; on the contrary,
    it forbade them. But it did promise exalted honors and abundant riches; for
    it is written in reference to the former (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++28%3A1"
      >Dt. 28:1</a
    >): "If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God... He will make thee
    higher than all the nations"; and in reference to the latter, we read a
    little further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++28%3A11"
      >Dt. 28:11</a
    >): "He will make thee abound with all goods." But the Jews so distorted the
    true meaning of these promises, as to think that we ought to serve God, with
    these things as the end in view. Wherefore Our Lord set this aside by
    teaching, first of all, that works of virtue should not be done for human
    glory. And He mentions three works, to which all others may be reduced:
    since whatever a man does in order to curb his desires, comes under the head
    of fasting; and whatever a man does for the love of his neighbor, comes
    under the head of alms-deeds; and whatever a man does for the worship of
    God, comes under the head of prayer. And He mentions these three
    specifically, as they hold the principal place, and are most often used by
    men in order to gain glory. In the second place He taught us that we must
    not place our end in riches, when He said: "Lay not up to yourselves
    treasures on earth" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A19"
      >Mt. 6:19</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Our Lord forbade, not necessary, but
    inordinate solicitude. Now there is a fourfold solicitude to be avoided in
    temporal matters. First, we must not place our end in them, nor serve God
    for the sake of the necessities of food and raiment. Wherefore He says: "Lay
    not up for yourselves," etc. Secondly, we must not be so anxious about
    temporal things, as to despair of God's help: wherefore Our Lord says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A32"
      >Mt. 6:32</a
    >): "Your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things." Thirdly,
    we must not add presumption to our solicitude; in other words, we must not
    be confident of getting the necessaries of life by our own efforts without
    God's help: such solicitude Our Lord sets aside by saying that a man cannot
    add anything to his stature (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A27"
      >Mt. 6:27</a
    >). We must not anticipate the time for anxiety; namely, by being solicitous
    now, for the needs, not of the present, but of a future time: wherefore He
    says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A34">Mt. 6:34</a
    >): "Be not... solicitous for tomorrow."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Our Lord did not forbid the judgment of
    justice, without which holy things could not be withdrawn from the unworthy.
    But he forbade inordinate judgment, as stated above.<br />

    Whether certain definite counsels are fittingly proposed in the New Law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that certain definite counsels are
    not fittingly proposed in the New Law. For counsels are given about that
    which is expedient for an end, as we stated above, when treating of counsel
    (<a href="FS014.html#FSQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>,
    <a href="FS014.html#FSQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the same things are
    not expedient for all. Therefore certain definite counsels should not be
    proposed to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, counsels regard a greater good. But
    there are no definite degrees to the greater good. Therefore definite
    counsels should not be given.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, counsels pertain to the life of
    perfection. But obedience pertains to the life of perfection. Therefore it
    was unfitting that no counsel of obedience should be contained in the
    Gospel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, many matters pertaining to the life of
    perfection are found among the commandments, as, for instance, "Love your
    enemies" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A44"
      >Mt. 5:44</a
    >), and those precepts which Our Lord gave His apostles (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++10"
      >Mt. 10</a
    >). Therefore the counsels are unfittingly given in the New Law: both
    because they are not all mentioned; and because they are not distinguished
    from the commandments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The counsels of a wise friend are of great
    use, according to Prov. (27:9): "Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart:
    and the good counsels of a friend rejoice the soul." But Christ is our
    wisest and greatest friend. Therefore His counsels are supremely useful and
    becoming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The difference between a counsel and a
    commandment is that a commandment implies obligation, whereas a counsel is
    left to the option of the one to whom it is given. Consequently in the New
    Law, which is the law of liberty, counsels are added to the commandments,
    and not in the Old Law, which is the law of bondage. We must therefore
    understand the commandments of the New Law to have been given about matters
    that are necessary to gain the end of eternal bliss, to which end the New
    Law brings us forthwith: but that the counsels are about matters that render
    the gaining of this end more assured and expeditious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now man is placed between the things of this world, and spiritual goods
    wherein eternal happiness consists: so that the more he cleaves to the one,
    the more he withdraws from the other, and conversely. Wherefore he that
    cleaves wholly to the things of this world, so as to make them his end, and
    to look upon them as the reason and rule of all he does, falls away
    altogether from spiritual goods. Hence this disorder is removed by the
    commandments. Nevertheless, for man to gain the end aforesaid, he does not
    need to renounce the things of the world altogether: since he can, while
    using the things of this world, attain to eternal happiness, provided he
    does not place his end in them: but he will attain more speedily thereto by
    giving up the goods of this world entirely: wherefore the evangelical
    counsels are given for this purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the goods of this world which come into use in human life, consist in
    three things: viz. in external wealth pertaining to the "concupiscence of
    the eyes"; carnal pleasures pertaining to the "concupiscence of the flesh";
    and honors, which pertain to the "pride of life," according to 1 Jn. 2:16:
    and it is in renouncing these altogether, as far as possible, that the
    evangelical counsels consist. Moreover, every form of the religious life
    that professes the state of perfection is based on these three: since riches
    are renounced by poverty; carnal pleasures by perpetual chastity; and the
    pride of life by the bondage of obedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now if a man observe these absolutely, this is in accordance with the
    counsels as they stand. But if a man observe any one of them in a particular
    case, this is taking that counsel in a restricted sense, namely, as applying
    to that particular case. For instance, when anyone gives an alms to a poor
    man, not being bound so to do, he follows the counsels in that particular
    case. In like manner, when a man for some fixed time refrains from carnal
    pleasures that he may give himself to prayer, he follows the counsel for
    that particular time. And again, when a man follows not his will as to some
    deed which he might do lawfully, he follows the counsel in that particular
    case: for instance, if he do good to his enemies when he is not bound to, or
    if he forgive an injury of which he might justly seek to be avenged. In this
    way, too, all particular counsels may be reduced to these three general and
    perfect counsels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The aforesaid counsels, considered in
    themselves, are expedient to all; but owing to some people being
    ill-disposed, it happens that some of them are inexpedient, because their
    disposition is not inclined to such things. Hence Our Lord, in proposing the
    evangelical counsels, always makes mention of man's fitness for observing
    the counsels. For in giving the counsel of perpetual poverty (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A21"
      >Mt. 19:21</a
    >), He begins with the words: "If thou wilt be perfect," and then He adds:
    "Go, sell all [Vulg.: 'what'] thou hast." In like manner when He gave the
    counsel of perpetual chastity, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A12"
      >Mt. 19:12</a
    >): "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
    heaven," He adds straightway: "He that can take, let him take it." And
    again, the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A35"
      >1 Cor. 7:35</a
    >), after giving the counsel of virginity, says: "And this I speak for your
    profit; not to cast a snare upon you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The greater goods are not definitely
    fixed in the individual; but those which are simply and absolutely the
    greater good in general are fixed: and to these all the above particular
    goods may be reduced, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even the counsel of obedience is
    understood to have been given by Our Lord in the words: "And [let him]
    follow Me." For we follow Him not only by imitating His works, but also by
    obeying His commandments, according to Jn. 10:27: "My sheep hear My voice...
    and they follow Me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those things which Our Lord prescribed
    about the true love of our enemies, and other similar sayings (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5;+Lk++6"
      >Mt. 5; Lk. 6</a
    >), may be referred to the preparation of the mind, and then they are
    necessary for salvation; for instance, that man be prepared to do good to
    his enemies, and other similar actions, when there is need. Hence these
    things are placed among the precepts. But that anyone should actually and
    promptly behave thus towards an enemy when there is no special need, is to
    be referred to the particular counsels, as stated above. As to those matters
    which are set down in Mt. 10 and Lk. 9 and 10, they were either disciplinary
    commands for that particular time, or concessions, as stated above (<a
      href="FS108.html#FSQ108A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 3). Hence they are not set down among the counsels.<br />
