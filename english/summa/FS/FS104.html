<H3 Align="Center">OF THE JUDICIAL PRECEPTS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the judicial precepts: and first of all we shall 
consider them in general; in the second place we shall consider their 
reasons. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS104.html#FSQ104A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is meant by the judicial precepts?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS104.html#FSQ104A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they are figurative?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS104.html#FSQ104A3THEP1">(3)</a> Their duration;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS104.html#FSQ104A4THEP1">(4)</a> Their division.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judicial precepts were those which directed man in relation to his neighbor?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts were not those which 
directed man in his relations to his neighbor. For judicial precepts take 
their name from "judgment." But there are many things that direct man as 
to his neighbor, which are not subordinate to judgment. Therefore the 
judicial precepts were not those which directed man in his relations to 
his neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the judicial precepts are distinct from the moral 
precepts, as stated above (<A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But there are many moral 
precepts which direct man as to his neighbor: as is evidently the case 
with the seven precepts of the second table. Therefore the judicial 
precepts are not so called from directing man as to his neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the ceremonial precepts relate to God, so do the 
judicial precepts relate to one's neighbor, as stated above (<A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>, <A Href="FS101.html#FSQ101A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But among the ceremonial precepts there are some which 
concern man himself, such as observances in matter of food and apparel, 
of which we have already spoken (<A Href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1">Question [102]</a>, <A Href="FS102.html#FSQ102A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1,6). Therefore the 
judicial precepts are not so called from directing man as to his neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned (Ezech. 18:8) among other works of a 
good and just man, that "he hath executed true judgment between man and 
man." But judicial precepts are so called from "judgment." Therefore it 
seems that the judicial precepts were those which directed the relations 
between man and man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is evident from what we have stated above (<A Href="FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>, <A Href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>, <A Href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), in every law, some precepts derive their binding force 
from the dictate of reason itself, because natural reason dictates that 
something ought to be done or to be avoided. These are called "moral" 
precepts: since human morals are based on reason. At the same time there 
are other precepts which derive their binding force, not from the very 
dictate of reason (because, considered in themselves, they do not imply 
an obligation of something due or undue); but from some institution, 
Divine or human: and such are certain determinations of the moral 
precepts. When therefore the moral precepts are fixed by Divine 
institution in matters relating to man's subordination to God, they are 
called "ceremonial" precepts: but when they refer to man's relations to 
other men, they are called "judicial" precepts. Hence there are two 
conditions attached to the judicial precepts: viz. first, that they refer 
to man's relations to other men; secondly, that they derive their binding 
force not from reason alone, but in virtue of their institution.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Judgments emanate through the official pronouncement of 
certain men who are at the head of affairs, and in whom the judicial 
power is vested. Now it belongs to those who are at the head of affairs 
to regulate not only litigious matters, but also voluntary contracts 
which are concluded between man and man, and whatever matters concern the 
community at large and the government thereof. Consequently the judicial 
precepts are not only those which concern actions at law; but also all 
those that are directed to the ordering of one man in relation to 
another, which ordering is subject to the direction of the sovereign as 
supreme judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument holds in respect of those precepts which 
direct man in his relations to his neighbor, and derive their  binding 
force from the mere dictate of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even in those precepts which direct us to God, some are 
moral precepts, which the reason itself dictates when it is quickened by 
faith; such as that God is to be loved and worshipped. There are also 
ceremonial precepts, which have no binding force except in virtue of 
their Divine institution. Now God is concerned not only with the 
sacrifices that are offered to Him, but also with whatever relates to the 
fitness of those who offer sacrifices to Him and worship Him. Because men 
are ordained to God as to their end; wherefore it concerns God and, 
consequently, is a matter of ceremonial precept, that man should show 
some fitness for the divine worship. On the other hand, man is not 
ordained to his neighbor as to his end, so as to need to be disposed in 
himself with regard to his neighbor, for such is the relationship of a 
slave to his master, since a slave "is his master's in all that he is," 
as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2). Hence there are no judicial 
precepts ordaining man in himself; all such precepts are moral: because 
the reason, which is the principal in moral matters, holds the same 
position, in man, with regard to things that concern him, as a prince or 
judge holds in the state. Nevertheless we must take note that, since the 
relations of man to his neighbor are more subject to reason than the 
relations of man to God, there are more precepts whereby man is directed 
in his relations to his neighbor, than whereby he is directed to God. For 
the same reason there had to be more ceremonial than judicial precepts in 
the Law.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judicial precepts were figurative?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts were not figurative. 
Because it seems proper to the ceremonial precepts to be instituted as 
figures of something else. Therefore, if the judicial precepts are 
figurative, there will be no difference between the judicial and 
ceremonial precepts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as certain judicial precepts were given to the 
Jewish people, so also were some given to other heathen peoples. But the 
judicial precepts given to other peoples were not figurative, but stated 
what had to be done. Therefore it seems that neither were the judicial 
precepts of the Old Law figures of anything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those things which relate to the divine worship had to 
be taught under certain figures, because the things of God are above our 
reason, as stated above (<A Href="FS101.html#FSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>, <A Href="FS101.html#FSQ101A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). But things concerning our 
neighbor are not above our reason. Therefore the judicial precepts which 
direct us in relation to our neighbor should not have been figurative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The judicial precepts are expounded both in the 
allegorical and in the moral sense (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21">Ex. 21</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A precept may be figurative in two ways. First,  
primarily and in itself: because, to wit, it is instituted principally 
that it may be the figure of something. In this way the ceremonial 
precepts are figurative; since they were instituted for the very purpose 
that they might foreshadow something relating to the worship of God and 
the mystery of Christ. But some precepts are figurative, not primarily 
and in themselves, but consequently. In this way the judicial precepts of 
the Old Law are figurative. For they were not instituted for the purpose 
of being figurative, but in order that they might regulate the state of 
that people according to justice and equity. Nevertheless they did 
foreshadow something consequently: since, to wit, the entire state of 
that people, who were directed by these precepts, was figurative, 
according to 1 Cor. 10:11: "All . . . things happened to them in figure."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The ceremonial precepts are not figurative in the same way 
as the judicial precepts, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Jewish people were chosen by God that Christ might be 
born of them. Consequently the entire state of that people had to be 
prophetic and figurative, as Augustine states (Contra Faust. xxii, 24). 
For this reason even the judicial precepts that were given to this people 
were more figurative that those which were given to other nations. Thus, 
too, the wars and deeds of this people are expounded in the mystical 
sense: but not the wars and deeds of the Assyrians or Romans, although 
the latter are more famous in the eyes of men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In this people the direction of man in regard to his 
neighbor, considered in itself, was subject to reason. But in so far as 
it was referred to the worship of God, it was above reason: and in this 
respect it was figurative.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judicial precepts of the Old Law bind for ever?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts of the Old Law bind for 
ever. Because the judicial precepts relate to the virtue of justice: 
since a judgment is an execution of the virtue of justice. Now "justice 
is perpetual and immortal" (Wis. 1:15). Therefore the judicial precepts 
bind for ever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Divine institutions are more enduring than human 
institutions. But the judicial precepts of human laws bind for ever. 
Therefore much more do the judicial precepts of the Divine Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7%3A18">Heb. 7:18</a>) that "there is a setting 
aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and 
unprofitableness thereof." Now this is true of the ceremonial precept, 
which "could [Vulg.: 'can'] not, as to the conscience, make him perfect 
that serveth only in meats and in drinks, and divers washings and 
justices of the flesh," as the Apostle declares (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++9%3A9,10">Heb. 9:9,10</a>). On the 
other hand, the judicial precepts were useful  and efficacious in respect 
of the purpose for which they were instituted, viz. to establish justice 
and equity among men. Therefore the judicial precepts of the Old Law are 
not set aside, but still retain their efficacy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7%3A12">Heb. 7:12</a>) that "the priesthood being 
translated it is necessary that a translation also be made of the Law." 
But the priesthood was transferred from Aaron to Christ. Therefore the 
entire Law was also transferred. Therefore the judicial precepts are no 
longer in force.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The judicial precepts did not bind for ever, but were 
annulled by the coming of Christ: yet not in the same way as the 
ceremonial precepts. For the ceremonial precepts were annulled so far as 
to be not only "dead," but also deadly to those who observe them since 
the coming of Christ, especially since the promulgation of the Gospel. On 
the other hand, the judicial precepts are dead indeed, because they have 
no binding force: but they are not deadly. For if a sovereign were to 
order these judicial precepts to be observed in his kingdom, he would not 
sin: unless perchance they were observed, or ordered to be observed, as 
though they derived their binding force through being institutions of the 
Old Law: for it would be a deadly sin to intend to observe them thus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this difference may be gathered from what has been said 
above (<A Href="FS104.html#FSQ104A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). For it has been stated that the ceremonial precepts are 
figurative primarily and in themselves, as being instituted chiefly for 
the purpose of foreshadowing the mysteries of Christ to come. On the 
other hand, the judicial precepts were not instituted that they might be 
figures, but that they might shape the state of that people who were 
directed to Christ. Consequently, when the state of that people changed 
with the coming of Christ, the judicial precepts lost their binding 
force: for the Law was a pedagogue, leading men to Christ, as stated in 
Gal. 3:24. Since, however, these judicial precepts are instituted, not 
for the purpose of being figures, but for the performance of certain 
deeds, the observance thereof is not prejudicial to the truth of faith. 
But the intention of observing them, as though one were bound by the Law, 
is prejudicial to the truth of faith: because it would follow that the 
former state of the people still lasts, and that Christ has not yet come.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The obligation of observing justice is indeed perpetual. 
But the determination of those things that are just, according to human 
or Divine institution, must needs be different, according to the 
different states of mankind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The judicial precepts established by men retain their 
binding force for ever, so long as the state of government remains the 
same. But if the state or nation pass to another form of government, the 
laws must needs be changed. For democracy, which is government by the 
people, demands different laws from those of oligarchy, which is 
government by the rich, as the Philosopher  shows (Polit. iv, 1). 
Consequently when the state of that people changed, the judicial precepts 
had to be changed also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those judicial precepts directed the people to justice and 
equity, in keeping with the demands of that state. But after the coming 
of Christ, there had to be a change in the state of that people, so that 
in Christ there was no distinction between Gentile and Jew, as there had 
been before. For this reason the judicial precepts needed to be changed 
also.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is possible to assign a distinct division of the judicial precepts?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is impossible to assign a distinct division 
of the judicial precepts. Because the judicial precepts direct men in 
their relations to one another. But those things which need to be 
directed, as pertaining to the relationship between man and man, and 
which are made use of by men, are not subject to division, since they are 
infinite in number. Therefore it is not possible to assign a distinct 
division of the judicial precepts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the judicial precepts are decisions on moral matters. 
But moral precepts do not seem to be capable of division, except in so 
far as they are reducible to the precepts of the decalogue. Therefore 
there is no distinct division of the judicial precepts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, because there is a distinct division of the ceremonial 
precepts, the Law alludes to this division, by describing some as 
"sacrifices," others as "observances." But the Law contains no allusion 
to a division of the judicial precepts. Therefore it seems that they have 
no distinct division.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Wherever there is order there must needs be division. 
But the notion of order is chiefly applicable to the judicial precepts, 
since thereby that people was ordained. Therefore it is most necessary 
that they should have a distinct division.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since law is the art, as it were, of directing or 
ordering the life of man, as in every art there is a distinct division in 
the rules of art, so, in every law, there must be a distinct division of 
precepts: else the law would be rendered useless by confusion. We must 
therefore say that the judicial precepts of the Old Law, whereby men were 
directed in their relations to one another, are subject to division 
according to the divers ways in which man is directed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in every people a fourfold order is to be found: one, of the 
people's sovereign to his subjects; a second of the subjects among 
themselves; a third, of the citizens to foreigners; a fourth, of members 
of the same household, such as the order of the father  to his son; of 
the wife to her husband; of the master to his servant: and according to 
these four orders we may distinguish different kinds of judicial precepts 
in the Old Law. For certain precepts are laid down concerning the 
institution of the sovereign and relating to his office, and about the 
respect due to him: this is one part of the judicial precepts. Again, 
certain precepts are given in respect of a man to his fellow citizens: 
for instance, about buying and selling, judgments and penalties: this is 
the second part of the judicial precepts. Again, certain precepts are 
enjoined with regard to foreigners: for instance, about wars waged 
against their foes, and about the way to receive travelers and strangers: 
this is the third part of the judicial precepts. Lastly, certain precepts 
are given relating to home life: for instance, about servants, wives and 
children: this is the fourth part of the judicial precepts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[104] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Things pertaining to the ordering of relations between one 
man and another are indeed infinite in number: yet they are reducible to 
certain distinct heads, according to the different relations in which one 
man stands to another, as stated above.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The precepts of the decalogue held the first place in the 
moral order, as stated above (<A Href="FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>, <A Href="FS100.html#FSQ100A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and consequently it is 
fitting that other moral precepts should be distinguished in relation to 
them. But the judicial and ceremonial precepts have a different binding 
force, derived, not from natural reason, but from their institution 
alone. Hence there is a distinct reason for distinguishing them.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Law alludes to the division of the judicial precepts in 
the very things themselves which are prescribed by the judicial precepts 
of the Law.<br>
