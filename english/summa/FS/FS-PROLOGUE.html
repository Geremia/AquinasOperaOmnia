  <p>
    Since, as Damascene states (De Fide Orth. ii, 12), man is said to be made in
    God's image, in so far as the image implies "an intelligent being endowed
    with free-will and self-movement": now that we have treated of the exemplar,
    i.e. God, and of those things which came forth from the power of God in
    accordance with His will; it remains for us to treat of His image, i.e. man,
    inasmuch as he too is the principle of his actions, as having free-will and
    control of his actions.<br />
