<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, as Damascene states (De Fide Orth. ii, 12), man is said to be 
made in God's image, in so far as the image implies "an intelligent being 
endowed with free-will and self-movement": now that we have treated of 
the exemplar, i.e. God, and of those things which came forth from the 
power of God in accordance with His will; it remains for us to treat of 
His image, i.e. man, inasmuch as he too is the principle of his actions, 
as having free-will and control of his actions.<br>
