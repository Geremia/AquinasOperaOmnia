  <h3 align="center">OF THE MEAN OF VIRTUE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the properties of virtues: and (1) the mean of virtue,
    (2) the connection between virtues, (3) equality of virtues, (4) the
    duration of virtues. Under the first head there are four points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether moral virtue observes the
    mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the mean of moral virtue
    is the real mean or the rational mean?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the intellectual virtues
    observe the mean?
  </p>

    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the theological virtues
    do?

  <h3 align="left">Whether moral virtues observe the mean?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that moral virtue does not observe
    the mean. For the nature of a mean is incompatible with that which is
    extreme. Now the nature of virtue is to be something extreme; for it is
    stated in De Coelo i that "virtue is the limit of power." Therefore moral
    virtue does not observe the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the maximum is not a mean. Now some
    moral virtues tend to a maximum: for instance, magnanimity to very great
    honors, and magnificence to very large expenditure, as stated in Ethic. iv,
    2,3. Therefore not every moral virtue observes the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it is essential to a moral virtue to
    observe the mean, it follows that a moral virtue is not perfected, but the
    contrary corrupted, through tending to something extreme. Now some moral
    virtues are perfected by tending to something extreme; thus virginity, which
    abstains from all sexual pleasure, observes the extreme, and is the most
    perfect chastity: and to give all to the poor is the most perfect mercy or
    liberality. Therefore it seems that it is not essential to moral virtue that
    it should observe the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6) that
    "moral virtue is a habit of choosing the mean."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As already explained (<a
      href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the nature of virtue
    is that it should direct man to good. Now moral virtue is properly a
    perfection of the appetitive part of the soul in regard to some determinate
    matter: and the measure or rule of the appetitive movement in respect of
    appetible objects is the reason. But the good of that which is measured or
    ruled consists in its conformity with its rule: thus the good things made by
    art is that they follow the rule of art. Consequently, in things of this
    sort, evil consists in discordance from their rule or measure. Now this may
    happen either by their exceeding the measure or by their falling short of
    it; as is clearly the case in all things ruled or measured. Hence it is
    evident that the good of moral virtue consists in conformity with the rule
    of reason. Now it is clear that between excess and deficiency the mean is
    equality or conformity. Therefore it is evident that moral virtue observes
    the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Moral virtue derives goodness from the
    rule of reason, while its matter consists in passions or operations. If
    therefore we compare moral virtue to reason, then, if we look at that which
    is has of reason, it holds the position of one extreme, viz. conformity;
    while excess and defect take the position of the other extreme, viz.
    deformity. But if we consider moral virtue in respect of its matter, then it
    holds the position of mean, in so far as it makes the passion conform to the
    rule of reason. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "virtue, as
    to its essence, is a mean state," in so far as the rule of virtue is imposed
    on its proper matter: "but it is an extreme in reference to the 'best' and
    the 'excellent,'" viz. as to its conformity with reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In actions and passions the mean and the
    extremes depend on various circumstances: hence nothing hinders something
    from being extreme in a particular virtue as to one circumstance, while the
    same thing is a mean in respect of other circumstances, through being in
    conformity with reason. This is the case with magnanimity and magnificence.
    For if we look at the absolute quantity of the respective objects of these
    virtues, we shall call it an extreme and a maximum: but if we consider the
    quantity in relation to other circumstances, then it has the character of a
    mean: since these virtues tend to this maximum in accordance with the rule
    of reason, i.e. "where" it is right, "when" it is right, and for an "end"
    that is right. There will be excess, if one tends to this maximum "when" it
    is not right, or "where" it is not right, or for an undue "end"; and there
    will be deficiency if one fails to tend thereto "where" one ought, and
    "when" one aught. This agrees with the saying of the Philosopher (Ethic. iv,
    3) that the "magnanimous man observes the extreme in quantity, but the mean
    in the right mode of his action."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same is to be said of virginity and
    poverty as of magnanimity. For virginity abstains from all sexual matters,
    and poverty from all wealth, for a right end, and in a right manner, i.e.
    according to God's word, and for the sake of eternal life. But if this be
    done in an undue manner, i.e. out of unlawful superstition, or again for
    vainglory, it will be in excess. And if it be not done when it ought to be
    done, or as it ought to be done, it is a vice by deficiency: for instance,
    in those who break their vows of virginity or poverty.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the mean of moral virtue is the real mean, or the rational mean?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the mean of moral virtue is
    not the rational mean, but the real mean. For the good of moral virtue
    consists in its observing the mean. Now, good, as stated in Metaph. ii,
    text. 8, is in things themselves. Therefore the mean of moral virtue is a
    real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the reason is a power of apprehension.
    But moral virtue does not observe a mean between apprehensions, but rather a
    mean between operations or passions. Therefore the mean of moral virtue is
    not the rational, but the real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a mean that is observed according to
    arithmetical or geometrical proportion is a real mean. Now such is the mean
    of justice, as stated in Ethic. v, 3. Therefore the mean of moral virtue is
    not the rational, but the real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6) that
    "moral virtue observes the mean fixed, in our regard, by reason."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The rational mean can be understood in two
    ways. First, according as the mean is observed in the act itself of reason,
    as though the very act of reason were made to observe the mean: in this
    sense, since moral virtue perfects not the act of reason, but the act of the
    appetitive power, the mean of moral virtue is not the rational mean.
    Secondly, the mean of reason may be considered as that which the reason puts
    into some particular matter. In this sense every mean of moral virtue is a
    rational mean, since, as above stated (<a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), moral virtue is said to observe the mean, through conformity with right
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it happens sometimes that the rational mean is also the real mean: in
    which case the mean of moral virtue is the real mean, for instance, in
    justice. On the other hand, sometimes the rational mean is not the real
    mean, but is considered in relation to us: and such is the mean in all the
    other moral virtues. The reason for this is that justice is about
    operations, which deal with external things, wherein the right has to be
    established simply and absolutely, as stated above (<a
      href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): wherefore the
    rational mean in justice is the same as the real mean, in so far, to wit as
    justice gives to each one his due, neither more nor less. But the other
    moral virtues deal with interior passions wherein the right cannot be
    established in the same way, since men are variously situated in relation to
    their passions; hence the rectitude of reason has to be established in the
    passions, with due regard to us, who are moved in respect of the
    passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two arguments
    take the rational mean as being in the very act of reason, while the third
    argues from the mean of justice.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the intellectual virtues observe the mean?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the intellectual virtues do
    not observe the mean. Because moral virtue observes the mean by conforming
    to the rule of reason. But the intellectual virtues are in reason itself, so
    that they seem to have no higher rule. Therefore the intellectual virtues do
    not observe the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the mean of moral virtue is fixed by an
    intellectual virtue: for it is stated in Ethic. ii, 6, that "virtue observes
    the mean appointed by reason, as a prudent man would appoint it." If
    therefore intellectual virtue also observe the mean, this mean will have to
    be appointed for them by another virtue, so that there would be an
    indefinite series of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a mean is, properly speaking, between
    contraries, as the Philosopher explains (Metaph. x, text. 22,23). But there
    seems to be no contrariety in the intellect; since contraries themselves, as
    they are in the intellect, are not in opposition to one another, but are
    understood together, as white and black, healthy and sick. Therefore there
    is no mean in the intellectual virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Art is an intellectual virtue; and yet there
    is a mean in art (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore also intellectual virtue observes
    the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The good of anything consists in its observing
    the mean, by conforming with a rule or measure in respect of which it may
    happen to be excessive or deficient, as stated above (<a
      href="FS064.html#FSQ64A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now intellectual virtue, like moral virtue, is directed to the good, as
    stated above (<a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence the good of an
    intellectual virtue consists in observing the mean, in so far as it is
    subject to a measure. Now the good of intellectual virtue is the true; in
    the case of contemplative virtue, it is the true taken absolutely (Ethic.
    vi, 2); in the case of practical virtue, it is the true in conformity with a
    right appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now truth apprehended by our intellect, if we consider it absolutely, is
    measured by things; since things are the measure of our intellect, as stated
    in Metaph. x, text. 5; because there is truth in what we think or say,
    according as the thing is so or not. Accordingly the good of speculative
    intellectual virtue consists in a certain mean, by way of conformity with
    things themselves, in so far as the intellect expresses them as being what
    they are, or as not being what they are not: and it is in this that the
    nature of truth consists. There will be excess if something false is
    affirmed, as though something were, which in reality it is not: and there
    will be deficiency if something is falsely denied, and declared not to be,
    whereas in reality it is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The truth of practical intellectual virtue, if we consider it in relation to
    things, is by way of that which is measured; so that both in practical and
    in speculative intellectual virtues, the mean consists in conformity with
    things. But if we consider it in relation to the appetite, it has the
    character of a rule and measure. Consequently the rectitude of reason is the
    mean of moral virtue, and also the mean of prudence---of prudence as ruling
    and measuring, of moral virtue, as ruled and measured by that mean. In like
    manner the difference between excess and deficiency is to be applied in both
    cases.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Intellectual virtues also have their
    measure, as stated, and they observe the mean according as they conform to
    that measure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no need for an indefinite
    series of virtues: because the measure and rule of intellectual virtue is
    not another kind of virtue, but things themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The things themselves that are contrary
    have no contrariety in the mind, because one is the reason for knowing the
    other: nevertheless there is in the intellect contrariety of affirmation and
    negation, which are contraries, as stated at the end of Peri Hermenias. For
    though "to be" and "not to be" are not in contrary, but in contradictory
    opposition to one another, so long as we consider their signification in
    things themselves, for on the one hand we have "being" and on the other we
    have simply "non-being"; yet if we refer them to the act of the mind, there
    is something positive in both cases. Hence "to be" and "not to be" are
    contradictory: but the opinion stating that "good is good" is contrary to
    the opinion stating that "good is not good": and between two such contraries
    intellectual virtue observes the mean.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the theological virtues observe the mean?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that theological virtue observes
    the mean. For the good of other virtues consists in their observing the
    mean. Now the theological virtues surpass the others in goodness. Therefore
    much more does theological virtue observe the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the mean of moral virtue depends on the
    appetite being ruled by reason; while the mean of intellectual virtue
    consists in the intellect being measured by things. Now theological virtue
    perfects both intellect and appetite, as stated above (<a
      href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore theological
    virtue also observes the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope, which is a theological virtue, is
    a mean between despair and presumption. Likewise faith holds a middle course
    between contrary heresies, as Boethius states (De Duab. Natur. vii): thus,
    by confessing one Person and two natures in Christ, we observe the mean
    between the heresy of Nestorius, who maintained the existence of two persons
    and two natures, and the heresy of Eutyches, who held to one person and one
    nature. Therefore theological virtue observes the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Wherever virtue observes the mean it is
    possible to sin by excess as well as by deficiency. But there is no sinning
    by excess against God, Who is the object of theological virtue: for it is
    written (Ecclus. 43:33): "Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as you can:
    for He is above all praise." Therefore theological virtue does not observe
    the mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS064.html#FSQ64A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the mean of virtue depends on conformity with virtue's rule or measure,
    in so far as one may exceed or fall short of that rule. Now the measure of
    theological virtue may be twofold. One is taken from the very nature of
    virtue, and thus the measure and rule of theological virtue is God Himself:
    because our faith is ruled according to Divine truth; charity, according to
    His goodness; hope, according to the immensity of His omnipotence and loving
    kindness. This measure surpasses all human power: so that never can we love
    God as much as He ought to be loved, nor believe and hope in Him as much as
    we should. Much less therefore can there be excess in such things.
    Accordingly the good of such virtues does not consist in a mean, but
    increases the more we approach to the summit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other rule or measure of theological virtue is by comparison with us:
    for although we cannot be borne towards God as much as we ought, yet we
    should approach to Him by believing, hoping and loving, according to the
    measure of our condition. Consequently it is possible to find a mean and
    extremes in theological virtue, accidentally and in reference to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The good of intellectual and moral
    virtues consists in a mean of reason by conformity with a measure that may
    be exceeded: whereas this is not so in the case of theological virtue,
    considered in itself, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Moral and intellectual virtues perfect
    our intellect and appetite in relation to a created measure and rule;
    whereas the theological virtues perfect them in relation to an uncreated
    rule and measure. Wherefore the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope observes the mean between
    presumption and despair, in relation to us, in so far, to wit, as a man is
    said to be presumptuous, through hoping to receive from God a good in excess
    of his condition; or to despair through failing to hope for that which
    according to his condition he might hope for. But there can be no excess of
    hope in comparison with God, Whose goodness is infinite. In like manner
    faith holds a middle course between contrary heresies, not by comparison
    with its object, which is God, in Whom we cannot believe too much; but in so
    far as human opinion itself takes a middle position between contrary
    opinions, as was explained above.<br />
