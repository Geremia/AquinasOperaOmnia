<H3 Align="Center">OF DELIGHT CONSIDERED IN ITSELF [*Or, Pleasure] (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider delight and sadness. Concerning delight four things 
must be considered: (1) Delight in itself; (2) The causes of delight; (3) 
Its effects; (4) Its goodness and malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether delight is a passion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether delight is subject to time?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it differs from joy?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of the delights of the higher appetite compared with the delight of 
the lower;<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of sensible delights compared with one another;

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that delight is not a passion. For Damascene (De 
Fide Orth. ii, 22) distinguishes operation from passion, and says that 
"operation is a movement in accord with nature, while passion is a 
movement contrary to nature." But delight is an operation, according to 
the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 12; x, 5). Therefore delight is not a 
passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "To be passive is to be moved," as stated in Phys. iii, 
3. But delight does not consist in being moved, but in having been moved; 
for it arises from good already gained. Therefore delight is not a 
passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, delight is a kind of a perfection of the one who is 
delighted; since it "perfects operation," as stated in Ethic. x, 4,5. But 
to be perfected does not consist in being passive or in being altered, as 
stated in Phys. vii, 3 and De Anima ii, 5. Therefore delight is not a 
passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Civ. Dei ix, 2; xiv, 5 seqq) reckons 
delight, joy, or gladness among the other passions of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The movements of the sensitive appetite, are properly 
called passions, as stated above (<A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>, <A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now every emotion arising 
from a sensitive apprehension, is a movement of the sensitive appetite: 
and this must needs be said of delight, since, according to the 
Philosopher (Rhet. i, 11) "delight is a certain movement of the soul and 
a sensible establishing thereof all at  once, in keeping with the nature 
of the thing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to understand this, we must observe that just as in natural 
things some happen to attain to their natural perfections, so does this 
happen in animals. And though movement towards perfection does not occur 
all at once, yet the attainment of natural perfection does occur all at 
once. Now there is this difference between animals and other natural 
things, that when these latter are established in the state becoming 
their nature, they do not perceive it, whereas animals do. And from this 
perception there arises a certain movement of the soul in the sensitive 
appetite; which movement is called delight. Accordingly by saying that 
delight is "a movement of the soul," we designate its genus. By saying 
that it is "an establishing in keeping with the thing's nature," i.e. 
with that which exists in the thing, we assign the cause of delight, viz. 
the presence of a becoming good. By saying that this establishing is "all 
at once," we mean that this establishing is to be understood not as in 
the process of establishment, but as in the fact of complete 
establishment, in the term of the movement, as it were: for delight is 
not a "becoming" as Plato [*Phileb. 32,33] maintained, but a "complete 
fact," as stated in Ethic. vii, 12. Lastly, by saying that this 
establishing is "sensible," we exclude the perfections of insensible 
things wherein there is no delight. It is therefore evident that, since 
delight is a movement of the animal appetite arising from an apprehension 
of sense, it is a passion of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Connatural operation, which is unhindered, is a second 
perfection, as stated in De Anima ii, 1: and therefore when a thing is 
established in its proper connatural and unhindered operation, delight 
follows, which consists in a state of completion, as observed above. 
Accordingly when we say that delight is an operation, we designate, not 
its essence, but its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A twofold movement is to be observed in an animal: one, 
according to the intention of the end, and this belongs to the appetite; 
the other, according to the execution, and this belongs to the external 
operation. And so, although in him who has already gained the good in 
which he delights, the movement of execution ceases, by which the tends 
to the end; yet the movement of the appetitive faculty does not cease, 
since, just as before it desired that which it had not, so afterwards 
does it delight in that which is possesses. For though delight is a 
certain repose of the appetite, if we consider the presence of the 
pleasurable good that satisfies the appetite, nevertheless there remains 
the impression made on the appetite by its object, by reason of which 
delight is a kind of movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the name of passion is more appropriate to those 
passions which have a corruptive and evil tendency, such as bodily 
ailments, as also sadness and fear in the soul; yet some passions have a 
tendency to something good, as stated above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4): and in this 
sense delight is called a passion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether delight is in time?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that delight is in time. For "delight is a kind of 
movement," as the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 11). But all movement is in 
time. Therefore delight is in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing is said to last long and to be morose in respect 
of time. But some pleasures are called morose. Therefore pleasure is in 
time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the passions of the soul are of one same genus. But some 
passions of the soul are in time. Therefore delight is too.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that "no one takes 
pleasure according to time."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be in time in two ways: first, by itself; 
secondly, by reason of something else, and accidentally as it were. For 
since time is the measure of successive things, those things are of 
themselves said to be in time, to which succession or something 
pertaining to succession is essential: such are movement, repose, speech 
and such like. On the other hand, those things are said to be in time, by 
reason of something else and not of themselves, to which succession is 
not essential, but which are subject to something successive. Thus the 
fact of being a man is not essentially something successive; since it is 
not a movement, but the term of a movement or change, viz. of this being 
begotten: yet, because human being is subject to changeable causes, in 
this respect, to be a man is in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, we must say that delight, of itself indeed, is not in time: 
for it regards good already gained, which is, as it were, the term of the 
movement. But if this good gained be subject to change, the delight 
therein will be in time accidentally: whereas if it be altogether 
unchangeable, the delight therein will not be in time, either by reason 
of itself or accidentally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated in De Anima iii, 7, movement is twofold. One is 
"the act of something imperfect, i.e. of something existing in 
potentiality, as such": this movement is successive and is in time. 
Another movement is "the act of something perfect, i.e. of something 
existing in act," e.g. to understand, to feel, and to will and such like, 
also to have delight. This movement is not successive, nor is it of 
itself in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Delight is said to be long lasting or morose, according as 
it is accidentally in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Other passions have not for their object a good obtained, 
as delight has. Wherefore there is more of the movement of the imperfect 
in them than in delight. And consequently it belongs more to delight not 
to be in time.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether delight differs from joy?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that delight is altogether the same as joy. Because 
the passions of the soul differ according to their objects. But delight 
and joy have the same object, namely, a good obtained. Therefore joy is 
altogether the same as delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one movement does not end in two terms. But one and the 
same movement, that of desire, ends in joy and delight. Therefore delight 
and joy are altogether the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if joy differs from delight, it seems that there is 
equal reason for distinguishing gladness, exultation, and cheerfulness 
from delight, so that they would all be various passions of the soul. But 
this seems to be untrue. Therefore joy does not differ from delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We do not speak of joy in irrational animals; whereas 
we do speak of delight in them. Therefore joy is not the same as delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Joy, as Avicenna states (De Anima iv), is a kind of 
delight. For we must observe that, just as some concupiscences are 
natural, and some not natural, but consequent to reason, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), so also some delights are natural, and some are not 
natural but rational. Or, as Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 13) and Gregory 
of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xviii.] put it, "some delights are of 
the body, some are of the soul"; which amounts to the same. For we take 
delight both in those things which we desire naturally, when we get them, 
and in those things which we desire as a result of reason. But we do not 
speak of joy except when delight follows reason; and so we do not ascribe 
joy to irrational animals, but only delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now whatever we desire naturally, can also be the object of reasoned 
desire and delight, but not vice versa. Consequently whatever can be the 
object of delight, can also be the object of joy in rational beings. And 
yet everything is not always the object of joy; since sometimes one feels 
a certain delight in the body, without rejoicing thereat according to 
reason. And accordingly delight extends to more things than does joy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the object of the appetite of the soul is an 
apprehended good, diversity of apprehension pertains, in a way, to 
diversity of the object. And so delights of the soul, which are also 
called joys, are distinct from bodily delights, which are not called 
otherwise than delights: as we have observed above in regard to 
concupiscences (<A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A like difference is to be observed in concupiscences also: 
so that delight corresponds to concupiscence, while joy corresponds to 
desire, which seems to pertain more to concupiscence of the soul. Hence 
there is a difference of repose  corresponding to the difference of 
movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These other names pertaining to delight are derived from 
the effects of delight; for "laetitia" [gladness] is derived from the 
"dilation" of the heart, as if one were to say "latitia"; "exultation" is 
derived from the exterior signs of inward delight, which appear outwardly 
in so far as the inward joy breaks forth from its bounds; and 
"cheerfulness" is so called from certain special signs and effects of 
gladness. Yet all these names seem to belong to joy; for we do not employ 
them save in speaking of rational beings.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether delight is in the intellectual appetite?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that delight is not in the intellectual appetite. 
Because the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 11) that "delight is a sensible 
movement." But sensible movement is not in an intellectual power. 
Therefore delight is not in the intellectual appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, delight is a passion. But every passion is in the 
sensitive appetite. Therefore delight is only in the sensitive appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, delight is common to us and to the irrational animals. 
Therefore it is not elsewhere than in that power which we have in common 
with irrational animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++36:4">Ps. 36:4</a>): "Delight in the Lord." But 
the sensitive appetite cannot reach to God; only the intellectual 
appetite can. Therefore delight can be in the intellectual appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a certain delight arises from the 
apprehension of the reason. Now on the reason apprehending something, not 
only the sensitive appetite is moved, as regards its application to some 
particular thing, but also the intellectual appetite, which is called the 
will. And accordingly in the intellectual appetite or will there is that 
delight which is called joy, but not bodily delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is this difference of delight in either power, that 
delight of the sensitive appetite is accompanied by a bodily 
transmutation, whereas delight of the intellectual appetite is nothing 
but the mere movement of the will. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 
6) that "desire and joy are nothing else but a volition of consent to the 
things we wish."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this definition of the Philosopher, he uses the word 
"sensible" in its wide acceptation for any kind of perception. For he 
says (Ethic. x, 4) that "delight is attendant upon every sense, as it is 
also upon every act of the intellect and contemplation." Or we may say 
that he is defining delight of the  sensitive appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Delight has the character of passion, properly speaking, 
when accompanied by bodily transmutation. It is not thus in the 
intellectual appetite, but according to simple movement: for thus it is 
also in God and the angels. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 14) 
that "God rejoices by one simple act": and Dionysius says at the end of 
De Coel. Hier., that "the angels are not susceptible to our passible 
delight, but rejoice together with God with the gladness of incorruption."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In us there is delight, not only in common with dumb 
animals, but also in common with angels. Wherefore Dionysius says (De 
Coel. Hier.) that "holy men often take part in the angelic delights." 
Accordingly we have delight, not only in the sensitive appetite, which we 
have in common with dumb animals, but also in the intellectual appetite, 
which we have in common with the angels.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that bodily and sensible pleasures are greater than 
spiritual and intelligible pleasures. For all men seek some pleasure, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. x, 2,4). But more seek sensible 
pleasures, than intelligible spiritual pleasures. Therefore bodily 
pleasures are greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greatness of a cause is known by its effect. But 
bodily pleasures have greater effects; since "they alter the state of the 
body, and in some they cause madness" (Ethic. vii, 3). Therefore bodily 
pleasures are greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, bodily pleasures need to be tempered and checked, by 
reason of their vehemence: whereas there is no need to check spiritual 
pleasures. Therefore bodily pleasures are greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118:103">Ps. 118:103</a>): "How sweet are Thy words 
to my palate; more than honey to my mouth!" And the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. x, 7) that "the greatest pleasure is derived from the operation 
of wisdom."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), pleasure arises from union with a 
suitable object perceived or known. Now, in the operations of the soul, 
especially of the sensitive and intellectual soul, it must be noted that, 
since they do not pass into outward matter, they are acts or perfections 
of the agent, e.g. to understand, to feel, to will and the like: because 
actions which pass into outward matter, are actions and perfections 
rather of the matter transformed; for "movement is the act produced by 
the mover in the thing moved" (Phys. iii, 3). Accordingly the aforesaid 
actions of the sensitive and intellectual soul, are themselves a certain 
good of the agent, and are known by sense and intellect. Wherefore from 
them also does pleasure arise, and not only from  their objects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If therefore we compare intellectual pleasures with sensible pleasures, 
according as we delight in the very actions, for instance in sensitive 
and in intellectual knowledge; without doubt intellectual pleasures are 
much greater than sensible pleasures. For man takes much more delight in 
knowing something, by understanding it, than in knowing something by 
perceiving it with his sense. Because intellectual knowledge is more 
perfect; and because it is better known, since the intellect reflects on 
its own act more than sense does. Moreover intellectual knowledge is more 
beloved: for there is no one who would not forfeit his bodily sight 
rather than his intellectual vision, as beasts or fools are deprived 
thereof, as Augustine says in De Civ. Dei (De Trin. xiv, 14).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, intellectual spiritual pleasures be compared with sensible 
bodily pleasures, then, in themselves and absolutely speaking, spiritual 
pleasures are greater. And this appears from the consideration of the 
three things needed for pleasure, viz. the good which is brought into 
conjunction, that to which it is conjoined, and the conjunction itself. 
For spiritual good is both greater and more beloved than bodily good: a 
sign whereof is that men abstain from even the greatest bodily pleasures, 
rather than suffer loss of honor which is an intellectual good. Likewise 
the intellectual faculty is much more noble and more knowing than the 
sensitive faculty. Also the conjunction is more intimate, more perfect 
and more firm. More intimate, because the senses stop at the outward 
accidents of a thing, whereas the intellect penetrates to the essence; 
for the object of the intellect is "what a thing is." More perfect, 
because the conjunction of the sensible to the sense implies movement, 
which is an imperfect act: wherefore sensible pleasures are not perceived 
all at once, but some part of them is passing away, while some other part 
is looked forward to as yet to be realized, as is manifest in pleasures 
of the table and in sexual pleasures: whereas intelligible things are 
without movement: hence pleasures of this kind are realized all at once. 
More firm; because the objects of bodily pleasure are corruptible, and 
soon pass away; whereas spiritual goods are incorruptible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, in relation to us, bodily pleasures are more 
vehement, for three reasons. First, because sensible things are more 
known to us, than intelligible things. Secondly, because sensible 
pleasures, through being passions of the sensitive appetite, are 
accompanied by some alteration in the body: whereas this does not occur 
in spiritual pleasures, save by reason of a certain reaction of the 
superior appetite on the lower. Thirdly, because bodily pleasures are 
sought as remedies for bodily defects or troubles, whence various griefs 
arise. Wherefore bodily pleasures, by reason of their succeeding griefs 
of this kind, are felt the more, and consequently are welcomed more than 
spiritual pleasures, which have no contrary griefs, as we shall state 
farther on (<A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>, <A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The reason why more seek bodily pleasures is because 
sensible goods are known better and more generally: and, again, because 
men need pleasures as remedies for many kinds of sorrow and sadness: and 
since the majority cannot attain spiritual pleasures, which are proper to 
the virtuous, hence it is that they turn aside to seek those of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Bodily transmutation arises more from bodily pleasures, 
inasmuch as they are passions of the sensitive appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Bodily pleasures are realized in the sensitive faculty 
which is governed by reason: wherefore they need to be tempered and 
checked by reason. But spiritual pleasures are in the mind, which is 
itself the rule: wherefore they are in themselves both sober and moderate.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the pleasures of touch are greater than the pleasures afforded by the other senses?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the pleasures of touch are not greater than 
the pleasures afforded by the other senses. Because the greatest pleasure 
seems to be that without which all joy is at an end. But such is the 
pleasure afforded by the sight, according to the words of Tobias 5:12: 
"What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the 
light of heaven?" Therefore the pleasure afforded by the sight is the 
greatest of sensible pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "every one finds treasure in what he loves," as the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 11). But "of all the senses the sight is loved 
most" [*Metaph. i, 1]. Therefore the greatest pleasure seems to be 
afforded by sight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the beginning of friendship which is for the sake of the 
pleasant is principally sight. But pleasure is the cause of such 
friendship. Therefore the greatest pleasure seems to be afforded by sight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10), that the 
greatest pleasures are those which are afforded by the touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1), 
everything gives pleasure according as it is loved. Now, as stated in 
Metaph. i, 1, the senses are loved for two reasons: for the purpose of 
knowledge, and on account of their usefulness. Wherefore the senses 
afford pleasure in both these ways. But because it is proper to man to 
apprehend knowledge itself as something good, it follows that the former 
pleasures of the senses, i.e. those which arise from knowledge, are 
proper to man: whereas pleasures of the senses, as loved for their 
usefulness, are common to all animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If therefore we speak of that sensible pleasure by which reason of 
knowledge, it is evident that the sight affords greater  pleasure than 
any other sense. On the other hand, if we speak of that sensible pleasure 
which is by reason of usefulness, then the greatest pleasure is afforded 
by the touch. For the usefulness of sensible things is gauged by their 
relation to the preservation of the animal's nature. Now the sensible 
objects of touch bear the closest relation to this usefulness: for the 
touch takes cognizance of those things which are vital to an animal, 
namely, of things hot and cold and the like. Wherefore in this respect, 
the pleasures of touch are greater as being more closely related to the 
end. For this reason, too, other animals which do not experience sensible 
pleasure save by reason of usefulness, derive no pleasure from the other 
senses except as subordinated to the sensible objects of the touch: "for 
dogs do not take delight in the smell of hares, but in eating them; . . . 
nor does the lion feel pleasure in the lowing of an ox, but in devouring 
it" (Ethic. iii, 10).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then the pleasure afforded by touch is the greatest in respect of 
usefulness, and the pleasure afforded by sight the greatest in respect of 
knowledge; if anyone wish to compare these two, he will find that the 
pleasure of touch is, absolutely speaking, greater than the pleasure of 
sight, so far as the latter remains within the limits of sensible 
pleasure. Because it is evident that in everything, that which is natural 
is most powerful: and it is to these pleasures of the touch that the 
natural concupiscences, such as those of food, sexual union, and the 
like, are ordained. If, however, we consider the pleasures of sight, 
inasmuch sight is the handmaid of the mind, then the pleasures of sight 
are greater, forasmuch as intellectual pleasures are greater than 
sensible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Joy, as stated above (<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), denotes pleasure of the soul; 
and this belongs principally to the sight. But natural pleasure belongs 
principally to the touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sight is loved most, "on account of knowledge, because 
it helps us to distinguish many things," as is stated in the same passage 
(Metaph. i, 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Pleasure causes carnal love in one way; the sight, in 
another. For pleasure, especially that which is afforded by the touch, is 
the final cause of the friendship which is for the sake of the pleasant: 
whereas the sight is a cause like that from which a movement has its 
beginning, inasmuch as the beholder on seeing the lovable object receives 
an impression of its image, which entices him to love it and to seek its 
delight.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any pleasure is not natural?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no pleasure is not natural. For pleasure is to 
the emotions of the soul what repose is to bodies. But the appetite of a 
natural body does not repose save in a connatural place. Neither, 
therefore, can the repose of the animal appetite, which is pleasure, be 
elsewhere than in something  connatural. Therefore no pleasure is 
non-natural.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is against nature is violent. But "whatever is 
violent causes grief" (Metaph. v, 5). Therefore nothing which is 
unnatural can give pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fact of being established in one's own nature, if 
perceived, gives rise to pleasure, as is evident from the Philosopher's 
definition quoted above (<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But it is natural to every thing to be 
established in its nature; because natural movement tends to a natural 
end. Therefore every pleasure is natural.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 5,6) that some things 
are pleasant "not from nature but from disease."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We speak of that as being natural, which is in accord 
with nature, as stated in Phys. ii, 1. Now, in man, nature can be taken 
in two ways. First, inasmuch as intellect and reason is the principal 
part of man's nature, since in respect thereof he has his own specific 
nature. And in this sense, those pleasures may be called natural to man, 
which are derived from things pertaining to man in respect of his reason: 
for instance, it is natural to man to take pleasure in contemplating the 
truth and in doing works of virtue. Secondly, nature in man may be taken 
as contrasted with reason, and as denoting that which is common to man 
and other animals, especially that part of man which does not obey 
reason. And in this sense, that which pertains to the preservation of the 
body, either as regards the individual, as food, drink, sleep, and the 
like, or as regards the species, as sexual intercourse, are said to 
afford man natural pleasure. Under each kind of pleasures, we find some 
that are "not natural" speaking absolutely, and yet "connatural" in some 
respect. For it happens in an individual that some one of the natural 
principles of the species is corrupted, so that something which is 
contrary to the specific nature, becomes accidentally natural to this 
individual: thus it is natural to this hot water to give heat. 
Consequently it happens that something which is not natural to man, 
either in regard to reason, or in regard to the preservation of the body, 
becomes connatural to this individual man, on account of there being some 
corruption of nature in him. And this corruption may be either on the 
part of the body---from some ailment; thus to a man suffering from fever, 
sweet things seem bitter, and vice versa---or from an evil temperament; 
thus some take pleasure in eating earth and coals and the like; or on the 
part of the soul; thus from custom some take pleasure in cannibalism or 
in the unnatural intercourse of man and beast, or other such things, 
which are not in accord with human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the answers to the objections.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one pleasure cannot be contrary to  another. 
Because the passions of the soul derive their species and contrariety 
from their objects. Now the object of pleasure is the good. Since 
therefore good is not contrary to good, but "good is contrary to evil, 
and evil to good," as stated in Praedic. viii; it seems that one pleasure 
is not contrary to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to one thing there is one contrary, as is proved in 
Metaph. x, 4. But sadness is contrary to pleasure. Therefore pleasure is 
not contrary to pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if one pleasure is contrary to another, this is only on 
account of the contrariety of the things which give pleasure. But this 
difference is material: whereas contrariety is a difference of form, as 
stated in Metaph. x, 4. Therefore there is no contrariety between one 
pleasure and another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things of the same genus that impede one another are 
contraries, as the Philosopher states (Phys. viii, 8). But some pleasures 
impede one another, as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Therefore some pleasures 
are contrary to one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Pleasure, in the emotions of the soul, is likened to 
repose in natural bodies, as stated above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now one repose 
is said to be contrary to another when they are in contrary termini; 
thus, "repose in a high place is contrary to repose in a low place" 
(Phys. v, 6). Wherefore it happens in the emotions of the soul that one 
pleasure is contrary to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of the Philosopher is to be understood of good 
and evil as applied to virtues and vices: because one vice may be 
contrary to another vice, whereas no virtue can be contrary to another 
virtue. But in other things nothing prevents one good from being contrary 
to another, such as hot and cold, of which the former is good in relation 
to fire, the latter, in relation to water. And in this way one pleasure 
can be contrary to another. That this is impossible with regard to the 
good of virtue, is due to the fact that virtue's good depends on 
fittingness in relation to some one thing---i.e. the reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Pleasure, in the emotions of the soul, is likened to 
natural repose in bodies: because its object is something suitable and 
connatural, so to speak. But sadness is like a violent repose; because 
its object is disagreeable to the animal appetite, just as the place of 
violent repose is disagreeable to the natural appetite. Now natural 
repose is contrary both to violent repose of the same body, and to the 
natural repose of another, as stated in Phys. v, 6. Wherefore pleasure is 
contrary to both to another pleasure and to sadness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[31] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The things in which we take pleasure, since they are the 
objects of pleasure, cause not only a material, but also a formal 
difference, if the formality of pleasurableness be different. Because 
difference in the formal object causes a specific difference in acts and 
passions, as stated above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,  <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4; <A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="FS030.html#FSQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
