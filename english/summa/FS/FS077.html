    OF THE CAUSE OF SIN, ON THE PART OF THE SENSITIVE APPETITE (EIGHT
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the cause of sin, on the part of the sensitive
    appetite, as to whether a passion of the soul may be a cause of sin: and
    under this head there are eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a passion of the sensitive
    appetite can move or incline the will?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it can overcome the reason
    against the latter's knowledge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a sin resulting from a
    passion is a sin of weakness?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the passion of self-love
    is the cause of every sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of three causes mentioned in 1 Jn.
    2:16: "Concupiscence of the eyes, Concupiscence of the flesh," and "Pride of
    life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the passion which causes a
    sin diminishes it?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether passion excuses from sin
    altogether?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether a sin committed through
    passion can be mortal?

    Whether the will is moved by a passion of the senstive appetite?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is not moved by a
    passion of the sensitive appetite. For no passive power is moved except by
    its object. Now the will is a power both passive and active, inasmuch as it
    is mover and moved, as the Philosopher says of the appetitive power in
    general (De Anima iii, text. 54). Since therefore the object of the will is
    not a passion of the sensitive appetite, but good defined by the reason, it
    seems that a passion of the sensitive appetite does not move the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the higher mover is not moved by the
    lower; thus the soul is not moved by the body. Now the will, which is the
    rational appetite, is compared to the sensitive appetite, as a higher mover
    to a lower: for the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 57) that "the
    rational appetite moves the sensitive appetite, even as, in the heavenly
    bodies, one sphere moves another." Therefore the will cannot be moved by a
    passion of the sensitive appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing immaterial can be moved by that
    which is material. Now the will is an immaterial power, because it does not
    use a corporeal organ, since it is in the reason, as stated in De Anima iii,
    text. 42: whereas the sensitive appetite is a material force, since it is
    seated in an organ of the body. Therefore a passion of the sensitive
    appetite cannot move the intellective appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++13%3A56"
      >Dan. 13:56</a
    >): "Lust hath perverted thy heart."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A passion of the sensitive appetite cannot draw
    or move the will directly; but it can do so indirectly, and this in two
    ways. First, by a kind of distraction: because, since all the soul's powers
    are rooted in the one essence of the soul, it follows of necessity that,
    when one power is intent in its act, another power becomes remiss, or is
    even altogether impeded, in its act, both because all energy is weakened
    through being divided, so that, on the contrary, through being centered on
    one thing, it is less able to be directed to several; and because, in the
    operations of the soul, a certain attention is requisite, and if this be
    closely fixed on one thing, less attention is given to another. In this way,
    by a kind of distraction, when the movement of the sensitive appetite is
    enforced in respect of any passion whatever, the proper movement of the
    rational appetite or will must, of necessity, become remiss or altogether
    impeded.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, this may happen on the part of the will's object, which is good
    apprehended by reason. Because the judgment and apprehension of reason is
    impeded on account of a vehement and inordinate apprehension of the
    imagination and judgment of the estimative power, as appears in those who
    are out of their mind. Now it is evident that the apprehension of the
    imagination and the judgment of the estimative power follow the passion of
    the sensitive appetite, even as the verdict of the taste follows the
    disposition of the tongue: for which reason we observe that those who are in
    some kind of passion, do not easily turn their imagination away from the
    object of their emotion, the result being that the judgment of the reason
    often follows the passion of the sensitive appetite, and consequently the
    will's movement follows it also, since it has a natural inclination always
    to follow the judgment of the reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the passion of the sensitive
    appetite is not the direct object of the will, yet it occasions a certain
    change in the judgment about the object of the will, as stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The higher mover is not directly moved
    by the lower; but, in a manner, it can be moved by it indirectly, as
    stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Third Objection is solved in like manner.</p>

    Whether the reason can be overcome by a passion, against its knowledge?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the reason cannot be overcome
    by a passion, against its knowledge. For the stronger is not overcome by the
    weaker. Now knowledge, on account of its certitude, is the strongest thing
    in us. Therefore it cannot be overcome by a passion, which is weak and soon
    passes away.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the will is not directed save to the
    good or the apparent good. Now when a passion draws the will to that which
    is really good, it does not influence the reason against its knowledge; and
    when it draws it to that which is good apparently, but not really, it draws
    it to that which appears good to the reason. But what appears to the reason
    is in the knowledge of the reason. Therefore a passion never influences the
    reason against its knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it be said that it draws the reason
    from its knowledge of something in general, to form a contrary judgment
    about a particular matter---on the contrary, if a universal and a particular
    proposition be opposed, they are opposed by contradiction, e.g. "Every man,"
    and "Not every man." Now if two opinions contradict one another, they are
    contrary to one another, as stated in Peri Herm. ii. If therefore anyone,
    while knowing something in general, were to pronounce an opposite judgment
    in a particular case, he would have two contrary opinions at the same time,
    which is impossible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever knows the universal, knows also
    the particular which he knows to be contained in the universal: thus who
    knows that every mule is sterile, knows that this particular animal is
    sterile, provided he knows it to be a mule, as is clear from Poster. i,
    text. 2. Now he who knows something in general, e.g. that "no fornication is
    lawful," knows this general proposition to contain, for example, the
    particular proposition, "This is an act of fornication." Therefore it seems
    that his knowledge extends to the particular.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm.
    i), "words express the thoughts of the mind." Now it often happens that man,
    while in a state of passion, confesses that what he has chosen is an evil,
    even in that particular case. Therefore he has knowledge, even in
    particular.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it seems that the passions cannot draw the reason against its
    universal knowledge; because it is impossible for it to have universal
    knowledge together with an opposite particular judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A23"
      >Rm. 7:23</a
    >): "I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind,
    and captivating me in the law of sin." Now the law that is in the members is
    concupiscence, of which he had been speaking previously. Since then
    concupiscence is a passion, it seems that a passion draws the reason counter
    to its knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher states (Ethic. vii, 2), the
    opinion of Socrates was that knowledge can never be overcome by passion;
    wherefore he held every virtue to be a kind of knowledge, and every sin a
    kind of ignorance. In this he was somewhat right, because, since the object
    of the will is a good or an apparent good, it is never moved to an evil,
    unless that which is not good appear good in some respect to the reason; so
    that the will would never tend to evil, unless there were ignorance or error
    in the reason. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++14%3A22"
      >Prov. 14:22</a
    >): "They err that work evil."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Experience, however, shows that many act contrary to the knowledge that they
    have, and this is confirmed by Divine authority, according to the words of
    Lk. 12:47: "The servant who knew that the will of his lord... and did not...
    shall be beaten with many stripes," and of James 4:17: "To him... who
    knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is a sin." Consequently he
    was not altogether right, and it is necessary, with the Philosopher (Ethic.
    vii, 3) to make a distinction. Because, since man is directed to right
    action by a twofold knowledge, viz. universal and particular, a defect in
    either of them suffices to hinder the rectitude of the will and of the deed,
    as stated above (<a href="FS076.html#FSQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FS076.html#FSQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). It may happen, then,
    that a man has some knowledge in general, e.g. that no fornication is
    lawful, and yet he does not know in particular that this act, which is
    fornication, must not be done; and this suffices for the will not to follow
    the universal knowledge of the reason. Again, it must be observed that
    nothing prevents a thing which is known habitually from not being considered
    actually: so that it is possible for a man to have correct knowledge not
    only in general but also in particular, and yet not to consider his
    knowledge actually: and in such a case it does not seem difficult for a man
    to act counter to what he does not actually consider. Now, that a man
    sometimes fails to consider in particular what he knows habitually, may
    happen through mere lack of attention: for instance, a man who knows
    geometry, may not attend to the consideration of geometrical conclusions,
    which he is ready to consider at any moment. Sometimes man fails to consider
    actually what he knows habitually, on account of some hindrance supervening,
    e.g. some external occupation, or some bodily infirmity; and, in this way, a
    man who is in a state of passion, fails to consider in particular what he
    knows in general, in so far as the passions hinder him from considering it.
    Now it hinders him in three ways. First, by way of distraction, as explained
    above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Secondly, by way
    of opposition, because a passion often inclines to something contrary to
    what man knows in general. Thirdly, by way of bodily transmutation, the
    result of which is that the reason is somehow fettered so as not to exercise
    its act freely; even as sleep or drunkenness, on account of some change
    wrought on the body, fetters the use of reason. That this takes place in the
    passions is evident from the fact that sometimes, when the passions are very
    intense, man loses the use of reason altogether: for many have gone out of
    their minds through excess of love or anger. It is in this way that passion
    draws the reason to judge in particular, against the knowledge which it has
    in general.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Universal knowledge, which is most
    certain, does not hold the foremost place in action, but rather particular
    knowledge, since actions are about singulars: wherefore it is not
    astonishing that, in matters of action, passion acts counter to universal
    knowledge, if the consideration of particular knowledge be lacking.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fact that something appears good in
    particular to the reason, whereas it is not good, is due to a passion: and
    yet this particular judgment is contrary to the universal knowledge of the
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is impossible for anyone to have an
    actual knowledge or true opinion about a universal affirmative proposition,
    and at the same time a false opinion about a particular negative
    proposition, or vice versa: but it may well happen that a man has true
    habitual knowledge about a universal affirmative proposition, and actually a
    false opinion about a particular negative: because an act is directly
    opposed, not to a habit, but to an act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> He that has knowledge in a universal, is
    hindered, on account of a passion, from reasoning about that universal, so
    as to draw the conclusion: but he reasons about another universal
    proposition suggested by the inclination of the passion, and draws his
    conclusion accordingly. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 3) that the
    syllogism of an incontinent man has four propositions, two particular and
    two universal, of which one is of the reason, e.g. No fornication is lawful,
    and the other, of passion, e.g. Pleasure is to be pursued. Hence passion
    fetters the reason, and hinders it from arguing and concluding under the
    first proposition; so that while the passions lasts, the reason argues and
    concludes under the second.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Even as a drunken man sometimes gives
    utterance to words of deep signification, of which, however, he is
    incompetent to judge, his drunkenness hindering him; so that a man who is in
    a state of passion, may indeed say in words that he ought not to do so and
    so, yet his inner thought is that he must do it, as stated in Ethic. vii,
    3.<br />

    Whether a sin committed through passion, should be called a sin of
    weakness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a sin committed through
    passion should not be called a sin of weakness. For a passion is a vehement
    movement of the sensitive appetite, as stated above (<a
      href="FS077.html#FSQ77A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now vehemence of movements is evidence of strength rather than of
    weakness. Therefore a sin committed through passion, should not be called a
    sin of weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, weakness in man regards that which is
    most fragile in him. Now this is the flesh; whence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++77%3A39"
      >Ps. 77:39</a
    >): "He remembered that they are flesh." Therefore sins of weakness should
    be those which result from bodily defects, rather than those which are due
    to a passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man does not seem to be weak in respect
    of things which are subject to his will. Now it is subject to man's will,
    whether he do or do not the things to which his passions incline him,
    according to Gn. 4:7: "Thy appetite shall be under thee [*Vulg.: 'The lust
    thereof shall be under thee.'], and thou shalt have dominion over it."
    Therefore sin committed through passion is not a sin of weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Cicero (De Quaest. Tusc. iv) calls the
    passions diseases of the soul. Now weakness is another name for disease.
    Therefore a sin that arises from passion should be called a sin of
    weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The cause of sin is on the part of the soul, in
    which, chiefly, sin resides. Now weakness may be applied to the soul by way
    of likeness to weakness of the body. Accordingly, man's body is said to be
    weak, when it is disabled or hindered in the execution of its proper action,
    through some disorder of the body's parts, so that the humors and members of
    the human body cease to be subject to its governing and motive power. Hence
    a member is said to be weak, when it cannot do the work of a healthy member,
    the eye, for instance, when it cannot see clearly, as the Philosopher states
    (De Hist. Animal. x, 1). Therefore weakness of the soul is when the soul is
    hindered from fulfilling its proper action on account of a disorder in its
    parts. Now as the parts of the body are said to be out of order, when they
    fail to comply with the order of nature, so too the parts of the soul are
    said to be inordinate, when they are not subject to the order of reason, for
    the reason is the ruling power of the soul's parts. Accordingly, when the
    concupiscible or irascible power is affected by any passion contrary to the
    order of reason, the result being that an impediment arises in the aforesaid
    manner to the due action of man, it is said to be a sin of weakness. Hence
    the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 8) compares the incontinent man to an
    epileptic, whose limbs move in a manner contrary to his intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as in the body the stronger the
    movement against the order of nature, the greater the weakness, so likewise,
    the stronger the movement of passion against the order of reason, the
    greater the weakness of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sin consists chiefly in an act of the
    will, which is not hindered by weakness of the body: for he that is weak in
    body may have a will ready for action, and yet be hindered by a passion, as
    stated above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence when
    we speak of sins of weakness, we refer to weakness of soul rather than of
    body. And yet even weakness of soul is called weakness of the flesh, in so
    far as it is owing to a condition of the flesh that the passions of the soul
    arise in us through the sensitive appetite being a power using a corporeal
    organ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is in the will's power to give or
    refuse its consent to what passion inclines us to do, and it is in this
    sense that our appetite is said to be under us; and yet this consent or
    dissent of the will is hindered in the way already explained (<a

  <h3 align="left">Whether self-love is the source of every sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that self-love is not the source of
    every sin. For that which is good and right in itself is not the proper
    cause of sin. Now love of self is a good and right thing in itself:
    wherefore man is commanded to love his neighbor as himself (Lev. 19:18).
    Therefore self-love cannot be the proper cause of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A8"
      >Rm. 7:8</a
    >): "Sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of
    concupiscence"; on which words a gloss says that "the law is good, since by
    forbidding concupiscence, it forbids all evils," the reason for which is
    that concupiscence is the cause of every sin. Now concupiscence is a
    distinct passion from love, as stated above (<a href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore self-love is
    not the cause of every sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine in commenting on Ps. 79:17,
    "Things set on fire and dug down," says that "every sin is due either to
    love arousing us to undue ardor or to fear inducing false humility."
    Therefore self-love is not the only cause of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as man sins at times through inordinate
    love of self, so does he sometimes through inordinate love of his neighbor.
    Therefore self-love is not the cause of every sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that
    "self-love, amounting to contempt of God, builds up the city of Babylon."
    Now every sin makes man a citizen of Babylon. Therefore self-love is the
    cause of every sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS075.html#FSQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="FS075.html#FSQ75A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the proper and direct
    cause of sin is to be considered on the part of the adherence to a mutable
    good; in which respect every sinful act proceeds from inordinate desire for
    some temporal good. Now the fact that anyone desires a temporal good
    inordinately, is due to the fact that he loves himself inordinately; for to
    wish anyone some good is to love him. Therefore it is evident that
    inordinate love of self is the cause of every sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Well ordered self-love, whereby man
    desires a fitting good for himself, is right and natural; but it is
    inordinate self-love, leading to contempt of God, that Augustine (De Civ.
    Dei xiv, 28) reckons to be the cause of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Concupiscence, whereby a man desires
    good for himself, is reduced to self-love as to its cause, as stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is said to love both the good he
    desires for himself, and himself to whom he desires it. Love, in so far as
    it is directed to the object of desire (e.g. a man is said to love wine or
    money) admits, as its cause, fear which pertains to avoidance of evil: for
    every sin arises either from inordinate desire for some good, or from
    inordinate avoidance of some evil. But each of these is reduced to
    self-love, since it is through loving himself that man either desires good
    things, or avoids evil things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A friend is like another self (Ethic.
    ix): wherefore the sin which is committed through love for a friend, seems
    to be committed through self-love.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of
    life are fittingly described as causes of sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "concupiscence of the flesh,
    concupiscence of the eyes, and pride of life" are unfittingly described as
    causes of sin. Because, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++6%3A10"
      >1 Tim. 6:10</a
    >), "covetousness [*Douay: 'The desire of money'] is the root of all evils."
    Now pride of life is not included in covetousness. Therefore it should not
    be reckoned among the causes of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, concupiscence of the flesh is aroused
    chiefly by what is seen by the eyes, according to Dan. 13:56: "Beauty hath
    deceived thee." Therefore concupiscence of the eyes should not be condivided
    with concupiscence of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, concupiscence is desire for pleasure, as
    stated above (<a href="FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>,
    <a href="FS030.html#FSQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now objects of pleasure
    are perceived not only by the sight, but also by the other senses. Therefore
    "concupiscence of the hearing" and of the other senses should also have been
    mentioned.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as man is induced to sin, through
    inordinate desire of good things, so is he also, through inordinate
    avoidance of evil things, as stated above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 3). But nothing is mentioned here pertaining to avoidance of evil.
    Therefore the causes of sin are insufficiently described.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++2%3A16"
      >1 Jn. 2:16</a
    >): "All that is in the world is concupiscence of the flesh, or [Vulg.:
    'and'] pride of life." Now a thing is said to be "in the world" by reason of
    sin: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++5%3A19"
      >1 Jn. 5:19</a
    >): "The whole world is seated in wickedness." Therefore these three are
    causes of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS077.html#FSQ77A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), inordinate self-love is the cause of every sin. Now self-love includes
    inordinate desire of good: for a man desires good for the one he loves.
    Hence it is evident that inordinate desire of good is the cause of every
    sin. Now good is, in two ways, the object of the sensitive appetite, wherein
    are the passions which are the cause of sin: first, absolutely, according as
    it is the object of the concupiscible part; secondly, under the aspect of
    difficulty, according as it is the object of the irascible part, as stated
    above (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Again, concupiscence is
    twofold, as stated above (<a href="FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>,
    <a href="FS030.html#FSQ30A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). One is natural, and is
    directed to those things which sustain the nature of the body, whether as
    regards the preservation of the individual, such as food, drink, and the
    like, or as regards the preservation of the species, such as sexual matters:
    and the inordinate appetite of such things is called "concupiscence of the
    flesh." The other is spiritual concupiscence, and is directed to those
    things which do not afford sustentation or pleasure in respect of the
    fleshly senses, but are delectable in respect of the apprehension or
    imagination, or some similar mode of perception; such are money, apparel,
    and the like; and this spiritual concupiscence is called "concupiscence of
    the eyes," whether this be taken as referring to the sight itself, of which
    the eyes are the organ, so as to denote curiosity according to Augustine's
    exposition (Confess. x); or to the concupiscence of things which are
    proposed outwardly to the eyes, so as to denote covetousness, according to
    the explanation of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The inordinate appetite of the arduous good pertains to the "pride of life";
    for pride is the inordinate appetite of excellence, as we shall state
    further on (<a href="FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="FS084.html#FSQ84A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;

    <a href="../SS/SS162.html#SSQ162A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore evident that all passions that are a cause of sin can be
    reduced to these three: since all the passions of the concupiscible part can
    be reduced to the first two, and all the irascible passions to the third,
    which is not divided into two because all the irascible passions conform to
    spiritual concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Pride of life" is included in
    covetousness according as the latter denotes any kind of appetite for any
    kind of good. How covetousness, as a special vice, which goes by the name of
    "avarice," is the root of all sins, shall be explained further on (<a
      href="FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1"
      >Question [84]</a
    >, <a href="FS084.html#FSQ84A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Concupiscence of the eyes" does not
    mean here the concupiscence for all things which can be seen by the eyes,
    but only for such things as afford, not carnal pleasure in respect of touch,
    but in respect of the eyes, i.e. of any apprehensive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sense of sight is the most excellent
    of all the senses, and covers a larger ground, as stated in Metaph. i: and
    so its name is transferred to all the other senses, and even to the inner
    apprehensions, as Augustine states (De Verb. Dom., serm. xxxiii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Avoidance of evil is caused by the
    appetite for good, as stated above (<a href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS039.html#FSQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>,
    <a href="FS039.html#FSQ39A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); and so those passions
    alone are mentioned which incline to good, as being the causes of those
    which cause inordinately the avoidance of evil.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether sin is alleviated on account of a passion?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sin is not alleviated on
    account of passion. For increase of cause adds to the effect: thus if a hot
    thing causes something to melt, a hotter will do so yet more. Now passion is
    a cause of sin, as stated (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A5THEP1">Article [5]</a
    >). Therefore the more intense the passion, the greater the sin. Therefore
    passion does not diminish sin, but increases it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a good passion stands in the same
    relation to merit, as an evil passion does to sin. Now a good passion
    increases merit: for a man seems to merit the more, according as he is moved
    by a greater pity to help a poor man. Therefore an evil passion also
    increases rather than diminishes a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man seems to sin the more grievously,
    according as he sins with a more intense will. But the passion that impels
    the will makes it tend with greater intensity to the sinful act. Therefore
    passion aggravates a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The passion of concupiscence is called a
    temptation of the flesh. But the greater the temptation that overcomes a
    man, the less grievous his sin, as Augustine states (De Civ. Dei iv, 12).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sin consists essentially in an act of the free
    will, which is a faculty of the will and reason; while passion is a movement
    of the sensitive appetite. Now the sensitive appetite can be related to the
    free-will, antecedently and consequently: antecedently, according as a
    passion of the sensitive appetite draws or inclines the reason or will, as
    stated above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="FS010.html#FSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>,
    <a href="FS010.html#FSQ10A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>); and consequently, in so
    far as the movements of the higher powers redound on to the lower, since it
    is not possible for the will to be moved to anything intensely, without a
    passion being aroused in the sensitive appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly if we take passion as preceding the sinful act, it must needs
    diminish the sin: because the act is a sin in so far as it is voluntary, and
    under our control. Now a thing is said to be under our control, through the
    reason and will: and therefore the more the reason and will do anything of
    their own accord, and not through the impulse of a passion, the more is it
    voluntary and under our control. In this respect passion diminishes sin, in
    so far as it diminishes its voluntariness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, a consequent passion does not diminish a sin, but
    increases it; or rather it is a sign of its gravity, in so far, to wit, as
    it shows the intensity of the will towards the sinful act; and so it is true
    that the greater the pleasure or the concupiscence with which anyone sins,
    the greater the sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Passion is the cause of sin on the part
    of that to which the sinner turns. But the gravity of a sin is measured on
    the part of that from which he turns, which results accidentally from his
    turning to something else---accidentally, i.e. beside his intention. Now an
    effect is increased by the increase, not of its accidental cause, but of its
    direct cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A good passion consequent to the
    judgment of reason increases merit; but if it precede, so that a man is
    moved to do well, rather by his passion than by the judgment of his reason,
    such a passion diminishes the goodness and praiseworthiness of his
    action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the movement of the will
    incited by the passion is more intense, yet it is not so much the will's own
    movement, as if it were moved to sin by the reason alone.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether passion excuses from sin altogether?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that passion excuses from sin
    altogether. For whatever causes an act to be involuntary, excuses from sin
    altogether. But concupiscence of the flesh, which is a passion, makes an act
    to be involuntary, according to Gal. 5:17: "The flesh lusteth against the
    spirit... so that you do not the things that you would." Therefore passion
    excuses from sin altogether.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, passion causes a certain ignorance of a
    particular matter, as stated above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >; <a href="FS076.html#FSQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>,
    <a href="FS076.html#FSQ76A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But ignorance of a
    particular matter excuses from sin altogether, as stated above (<a
      href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore passion
    excuses from sin altogether.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, disease of the soul is graver than
    disease of the body. But bodily disease excuses from sin altogether, as in
    the case of mad people. Much more, therefore, does passion, which is a
    disease of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A5"
      >Rm. 7:5</a
    >) speaks of the passions as "passions of sins," for no other reason than
    that they cause sin: which would not be the case if they excused from sin
    altogether. Therefore passion does not excuse from sin altogether.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An act which, in its genus, is evil, cannot be
    excused from sin altogether, unless it be rendered altogether involuntary.
    Consequently, if the passion be such that it renders the subsequent act
    wholly involuntary, it entirely excuses from sin; otherwise, it does not
    excuse entirely. In this matter two points apparently should be observed:
    first, that a thing may be voluntary either "in itself," as when the will
    tends towards it directly; or "in its cause," when the will tends towards
    that cause and not towards the effect; as is the case with one who wilfully
    gets drunk, for in that case he is considered to do voluntarily whatever he
    does through being drunk. Secondly, we must observe that a thing is said to
    be voluntary "directly" or "indirectly"; directly, if the will tends towards
    it; indirectly, if the will could have prevented it, but did not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly therefore we must make a distinction: because a passion is
    sometimes so strong as to take away the use of reason altogether, as in the
    case of those who are mad through love or anger; and then if such a passion
    were voluntary from the beginning, the act is reckoned a sin, because it is
    voluntary in its cause, as we have stated with regard to drunkenness. If,
    however, the cause be not voluntary but natural, for instance, if anyone
    through sickness or some such cause fall into such a passion as deprives him
    of the use of reason, his act is rendered wholly involuntary, and he is
    entirely excused from sin. Sometimes, however, the passion is not such as to
    take away the use of reason altogether; and then reason can drive the
    passion away, by turning to other thoughts, or it can prevent it from having
    its full effect; since the members are not put to work, except by the
    consent of reason, as stated above (<a href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1"
      >Question [17]</a
    >, <a href="FS017.html#FSQ17A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>): wherefore such a
    passion does not excuse from sin altogether.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words, "So that you do not the
    things that you would" are not to be referred to outward deeds, but to the
    inner movement of concupiscence; for a man would wish never to desire evil,
    in which sense we are to understand the words of Rm. 7:19: "The evil which I
    will not, that I do." Or again they may be referred to the will as preceding
    the passion, as is the case with the incontinent, who act counter to their
    resolution on account of their concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The particular ignorance which excuses
    altogether, is ignorance of a circumstance, which a man is unable to know
    even after taking due precautions. But passion causes ignorance of law in a
    particular case, by preventing universal knowledge from being applied to a
    particular act, which passion the reason is able to drive away, as
    stated.<br />

    would be a comparison, however, if it were voluntary, as we have stated
    about drunkenness, which is a kind of bodily disease.<br />

    Whether a sin committed through passion can be mortal?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sin committed through passion
    cannot be mortal. Because venial sin is condivided with mortal sin. Now sin
    committed from weakness is venial, since it has in itself a motive for
    pardon [venia]. Since therefore sin committed through passion is a sin of
    weakness, it seems that it cannot be mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the cause is more powerful than its
    effect. But passion cannot be a mortal sin, for there is no mortal sin in
    the sensuality, as stated above (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1"
      >Question [74]</a
    >, <a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore a sin
    committed through passion cannot be mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, passion is a hindrance to reason, as
    explained above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Now
    it belongs to the reason to turn to God, or to turn away from Him, which is
    the essence of a mortal sin. Therefore a sin committed through passion
    cannot be mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A5"
      >Rm. 7:5</a
    >) that "the passions of the sins... work [Vulg.: 'did work'] in our members
    to bring forth fruit unto death." Now it is proper to mortal sin to bring
    forth fruit unto death. Therefore sin committed through passion may be
    mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Mortal sin, as stated above (<a
      href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1"
      >Question [72]</a
    >, <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), consists in turning
    away from our last end which is God, which aversion pertains to the
    deliberating reason, whose function it is also to direct towards the end.
    Therefore that which is contrary to the last end can happen not to be a
    mortal sin, only when the deliberating reason is unable to come to the
    rescue, which is the case in sudden movements. Now when anyone proceeds from
    passion to a sinful act, or to a deliberate consent, this does not happen
    suddenly: and so the deliberating reason can come to the rescue here, since
    it can drive the passion away, or at least prevent it from having its
    effect, as stated above: wherefore if it does not come to the rescue, there
    is a mortal sin; and it is thus, as we see, that many murders and adulteries
    are committed through passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A sin may be venial in three ways.
    First, through its cause, i.e. through having cause to be forgiven, which
    cause lessens the sin; thus a sin that is committed through weakness or
    ignorance is said to be venial. Secondly, through its issue; thus every sin,
    through repentance, becomes venial, i.e. receives pardon [veniam]. Thirdly,
    by its genus, e.g. an idle word. This is the only kind of venial sin that is
    opposed to mortal sin: whereas the objection regards the first kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passion causes sin as regards the
    adherence to something. But that this be a mortal sin regards the aversion,
    which follows accidentally from the adherence, as stated above (<a
      href="FS077.html#FSQ77A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >, ad 1): hence the argument does not prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Passion does not always hinder the act
    of reason altogether: consequently the reason remains in possession of its
    free-will, so as to turn away from God, or turn to Him. If, however, the use
    of reason be taken away altogether, the sin is no longer either mortal or
    venial.<br />
