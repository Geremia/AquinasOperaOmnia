<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that daring is not contrary to fear. For Augustine 
says (Questions. 83, qu. 31) that "daring is a vice." Now vice is contrary to 
virtue. Since, therefore, fear is not a virtue but a passion, it seems 
that daring is not contrary to fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to one thing there is one contrary. But hope is contrary 
to fear. Therefore daring is not contrary to fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every passion excludes its opposite. But fear excludes 
safety; for Augustine says (Confess. ii, 6) that "fear takes forethought 
for safety." Therefore safety is contrary to fear. Therefore daring is 
not contrary to fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "daring is 
contrary to fear."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is of the essence of contraries to be "farthest 
removed from one another," as stated in Metaph. x, 4. Now that which is 
farthest removed from fear, is daring: since fear turns away from the 
future hurt, on account of its victory over him that fears it; whereas 
daring turns on threatened danger because of its own victory over that 
same danger. Consequently it is evident that daring is contrary to fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Anger, daring and all the names of the passions can be 
taken in two ways. First, as denoting absolutely movements of the 
sensitive appetite in respect of some object, good or bad: and thus they 
are names of passions. Secondly, as denoting besides this movement, a 
straying from the order of reason: and thus they are names of vices. It 
is in this sense that Augustine speaks of daring: but we are speaking of 
it in the first sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To one thing, in the same respect, there are not several 
contraries; but in different respects nothing prevents one thing having 
several contraries. Accordingly it has been said above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that the irascible passions admit of a twofold  contrariety: 
one, according to the opposition of good and evil, and thus fear is 
contrary to hope: the other, according to the opposition of approach and 
withdrawal, and thus daring is contrary to fear, and despair contrary to 
hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Safety does not denote something contrary to fear, but 
merely the exclusion of fear: for he is said to be safe, who fears not. 
Wherefore safety is opposed to fear, as a privation: while daring is 
opposed thereto as a contrary. And as contrariety implies privation, so 
daring implies safety.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether daring ensues from hope?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that daring does not ensue from hope. Because 
daring regards evil and fearful things, as stated in Ethic. iii, 7. But 
hope regards good things, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore they 
have different objects and are not in the same order. Therefore daring 
does not ensue from hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as daring is contrary to fear, so is despair 
contrary to hope. But fear does not ensue from despair: in fact, despair 
excludes fear, as the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5). Therefore daring 
does not result from hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, daring is intent on something good, viz. victory. But it 
belongs to hope to tend to that which is good and difficult. Therefore 
daring is the same as hope; and consequently does not result from it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "those are 
hopeful are full of daring." Therefore it seems that daring ensues from 
hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As we have often stated (<A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>, <A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>, <A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="FS041.html#FSQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), all these passions belong to the appetitive power. Now every 
movement of the appetitive power is reducible to one either of pursuit or 
of avoidance. Again, pursuit or avoidance is of something either by 
reason of itself or by reason of something else. By reason of itself, 
good is the object of pursuit, and evil, the object of avoidance: but by 
reason of something else, evil can be the object of pursuit, through some 
good attaching to it; and good can be the object of avoidance, through 
some evil attaching to it. Now that which is by reason of something else, 
follows that which is by reason of itself. Consequently pursuit of evil 
follows pursuit of good; and avoidance of good follows avoidance of evil. 
Now these four things belong to four passions, since pursuit of good 
belongs to hope, avoidance of evil to fear, the pursuit of the fearful 
evil belongs to daring, and the avoidance of good to despair. It follows, 
therefore, that daring results from hope; since it is in the hope of 
overcoming the threatening object of fear, that one attacks it boldly. 
But despair results from fear: since the reason why a man despairs is 
because he fears the difficulty attaching to the good he should hope for. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument would hold, if good and evil were not 
co-ordinate objects. But because evil has a certain relation to good, 
since it comes after good, as privation comes after habit; consequently 
daring which pursues evil, comes after hope which pursues good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although good, absolutely speaking, is prior to evil, yet 
avoidance of evil precedes avoidance of good; just as the pursuit of good 
precedes the pursuit of evil. Consequently just as hope precedes daring, 
so fear precedes despair. And just as fear does not always lead to 
despair, but only when it is intense; so hope does not always lead to 
daring, save only when it is strong.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the object of daring is an evil to which, in the 
estimation of the daring man, the good of victory is conjoined; yet 
daring regards the evil, and hope regards the conjoined good. In like 
manner despair regards directly the good which it turns away from, while 
fear regards the conjoined evil. Hence, properly speaking, daring is not 
a part of hope, but its effect: just as despair is an effect, not a part, 
of fear. For this reason, too, daring cannot be a principal passion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether some defect is a cause of daring?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that some defect is a cause of daring. For the 
Philosopher says (De Problem. xxvii, 4) that "lovers of wine are strong 
and daring." But from wine ensues the effect of drunkenness. Therefore 
daring is caused by a defect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those who have 
no experience of danger are bold." But want of experience is a defect. 
Therefore daring is caused by a defect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those who have suffered wrongs are wont to be daring; 
"like the beasts when beaten," as stated in Ethic. iii, 5. But the 
suffering of wrongs pertains to defect. Therefore daring is caused by a 
defect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that the cause of 
daring "is the presence in the imagination of the hope that the means of 
safety are nigh, and that the things to be feared are either non-existent 
or far off." But anything pertaining to defect implies either the removal 
of the means of safety, or the proximity of something to be feared. 
Therefore nothing pertaining to defect is a cause of daring.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS045.html#FSQ45ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) daring results from hope and is 
contrary to fear: wherefore whatever is naturally apt to cause hope or 
banish fear, is a cause of daring. Since, however, fear and hope, and 
also daring, being passions, consist in a movement of the appetite, and 
in a certain bodily transmutation; a thing may be considered as the cause 
of daring in two ways, whether  by raising hope, or by banishing fear; in 
one way, in the part of the appetitive movement; in another way, on the 
part of the bodily transmutation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the appetitive movement which follows apprehension, hope 
that leads to daring is roused by those things that make us reckon 
victory as possible. Such things regard either our own power, as bodily 
strength, experience of dangers, abundance of wealth, and the like; or 
they regard the powers of others, such as having a great number of 
friends or any other means of help, especially if a man trust in the 
Divine assistance: wherefore "those are more daring, with whom it is well 
in regard to godlike things," as the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5). Fear 
is banished, in this way, by the removal of threatening causes of fear; 
for instance, by the fact that a man has not enemies, through having 
harmed nobody, so that he is not aware of any imminent danger; since 
those especially appear to be threatened by danger, who have harmed 
others.<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the bodily transmutation, daring is caused through the 
incitement of hope and the banishment of fear, by those things which 
raise the temperature about the heart. Wherefore the Philosopher says (De 
Part. Animal. iii, 4) that "those whose heart is small in size, are more 
daring; while animals whose heart is large are timid; because the natural 
heat is unable to give the same degree of temperature to a large as to a 
small heart; just as a fire does not heat a large house as well as it 
does a small house." He says also (De Problem. xxvii, 4), that "those 
whose lungs contain much blood, are more daring, through the heat in the 
heart that results therefrom." He says also in the same passage that 
"lovers of wine are more daring, on account of the heat of the wine": 
hence it has been said above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) that drunkenness conduces to 
hope, since the heat in the heart banishes fear and raises hope, by 
reason of the dilatation and enlargement of the heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Drunkenness causes daring, not through being a defect, but 
through dilating the heart: and again through making a man think greatly 
of himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who have no experience of dangers are more daring, 
not on account of a defect, but accidentally, i.e. in so far as through 
being inexperienced they do not know their own failings, nor the dangers 
that threaten. Hence it is that the removal of the cause of fear gives 
rise to daring.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) "those who have been 
wronged are courageous, because they think that God comes to the 
assistance of those who suffer unjustly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is evident that no defect causes daring except accidentally, 
i.e. in so far as some excellence attaches thereto, real or imaginary, 
either in oneself or in another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the brave are more eager at first than in the midst of danger?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the daring are not more eager at first than in 
the midst of danger. Because trembling is caused by fear, which is 
contrary to daring, as stated above (<A Href="FS045.html#FSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS044.html#FSQ44OUTP1">Question [44]</a>, <A Href="FS044.html#FSQ44A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But the daring 
sometimes tremble at first, as the Philosopher says (De Problem. xxvii, 
3). Therefore they are not more eager at first than in the midst of 
danger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, passion is intensified by an increase in its object: 
thus since a good is lovable, what is better is yet more lovable. But the 
object of daring is something difficult. Therefore the greater the 
difficulty, the greater the daring. But danger is more arduous and 
difficult when present. It is then therefore that daring is greatest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, anger is provoked by the infliction of wounds. But anger 
causes daring; for the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "anger makes 
man bold." Therefore when man is in the midst of danger and when he is 
being beaten, then is he most daring.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in Ethic. iii, 7 that "the daring are 
precipitate and full of eagerness before the danger, yet in the midst of 
dangers they stand aloof."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Daring, being a movement of the sensitive appetite, 
follows an apprehension of the sensitive faculty. But the sensitive 
faculty cannot make comparisons, nor can it inquire into circumstances; 
its judgment is instantaneous. Now it happens sometimes that it is 
impossible for a man to take note in an instant of all the difficulties 
of a certain situation: hence there arises the movement of daring to face 
the danger; so that when he comes to experience the danger, he feels the 
difficulty to be greater than he expected, and so gives way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, reason discusses all the difficulties of a situation. 
Consequently men of fortitude who face danger according to the judgment 
of reason, at first seem slack, because they face the danger not from 
passion but with due deliberation. Yet when they are in the midst of 
danger, they experience nothing unforeseen, but sometimes the difficulty 
turns out to be less than they anticipated; wherefore they are more 
persevering. Moreover, it may be because they face the danger on account 
of the good of virtue which is the abiding object of their will, however 
great the danger may prove: whereas men of daring face the danger on 
account of a mere thought giving rise to hope and banishing fear, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS045.html#FSQ45A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Trembling does occur in men of daring, on account of the 
heat being withdrawn from the outer to the inner parts of the body, as 
occurs also in those who are afraid. But in men of daring the heat 
withdraws to the heart; whereas in those who are afraid, it withdraws to 
the inferior parts. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The object of love is good simply, wherefore if it be 
increased, love is increased simply. But the object of daring is a 
compound of good and evil; and the movement of daring towards evil 
presupposes the movement of hope towards good. If, therefore, so much 
difficulty be added to the danger that it overcomes hope, the movement of 
daring does not ensue, but fails. But if the movement of daring does 
ensue, the greater the danger, the greater is the daring considered to be.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[45] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hurt does not give rise to anger unless there be some kind 
of hope, as we shall see later on (<A Href="FS046.html#FSQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="FS046.html#FSQ46A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently if the 
danger be so great as to banish all hope of victory, anger does not 
ensue. It is true, however, that if anger does ensue, there will be 
greater daring.<br>
