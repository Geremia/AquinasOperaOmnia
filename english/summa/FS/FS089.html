  <h3 align="left">Whether venial sin causes a stain on the soul?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin causes a stain in
    the soul. For Augustine says (De Poenit.) [*Hom. 50, inter. L., 2], that if
    venial sins be multiplied, they destroy the beauty of our souls so as to
    deprive us of the embraces of our heavenly spouse. But the stain of sin is
    nothing else but the loss of the soul's beauty. Therefore venial sins cause
    a stain in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, mortal sin causes a stain in the soul,
    on account of the inordinateness of the act and of the sinner's affections.
    But, in venial sin, there is an inordinateness of the act and of the
    affections. Therefore venial sin causes a stain in the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the stain on the soul is caused by
    contact with a temporal thing, through love thereof as stated above (<a
      href="FS086.html#FSQ86OUTP1"
      >Question [86]</a
    >, <a href="FS086.html#FSQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But, in venial sin,
    the soul is in contact with a temporal thing through inordinate love.
    therefore, venial sin brings a stain on the soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> it is written, (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A27"
      >Eph. 5:27</a
    >): "That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot
    or wrinkle," on which the gloss says: "i.e., some grievous sin." Therefore
    it seems proper to mortal sin to cause a stain on the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that as stated above (<a href="FS086.html#FSQ86OUTP1"
      >Question [86]</a
    >, <a href="FS086.html#FSQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a stain denotes a
    loss of comeliness due to contact with something, as may be seen in
    corporeal matters, from which the term has been transferred to the soul, by
    way of similitude. Now, just as in the body there is a twofold comeliness,
    one resulting from the inward disposition of the members and colors, the
    other resulting from outward refulgence supervening, so too, in the soul,
    there is a twofold comeliness, one habitual and, so to speak, intrinsic, the
    other actual like an outward flash of light. Now venial sin is a hindrance
    to actual comeliness, but not to habitual comeliness, because it neither
    destroys nor diminishes the habit of charity and of the other virtues, as we
    shall show further on (<a href="../SS.html">SS</a>,
    <a href="../SS/SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="../SS/SS024.html#SSQ24A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>;
    <a href="FS133.html#FSQ133OUTP1">Question [133]</a>,
    <a href="FS133.html#FSQ133A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), but only hinders
    their acts. On the other hand a stain denotes something permanent in the
    thing stained, wherefore it seems in the nature of a loss of habitual rather
    than of actual comeliness. Therefore, properly speaking, venial sin does not
    cause a stain in the soul. If, however, we find it stated anywhere that it
    does induce a stain, this is in a restricted sense, in so far as it hinders
    the comeliness that results from acts of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of the case in
    which many venial sins lead to mortal sin dispositively: because otherwise
    they would not sever the soul from its heavenly spouse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In mortal sin the inordinateness of the
    act destroys the habit of virtue, but not in venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In mortal sin the soul comes into
    contact with a temporal thing as its end, so that the shedding of the light
    of grace, which accrues to those who, by charity, cleave to God as their
    last end, is entirely cut off. On the contrary, in venial sin, man does not
    cleave to a creature as his last end: hence there is no comparison.<br />

    Whether venial sins are suitably designated as "wood, hay, and stubble"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sins are unsuitably
    designated as "wood," "hay," and "stubble." Because wood hay and stubble are
    said (1 Cor. 3:12) to be built on a spiritual foundation. Now venial sins
    are something outside a spiritual foundation, even as false opinions are
    outside the pale of science. Therefore, venial sins are not suitably
    designated as wood, hay and stubble.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who builds wood, hay and stubble,
    "shall be saved yet so as by fire" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 3:15</a
    >). But sometimes the man who commits a venial sin, will not be saved, even
    by fire, e.g. when a man dies in mortal sin to which venial sins are
    attached. Therefore, venial sins are unsuitably designated by wood, hay, and
    stubble.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 3:12</a
    >) those who build "gold, silver, precious stones," i.e. love of God and our
    neighbor, and good works, are others from those who build wood, hay, and
    stubble. But those even who love God and their neighbor, and do good works,
    commit venial sins: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++1%3A8"
      >1 Jn. 1:8</a
    >): "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." Therefore venial
    sins are not suitably designated by these three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there are many more than three
    differences and degrees of venial sins. Therefore they are unsuitably
    comprised under these three.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 3:15</a
    >) that the man who builds up wood, hay and stubble, "shall be saved yet so
    as by fire," so that he will suffer punishment, but not everlasting. Now the
    debt of temporal punishment belongs properly to venial sin, as stated above
    (<a href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>,
    <a href="FS087.html#FSQ87A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore these three
    signify venial sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have understood the "foundation" to be
    dead faith, upon which some build good works, signified by gold, silver, and
    precious stones, while others build mortal sins, which according to them are
    designated by wood, hay and stubble. But Augustine disapproves of this
    explanation (De Fide et Oper. xv), because, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A21"
      >Gal. 5:21</a
    >), he who does the works of the flesh, "shall not obtain the kingdom of
    God," which signifies to be saved; whereas the Apostle says that he who
    builds wood, hay, and stubble "shall be saved yet so as by fire."
    Consequently wood, hay, stubble cannot be understood to denote mortal
    sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others say that wood, hay, stubble designate good works, which are indeed
    built upon the spiritual edifice, but are mixed with venial sins: as, when a
    man is charged with the care of a family, which is a good thing, excessive
    love of his wife or of his children or of his possessions insinuates itself
    into his life, under God however, so that, to wit, for the sake of these
    things he would be unwilling to do anything in opposition to God. But
    neither does this seem to be reasonable. For it is evident that all good
    works are referred to the love of God, and one's neighbor, wherefore they
    are designated by "gold," "silver," and "precious stones," and consequently
    not by "wood," "hay," and "stubble."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore say that the very venial sins that insinuate themselves
    into those who have a care for earthly things, are designated by wood, hay,
    and stubble. For just as these are stored in a house, without belonging to
    the substance of the house, and can be burnt, while the house is saved, so
    also venial sins are multiplied in a man, while the spiritual edifice
    remains, and for them, man suffers fire, either of temporal trials in this
    life, or of purgatory after this life, and yet he is saved for ever.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial sins are not said to be built
    upon the spiritual foundation, as though they were laid directly upon it,
    but because they are laid beside it; in the same sense as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++136%3A1"
      >Ps. 136:1</a
    >): "Upon the waters of Babylon," i.e. "beside the waters": because venial
    sins do not destroy the edifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not said that everyone who builds
    wood, hay and stubble, shall be saved as by fire, but only those who build
    "upon" the "foundation." And this foundation is not dead faith, as some have
    esteemed, but faith quickened by charity, according to Eph. 3:17: "Rooted
    and founded in charity." Accordingly, he that dies in mortal sin with venial
    sins, has indeed wood, hay, and stubble, but not built upon the spiritual
    edifice; and consequently he will not be saved so as by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although those who are withdrawn from
    the care of temporal things, sin venially sometimes, yet they commit but
    slight venial sins, and in most cases they are cleansed by the fervor of
    charity: wherefore they do not build up venial sins, because these do not
    remain long in them. But the venial sins of those who are busy about earthly
    remain longer, because they are unable to have such frequent recourse to the
    fervor of charity in order to remove them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (De Coelo i,
    text. 2), "all things are comprised under three, the beginning, the middle,
    the end." Accordingly all degrees of venial sins are reduced to three, viz.
    to "wood," which remains longer in the fire; "stubble," which is burnt up at
    once; and "hay," which is between these two: because venial sins are removed
    by fire, quickly or slowly, according as man is more or less attached to
    them.<br />

    Whether man could commit a venial sin in the state of innocence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man could commit a venial sin
    in the state of innocence. Because on 1 Tim. 2:14, "Adam was not seduced," a
    gloss says: "Having had no experience of God's severity, it was possible for
    him to be so mistaken as to think that what he had done was a venial sin."
    But he would not have thought this unless he could have committed a venial
    sin. Therefore he could commit a venial sin without sinning mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 5): "We
    must not suppose that the tempter would have overcome man, unless first of
    all there had arisen in man's soul a movement of vainglory which should have
    been checked." Now the vainglory which preceded man's defeat, which was
    accomplished through his falling into mortal sin, could be nothing more than
    a venial sin. In like manner, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 5) that "man
    was allured by a certain desire of making the experiment, when he saw that
    the woman did not die when she had taken the forbidden fruit." Again there
    seems to have been a certain movement of unbelief in Eve, since she doubted
    what the Lord had said, as appears from her saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A3"
      >Gn. 3:3</a
    >): "Lest perhaps we die." Now these apparently were venial sins. Therefore
    man could commit a venial sin before he committed a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, mortal sin is more opposed to the
    integrity of the original state, than venial sin is. Now man could sin
    mortally notwithstanding the integrity of the original state. Therefore he
    could also sin venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Every sin deserves some punishment. But
    nothing penal was possible in the state of innocence, as Augustine declares
    (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10). Therefore he could commit a sin that would not
    deprive him of that state of integrity. But venial sin does not change man's
    state. Therefore he could not sin venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is generally admitted that man could not
    commit a venial sin in the state of innocence. This, however, is not to be
    understood as though on account of the perfection of his state, the sin
    which is venial for us would have been mortal for him, if he had committed
    it. Because the dignity of a person is circumstance that aggravates a sin,
    but it does not transfer it to another species, unless there be an
    additional deformity by reason of disobedience, or vow or the like, which
    does not apply to the question in point. Consequently what is venial in
    itself could not be changed into mortal by reason of the excellence of the
    original state. We must therefore understand this to mean that he could not
    sin venially, because it was impossible for him to commit a sin which was
    venial in itself, before losing the integrity of the original state by
    sinning mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason for this is because venial sin occurs in us, either through the
    imperfection of the act, as in the case of sudden movements, in a genus of
    mortal sin or through some inordinateness in respect of things referred to
    the end, the due order of the end being safeguarded. Now each of these
    happens on account of some defect of order, by reason of the lower powers
    not being checked by the higher. Because the sudden rising of a movement of
    the sensuality in us is due to the sensuality not being perfectly subject to
    reason: and the sudden rising of a movement of reason itself is due, in us,
    to the fact that the execution of the act of reason is not subject to the
    act of deliberation which proceeds from a higher good, as stated above (<a
      href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1"
      >Question [74]</a
    >, <a href="FS074.html#FSQ74A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>); and that the human
    mind be out of order as regards things directed to the end, the due order of
    the end being safeguarded, is due to the fact that the things referred to
    the end are not infallibly directed under the end, which holds the highest
    place, being the beginning, as it were, in matters concerning the appetite,
    as stated above (<a href="FS010.html#FSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>,
    <a href="FS010.html#FSQ10ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2, ad 3;
    <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>,
    <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now, in the state of
    innocence, as stated in the FP, Question [95], Article [1], there was an
    unerring stability of order, so that the lower powers were always subjected
    to the higher, so long as man remained subject to God, as Augustine says (De
    Civ. Dei xiv, 13). Hence there can be no inordinateness in man, unless first
    of all the highest part of man were not subject to God, which constitutes a
    mortal sin. From this it is evident that, in the state of innocence, man
    could not commit a venial sin, before committing a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the passage quoted, venial is not
    taken in the same sense as we take it now; but by venial sin we mean that
    which is easily forgiven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This vainglory which preceded man's
    downfall, was his first mortal sin, for it is stated to have preceded his
    downfall into the outward act of sin. This vainglory was followed, in the
    man, by the desire to make and experiment, and in the woman, by doubt, for
    she gave way to vainglory, merely through hearing the serpent mention the
    precept, as though she refused to be held in check by the precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mortal sin is opposed to the integrity
    of the original state in the fact of its destroying that state: this a
    venial sin cannot do. And because the integrity of the primitive state is
    incompatible with any inordinateness whatever, the result is that the first
    man could not sin venially, before committing a mortal sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether a good or a wicked angel can sin venially?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a good or wicked angel can sin
    venially. Because man agrees with the angels in the higher part of his soul
    which is called the mind, according to Gregory, who says (Hom. xxix in
    Evang.) that "man understands in common with the angels." But man can commit
    a venial sin in the higher part of his soul. Therefore an angel can commit a
    venial sin also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, He that can do more can do less. But an
    angel could love a created good more than God, and he did, by sinning
    mortally. Therefore he could also love a creature less than God
    inordinately, by sinning venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, wicked angels seem to do things which
    are venial sins generically, by provoking men to laughter, and other like
    frivolities. Now the circumstance of the person does not make a mortal sin
    to be venial as stated above (<a href="FS089.html#FSQ89A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), unless there is a special prohibition, which is not the case in point.
    Therefore an angel can sin venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The perfection of an angel is greater than
    that of man in the primitive state. But man could not sin venially in the
    primitive state, and much less, therefore, can an angel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An angel's intellect, as stated above in the
    FP, Question [58], Article [3]; FP, Question [79], Article [8], is not
    discursive, i.e. it does not proceed from principles to conclusions, so as
    to understand both separately, as we do. Consequently, whenever the angelic
    intellect considers a conclusion, it must, of necessity, consider it in its
    principles. Now in matters of appetite, as we have often stated (<a
      href="FS008.html#FSQ8OUTP1"
      >Question [8]</a
    >, <a href="FS008.html#FSQ8A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS010.html#FSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>,

    <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>,
    <a href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), ends are like
    principles, while the means are like conclusions. Wherefore, an angel's mind
    is not directed to the means, except as they stand under the order to the
    end. Consequently, from their very nature, they can have no inordinateness
    in respect of the means, unless at the same time they have an inordinateness
    in respect of the end, and this is a mortal sin. Now good angels are not
    moved to the means, except in subordination to the due end which is God:
    wherefore all their acts are acts of charity, so that no venial sin can be
    in them. On the other hand, wicked angels are moved to nothing except in
    subordination to the end which is their sin of pride. Therefore they sin
    mortally in everything that they do of their own will. This does not apply
    to the appetite for the natural good, which appetite we have stated to be in
    them (<a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP063.html#FPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,

    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="FS064.html#FSQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 5).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man does indeed agree with the angels in
    the mind or intellect, but he differs in his mode of understanding, as
    stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An angel could not love a creature less
    than God, without, at the same time, either referring it to God, as the last
    end, or to some inordinate end, for the reason given above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The demons incite man to all such things
    which seem venial, that he may become used to them, so as to lead him on to
    mortal sin. Consequently in all such things they sin mortally, on account of
    the end they have in view.<br />

    Whether the first movements of the sensuality in unbelievers are mortal
    sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first movements of the
    sensuality in unbelievers are mortal sins. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A1"
      >Rm. 8:1</a
    >) that "there is... no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who
    walk not according to the flesh": and he is speaking there of the
    concupiscence of the sensuality, as appears from the context (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7"
      >Rm. 7</a
    >). Therefore the reason why concupiscence is not a matter of condemnation
    to those who walk not according to the flesh, i.e. by consenting to
    concupiscence, is because they are in Christ Jesus. But unbelievers are not
    in Christ Jesus. Therefore in unbelievers this is a matter of condemnation.
    Therefore the first movements of unbelievers are mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further Anselm says (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. vii):
    "Those who are not in Christ, when they feel the sting of the flesh, follow
    the road of damnation, even if they walk not according to the flesh." But
    damnation is not due save to mortal sin. Therefore, since man feels the
    sting of the flesh in the first movements of the concupiscence, it seems
    that the first movements of concupiscence in unbelievers are mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Anselm says (De Gratia et Lib. Arb.
    vii): "Man was so made that he was not liable to feel concupiscence." Now
    this liability seems to be remitted to man by the grace of Baptism, which
    the unbeliever has not. Therefore every act of concupiscence in an
    unbeliever, even without his consent, is a mortal sin, because he acts
    against his duty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in Acts 10:34 that "God is not a
    respecter of persons." Therefore he does not impute to one unto
    condemnation, what He does not impute to another. But he does not impute
    first movements to believers, unto condemnation. Neither therefore does He
    impute them to unbelievers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is unreasonable to say that the first
    movements of unbelievers are mortal sins, when they do not consent to them.
    This is evident for two reasons. First, because the sensuality itself could
    not be the subject of mortal sin, as stated above (<a
      href="FS079.html#FSQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="FS079.html#FSQ79A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now the sensuality
    has the same nature in unbelievers as in believers. Therefore it is not
    possible for the mere movements of the sensuality in unbelievers, to be
    mortal sins. Secondly, from the state of the sinner. Because excellence of
    the person of the person never diminishes sin, but, on the contrary,
    increases it, as stated above (<a href="FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1"
      >Question [73]</a
    >, <a href="FS073.html#FSQ73A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). Therefore a sin is
    not less grievous in a believer than in an unbeliever, but much more so. For
    the sins of an unbeliever are more deserving of forgiveness, on account of
    their ignorance, according to 1 Tim. 1:13: "I obtained the mercy of God,
    because I did it ignorantly in my unbelief": whereas the sins of believers
    are more grievous on account of the sacraments of grace, according to Heb.
    10:29: "How much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments... who
    hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was
    sanctified?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking of the
    condemnation due to original sin, which condemnation is remitted by the
    grace of Jesus Christ, although the "fomes" of concupiscence remain.
    Wherefore the fact that believers are subject to concupiscence is not in
    them a sign of the condemnation due to original sin, as it is in
    unbelievers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way also is to be understood the saying of Anselm, wherefore the
    Reply to the Second Objection is evident.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This freedom from liability to
    concupiscence was a result of original justice. Wherefore that which is
    opposed to such liability pertains, not to actual but to original sin.<br />

    Whether venial sin can be in anyone with original sin alone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin can be in a man
    with original sin alone. For disposition precedes habit. Now venial sin is a
    disposition to mortal sin, as stated above (<a href="FS088.html#FSQ88OUTP1"
      >Question [88]</a
    >, <a href="FS088.html#FSQ88A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore in an
    unbeliever, in whom original sin is not remitted, venial sin exists before
    mortal sin: and so sometimes unbelievers have venial together with original
    sin, and without mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, venial sin has less in common, and less
    connection with mortal sin, than one mortal sin has with another. But an
    unbeliever in the state of original sin, can commit one mortal sin without
    committing another. Therefore he can also commit a venial sin without
    committing a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is possible to fix the time at which
    a child is first able to commit an actual sin: and when the child comes to
    that time, it can stay a short time at least, without committing a mortal
    sin, because this happens in the worst criminals. Now it is possible for the
    child to sin venially during that space of time, however short it may be.
    Therefore venial sin can be in anyone with original sin alone and without
    mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Man is punished for original sin in the
    children's limbo, where there is no pain of sense as we shall state further
    on (SS, Question [69], Article [6]): whereas men are punished in hell for no
    other than mortal sin. Therefore there will be no place where a man can be
    punished for venial sin with no other than original sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for venial sin to be in anyone
    with original sin alone, and without mortal sin. The reason for this is
    because before a man comes to the age of discretion, the lack of years
    hinders the use of reason and excuses him from mortal sin, wherefore, much
    more does it excuse him from venial sin, if he does anything which is such
    generically. But when he begins to have the use of reason, he is not
    entirely excused from the guilt of venial or mortal sin. Now the first thing
    that occurs to a man to think about then, is to deliberate about himself.
    And if he then direct himself to the due end, he will, by means of grace,
    receive the remission of original sin: whereas if he does not then direct
    himself to the due end, and as far as he is capable of discretion at that
    particular age, he will sin mortally, for through not doing that which is in
    his power to do. Accordingly thenceforward there cannot be venial sin in him
    without mortal, until afterwards all sin shall have been remitted to him
    through grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial sin always precedes mortal sin
    not as a necessary, but as a contingent disposition, just as work sometimes
    disposes to fever, but not as heat disposes to the form of fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Venial sin is prevented from being with
    original sin alone, not on account of its want of connection or likeness,
    but on account of the lack of use of reason, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The child that is beginning to have the
    use of reason can refrain from other mortal sins for a time, but it is not
    free from the aforesaid sin of omission, unless it turns to God as soon as
    possible. For the first thing that occurs to a man who has discretion, is to
    think of himself, and to direct other things to himself as to their end,
    since the end is the first thing in the intention. Therefore this is the
    time when man is bound by God's affirmative precept, which the Lord
    expressed by saying (Zach. 1:3): "Turn ye to Me... and I will turn to
    you."<br />
