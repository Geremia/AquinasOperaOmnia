<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider consent; concerning which there are four points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether consent is an act of the appetitive or of the apprehensive 
power?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent belongs only to the apprehensive part 
of the soul. For Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12) ascribes consent to the 
higher reason. But the reason is an apprehensive power. Therefore consent 
belongs to an apprehensive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, consent is "co-sense." But sense is an apprehensive 
power. Therefore consent is the act of an apprehensive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as assent is an application of the intellect to 
something, so is consent. But assent belongs to the intellect, which is 
an apprehensive power. Therefore consent also belongs to an apprehensive 
power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "if a man 
judge without affection for that of which he judges, there is no 
sentence," i.e. consent. But affection belongs to the appetitive power. 
Therefore consent does also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Consent implies application of sense to something. Now it 
is proper to sense to take cognizance of things present; for the 
imagination apprehends the similitude of corporeal things, even in the 
absence of the things of which they bear the likeness; while the 
intellect apprehends universal ideas, which it can apprehend 
indifferently, whether the singulars be present or absent. And since the 
act of an appetitive power is a kind of inclination to the thing itself, 
the application of the appetitive power to the thing, in so far as it 
cleaves to it, gets by a kind of similitude, the name of sense, since, as 
it were, it acquires direct knowledge of the thing to which it cleaves, 
in so far as it takes complacency in it. Hence it is written (Wis. 1:1): 
"Think of [Sentite] the Lord in goodness." And on these grounds consent 
is an act of the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated in De Anima iii, 9, "the will is in the reason." 
Hence, when Augustine ascribes consent to the reason, he takes reason as 
including the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sense, properly speaking, belongs to the apprehensive 
faculty; but by way of similitude, in so far as it implies seeking 
acquaintance, it belongs to the appetitive power, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Assentire" [to assent] is, to speak, "ad aliud sentire" 
[to feel towards something]; and thus it implies a certain distance from 
that to which assent is given. But "consentire" [to consent] is "to feel 
with," and this implies a certain union to the object of consent. Hence 
the will, to which it belongs to tend to the thing itself, is more 
properly said to consent: whereas the intellect, whose act does not 
consist in a movement towards the thing, but rather the reverse, as we 
have stated in the FP, Question [16],  Article [1]; FP, Question [27], Article [4]; FP, Question [59], Article [2], is 
more properly said to assent: although one word is wont to be used for 
the other [*In Latin rather than in English.]. We may also say that the 
intellect assents, in so far as it is moved by the will.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent is to be found in irrational animals. 
For consent implies a determination of the appetite to one thing. But the 
appetite of irrational animals is determinate to one thing. Therefore 
consent is to be found in irrational animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if you remove what is first, you remove what follows. 
But consent precedes the accomplished act. If therefore there were no 
consent in irrational animals, there would be no act accomplished; which 
is clearly false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are sometimes said to consent to do something, 
through some passion; desire, for instance, or anger. But irrational 
animals act through passion. Therefore they consent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "after 
judging, man approves and embraces the judgment of his counselling, and 
this is called the sentence," i.e. consent. But counsel is not in 
irrational animals. Therefore neither is consent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Consent, properly speaking, is not in irrational animals. 
The reason of this is that consent implies an application of the 
appetitive movement to something as to be done. Now to apply the 
appetitive movement to the doing of something, belongs to the subject in 
whose power it is to move the appetite: thus to touch a stone is an 
action suitable to a stick, but to apply the stick so that it touch the 
stone, belongs to one who has the power of moving the stick. But 
irrational animals have not the command of the appetitive movement; for 
this is in them through natural instinct. Hence in the irrational animal, 
there is indeed the movement of the appetite, but it does not apply that 
movement to some particular thing. And hence it is that the irrational 
animal is not properly said to consent: this is proper to the rational 
nature, which has the command of the appetitive movement, and is able to 
apply or not to apply it to this or that thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In irrational animals the determination of the appetite to 
a particular thing is merely passive: whereas consent implies a 
determination of the appetite, which is active rather than merely passive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the first be removed, then what follows is removed, 
provided that, properly speaking, it follow from that only. But if 
something can follow from several things, it is not removed by the fact 
that one of them is removed; thus if hardening is the effect of heat and 
of cold (since bricks are hardened by the fire, and frozen water is 
hardened by the cold), then by removing  heat it does not follow that 
there is no hardening. Now the accomplishment of an act follows not only 
from consent, but also from the impulse of the appetite, such as is found 
in irrational animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The man who acts through passion is able not to follow the 
passion: whereas irrational animals have not that power. Hence the 
comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether consent is directed to the end or to the means?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent is directed to the end. Because that 
on account of which a thing is such is still more such. But it is on 
account of the end that we consent to the means. Therefore, still more do 
we consent to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the act of the intemperate man is his end, just as the 
act of the virtuous man is his end. But the intemperate man consents to 
his own act. Therefore consent can be directed to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, desire of the means is choice, as stated above (<A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). If therefore consent were only directed to the means it would 
nowise differ from choice. And this is proved to be false by the 
authority of Damascene who says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "after the 
approval" which he calls "the sentence," "comes the choice." Therefore 
consent is not only directed to the means.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that the 
"sentence," i.e. the consent, takes place "when a man approves and 
embraces the judgment of his counsel." But counsel is only about the 
means. Therefore the same applies to consent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Consent is the application of the appetitive movement to 
something that is already in the power of him who causes the application. 
Now the order of action is this: First there is the apprehension of the 
end; then the desire of the end; then the counsel about the means; then 
the desire of the means. Now the appetite tends to the last end 
naturally: wherefore the application of the appetitive movement to the 
apprehended end has not the nature of consent, but of simple volition. 
But as to those things which come under consideration after the last end, 
in so far as they are directed to the end, they come under counsel: and 
so counsel can be applied to them, in so far as the appetitive movement 
is applied to the judgment resulting from counsel. But the appetitive 
movement to the end is not applied to counsel: rather is counsel applied 
to it, because counsel presupposes the desire of the end. On the other 
hand, the desire of the means presupposes the decision of counsel. And 
therefore the application of the appetitive movement to counsel's 
decision is consent, properly speaking. Consequently, since counsel is 
only about the means, consent, properly speaking, is of nothing else but 
the means.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the knowledge of conclusions through the principles 
is science, whereas the knowledge of the principles is not science, but 
something higher, namely, understanding; so do we consent to the means on 
account of the end, in respect of which our act is not consent but 
something greater, namely, volition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Delight in his act, rather than the act itself, is the end 
of the intemperate man, and for sake of this delight he consents to that 
act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Choice includes something that consent has not, namely, a 
certain relation to something to which something else is preferred: and 
therefore after consent there still remains a choice. For it may happen 
that by aid of counsel several means have been found conducive to the 
end, and through each of these meeting with approval, consent has been 
given to each: but after approving of many, we have given our preference 
to one by choosing it. But if only one meets with approval, then consent 
and choice do not differ in reality, but only in our way of looking at 
them; so that we call it consent, according as we approve of doing that 
thing; but choice according as we prefer it to those that do not meet 
with our approval.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether consent to the act belongs only to the higher part of the soul?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent to the act does not always belong to 
the higher reason. For "delight follows action, and perfects it, just as 
beauty perfects youth" [*oion tois akmaiois he hora}--as youthful vigor 
perfects a man in his prime] (Ethic. x, 4). But consent to delight 
belongs to the lower reason, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12). 
Therefore consent to the act does not belong only to the higher reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an act to which we consent is said to be voluntary. But 
it belongs to many powers to produce voluntary acts. Therefore the higher 
reason is not alone in consenting to the act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "the higher reason is that which is intent on the 
contemplation and consultation of things eternal," as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xii, 7). But man often consents to an act not for eternal, but for 
temporal reasons, or even on account of some passion of the soul. 
Therefore consent to an act does not belong to the higher reason alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12): "It is impossible 
for man to make up his mind to commit a sin, unless that mental faculty 
which has the sovereign power of urging his members to, or restraining 
them from, act, yield to the evil deed and become its slave."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The final decision belongs to him who holds the highest 
place, and to whom it belongs to judge of the others; for  as long as 
judgment about some matter remains to be pronounced, the final decision 
has not been given. Now it is evident that it belongs to the higher 
reason to judge of all: since it is by the reason that we judge of 
sensible things; and of things pertaining to human principles we judge 
according to Divine principles, which is the function of the higher 
reason. Wherefore as long as a man is uncertain whether he resists or 
not, according to Divine principles, no judgment of the reason can be 
considered in the light of a final decision. Now the final decision of 
what is to be done is consent to the act. Therefore consent to the act 
belongs to the higher reason; but in that sense in which the reason 
includes the will, as stated above (<A Href="FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Consent to delight in the work done belongs to the higher 
reason, as also does consent to the work; but consent to delight in 
thought belongs to the lower reason, just as to the lower reason it 
belongs to think. Nevertheless the higher reason exercises judgment on 
the fact of thinking or not thinking, considered as an action; and in 
like manner on the delight that results. But in so far as the act of 
thinking is considered as ordained to a further act, it belongs to the 
lower reason. For that which is ordained to something else, belongs to a 
lower art or power than does the end to which it is ordained: hence the 
art which is concerned with the end is called the master or principal art.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since actions are called voluntary from the fact that we 
consent to them, it does not follow that consent is an act of each power, 
but of the will which is in the reason, as stated above (<A Href="FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), and 
from which the voluntary act is named.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[15] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The higher reason is said to consent not only because it 
always moves to act, according to the eternal reasons; but also because 
it fails to dissent according to those same reasons.<br>
