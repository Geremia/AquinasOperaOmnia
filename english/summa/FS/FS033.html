</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that expansion is not an effect of pleasure. For 
expansion seems to pertain more to love, according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++6%3A11">2 Cor. 6:11</a>): "Our heart is enlarged." Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118%3A96">Ps. 118:96</a>) 
concerning the precept of charity: "Thy commandment is exceeding broad." 
But pleasure is a distinct passion from love. Therefore expansion is not 
an effect of pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, when a thing expands it is enabled to receive more. But 
receiving pertains to desire, which is for something not yet possessed. 
Therefore expansion seems to belong to desire rather than to pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contraction is contrary to expansion. But contraction 
seems to belong to pleasure, for the hand closes on that which we wish to 
grasp firmly: and such is the affection of appetite in regard to that 
which pleases it. Therefore expansion does not pertain to pleasure. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In order to express joy, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++60%3A5">Is. 60:5</a>): 
"Thou shall see and abound, thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged." 
Moreover pleasure is called by the name of "laetitia" as being derived 
from "dilatatio" [expansion], as stated above (<A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="FS031.html#FSQ31A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Breadth [latitudo] is a dimension of bodily magnitude: 
hence it is not applied to the emotions of the soul, save metaphorically. 
Now expansion denotes a kind of movement towards breadth; and it belongs 
to pleasure in respect of the two things requisite for pleasure. One of 
these is on the part of the apprehensive power, which is cognizant of the 
conjunction with some suitable good. As a result of this apprehension, 
man perceives that he has attained a certain perfection, which is a 
magnitude of the spiritual order: and in this respect man's mind is said 
to be magnified or expanded by pleasure. The other requisite for pleasure 
is on the part of the appetitive power, which acquiesces in the 
pleasurable object, and rests therein, offering, as it were, to enfold it 
within itself. And thus man's affection is expanded by pleasure, as 
though it surrendered itself to hold within itself the object of its 
pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In metaphorical expressions nothing hinders one and the 
same thing from being attributed to different things according to 
different likenesses. And in this way expansion pertains to love by 
reason of a certain spreading out, in so far as the affection of the 
lover spreads out to others, so as to care, not only for his own 
interests, but also for what concerns others. On the other hand expansion 
pertains to pleasure, in so far as a thing becomes more ample in itself 
so as to become more capacious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Desire includes a certain expansion arising from the 
imagination of the thing desired; but this expansion increases at the 
presence of the pleasurable object: because the mind surrenders itself 
more to that object when it is already taking pleasure in it, than when 
it desires it before possessing it; since pleasure is the end of desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that takes pleasure in a thing holds it fast, by 
clinging to it with all his might: but he opens his heart to it that he 
may enjoy it perfectly.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether pleasure causes thirst or desire for itself?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not cause desire for itself. 
Because all movement ceases when repose is reached. But pleasure is, as 
it were, a certain repose of the movement of desire, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore the movement of desire ceases when 
pleasure is reached. Therefore pleasure does not cause desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing does not cause its contrary. But  pleasure is, 
in a way, contrary to desire, on the part of the object: since desire 
regards a good which is not yet possessed, whereas pleasure regards the 
good that is possessed. Therefore pleasure does not cause desire for 
itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, distaste is incompatible with desire. But pleasure often 
causes distaste. Therefore it does not cause desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4%3A13">Jn. 4:13</a>): "Whosoever drinketh of this 
water, shall thirst again": where, according to Augustine (Tract. xv in 
Joan.), water denotes pleasures of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Pleasure can be considered in two ways; first, as 
existing in reality; secondly, as existing in the memory. Again thirst, 
or desire, can be taken in two ways; first, properly, as denoting a 
craving for something not possessed; secondly, in general, as excluding 
distaste.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Considered as existing in reality, pleasure does not of itself cause 
thirst or desire for itself, but only accidentally; provided we take 
thirst or desire as denoting a craving for some thing not possessed: 
because pleasure is an emotion of the appetite in respect of something 
actually present. But it may happen that what is actually present is not 
perfectly possessed: and this may be on the part of the thing possessed, 
or on the part of the possessor. On the part of the thing possessed, this 
happens through the thing possessed not being a simultaneous whole; 
wherefore one obtains possession of it successively, and while taking 
pleasure in what one has, one desires to possess the remainder: thus if a 
man is pleased with the first part of a verse, he desires to hear the 
second part, as Augustine says (Confess. iv, 11). In this way nearly all 
bodily pleasures cause thirst for themselves, until they are fully 
realized, because pleasures of this kind arise from some movement: as is 
evident in pleasures of the table. On the part of the possessor, this 
happens when a man possesses a thing which is perfect in itself, yet does 
not possess it perfectly, but obtains possession of it little by little. 
Thus in this life, a faint perception of Divine knowledge affords us 
delight, and delight sets up a thirst or desire for perfect knowledge; in 
which sense we may understand the words of Ecclus. 24:29: "They that 
drink me shall yet thirst."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if by thirst or desire we understand the mere 
intensity of the emotion, that excludes distaste, thus more than all 
others spiritual pleasures cause thirst or desire for themselves. Because 
bodily pleasures become distasteful by reason of their causing an excess 
in the natural mode of being, when they are increased or even when they 
are protracted; as is evident in the case of pleasures of the table. This 
is why, when a man arrives at the point of perfection in bodily 
pleasures, he wearies of them, and sometimes desires another kind. 
Spiritual pleasures, on the contrary, do not exceed the natural mode of 
being, but perfect nature. Hence when their point of perfection is 
reached, then do they afford the greatest delight: except, perchance, 
accidentally,  in so far as the work of contemplation is accompanied by 
some operation of the bodily powers, which tire from protracted activity. 
And in this sense also we may understand those words of Ecclus. 24:29: 
"They that drink me shall yet thirst": for, even of the angels, who know 
God perfectly, and delight in Him, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++1%3A12">1 Pt. 1:12</a>) that they 
"desire to look at Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, if we consider pleasure, not as existing in reality, but as 
existing in the memory, thus it has of itself a natural tendency to cause 
thirst and desire for itself: when, to wit, man returns to that 
disposition, in which he was when he experienced the pleasure that is 
past. But if he be changed from that disposition, the memory of that 
pleasure does not give him pleasure, but distaste: for instance, the 
memory of food in respect of a man who has eaten to repletion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When pleasure is perfect, then it includes complete rest; 
and the movement of desire, tending to what was not possessed, ceases. 
But when it is imperfect, then the desire, tending to what was not 
possessed, does not cease altogether.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which is possessed imperfectly, is possessed in one 
respect, and in another respect is not possessed. Consequently it may be 
the object of desire and pleasure at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Pleasures cause distaste in one way, desire in another, as 
stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether pleasure hinders the use of reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not hinder the use of reason. 
Because repose facilitates very much the due use of reason: wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Phys. vii, 3) that "while we sit and rest, the soul is 
inclined to knowledge and prudence"; and it is written (Wis. 8:16): "When 
I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her," i.e. wisdom. But 
pleasure is a kind of repose. Therefore it helps rather than hinders the 
use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things which are not in the same subject though they be 
contraries, do not hinder one another. But pleasure is in the appetitive 
faculty, while the use of reason is in the apprehensive power. Therefore 
pleasure does not hinder the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is hindered by another, seems to be moved, as 
it were, thereby. But the use of an apprehensive power moves pleasure 
rather than is moved by it: because it is the cause of pleasure. 
Therefore pleasure does not hinder the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 5), that "pleasure 
destroys the estimate of prudence."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] Body Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is stated in Ethic. x, 5, "appropriate pleasures 
increase activity . . . whereas pleasures arising from other sources are 
impediments to activity." Accordingly there is a certain pleasure that is 
taken in the very act of reason, as when one takes pleasure in 
contemplating or in reasoning: and such pleasure does not hinder the act 
of reason, but helps it; because we are more attentive in doing that 
which gives us pleasure, and attention fosters activity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand bodily pleasures hinder the use of reason in three 
ways. First, by distracting the reason. Because, as we have just 
observed, we attend much to that which pleases us. Now when the attention 
is firmly fixed on one thing, it is either weakened in respect of other 
things, or it is entirely withdrawn from them; and thus if the bodily 
pleasure be great, either it entirely hinders the use of reason, by 
concentrating the mind's attention on itself; or else it hinders it 
considerably. Secondly, by being contrary to reason. Because some 
pleasures, especially those that are in excess, are contrary to the order 
of reason: and in this sense the Philosopher says that "bodily pleasures 
destroy the estimate of prudence, but not the speculative estimate," to 
which they are not opposed, "for instance that the three angles of a 
triangle are together equal to two right angles." In the first sense, 
however, they hinder both estimates. Thirdly, by fettering the reason: in 
so far as bodily pleasure is followed by a certain alteration in the 
body, greater even than in the other passions, in proportion as the 
appetite is more vehemently affected towards a present than towards an 
absent thing. Now such bodily disturbances hinder the use of reason; as 
may be seen in the case of drunkards, in whom the use of reason is 
fettered or hindered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bodily pleasure implies indeed repose of the appetite in 
the object of pleasure; which repose is sometimes contrary to reason; but 
on the part of the body it always implies alteration. And in respect of 
both points, it hinders the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The powers of the appetite and of apprehension are indeed 
distinct parts, but belonging to the one soul. Consequently when the soul 
is very intent on the action of one part, it is hindered from attending 
to a contrary act of the other part.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The use of reason requires the due use of the imagination 
and of the other sensitive powers, which are exercised through a bodily 
organ. Consequently alteration in the body hinders the use of reason, 
because it hinders the act of the imagination and of the other sensitive 
powers.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether pleasure perfects operation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not perfect operation. For every 
human operation depends on the use of reason. But  pleasure hinders the 
use of reason, as stated above (<A Href="FS033.html#FSQ33A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore pleasure does not 
perfect, but weakens human operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing perfects itself or its cause. But pleasure is an 
operation (Ethic. vii, 12; x, 4), i.e. either in its essence or in its 
cause. Therefore pleasure does not perfect operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if pleasure perfects operation, it does so either as 
end, or as form, or as agent. But not as end; because operation is not 
sought for the sake of pleasure, but rather the reverse, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): nor as agent, because rather is it the operation that 
causes pleasure: nor again as form, because, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. x, 4), "pleasure does not perfect operation, as a habit does." 
Therefore pleasure does not perfect operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure 
perfects operation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Pleasure perfects operation in two ways. First, as an 
end: not indeed according as an end is that on "account of which a thing 
is"; but according as every good which is added to a thing and completes 
it, can be called its end. And in this sense the Philosopher says (Ethic. 
x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation . . . as some end added to it": 
that is to say, inasmuch as to this good, which is operation, there is 
added another good, which is pleasure, denoting the repose of the 
appetite in a good that is presupposed. Secondly, as agent; not indeed 
directly, for the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects 
operation, not as a physician makes a man healthy, but as health does": 
but it does so indirectly; inasmuch as the agent, through taking pleasure 
in his action, is more eagerly intent on it, and carries it out with 
greater care. And in this sense it is said in Ethic. x, 5 that "pleasures 
increase their appropriate activities, and hinder those that are not 
appropriate."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not every pleasure that hinders the act of reason, 
but only bodily pleasure; for this arises, not from the act of reason, 
but from the act of the concupiscible faculty, which act is intensified 
by pleasure. On the contrary, pleasure that arises from the act of 
reason, strengthens the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in Phys. ii, 3 two things may be causes of one 
another, if one be the efficient, the other the final cause. And in this 
way, operation is the efficient cause of pleasure, while pleasure 
perfects operation by way of final cause, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[33] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection is evident for what has been said.
