    We must now consider the effects of pleasure; and under this head there are
    four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS033.html#FSQ33A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether expansion is an effect of
    pleasure?
  </p>

    desire for itself?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether expansion is an effect of pleasure?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that expansion is not an effect of
    pleasure. For expansion seems to pertain more to love, according to the
    Apostle (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++6%3A11"
      >2 Cor. 6:11</a
    >): "Our heart is enlarged." Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++118%3A96"
      >Ps. 118:96</a
    >) concerning the precept of charity: "Thy commandment is exceeding broad."
    But pleasure is a distinct passion from love. Therefore expansion is not an
    effect of pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, when a thing expands it is enabled to
    receive more. But receiving pertains to desire, which is for something not
    yet possessed. Therefore expansion seems to belong to desire rather than to
    pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contraction is contrary to expansion.
    But contraction seems to belong to pleasure, for the hand closes on that
    which we wish to grasp firmly: and such is the affection of appetite in
    regard to that which pleases it. Therefore expansion does not pertain to
    pleasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In order to express joy, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++60%3A5"
      >Is. 60:5</a
    >): "Thou shall see and abound, thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged."
    Moreover pleasure is called by the name of "laetitia" as being derived from
    "dilatatio" [expansion], as stated above (<a href="FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1"
      >Question [31]</a
    >, <a href="FS031.html#FSQ31A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Breadth [latitudo] is a dimension of bodily
    magnitude: hence it is not applied to the emotions of the soul, save
    metaphorically. Now expansion denotes a kind of movement towards breadth;
    and it belongs to pleasure in respect of the two things requisite for
    pleasure. One of these is on the part of the apprehensive power, which is
    cognizant of the conjunction with some suitable good. As a result of this
    apprehension, man perceives that he has attained a certain perfection, which
    is a magnitude of the spiritual order: and in this respect man's mind is
    said to be magnified or expanded by pleasure. The other requisite for
    pleasure is on the part of the appetitive power, which acquiesces in the
    pleasurable object, and rests therein, offering, as it were, to enfold it
    within itself. And thus man's affection is expanded by pleasure, as though
    it surrendered itself to hold within itself the object of its pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In metaphorical expressions nothing
    hinders one and the same thing from being attributed to different things
    according to different likenesses. And in this way expansion pertains to
    love by reason of a certain spreading out, in so far as the affection of the
    lover spreads out to others, so as to care, not only for his own interests,
    but also for what concerns others. On the other hand expansion pertains to
    pleasure, in so far as a thing becomes more ample in itself so as to become
    more capacious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Desire includes a certain expansion
    arising from the imagination of the thing desired; but this expansion
    increases at the presence of the pleasurable object: because the mind
    surrenders itself more to that object when it is already taking pleasure in
    it, than when it desires it before possessing it; since pleasure is the end
    of desire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that takes pleasure in a thing holds
    it fast, by clinging to it with all his might: but he opens his heart to it
    that he may enjoy it perfectly.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether pleasure causes thirst or desire for itself?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not cause desire
    for itself. Because all movement ceases when repose is reached. But pleasure
    is, as it were, a certain repose of the movement of desire, as stated above
    (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore the movement
    of desire ceases when pleasure is reached. Therefore pleasure does not cause
    desire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing does not cause its contrary. But
    pleasure is, in a way, contrary to desire, on the part of the object: since
    desire regards a good which is not yet possessed, whereas pleasure regards
    the good that is possessed. Therefore pleasure does not cause desire for
    itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, distaste is incompatible with desire.
    But pleasure often causes distaste. Therefore it does not cause desire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A13"
      >Jn. 4:13</a
    >): "Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again": where, according
    to Augustine (Tract. xv in Joan.), water denotes pleasures of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Pleasure can be considered in two ways; first,
    as existing in reality; secondly, as existing in the memory. Again thirst,
    or desire, can be taken in two ways; first, properly, as denoting a craving
    for something not possessed; secondly, in general, as excluding distaste.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Considered as existing in reality, pleasure does not of itself cause thirst
    or desire for itself, but only accidentally; provided we take thirst or
    desire as denoting a craving for some thing not possessed: because pleasure
    is an emotion of the appetite in respect of something actually present. But
    it may happen that what is actually present is not perfectly possessed: and
    this may be on the part of the thing possessed, or on the part of the
    possessor. On the part of the thing possessed, this happens through the
    thing possessed not being a simultaneous whole; wherefore one obtains
    possession of it successively, and while taking pleasure in what one has,
    one desires to possess the remainder: thus if a man is pleased with the
    first part of a verse, he desires to hear the second part, as Augustine says
    (Confess. iv, 11). In this way nearly all bodily pleasures cause thirst for
    themselves, until they are fully realized, because pleasures of this kind
    arise from some movement: as is evident in pleasures of the table. On the
    part of the possessor, this happens when a man possesses a thing which is
    perfect in itself, yet does not possess it perfectly, but obtains possession
    of it little by little. Thus in this life, a faint perception of Divine
    knowledge affords us delight, and delight sets up a thirst or desire for
    perfect knowledge; in which sense we may understand the words of Ecclus.
    24:29: "They that drink me shall yet thirst."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if by thirst or desire we understand the mere intensity
    of the emotion, that excludes distaste, thus more than all others spiritual
    pleasures cause thirst or desire for themselves. Because bodily pleasures
    become distasteful by reason of their causing an excess in the natural mode
    of being, when they are increased or even when they are protracted; as is
    evident in the case of pleasures of the table. This is why, when a man
    arrives at the point of perfection in bodily pleasures, he wearies of them,
    and sometimes desires another kind. Spiritual pleasures, on the contrary, do
    not exceed the natural mode of being, but perfect nature. Hence when their
    point of perfection is reached, then do they afford the greatest delight:
    except, perchance, accidentally, in so far as the work of contemplation is
    accompanied by some operation of the bodily powers, which tire from
    protracted activity. And in this sense also we may understand those words of
    Ecclus. 24:29: "They that drink me shall yet thirst": for, even of the
    angels, who know God perfectly, and delight in Him, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++1%3A12"
      >1 Pt. 1:12</a
    >) that they "desire to look at Him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, if we consider pleasure, not as existing in reality, but as existing
    in the memory, thus it has of itself a natural tendency to cause thirst and
    desire for itself: when, to wit, man returns to that disposition, in which
    he was when he experienced the pleasure that is past. But if he be changed
    from that disposition, the memory of that pleasure does not give him
    pleasure, but distaste: for instance, the memory of food in respect of a man
    who has eaten to repletion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When pleasure is perfect, then it
    includes complete rest; and the movement of desire, tending to what was not
    possessed, ceases. But when it is imperfect, then the desire, tending to
    what was not possessed, does not cease altogether.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which is possessed imperfectly, is
    possessed in one respect, and in another respect is not possessed.
    Consequently it may be the object of desire and pleasure at the same
    time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Pleasures cause distaste in one way,
    desire in another, as stated above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether pleasure hinders the use of reason?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not hinder the
    use of reason. Because repose facilitates very much the due use of reason:
    wherefore the Philosopher says (Phys. vii, 3) that "while we sit and rest,
    the soul is inclined to knowledge and prudence"; and it is written (Wis.
    8:16): "When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her," i.e.
    wisdom. But pleasure is a kind of repose. Therefore it helps rather than
    hinders the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things which are not in the same subject
    though they be contraries, do not hinder one another. But pleasure is in the
    appetitive faculty, while the use of reason is in the apprehensive power.
    Therefore pleasure does not hinder the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is hindered by another, seems
    to be moved, as it were, thereby. But the use of an apprehensive power moves
    pleasure rather than is moved by it: because it is the cause of pleasure.
    Therefore pleasure does not hinder the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 5), that
    "pleasure destroys the estimate of prudence."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is stated in Ethic. x, 5, "appropriate
    pleasures increase activity... whereas pleasures arising from other sources
    are impediments to activity." Accordingly there is a certain pleasure that
    is taken in the very act of reason, as when one takes pleasure in
    contemplating or in reasoning: and such pleasure does not hinder the act of
    reason, but helps it; because we are more attentive in doing that which
    gives us pleasure, and attention fosters activity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand bodily pleasures hinder the use of reason in three ways.
    First, by distracting the reason. Because, as we have just observed, we
    attend much to that which pleases us. Now when the attention is firmly fixed
    on one thing, it is either weakened in respect of other things, or it is
    entirely withdrawn from them; and thus if the bodily pleasure be great,
    either it entirely hinders the use of reason, by concentrating the mind's
    attention on itself; or else it hinders it considerably. Secondly, by being
    contrary to reason. Because some pleasures, especially those that are in
    excess, are contrary to the order of reason: and in this sense the
    Philosopher says that "bodily pleasures destroy the estimate of prudence,
    but not the speculative estimate," to which they are not opposed, "for
    instance that the three angles of a triangle are together equal to two right
    angles." In the first sense, however, they hinder both estimates. Thirdly,
    by fettering the reason: in so far as bodily pleasure is followed by a
    certain alteration in the body, greater even than in the other passions, in
    proportion as the appetite is more vehemently affected towards a present
    than towards an absent thing. Now such bodily disturbances hinder the use of
    reason; as may be seen in the case of drunkards, in whom the use of reason
    is fettered or hindered.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bodily pleasure implies indeed repose of
    the appetite in the object of pleasure; which repose is sometimes contrary
    to reason; but on the part of the body it always implies alteration. And in
    respect of both points, it hinders the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The powers of the appetite and of
    apprehension are indeed distinct parts, but belonging to the one soul.
    Consequently when the soul is very intent on the action of one part, it is
    hindered from attending to a contrary act of the other part.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The use of reason requires the due use
    of the imagination and of the other sensitive powers, which are exercised
    through a bodily organ. Consequently alteration in the body hinders the use
    of reason, because it hinders the act of the imagination and of the other
    sensitive powers.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether pleasure perfects operation?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that pleasure does not perfect
    operation. For every human operation depends on the use of reason. But
    pleasure hinders the use of reason, as stated above (<a
      href="FS033.html#FSQ33A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Therefore pleasure does not perfect, but weakens human operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing perfects itself or its cause.
    But pleasure is an operation (Ethic. vii, 12; x, 4), i.e. either in its
    essence or in its cause. Therefore pleasure does not perfect operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if pleasure perfects operation, it does
    so either as end, or as form, or as agent. But not as end; because operation
    is not sought for the sake of pleasure, but rather the reverse, as stated
    above (<a href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="FS004.html#FSQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): nor as agent, because
    rather is it the operation that causes pleasure: nor again as form, because,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. x, 4), "pleasure does not perfect
    operation, as a habit does." Therefore pleasure does not perfect
    operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that
    "pleasure perfects operation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Pleasure perfects operation in two ways. First,
    as an end: not indeed according as an end is that on "account of which a
    thing is"; but according as every good which is added to a thing and
    completes it, can be called its end. And in this sense the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation... as some end added to it":
    that is to say, inasmuch as to this good, which is operation, there is added
    another good, which is pleasure, denoting the repose of the appetite in a
    good that is presupposed. Secondly, as agent; not indeed directly, for the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that "pleasure perfects operation, not as a
    physician makes a man healthy, but as health does": but it does so
    indirectly; inasmuch as the agent, through taking pleasure in his action, is
    more eagerly intent on it, and carries it out with greater care. And in this
    sense it is said in Ethic. x, 5 that "pleasures increase their appropriate
    activities, and hinder those that are not appropriate."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not every pleasure that hinders
    the act of reason, but only bodily pleasure; for this arises, not from the
    act of reason, but from the act of the concupiscible faculty, which act is
    intensified by pleasure. On the contrary, pleasure that arises from the act
    of reason, strengthens the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in Phys. ii, 3 two things may
    be causes of one another, if one be the efficient, the other the final
    cause. And in this way, operation is the efficient cause of pleasure, while
    pleasure perfects operation by way of final cause, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Reply to the Third Objection is evident for what has been said.</p>
