  <h3 align="center">OF THE POWER OF HUMAN LAW (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the power of human law. Under this head there are six
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether human law should be framed
    for the community?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether human law should repress
    all vices?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether human law is competent to
    direct all acts of virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it binds man in
    conscience?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether all men are subject to
    human law?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether those who are under the
    law may act beside the letter of the law?<br />

    Whether human law should be framed for the community rather than for the
    individual?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human law should be framed not
    for the community, but rather for the individual. For the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. v, 7) that "the legal just... includes all particular acts of
    legislation... and all those matters which are the subject of decrees,"
    which are also individual matters, since decrees are framed about individual
    actions. Therefore law is framed not only for the community, but also for
    the individual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, law is the director of human acts, as
    stated above (<a href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But human acts are
    about individual matters. Therefore human laws should be framed, not for the
    community, but rather for the individual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, law is a rule and measure of human acts,
    as stated above (<a href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But a measure should
    be most certain, as stated in Metaph. x. Since therefore in human acts no
    general proposition can be so certain as not to fail in some individual
    cases, it seems that laws should be framed not in general but for individual
    cases.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The jurist says (Pandect. Justin. lib. i,
    tit. iii, art. ii; De legibus, etc.) that "laws should be made to suit the
    majority of instances; and they are not framed according to what may
    possibly happen in an individual case."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever is for an end should be proportionate
    to that end. Now the end of law is the common good; because, as Isidore says
    (Etym. v, 21) that "law should be framed, not for any private benefit, but
    for the common good of all the citizens." Hence human laws should be
    proportionate to the common good. Now the common good comprises many things.
    Wherefore law should take account of many things, as to persons, as to
    matters, and as to times. Because the community of the state is composed of
    many persons; and its good is procured by many actions; nor is it
    established to endure for only a short time, but to last for all time by the
    citizens succeeding one another, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21;
    xxii, 6).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. v, 7) divides
    the legal just, i.e. positive law, into three parts. For some things are
    laid down simply in a general way: and these are the general laws. Of these
    he says that "the legal is that which originally was a matter of
    indifference, but which, when enacted, is so no longer": as the fixing of
    the ransom of a captive. Some things affect the community in one respect,
    and individuals in another. These are called "privileges," i.e. "private
    laws," as it were, because they regard private persons, although their power
    extends to many matters; and in regard to these, he adds, "and further, all
    particular acts of legislation." Other matters are legal, not through being
    laws, but through being applications of general laws to particular cases:
    such are decrees which have the force of law; and in regard to these, he
    adds "all matters subject to decrees."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A principle of direction should be
    applicable to many; wherefore (Metaph. x, text. 4) the Philosopher says that
    all things belonging to one genus, are measured by one, which is the
    principle in that genus. For if there were as many rules or measures as
    there are things measured or ruled, they would cease to be of use, since
    their use consists in being applicable to many things. Hence law would be of
    no use, if it did not extend further than to one single act. Because the
    decrees than to one single act. Because the decrees of prudent men are made
    for the purpose of directing individual actions; whereas law is a general
    precept, as stated above (<a href="FS092.html#FSQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>,
    <a href="FS092.html#FSQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [2]).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "We must not seek the same degree of
    certainty in all things" (Ethic. i, 3). Consequently in contingent matters,
    such as natural and human things, it is enough for a thing to be certain, as
    being true in the greater number of instances, though at times and less
    frequently it fail.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it belongs to the human law to repress all vices?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it belongs to human law to
    repress all vices. For Isidore says (Etym. v, 20) that "laws were made in
    order that, in fear thereof, man's audacity might be held in check." But it
    would not be held in check sufficiently, unless all evils were repressed by
    law. Therefore human laws should repress all evils.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the intention of the lawgiver is to make
    the citizens virtuous. But a man cannot be virtuous unless he forbear from
    all kinds of vice. Therefore it belongs to human law to repress all
    vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human law is derived from the natural
    law, as stated above (<a href="FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>,
    <a href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But all vices are
    contrary to the law of nature. Therefore human law should repress all
    vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> We read in De Lib. Arb. i, 5: "It seems to me
    that the law which is written for the governing of the people rightly
    permits these things, and that Divine providence punishes them." But Divine
    providence punishes nothing but vices. Therefore human law rightly allows
    some vices, by not repressing them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1"
      >Question [90]</a
    >, <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), law is framed as a
    rule or measure of human acts. Now a measure should be homogeneous with that
    which it measures, as stated in Metaph. x, text. 3,4, since different things
    are measured by different measures. Wherefore laws imposed on men should
    also be in keeping with their condition, for, as Isidore says (Etym. v, 21),
    law should be "possible both according to nature, and according to the
    customs of the country." Now possibility or faculty of action is due to an
    interior habit or disposition: since the same thing is not possible to one
    who has not a virtuous habit, as is possible to one who has. Thus the same
    is not possible to a child as to a full-grown man: for which reason the law
    for children is not the same as for adults, since many things are permitted
    to children, which in an adult are punished by law or at any rate are open
    to blame. In like manner many things are permissible to men not perfect in
    virtue, which would be intolerable in a virtuous man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now human law is framed for a number of human beings, the majority of whom
    are not perfect in virtue. Wherefore human laws do not forbid all vices,
    from which the virtuous abstain, but only the more grievous vices, from
    which it is possible for the majority to abstain; and chiefly those that are
    to the hurt of others, without the prohibition of which human society could
    not be maintained: thus human law prohibits murder, theft and such like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Audacity seems to refer to the assailing
    of others. Consequently it belongs to those sins chiefly whereby one's
    neighbor is injured: and these sins are forbidden by human law, as
    stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The purpose of human law is to lead men
    to virtue, not suddenly, but gradually. Wherefore it does not lay upon the
    multitude of imperfect men the burdens of those who are already virtuous,
    viz. that they should abstain from all evil. Otherwise these imperfect ones,
    being unable to bear such precepts, would break out into yet greater evils:
    thus it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++30%3A33"
      >Ps. 30:33</a
    >): "He that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++9%3A17"
      >Mt. 9:17</a
    >) that if "new wine," i.e. precepts of a perfect life, "is put into old
    bottles," i.e. into imperfect men, "the bottles break, and the wine runneth
    out," i.e. the precepts are despised, and those men, from contempt, break
    into evils worse still.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The natural law is a participation in us
    of the eternal law: while human law falls short of the eternal law. Now
    Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5): "The law which is framed for the
    government of states, allows and leaves unpunished many things that are
    punished by Divine providence. Nor, if this law does not attempt to do
    everything, is this a reason why it should be blamed for what it does."
    Wherefore, too, human law does not prohibit everything that is forbidden by
    the natural law.<br />

    Whether human law prescribes acts of all the virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human law does not prescribe
    acts of all the virtues. For vicious acts are contrary to acts of virtue.
    But human law does not prohibit all vices, as stated above (<a
      href="FS096.html#FSQ96A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Therefore neither does it prescribe all acts of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a virtuous act proceeds from a virtue.
    But virtue is the end of law; so that whatever is from a virtue, cannot come
    under a precept of law. Therefore human law does not prescribe all acts of
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, law is ordained to the common good, as
    stated above (<a href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But some acts of virtue
    are ordained, not to the common good, but to private good. Therefore the law
    does not prescribe all acts of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that the
    law "prescribes the performance of the acts of a brave man... and the acts
    of the temperate man... and the acts of the meek man: and in like manner as
    regards the other virtues and vices, prescribing the former, forbidding the
    latter."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The species of virtues are distinguished by
    their objects, as explained above (<a href="FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1"
      >Question [54]</a
    >, <a href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now all the objects of
    virtues can be referred either to the private good of an individual, or to
    the common good of the multitude: thus matters of fortitude may be achieved
    either for the safety of the state, or for upholding the rights of a friend,
    and in like manner with the other virtues. But law, as stated above (<a
      href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1"
      >Question [90]</a
    >, <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) is ordained to the
    common good. Wherefore there is no virtue whose acts cannot be prescribed by
    the law. Nevertheless human law does not prescribe concerning all the acts
    of every virtue: but only in regard to those that are ordainable to the
    common good---either immediately, as when certain things are done directly
    for the common good---or mediately, as when a lawgiver prescribes certain
    things pertaining to good order, whereby the citizens are directed in the
    upholding of the common good of justice and peace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Human law does not forbid all vicious
    acts, by the obligation of a precept, as neither does it prescribe all acts
    of virtue. But it forbids certain acts of each vice, just as it prescribes
    some acts of each virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An act is said to be an act of virtue in
    two ways. First, from the fact that a man does something virtuous; thus the
    act of justice is to do what is right, and an act of fortitude is to do
    brave things: and in this way law prescribes certain acts of virtue.
    Secondly an act of virtue is when a man does a virtuous thing in a way in
    which a virtuous man does it. Such an act always proceeds from virtue: and
    it does not come under a precept of law, but is the end at which every
    lawgiver aims.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is no virtue whose act is not
    ordainable to the common good, as stated above, either mediately or
    immediately.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether human law binds a man in conscience?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human law does not bind man in
    conscience. For an inferior power has no jurisdiction in a court of higher
    power. But the power of man, which frames human law, is beneath the Divine
    power. Therefore human law cannot impose its precept in a Divine court, such
    as is the court of conscience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the judgment of conscience depends
    chiefly on the commandments of God. But sometimes God's commandments are
    made void by human laws, according to Mt. 15:6: "You have made void the
    commandment of God for your tradition." Therefore human law does not bind a
    man in conscience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human laws often bring loss of character
    and injury on man, according to Is. 10:1 et seqq.: "Woe to them that make
    wicked laws, and when they write, write injustice; to oppress the poor in
    judgment, and do violence to the cause of the humble of My people." But it
    is lawful for anyone to avoid oppression and violence. Therefore human laws
    do not bind man in conscience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++2%3A19"
      >1 Pt. 2:19</a
    >): "This is thankworthy, if the conscience... a man endure sorrows,
    suffering wrongfully."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Laws framed by man are either just or unjust.
    If they be just, they have the power of binding in conscience, from the
    eternal law whence they are derived, according to Prov. 8:15: "By Me kings
    reign, and lawgivers decree just things." Now laws are said to be just, both
    from the end, when, to wit, they are ordained to the common good---and from
    their author, that is to say, when the law that is made does not exceed the
    power of the lawgiver---and from their form, when, to wit, burdens are laid
    on the subjects, according to an equality of proportion and with a view to
    the common good. For, since one man is a part of the community, each man in
    all that he is and has, belongs to the community; just as a part, in all
    that it is, belongs to the whole; wherefore nature inflicts a loss on the
    part, in order to save the whole: so that on this account, such laws as
    these, which impose proportionate burdens, are just and binding in
    conscience, and are legal laws.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand laws may be unjust in two ways: first, by being contrary
    to human good, through being opposed to the things mentioned above---either
    in respect of the end, as when an authority imposes on his subjects
    burdensome laws, conducive, not to the common good, but rather to his own
    cupidity or vainglory---or in respect of the author, as when a man makes a
    law that goes beyond the power committed to him---or in respect of the form,
    as when burdens are imposed unequally on the community, although with a view
    to the common good. The like are acts of violence rather than laws; because,
    as Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5), "a law that is not just, seems to be
    no law at all." Wherefore such laws do not bind in conscience, except
    perhaps in order to avoid scandal or disturbance, for which cause a man
    should even yield his right, according to Mt. 5:40,41: "If a man... take
    away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him; and whosoever will force thee
    one mile, go with him other two."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, laws may be unjust through being opposed to the Divine good: such
    are the laws of tyrants inducing to idolatry, or to anything else contrary
    to the Divine law: and laws of this kind must nowise be observed, because,
    as stated in Acts 5:29, "we ought to obey God rather than man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A1,2"
      >Rm. 13:1,2</a
    >), all human power is from God... "therefore he that resisteth the power,"
    in matters that are within its scope, "resisteth the ordinance of God"; so
    that he becomes guilty according to his conscience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument is true of laws that are
    contrary to the commandments of God, which is beyond the scope of (human)
    power. Wherefore in such matters human law should not be obeyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is true of a law that
    inflicts unjust hurt on its subjects. The power that man holds from God does
    not extend to this: wherefore neither in such matters is man bound to obey
    the law, provided he avoid giving scandal or inflicting a more grievous
    hurt.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether all are subject to the law?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all are subject to the
    law. For those alone are subject to a law for whom a law is made. But the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A9"
      >1 Tim. 1:9</a
    >): "The law is not made for the just man." Therefore the just are not
    subject to the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Pope Urban says [*Decretals. caus. xix,
    qu. 2]: "He that is guided by a private law need not for any reason be bound
    by the public law." Now all spiritual men are led by the private law of the
    Holy Ghost, for they are the sons of God, of whom it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A14"
      >Rm. 8:14</a
    >): "Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
    Therefore not all men are subject to human law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the jurist says [*Pandect. Justin. i,
    ff., tit. 3, De Leg. et Senat.] that "the sovereign is exempt from the
    laws." But he that is exempt from the law is not bound thereby. Therefore
    not all are subject to the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A1"
      >Rm. 13:1</a
    >): "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers." But subjection to a
    power seems to imply subjection to the laws framed by that power. Therefore
    all men should be subject to human law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1"
      >Question [90]</a
    >, <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90Articles3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), the notion
    of law contains two things: first, that it is a rule of human acts;
    secondly, that it has coercive power. Wherefore a man may be subject to law
    in two ways. First, as the regulated is subject to the regulator: and, in
    this way, whoever is subject to a power, is subject to the law framed by
    that power. But it may happen in two ways that one is not subject to a
    power. In one way, by being altogether free from its authority: hence the
    subjects of one city or kingdom are not bound by the laws of the sovereign
    of another city or kingdom, since they are not subject to his authority. In
    another way, by being under a yet higher law; thus the subject of a
    proconsul should be ruled by his command, but not in those matters in which
    the subject receives his orders from the emperor: for in these matters, he
    is not bound by the mandate of the lower authority, since he is directed by
    that of a higher. In this way, one who is simply subject to a law, may not
    be a subject thereto in certain matters, in respect of which he is ruled by
    a higher law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, a man is said to be subject to a law as the coerced is subject to
    the coercer. In this way the virtuous and righteous are not subject to the
    law, but only the wicked. Because coercion and violence are contrary to the
    will: but the will of the good is in harmony with the law, whereas the will
    of the wicked is discordant from it. Wherefore in this sense the good are
    not subject to the law, but only the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is true of subjection by
    way of coercion: for, in this way, "the law is not made for the just men":
    because "they are a law to themselves," since they "show the work of the law
    written in their hearts," as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++2%3A14,15"
      >Rm. 2:14,15</a
    >). Consequently the law does not enforce itself upon them as it does on the
    wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The law of the Holy Ghost is above all
    law framed by man: and therefore spiritual men, in so far as they are led by
    the law of the Holy Ghost, are not subject to the law in those matters that
    are inconsistent with the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Nevertheless the very
    fact that spiritual men are subject to law, is due to the leading of the
    Holy Ghost, according to 1 Pt. 2:13: "Be ye subject... to every human
    creature for God's sake."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sovereign is said to be "exempt from
    the law," as to its coercive power; since, properly speaking, no man is
    coerced by himself, and law has no coercive power save from the authority of
    the sovereign. Thus then is the sovereign said to be exempt from the law,
    because none is competent to pass sentence on him, if he acts against the
    law. Wherefore on Ps. 50:6: "To Thee only have I sinned," a gloss says that
    "there is no man who can judge the deeds of a king." But as to the directive
    force of law, the sovereign is subject to the law by his own will, according
    to the statement (Extra, De Constit. cap. Cum omnes) that "whatever law a
    man makes for another, he should keep himself. And a wise authority
    [*Dionysius Cato, Dist. de Moribus] says: 'Obey the law that thou makest
    thyself.'" Moreover the Lord reproaches those who "say and do not"; and who
    "bind heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but with a finger of
    their own they will not move them" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++23%3A3,4"
      >Mt. 23:3,4</a
    >). Hence, in the judgment of God, the sovereign is not exempt from the law,
    as to its directive force; but he should fulfil it to his own free-will and
    not of constraint. Again the sovereign is above the law, in so far as, when
    it is expedient, he can change the law, and dispense in it according to time
    and place.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether he who is under a law may act beside the letter of the law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that he who is subject to a law may not
    act beside the letter of the law. For Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 31):
    "Although men judge about temporal laws when they make them, yet when once
    they are made they must pass judgment not on them, but according to them."
    But if anyone disregard the letter of the law, saying that he observes the
    intention of the lawgiver, he seems to pass judgment on the law. Therefore
    it is not right for one who is under the law to disregard the letter of the
    law, in order to observe the intention of the lawgiver.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he alone is competent to interpret the
    law who can make the law. But those who are subject to the law cannot make
    the law. Therefore they have no right to interpret the intention of the
    lawgiver, but should always act according to the letter of the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every wise man knows how to explain his
    intention by words. But those who framed the laws should be reckoned wise:
    for Wisdom says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++8%3A15"
      >Prov. 8:15</a
    >): "By Me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things." Therefore we
    should not judge of the intention of the lawgiver otherwise than by the
    words of the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. iv): "The meaning of
    what is said is according to the motive for saying it: because things are
    not subject to speech, but speech to things." Therefore we should take
    account of the motive of the lawgiver, rather than of his very words.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS096.html#FSQ96A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), every law is directed to the common weal of men, and derives the force
    and nature of law accordingly. Hence the jurist says [*Pandect. Justin. lib.
    i, ff., tit. 3, De Leg. et Senat.]: "By no reason of law, or favor of
    equity, is it allowable for us to interpret harshly, and render burdensome,
    those useful measures which have been enacted for the welfare of man." Now
    it happens often that the observance of some point of law conduces to the
    common weal in the majority of instances, and yet, in some cases, is very
    hurtful. Since then the lawgiver cannot have in view every single case, he
    shapes the law according to what happens most frequently, by directing his
    attention to the common good. Wherefore if a case arise wherein the
    observance of that law would be hurtful to the general welfare, it should
    not be observed. For instance, suppose that in a besieged city it be an
    established law that the gates of the city are to be kept closed, this is
    good for public welfare as a general rule: but, it were to happen that the
    enemy are in pursuit of certain citizens, who are defenders of the city, it
    would be a great loss to the city, if the gates were not opened to them: and
    so in that case the gates ought to be opened, contrary to the letter of the
    law, in order to maintain the common weal, which the lawgiver had in
    view.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless it must be noted, that if the observance of the law according
    to the letter does not involve any sudden risk needing instant remedy, it is
    not competent for everyone to expound what is useful and what is not useful
    to the state: those alone can do this who are in authority, and who, on
    account of such like cases, have the power to dispense from the laws. If,
    however, the peril be so sudden as not to allow of the delay involved by
    referring the matter to authority, the mere necessity brings with it a
    dispensation, since necessity knows no law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who in a case of necessity acts
    beside the letter of the law, does not judge the law; but of a particular
    case in which he sees that the letter of the law is not to be observed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He who follows the intention of the
    lawgiver, does not interpret the law simply; but in a case in which it is
    evident, by reason of the manifest harm, that the lawgiver intended
    otherwise. For if it be a matter of doubt, he must either act according to
    the letter of the law, or consult those in power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No man is so wise as to be able to take
    account of every single case; wherefore he is not able sufficiently to
    express in words all those things that are suitable for the end he has in
    view. And even if a lawgiver were able to take all the cases into
    consideration, he ought not to mention them all, in order to avoid
    confusion: but should frame the law according to that which is of most
    common occurrence.<br />
