</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the manner in which the will is moved. Under this 
head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the will is moved to anything naturally?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is moved of necessity by its object?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is moved of necessity by the lower appetite?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is moved of necessity by the exterior mover which is God?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is not moved to anything naturally. 
For the natural agent is condivided with the voluntary agent, as stated 
at the beginning of Phys. ii, 1. Therefore the will is not moved to 
anything naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is natural is in a thing always: as "being 
hot" is in fire. But no movement is always in the will. Therefore no 
movement is natural to the will. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nature is determinate to one thing: whereas the will is 
referred to opposites. Therefore the will wills nothing naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The movement of the will follows the movement of the 
intellect. But the intellect understands some things naturally. Therefore 
the will, too, wills some things naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Boethius says (De Duabus Nat.) and the Philosopher 
also (Metaph. v, 4) the word "nature" is used in a manifold sense. For 
sometimes it stands for the intrinsic principle in movable things. In 
this sense nature is either matter or the material form, as stated in 
Phys. ii, 1. In another sense nature stands for any substance, or even 
for any being. And in this sense, that is said to be natural to a thing 
which befits it in respect of its substance. And this is that which of 
itself is in a thing. Now all things that do not of themselves belong to 
the thing in which they are, are reduced to something which belongs of 
itself to that thing, as to their principle. Wherefore, taking nature in 
this sense, it is necessary that the principle of whatever belongs to a 
thing, be a natural principle. This is evident in regard to the 
intellect: for the principles of intellectual knowledge are naturally 
known. In like manner the principle of voluntary movements must be 
something naturally willed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is good in general, to which the will tends naturally, as does 
each power to its object; and again it is the last end, which stands in 
the same relation to things appetible, as the first principles of 
demonstrations to things intelligible: and, speaking generally, it is all 
those things which belong to the willer according to his nature. For it 
is not only things pertaining to the will that the will desires, but also 
that which pertains to each power, and to the entire man. Wherefore man 
wills naturally not only the object of the will, but also other things 
that are appropriate to the other powers; such as the knowledge of truth, 
which befits the intellect; and to be and to live and other like things 
which regard the natural well-being; all of which are included in the 
object of the will, as so many particular goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The will is distinguished from nature as one kind of cause 
from another; for some things happen naturally and some are done 
voluntarily. There is, however, another manner of causing that is proper 
to the will, which is mistress of its act, besides the manner proper to 
nature, which is determinate to one thing. But since the will is founded 
on some nature, it is necessary that the movement proper to nature be 
shared by the will, to some extent: just as what belongs to a previous 
cause is shared by a subsequent cause. Because in every thing, being 
itself, which is from nature, precedes volition, which is from the will. 
And hence it is that the will wills something naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the case of natural things, that which is natural, as a 
result of the form only, is always in them actually,  as heat is in fire. 
But that which is natural as a result of matter, is not always in them 
actually, but sometimes only in potentiality: because form is act, 
whereas matter is potentiality. Now movement is "the act of that which is 
in potentiality" (Aristotle, Phys. iii, 1). Wherefore that which belongs 
to, or results from, movement, in regard to natural things, is not always 
in them. Thus fire does not always move upwards, but only when it is 
outside its own place. [*The Aristotelian theory was that fire's proper 
place is the fiery heaven, i.e. the Empyrean.] And in like manner it is 
not necessary that the will (which is reduced from potentiality to act, 
when it wills something), should always be in the act of volition; but 
only when it is in a certain determinate disposition. But God's will, 
which is pure act, is always in the act of volition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To every nature there is one thing corresponding, 
proportionate, however, to that nature. For to nature considered as a 
genus, there corresponds something one generically; and to nature as 
species there corresponds something one specifically; and to the 
individualized nature there corresponds some one individual. Since, 
therefore, the will is an immaterial power like the intellect, some one 
general thing corresponds to it, naturally which is the good; just as to 
the intellect there corresponds some one general thing, which is the 
true, or being, or "what a thing is." And under good in general are 
included many particular goods, to none of which is the will determined.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the will is moved, of necessity, by its object?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the will is moved, of necessity, by its object. For 
the object of the will is compared to the will as mover to movable, as 
stated in De Anima iii, 10. But a mover, if it be sufficient, moves the 
movable of necessity. Therefore the will can be moved of necessity by its 
object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the will is an immaterial power, so is the 
intellect: and both powers are ordained to a universal object, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). But the intellect is moved, of necessity, by its 
object: therefore the will also, by its object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever one wills, is either the end, or something 
ordained to an end. But, seemingly, one wills an end necessarily: because 
it is like the principle in speculative matters, to which principle one 
assents of necessity. Now the end is the reason for willing the means; 
and so it seems that we will the means also necessarily. Therefore the 
will is moved of necessity by its object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The rational powers, according to the Philosopher 
(Metaph. ix, 2) are directed to opposites. But the will is a rational 
power, since it is in the reason, as stated in De Anima iii, 9. Therefore 
the will is directed to opposites. Therefore it is not moved, of 
necessity, to either of the  opposites.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The will is moved in two ways: first, as to the exercise 
of its act; secondly, as to the specification of its act, derived from 
the object. As to the first way, no object moves the will necessarily, 
for no matter what the object be, it is in man's power not to think of 
it, and consequently not to will it actually. But as to the second manner 
of motion, the will is moved by one object necessarily, by another not. 
For in the movement of a power by its object, we must consider under what 
aspect the object moves the power. For the visible moves the sight, under 
the aspect of color actually visible. Wherefore if color be offered to 
the sight, it moves the sight necessarily: unless one turns one's eyes 
away; which belongs to the exercise of the act. But if the sight were 
confronted with something not in all respects colored actually, but only 
so in some respects, and in other respects not, the sight would not of 
necessity see such an object: for it might look at that part of the 
object which is not actually colored, and thus it would not see it. Now 
just as the actually colored is the object of sight, so is good the 
object of the will. Wherefore if the will be offered an object which is 
good universally and from every point of view, the will tends to it of 
necessity, if it wills anything at all; since it cannot will the 
opposite. If, on the other hand, the will is offered an object that is 
not good from every point of view, it will not tend to it of necessity. 
And since lack of any good whatever, is a non-good, consequently, that 
good alone which is perfect and lacking in nothing, is such a good that 
the will cannot not-will it: and this is Happiness. Whereas any other 
particular goods, in so far as they are lacking in some good, can be 
regarded as non-goods: and from this point of view, they can be set aside 
or approved by the will, which can tend to one and the same thing from 
various points of view.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sufficient mover of a power is none but that object 
that in every respect presents the aspect of the mover of that power. If, 
on the other hand, it is lacking in any respect, it will not move of 
necessity, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The intellect is moved, of necessity, by an object which is 
such as to be always and necessarily true: but not by that which may be 
either true or false---viz. by that which is contingent: as we have said 
of the good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The last end moves the will necessarily, because it is the 
perfect good. In like manner whatever is ordained to that end, and 
without which the end cannot be attained, such as "to be" and "to live," 
and the like. But other things without which the end can be gained, are 
not necessarily willed by one who wills the end: just as he who assents 
to the principle, does not necessarily assent to the conclusions, without 
which the principles can still be true.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the will is moved, of necessity, by the lower appetite? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is moved of necessity by a passion of 
the lower appetite. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7%3A19">Rm. 7:19</a>): "The good which I 
will I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do": and this is 
said by reason of concupiscence, which is a passion. Therefore the will 
is moved of necessity by a passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated in Ethic. iii, 5, "according as a man is, such 
does the end seem to him." But it is not in man's power to cast aside a 
passion once. Therefore it is not in man's power not to will that to 
which the passion inclines him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a universal cause is not applied to a particular effect, 
except by means of a particular cause: wherefore the universal reason 
does not move save by means of a particular estimation, as stated in De 
Anima iii, 11. But as the universal reason is to the particular 
estimation, so is the will to the sensitive appetite. Therefore the will 
is not moved to will something particular, except through the sensitive 
appetite. Therefore, if the sensitive appetite happen to be disposed to 
something, by reason of a passion, the will cannot be moved in a contrary 
sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++4%3A7">Gn. 4:7</a>): "Thy lust [Vulg. 'The lust 
thereof'] shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it." 
Therefore man's will is moved of necessity by the lower appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the passion of the 
sensitive appetite moves the will, in so far as the will is moved by its 
object: inasmuch as, to wit, man through being disposed in such and such 
a way by a passion, judges something to be fitting and good, which he 
would not judge thus were it not for the passion. Now this influence of a 
passion on man occurs in two ways. First, so that his reason is wholly 
bound, so that he has not the use of reason: as happens in those who 
through a violent access of anger or concupiscence become furious or 
insane, just as they may from some other bodily disorder; since such like 
passions do not take place without some change in the body. And of such 
the same is to be said as of irrational animals, which follow, of 
necessity, the impulse of their passions: for in them there is neither 
movement of reason, nor, consequently, of will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the reason is not entirely engrossed by the passion, 
so that the judgment of reason retains, to a certain extent, its freedom: 
and thus the movement of the will remains in a certain degree. 
Accordingly in so far as the reason remains free, and not subject to the 
passion, the will's movement, which also remains, does not tend of 
necessity to that whereto the passion inclines it. Consequently, either 
there is no movement of the will in that man, and the passion alone holds 
its sway: or if there be a movement of the will, it does not necessarily 
follow the passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the will cannot prevent the movement of  
concupiscence from arising, of which the Apostle says: "The evil which I 
will not, that I do---i.e. I desire"; yet it is in the power of the will 
not to will to desire or not to consent to concupiscence. And thus it 
does not necessarily follow the movement of concupiscence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since there is in man a twofold nature, intellectual and 
sensitive; sometimes man is such and such uniformly in respect of his 
whole soul: either because the sensitive part is wholly subject to this 
reason, as in the virtuous; or because reason is entirely engrossed by 
passion, as in a madman. But sometimes, although reason is clouded by 
passion, yet something of this reason remains free. And in respect of 
this, man can either repel the passion entirely, or at least hold himself 
in check so as not to be led away by the passion. For when thus disposed, 
since man is variously disposed according to the various parts of the 
soul, a thing appears to him otherwise according to his reason, than it 
does according to a passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The will is moved not only by the universal good 
apprehended by the reason, but also by good apprehended by sense. 
Wherefore he can be moved to some particular good independently of a 
passion of the sensitive appetite. For we will and do many things without 
passion, and through choice alone; as is most evident in those cases 
wherein reason resists passion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the will is moved of necessity by the exterior mover which is God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is moved of necessity by God. For 
every agent that cannot be resisted moves of necessity. But God cannot be 
resisted, because His power is infinite; wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9%3A19">Rm. 9:19</a>): "Who resisteth His will?" Therefore God moves the will of 
necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the will is moved of necessity to whatever it wills 
naturally, as stated above (<A Href="FS010.html#FSQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). But "whatever God does in a 
thing is natural to it," as Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3). 
Therefore the will wills of necessity everything to which God moves it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a thing is possible, if nothing impossible follows from 
its being supposed. But something impossible follows from the supposition 
that the will does not will that to which God moves it: because in that 
case God's operation would be ineffectual. Therefore it is not possible 
for the will not to will that to which God moves it. Therefore it wills 
it of necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 15:14): "God made man from the 
beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel." Therefore He 
does not of necessity move man's will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) "it belongs to  Divine 
providence, not to destroy but to preserve the nature of things." 
Wherefore it moves all things in accordance with their conditions; so 
that from necessary causes through the Divine motion, effects follow of 
necessity; but from contingent causes, effects follow contingently. 
Since, therefore, the will is an active principle, not determinate to one 
thing, but having an indifferent relation to many things, God so moves 
it, that He does not determine it of necessity to one thing, but its 
movement remains contingent and not necessary, except in those things to 
which it is moved naturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Divine will extends not only to the doing of something 
by the thing which He moves, but also to its being done in a way which is 
fitting to the nature of that thing. And therefore it would be more 
repugnant to the Divine motion, for the will to be moved of necessity, 
which is not fitting to its nature; than for it to be moved freely, which 
is becoming to its nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[10] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That is natural to a thing, which God so works in it that 
it may be natural to it: for thus is something becoming to a thing, 
according as God wishes it to be becoming. Now He does not wish that 
whatever He works in things should be natural to them, for instance, that 
the dead should rise again. But this He does wish to be natural to each 
thing---that it be subject to the Divine power.<br>
