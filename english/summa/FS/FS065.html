</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the moral virtues are not connected with one 
another. Because moral virtues are sometimes caused by the exercise of 
acts, as is proved in Ethic. ii, 1,2. But man can exercise himself in the 
acts of one virtue, without exercising himself in the acts of some other 
virtue. Therefore it is possible to have one moral virtue without another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, magnificence and magnanimity are moral virtues. Now a 
man may have other moral virtues without having magnificence or 
magnanimity: for the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 2,3) that "a poor man 
cannot be magnificent," and yet he may have other virtues; and (Ethic. 
iv) that "he who is worthy of small things, and so accounts his worth, is 
modest, but not magnanimous." Therefore the moral virtues are not 
connected with one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the moral virtues perfect the appetitive part of the 
soul, so do the intellectual virtues perfect the intellective part. But 
the intellectual virtues are not mutually connected: since we may have 
one science, without having another. Neither, therefore, are the moral 
virtues connected with one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the moral virtues are mutually connected, this can 
only be because they are united together in prudence. But this does not 
suffice to connect the moral virtues together. For, seemingly, one may be 
prudent about things to be done in relation to one virtue, without being 
prudent in those that concern another virtue: even as one may have the 
art of making certain things, without the art of making certain others. 
Now prudence is right reason about things to be done. Therefore the moral 
virtues are not necessarily connected with one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says on Lk. 6:20: "The virtues are connected 
and linked together, so that whoever has one, is seen to have several": 
and Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 4) that "the virtues that reside in the 
human mind are quite inseparable from one another": and Gregory says 
(Moral. xxii, 1) that "one virtue without the other is either of no 
account whatever, or very imperfect": and Cicero says (Quaest. Tusc. ii): 
"If you confess to not having one particular virtue, it must needs be 
that you have none at all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Moral virtue may be considered either as perfect or as 
imperfect. An imperfect moral virtue, temperance for instance, or 
fortitude, is nothing but an inclination in us to do some kind of good 
deed, whether such inclination be in us by nature or by habituation. If 
we take the moral virtues in this way, they are not connected: since we 
find men who, by natural temperament or by being accustomed, are prompt 
in doing deeds of liberality, but are not prompt in doing deeds of 
chastity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the perfect moral virtue is a habit that inclines us to do a good 
deed well; and if we take moral virtues in this way, we must say that 
they are connected, as nearly as all are agreed in saying. For this two 
reasons are given, corresponding to the different ways of assigning the 
distinction of the cardinal virtues. For, as we stated above (<A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), some distinguish them according to certain general properties 
of the virtues: for instance, by saying that discretion belongs to 
prudence, rectitude to justice, moderation to temperance, and strength of 
mind to fortitude, in whatever matter we consider these properties to be. 
In this way the reason for the connection is evident: for strength of 
mind is not commended as virtuous, if it be without moderation or 
rectitude or discretion: and so forth. This, too, is the reason assigned 
for the connection by Gregory, who says (Moral. xxii, 1) that "a virtue 
cannot be perfect" as a virtue, "if isolated from the others: for there 
can be no true prudence without temperance, justice and fortitude": and 
he continues to speak in like manner of the other virtues (cf. <A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, Objection [1]). Augustine also gives the same reason  (De Trin. vi, 4).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others, however, differentiate these virtues in respect of their 
matters, and it is in this way that Aristotle assigns the reason for 
their connection (Ethic. vi, 13). Because, as stated above (<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), 
no moral virtue can be without prudence; since it is proper to moral 
virtue to make a right choice, for it is an elective habit. Now right 
choice requires not only the inclination to a due end, which inclination 
is the direct outcome of moral virtue, but also correct choice of things 
conducive to the end, which choice is made by prudence, that counsels, 
judges, and commands in those things that are directed to the end. In 
like manner one cannot have prudence unless one has the moral virtues: 
since prudence is "right reason about things to be done," and the 
starting point of reason is the end of the thing to be done, to which end 
man is rightly disposed by moral virtue. Hence, just as we cannot have 
speculative science unless we have the understanding of the principles, 
so neither can we have prudence without the moral virtues: and from this 
it follows clearly that the moral virtues are connected with one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some moral virtues perfect man as regards his general 
state, in other words, with regard to those things which have to be done 
in every kind of human life. Hence man needs to exercise himself at the 
same time in the matters of all moral virtues. And if he exercise 
himself, by good deeds, in all such matters, he will acquire the habits 
of all the moral virtues. But if he exercise himself by good deeds in 
regard to one matter, but not in regard to another, for instance, by 
behaving well in matters of anger, but not in matters of concupiscence; 
he will indeed acquire a certain habit of restraining his anger; but this 
habit will lack the nature of virtue, through the absence of prudence, 
which is wanting in matters of concupiscence. In the same way, natural 
inclinations fail to have the complete character of virtue, if prudence 
be lacking.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are some moral virtues which perfect man with regard to some 
eminent state, such as magnificence and magnanimity; and since it does 
not happen to all in common to be exercised in the matter of such 
virtues, it is possible for a man to have the other moral virtues, 
without actually having the habits of these virtues---provided we speak 
of acquired virtue. Nevertheless, when once a man has acquired those 
other virtues he possesses these in proximate potentiality. Because when, 
by practice, a man has acquired liberality in small gifts and 
expenditure, if he were to come in for a large sum of money, he would 
acquire the habit of magnificence with but little practice: even as a 
geometrician, by dint of little study, acquires scientific knowledge 
about some conclusion which had never been presented to his mind before. 
Now we speak of having a thing when we are on the point of having it, 
according to the saying of the Philosopher (Phys. ii, text. 56): "That 
which is scarcely lacking is not lacking at all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellectual virtues are about divers matters having no 
relation to one another, as is clearly the case with the various sciences 
and arts. Hence we do not observe in them the connection that is to be 
found among the moral virtues, which are about passions and operations, 
that are clearly related to one another. For all the passions have their 
rise in certain initial passions, viz. love and hatred, and terminate in 
certain others, viz. pleasure and sorrow. In like manner all the 
operations that are the matter of moral virtue are related to one 
another, and to the passions. Hence the whole matter of moral virtues 
falls under the one rule of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, all intelligible things are related to first principles. 
And in this way, all the intellectual virtues depend on the understanding 
of principles; even as prudence depends on the moral virtues, as stated. 
On the other hand, the universal principles which are the object of the 
virtue of understanding of principles, do not depend on the conclusions, 
which are the objects of the other intellectual virtues, as do the moral 
virtues depend on prudence, because the appetite, in a fashion, moves the 
reason, and the reason the appetite, as stated above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those things to which the moral virtues incline, are as the 
principles of prudence: whereas the products of art are not the 
principles, but the matter of art. Now it is evident that, though reason 
may be right in one part of the matter, and not in another, yet in no way 
can it be called right reason, if it be deficient in any principle 
whatever. Thus, if a man be wrong about the principle, "A whole is 
greater than its part," he cannot acquire the science of geometry, 
because he must necessarily wander from the truth in his conclusion. 
Moreover, things "done" are related to one another, but not things 
"made," as stated above (ad 3). Consequently the lack of prudence in one 
department of things to be done, would result in a deficiency affecting 
other things to be done: whereas this does not occur in things to be made.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether moral virtues can be without charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that moral virtues can be without charity. For it 
is stated in the Liber Sentent. Prosperi vii, that "every virtue save 
charity may be common to the good and bad." But "charity can be in none 
except the good," as stated in the same book. Therefore the other virtues 
can be had without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, moral virtues can be acquired by means of human acts, as 
stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2, whereas charity cannot be had otherwise than by 
infusion, according to Rm. 5:5: "The charity of God is poured forth in 
our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us." Therefore it is 
possible to have the other virtues without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the moral virtues are connected together, through 
depending on prudence. But charity does not depend on prudence; indeed, 
it surpasses prudence, according to Eph. 3:19: "The charity of Christ, 
which surpasseth all knowledge." Therefore the moral virtues are not 
connected with charity, and can be without it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3:14">1 Jn. 3:14</a>): "He that loveth not, 
abideth in death." Now the spiritual life is perfected by the virtues, 
since it is "by them" that "we lead a good life," as Augustine states (De 
Lib. Arb. ii, 17,19). Therefore they cannot be without the love of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it is possible by means of 
human works to acquire moral virtues, in so far as they produce good 
works that are directed to an end not surpassing the natural power of 
man: and when they are acquired thus, they can be without charity, even 
as they were in many of the Gentiles. But in so far as they produce good 
works in proportion to a supernatural last end, thus they have the 
character of virtue, truly and perfectly; and cannot be acquired by human 
acts, but are infused by God. Such like moral virtues cannot be without 
charity. For it has been stated above (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5) that the 
other moral virtues cannot be without prudence; and that prudence cannot 
be without the moral virtues, because these latter make man well disposed 
to certain ends, which are the starting-point of the procedure of 
prudence. Now for prudence to proceed aright, it is much more necessary 
that man be well disposed towards his ultimate end, which is the effect 
of charity, than that he be well disposed in respect of other ends, which 
is the effect of moral virtue: just as in speculative matters right 
reason has greatest need of the first indemonstrable principle, that 
"contradictories cannot both be true at the same time." It is therefore 
evident that neither can infused prudence be without charity; nor, 
consequently, the other moral virtues, since they cannot be without 
prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore clear from what has been said that only the infused 
virtues are perfect, and deserve to be called virtues simply: since they 
direct man well to the ultimate end. But the other virtues, those, 
namely, that are acquired, are virtues in a restricted sense, but not 
simply: for they direct man well in respect of the last end in some 
particular genus of action, but not in respect of the last end simply. 
Hence a gloss of Augustine [*Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi cvi.] on the 
words, "All that is not of faith is sin" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++14:23">Rm. 14:23</a>), says: "He that 
fails to acknowledge the truth, has no true virtue, even if his conduct 
be good."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtue, in the words quoted, denotes imperfect virtue. Else 
if we take moral virtue in its perfect state, "it makes its possessor 
good," and consequently cannot be in the wicked.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument holds good of virtue in the sense of acquired 
virtue. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Though charity surpasses science and prudence, yet prudence 
depends on charity, as stated: and consequently so do all the infused 
moral virtues.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem possible to have charity without the moral virtues. 
For when one thing suffices for a certain purpose, it is superfluous to 
employ others. Now charity alone suffices for the fulfilment of all the 
works of virtue, as is clear from 1 Cor. 13:4, seqq.: "Charity is 
patient, is kind," etc. Therefore it seems that if one has charity, other 
virtues are superfluous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he that has a habit of virtue easily performs the works 
of that virtue, and those works are pleasing to him for their own sake: 
hence "pleasure taken in a work is a sign of habit" (Ethic. ii, 3). Now 
many have charity, being free from mortal sin, and yet they find it 
difficult to do works of virtue; nor are these works pleasing to them for 
their own sake, but only for the sake of charity. Therefore many have 
charity without the other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is to be found in every saint: and yet there are 
some saints who are without certain virtues. For Bede says (on Lk. 17:10) 
that the saints are more humbled on account of their not having certain 
virtues, than rejoiced at the virtues they have. Therefore, if a man has 
charity, it does not follow of necessity that he has all the moral 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The whole Law is fulfilled through charity, for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13:8">Rm. 13:8</a>): "He that loveth his neighbor, hath fulfilled the 
Law." Now it is not possible to fulfil the whole Law, without having all 
the moral virtues: since the law contains precepts about all acts of 
virtue, as stated in Ethic. v, 1,2. Therefore he that has charity, has 
all the moral virtues. Moreover, Augustine says in a letter (Epis. 
clxvii) [*Cf. Serm. xxxix and xlvi de Temp.] that charity contains all 
the cardinal virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All the moral virtues are infused together with charity. 
The reason for this is that God operates no less perfectly in works of 
grace than in works of nature. Now, in the works of nature, we find that 
whenever a thing contains a principle of certain works, it has also 
whatever is necessary for their execution: thus animals are provided with 
organs whereby to perform the actions that their souls empower them to 
do. Now it is evident that charity, inasmuch as it directs man to his 
last end, is the principle of all the good works that are referable to 
his last end. Wherefore all the moral virtues must needs be infused 
together with charity, since it is through them that man performs each 
different kind of good work.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore clear that the infused moral virtues are connected, not 
only through prudence, but also on account of  charity: and, again, that 
whoever loses charity through mortal sin, forfeits all the infused moral 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In order that the act of a lower power be perfect, not only 
must there be perfection in the higher, but also in the lower power: for 
if the principal agent were well disposed, perfect action would not 
follow, if the instrument also were not well disposed. Consequently, in 
order that man work well in things referred to the end, he needs not only 
a virtue disposing him well to the end, but also those virtues which 
dispose him well to whatever is referred to the end: for the virtue which 
regards the end is the chief and moving principle in respect of those 
things that are referred to the end. Therefore it is necessary to have 
the moral virtues together with charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It happens sometimes that a man who has a habit, finds it 
difficult to act in accordance with the habit, and consequently feels no 
pleasure and complacency in the act, on account of some impediment 
supervening from without: thus a man who has a habit of science, finds it 
difficult to understand, through being sleepy or unwell. In like manner 
sometimes the habits of moral virtue experience difficulty in their 
works, by reason of certain ordinary dispositions remaining from previous 
acts. This difficulty does not occur in respect of acquired moral virtue: 
because the repeated acts by which they are acquired, remove also the 
contrary dispositions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certain saints are said not to have certain virtues, in so 
far as they experience difficulty in the acts of those virtues, for the 
reason stated; although they have the habits of all the virtues.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith and hope are never without charity. 
Because, since they are theological virtues, they seem to be more 
excellent than even the infused moral virtues. But the infused moral 
virtues cannot be without charity. Neither therefore can faith and hope 
be without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "no man believes unwillingly" as Augustine says (Tract. 
xxvi in Joan.). But charity is in the will as a perfection thereof, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore faith cannot be without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Enchiridion viii) that "there can be no 
hope without love." But love is charity: for it is of this love that he 
speaks. Therefore hope cannot be without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Mt. 1:2 says that "faith begets hope, and 
hope, charity." Now the begetter precedes the begotten, and can be 
without it. Therefore faith can be without hope; and hope, without 
charity. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Faith and hope, like the moral virtues, can be considered 
in two ways; first in an inchoate state; secondly, as complete virtues. 
For since virtue is directed to the doing of good works, perfect virtue 
is that which gives the faculty of doing a perfectly good work, and this 
consists in not only doing what is good, but also in doing it well. Else, 
if what is done is good, but not well done, it will not be perfectly 
good; wherefore neither will the habit that is the principle of such an 
act, have the perfect character of virtue. For instance, if a man do what 
is just, what he does is good: but it will not be the work of a perfect 
virtue unless he do it well, i.e. by choosing rightly, which is the 
result of prudence; for which reason justice cannot be a perfect virtue 
without prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly faith and hope can exist indeed in a fashion without 
charity: but they have not the perfect character of virtue without 
charity. For, since the act of faith is to believe in God; and since to 
believe is to assent to someone of one's own free will: to will not as 
one ought, will not be a perfect act of faith. To will as one ought is 
the outcome of charity which perfects the will: since every right 
movement of the will proceeds from a right love, as Augustine says (De 
Civ. Dei xiv, 9). Hence faith may be without charity, but not as a 
perfect virtue: just as temperance and fortitude can be without prudence. 
The same applies to hope. Because the act of hope consists in looking to 
God for future bliss. This act is perfect, if it is based on the merits 
which we have; and this cannot be without charity. But to expect future 
bliss through merits which one has not yet, but which one proposes to 
acquire at some future time, will be an imperfect act; and this is 
possible without charity. Consequently, faith and hope can be without 
charity; yet, without charity, they are not virtues properly so-called; 
because the nature of virtue requires that by it, we should not only do 
what is good, but also that we should do it well (Ethic. ii, 6).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Moral virtue depends on prudence: and not even infused 
prudence has the character of prudence without charity; for this involves 
the absence of due order to the first principle, viz. the ultimate end. 
On the other hand faith and hope, as such, do not depend either on 
prudence or charity; so that they can be without charity, although they 
are not virtues without charity, as stated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument is true of faith considered as a perfect 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine is speaking here of that hope whereby we look to 
gain future bliss through merits which we have already; and this is not 
without charity.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity can be without faith and  hope. For 
charity is the love of God. But it is possible for us to love God 
naturally, without already having faith, or hope in future bliss. 
Therefore charity can be without faith and hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity is the root of all the virtues, according to 
Eph. 3:17: "Rooted and founded in charity." Now the root is sometimes 
without branches. Therefore charity can sometimes be without faith and 
hope, and the other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there was perfect charity in Christ. And yet He had 
neither faith nor hope: because He was a perfect comprehensor, as we 
shall explain further on (<A Href="../TP.html">TP</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP007.html#TPQ7ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). Therefore charity can be 
without faith and hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++11:6">Heb. 11:6</a>): "Without faith it is 
impossible to please God"; and this evidently belongs most to charity, 
according to Prov. 8:17: "I love them that love me." Again, it is by hope 
that we are brought to charity, as stated above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore 
it is not possible to have charity without faith and hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Charity signifies not only the love of God, but also a 
certain friendship with Him; which implies, besides love, a certain 
mutual return of love, together with mutual communion, as stated in 
Ethic. viii, 2. That this belongs to charity is evident from 1 Jn. 4:16: 
"He that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him," and from 1 
Cor. 1:9, where it is written: "God is faithful, by Whom you are called 
unto the fellowship of His Son." Now this fellowship of man with God, 
which consists in a certain familiar colloquy with Him, is begun here, in 
this life, by grace, but will be perfected in the future life, by glory; 
each of which things we hold by faith and hope. Wherefore just as 
friendship with a person would be impossible, if one disbelieved in, or 
despaired of, the possibility of their fellowship or familiar colloquy; 
so too, friendship with God, which is charity, is impossible without 
faith, so as to believe in this fellowship and colloquy with God, and to 
hope to attain to this fellowship. Therefore charity is quite impossible 
without faith and hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity is not any kind of love of God, but that love of 
God, by which He is loved as the object of bliss, to which object we are 
directed by faith and hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity is the root of faith and hope, in so far as it 
gives them the perfection of virtue. But faith and hope as such are the 
precursors of charity, as stated above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), and so charity is 
impossible without them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[65] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In Christ there was neither faith nor hope, on account of 
their implying an imperfection. But instead of faith, He had manifest 
vision, and instead of hope, full comprehension [*See above, Question [4], Article [3]]: 
so that in Him was perfect charity.<br>
