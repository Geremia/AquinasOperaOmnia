inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS029.html#FSQ29A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether evil is the cause and the object of hatred?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that evil is not the object and cause of hatred. 
For everything that exists, as such, is good. If therefore evil be the 
object of hatred, it follows that nothing but the lack of something can 
be the object of hatred: which is clearly untrue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hatred of evil is praise-worthy; hence (2 Macc 3:1) some 
are praised for that "the laws were very well kept, because of the 
godliness of Onias the high-priest, and the hatred of their souls [Douay: 
'his soul'] had no evil." If, therefore, nothing but evil be the object 
of hatred, it would follow that all hatred is commendable: and this is 
clearly false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing is not at the same time both good and 
evil. But the same thing is lovable and hateful to different subjects. 
Therefore hatred is not only of evil, but also of good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hatred is the opposite of love. But the object of love 
is good, as stated above (<A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>, <A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the object 
of hatred is evil. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since the natural appetite is the result of apprehension 
(though this apprehension is not in the same subject as the natural 
appetite), it seems that what applies to the inclination of the natural 
appetite, applies also to the animal appetite, which does result from an 
apprehension in the same subject, as stated above (<A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>, <A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now, 
with regard to the natural appetite, it is evident, that just as each 
thing is naturally attuned and adapted to that which is suitable to it, 
wherein consists natural love; so has it a natural dissonance from that 
which opposes and destroys it; and this is natural hatred. So, therefore, 
in the animal appetite, or in the intellectual appetite, love is a 
certain harmony of the appetite with that which is apprehended as 
suitable; while hatred is dissonance of the appetite from that which is 
apprehended as repugnant and hurtful. Now, just as whatever is suitable, 
as such, bears the aspect of good; so whatever is repugnant, as such, 
bears the aspect of evil. And therefore, just as good is the object of 
love, so evil is the object of hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Being, as such, has not the aspect of repugnance but only 
of fittingness; because being is common to all things. But being, 
inasmuch as it is this determinate being, has an aspect of repugnance to 
some determinate being. And in this way, one being is hateful to another, 
and is evil; though not in itself, but by comparison with something else.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as a thing may be apprehended as good, when it is not 
truly good; so a thing may be apprehended as evil, whereas it is not 
truly evil. Hence it happens sometimes that neither hatred of evil nor 
love of good is good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To different things the same thing may be lovable or 
hateful: in respect of the natural appetite, owing to one and the same 
thing being naturally suitable to one thing, and naturally unsuitable to 
another: thus heat is becoming to fire and unbecoming to water: and in 
respect of the animal appetite, owing to one and the same thing being 
apprehended by one as good, by another as bad.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether love is a cause of hatred?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that love is not a cause of hatred. For "the 
opposite members of a division are naturally simultaneous" (Praedic. x). 
But love and hatred are opposite members of a division, since they are 
contrary to one another. Therefore they are naturally simultaneous. 
Therefore love is not the cause of hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, of two contraries, one is not the cause of the other. 
But love and hatred are contraries. Therefore love is not the cause of 
hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which follows is not the cause of that  which 
precedes. But hatred precedes love, seemingly: since hatred implies a 
turning away from evil, whereas love implies a turning towards good. 
Therefore love is not the cause of hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9) that all emotions 
are caused by love. Therefore hatred also, since it is an emotion of the 
soul, is caused by love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS029.html#FSQ29A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), love consists in a certain 
agreement of the lover with the object loved, while hatred consists in a 
certain disagreement or dissonance. Now we should consider in each thing, 
what agrees with it, before that which disagrees: since a thing disagrees 
with another, through destroying or hindering that which agrees with it. 
Consequently love must needs precede hatred; and nothing is hated, save 
through being contrary to a suitable thing which is loved. And hence it 
is that every hatred is caused by love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The opposite members of a division are sometimes naturally 
simultaneous, both really and logically; e.g. two species of animal, or 
two species of color. Sometimes they are simultaneous logically, while, 
in reality, one precedes, and causes the other; e.g. the species of 
numbers, figures and movements. Sometimes they are not simultaneous 
either really or logically; e.g. substance and accident; for substance is 
in reality the cause of accident; and being is predicated of substance 
before it is predicated of accident, by a priority of reason, because it 
is not predicated of accident except inasmuch as the latter is in 
substance. Now love and hatred are naturally simultaneous, logically but 
not really. Wherefore nothing hinders love from being the cause of hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Love and hatred are contraries if considered in respect of 
the same thing. But if taken in respect of contraries, they are not 
themselves contrary, but consequent to one another: for it amounts to the 
same that one love a certain thing, or that one hate its contrary. Thus 
love of one thing is the cause of one's hating its contrary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the order of execution, the turning away from one term 
precedes the turning towards the other. But the reverse is the case in 
the order of intention: since approach to one term is the reason for 
turning away from the other. Now the appetitive movement belongs rather 
to the order of intention than to that of execution. Wherefore love 
precedes hatred: because each is an appetitive movement.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hatred is stronger than love?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hatred is stronger than love. For Augustine 
says (Questions. 83, qu. 36): "There is no one who does not flee from pain, more 
than he desires pleasure." But flight from pain pertains to hatred; while 
desire for pleasure belongs to love. Therefore hatred is stronger than 
love. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger. But love is 
overcome by hatred: when, that is to say, love is turned into hatred. 
Therefore hatred is stronger than love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the emotions of the soul are shown by their effects. But 
man insists more on repelling what is hateful, than on seeking what is 
pleasant: thus also irrational animals refrain from pleasure for fear of 
the whip, as Augustine instances (Questions. 83, qu. 36). Therefore hatred is 
stronger than love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Good is stronger than evil; because "evil does nothing 
except in virtue of good," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). But hatred 
and love differ according to the difference of good and evil. Therefore 
love is stronger than hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible for an effect to be stronger than its 
cause. Now every hatred arises from some love as its cause, as above 
stated (<A Href="FS029.html#FSQ29A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it is impossible for hatred to be stronger than 
love absolutely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But furthermore, love must needs be, absolutely speaking, stronger than 
hatred. Because a thing is moved to the end more strongly than to the 
means. Now turning away from evil is directed as a means to the gaining 
of good. Wherefore, absolutely speaking, the soul's movement in respect 
of good is stronger than its movement in respect of evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless hatred sometimes seems to be stronger than love, for two 
reasons. First, because hatred is more keenly felt than love. For, since 
the sensitive perception is accompanied by a certain impression; when 
once the impression has been received it is not felt so keenly as in the 
moment of receiving it. Hence the heat of a hectic fever, though greater, 
is nevertheless not felt so much as the heat of tertian fever; because 
the heat of the hectic fever is habitual and like a second nature. For 
this reason, love is felt more keenly in the absence of the object loved; 
thus Augustine says (De Trin. x, 12) that "love is felt more keenly when 
we lack what we love." And for the same reason, the unbecomingness of 
that which is hated is felt more keenly than the becomingness of that 
which is loved. Secondly, because comparison is made between a hatred and 
a love which are not mutually corresponding. Because, according to 
different degrees of good there are different degrees of love to which 
correspond different degrees of hatred. Wherefore a hatred that 
corresponds to a greater love, moves us more than a lesser love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is clear how to reply to the First Objection. For the love of 
pleasure is less than the love of self-preservation, to which corresponds 
flight from pain. Wherefore we flee from pain more than we love pleasure.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can hate himself? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man can hate himself. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++10%3A6">Ps. 10:6</a>): "He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul." But many love 
iniquity. Therefore many hate themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, him we hate, to whom we wish and work evil. But 
sometimes a man wishes and works evil to himself, e.g. a man who kills 
himself. Therefore some men hate themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Consol. ii) that "avarice makes a man 
hateful"; whence we may conclude that everyone hates a miser. But some 
men are misers. Therefore they hate themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5%3A29">Eph. 5:29</a>) that "no man ever hated 
his own flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to hate 
himself. For everything naturally desires good, nor can anyone desire 
anything for himself, save under the aspect of good: for "evil is outside 
the scope of the will," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Now to love a 
man is to will good to him, as stated above (<A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>, <A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Consequently, 
a man must, of necessity, love himself; and it is impossible for a man to 
hate himself, properly speaking.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But accidentally it happens that a man hates himself: and this in two 
ways. First, on the part of the good which a man wills to himself. For it 
happens sometimes that what is desired as good in some particular 
respect, is simply evil; and in this way, a man accidentally wills evil 
to himself; and thus hates himself. Secondly, in regard to himself, to 
whom he wills good. For each thing is that which is predominant in it; 
wherefore the state is said to do what the king does, as if the king were 
the whole state. Now it is clear that man is principally the mind of man. 
And it happens that some men account themselves as being principally that 
which they are in their material and sensitive nature. Wherefore they 
love themselves according to what they take themselves to be, while they 
hate that which they really are, by desiring what is contrary to reason. 
And in both these ways, "he that loveth iniquity hateth" not only "his 
own soul," but also himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore the reply to the First Objection is evident.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No man wills and works evil to himself, except he apprehend 
it under the aspect of good. For even they who kill themselves, apprehend 
death itself as a good, considered as putting an end to some unhappiness 
or pain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The miser hates something accidental to himself, but not 
for that reason does he hate himself: thus a sick man hates his sickness 
for the very reason that he loves himself. Or we may say that avarice 
makes man hateful to others, but not to himself. In fact, it is caused by 
inordinate self-love, in respect of which, man desires temporal goods for 
himself more than he should.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can hate the truth?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man cannot hate the truth. For good, true, 
and being are convertible. But a man cannot hate good. Neither, 
therefore, can he hate the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "All men have a natural desire for knowledge," as stated 
in the beginning of the Metaphysics i, 1. But knowledge is only of truth. 
Therefore truth is naturally desired and loved. But that which is in a 
thing naturally, is always in it. Therefore no man can hate the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "men love those 
who are straightforward." But there can be no other motive for this save 
truth. Therefore man loves the truth naturally. Therefore he cannot hate 
it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A16">Gal. 4:16</a>): "Am I become your enemy 
because I tell you the truth?" [*St. Thomas quotes the passage, probably 
from memory, as though it were an assertion: "I am become," etc.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Good, true and being are the same in reality, but differ 
as considered by reason. For good is considered in the light of something 
desirable, while being and true are not so considered: because good is 
"what all things seek." Wherefore good, as such, cannot be the object of 
hatred, neither in general nor in particular. Being and truth in general 
cannot be the object of hatred: because disagreement is the cause of 
hatred, and agreement is the cause of love; while being and truth are 
common to all things. But nothing hinders some particular being or some 
particular truth being an object of hatred, in so far as it is considered 
as hurtful and repugnant; since hurtfulness and repugnance are not 
incompatible with the notion of being and truth, as they are with the 
notion of good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it may happen in three ways that some particular truth is repugnant 
or hurtful to the good we love. First, according as truth is in things as 
in its cause and origin. And thus man sometimes hates a particular truth, 
when he wishes that what is true were not true. Secondly, according as 
truth is in man's knowledge, which hinders him from gaining the object 
loved: such is the case of those who wish not to know the truth of faith, 
that they may sin freely; in whose person it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+21%3A14">Job 21:14</a>): "We 
desire not the knowledge of Thy ways." Thirdly, a particular truth is 
hated, as being repugnant, inasmuch as it is in the intellect of another 
man: as, for instance, when a man wishes to remain hidden in his sin, he 
hates that anyone should know the truth about his sin. In this respect, 
Augustine says (Confess. x, 23) that men "love truth when it enlightens, 
they hate it when it reproves." This suffices for the Reply to the First 
Objection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The knowledge of truth is lovable in itself:  hence 
Augustine says that men love it when it enlightens. But accidentally, the 
knowledge of truth may become hateful, in so far as it hinders one from 
accomplishing one's desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reason why we love those who are straightforward is 
that they make known the truth, and the knowledge of the truth, 
considered in itself, is a desirable thing.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether anything can be an object of universal hatred?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a thing cannot be an object of universal 
hatred. Because hatred is a passion of the sensitive appetite, which is 
moved by an apprehension in the senses. But the senses cannot apprehend 
the universal. Therefore a thing cannot be an object of universal hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hatred is caused by disagreement; and where there is 
disagreement, there is nothing in common. But the notion of universality 
implies something in common. Therefore nothing can be the object of 
universal hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the object of hatred is evil. But "evil is in things, 
and not in the mind" (Metaph. vi, 4). Since therefore the universal is in 
the mind only, which abstracts the universal from the particular, it 
would seem that hatred cannot have a universal object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "anger is 
directed to something singular, whereas hatred is also directed to a 
thing in general; for everybody hates the thief and the backbiter."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two ways of speaking of the universal: first, 
as considered under the aspect of universality; secondly, as considered 
in the nature to which it is ascribed: for it is one thing to consider 
the universal man, and another to consider a man as man. If, therefore, 
we take the universal, in the first way, no sensitive power, whether of 
apprehension or of appetite, can attain the universal: because the 
universal is obtained by abstraction from individual matter, on which 
every sensitive power is based.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless the sensitive powers, both of apprehension and of appetite, 
can tend to something universally. Thus we say that the object of sight 
is color considered generically; not that the sight is cognizant of 
universal color, but because the fact that color is cognizant by the 
sight, is attributed to color, not as being this particular color, but 
simply because it is color. Accordingly hatred in the sensitive faculty 
can regard something universally: because this thing, by reason of its 
common nature, and not merely as an individual, is hostile to the 
animal---for instance, a wolf in regard to a sheep. Hence a sheep hates 
the wolf universally. On the other hand, anger is always caused by 
something in particular:  because it is caused by some action of the one 
that hurts us; and actions proceed from individuals. For this reason the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "anger is always directed to 
something singular, whereas hatred can be directed to a thing in general."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But according as hatred is in the intellectual part, since it arises 
from the universal apprehension of the intellect, it can regard the 
universal in both ways.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The senses do not apprehend the universal, as such: but 
they apprehend something to which the character of universality is given 
by abstraction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which is common to all cannot be a reason of hatred. 
But nothing hinders a thing from being common to many, and at variance 
with others, so as to be hateful to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[29] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the universal under the aspect of 
universality: and thus it does not come under the sensitive apprehension 
or appetite.<br>
