<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the irascible passions: (1) Hope and despair; (2) 
Fear and daring; (3) Anger. Under first head there are eight points of 
inquiry:<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope is the same as desire or cupidity. 
Because hope is reckoned as one of the four principal passions. But 
Augustine in setting down the four principal passions puts cupidity in 
the place of hope (De Civ. Dei xiv, 3,7). Therefore hope is the same as 
cupidity or desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, passions differ according to their objects. But the 
object of hope is the same as the object of cupidity or desire, viz. the 
future good. Therefore hope is the same as cupidity or desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> If it be said that hope, in addition to desire, denotes the 
possibility of obtaining the future good; on the contrary, whatever is 
accidental to the object does not make a different species of passion. 
But possibility of acquisition is accidental to a future good, which is 
the object of cupidity or desire, and of hope. Therefore hope does not 
differ specifically from desire or cupidity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> To different powers belong different species of 
passions. But hope is in the irascible power; whereas desire or cupidity 
is in the concupiscible. Therefore hope differs specifically from desire 
or cupidity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The species of a passion is taken from the object. Now, 
in the object of hope, we may note four conditions. First, that it is 
something good; since, properly speaking, hope regards only the good; in 
this respect, hope differs from fear, which regards evil. Secondly, that 
it is future; for hope does not regard that which is present and already 
possessed: in this respect, hope differs from joy which regards a present 
good. Thirdly, that it must be something arduous and difficult to obtain, 
for we do not speak of any one hoping for trifles, which are in one's 
power to have at any time: in this respect, hope differs from desire or 
cupidity, which regards the future good absolutely: wherefore it belongs 
to the concupiscible, while hope belongs to the irascible faculty. 
Fourthly, that this difficult thing is something possible to obtain: for 
one does not hope for that which one cannot get at all: and, in this 
respect, hope differs from despair. It is therefore evident that hope 
differs from desire, as the irascible passions differ from the 
concupiscible. For this reason, moreover, hope presupposes desire: just 
as all irascible passions presuppose the passions of the concupiscible 
faculty, as stated above (<A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine mentions desire instead of hope, because each 
regards future good; and because the good which is not arduous is 
reckoned as nothing: thus implying that desire seems to tend chiefly to 
the arduous good, to which hope tends likewise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The object of hope is the future good considered, not 
absolutely, but as arduous and difficult of attainment, as stated above. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The object of hope adds not only possibility to the object 
of desire, but also difficulty: and this makes hope belong to another 
power, viz. the irascible, which regards something difficult, as stated 
in the FP, Question [81], Article [2]. Moreover, possibility and impossibility are not 
altogether accidental to the object of the appetitive power: because the 
appetite is a principle of movement; and nothing is moved to anything 
except under the aspect of being possible; for no one is moved to that 
which he reckons impossible to get. Consequently hope differs from 
despair according to the difference of possible and impossible.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope belongs to the cognitive power. Because 
hope, seemingly, is a kind of awaiting; for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8:25">Rm. 8:25</a>): 
"If we hope for that which we see not; we wait for it with patience." But 
awaiting seems to belong to the cognitive power, which we exercise by 
"looking out." Therefore hope belongs to the cognitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, apparently hope is the same as confidence; hence when a 
man hopes he is said to be confident, as though to hope and to be 
confident were the same thing. But confidence, like faith, seems to 
belong to the cognitive power. Therefore hope does too.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, certainty is a property of the cognitive power. But 
certainty is ascribed to hope. Therefore hope belongs to the cognitive 
power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hope regards good, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now good, as 
such, is not the object of the cognitive, but of the appetitive power. 
Therefore hope belongs, not to the cognitive, but to the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since hope denotes a certain stretching out of the 
appetite towards good, it evidently belongs to the appetitive power; 
since movement towards things belongs properly to the appetite: whereas 
the action of the cognitive power is accomplished not by the movement of 
the knower towards things, but rather according as the things known are 
in the knower. But since the cognitive power moves the appetite, by 
presenting its object to it; there arise in the appetite various 
movements according to various aspects of the apprehended object. For the 
apprehension of good gives rise to one kind of movement in the appetite, 
while the apprehension of evil gives rise to another: in like manner 
various movements arise from the apprehension of something present and of 
something future; of something considered absolutely, and of something 
considered as arduous; of something possible, and of something 
impossible. And accordingly hope is a movement of the appetitive power 
ensuing from the apprehension of a future good, difficult but possible to 
obtain; namely, a stretching forth of the  appetite to such a good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since hope regards a possible good, there arises in man a 
twofold movement of hope; for a thing may be possible to him in two ways, 
viz. by his own power, or by another's. Accordingly when a man hopes to 
obtain something by his own power, he is not said to wait for it, but 
simply to hope for it. But, properly speaking, he is said to await that 
which he hopes to get by another's help as though to await [exspectare] 
implied keeping one's eyes on another [ex alio spectare], in so far as 
the apprehensive power, by going ahead, not only keeps its eye on the 
good which man intends to get, but also on the thing by whose power he 
hopes to get it; according to Ecclus. 51:10, "I looked for the succor of 
men." Wherefore the movement of hope is sometimes called expectation, on 
account of the preceding inspection of the cognitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man desires a thing and reckons that he can get it, 
he believes that he can get it, he believes that he will get it; and from 
this belief which precedes in the cognitive power, the ensuing movement 
in the appetite is called confidence. Because the movement of the 
appetite takes its name from the knowledge that precedes it, as an effect 
from a cause which is better known; for the apprehensive power knows its 
own act better than that of the appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certainty is ascribed to the movement, not only of the 
sensitive, but also of the natural appetite; thus we say that a stone is 
certain to tend downwards. This is owing to the inerrancy which the 
movement of the sensitive or even natural appetite derives from the 
certainty of the knowledge that precedes it.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no hope in dumb animals. Because hope 
is for some future good, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 12). But 
knowledge of the future is not in the competency of dumb animals, whose 
knowledge is confined to the senses and does not extend to the future. 
Therefore there is no hope in dumb animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object of hope is a future good, possible of 
attainment. But possible and impossible are differences of the true and 
the false, which are only in the mind, as the Philosopher states (Metaph. 
vi, 4). Therefore there is no hope in dumb animals, since they have no 
mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 14) that "animals are 
moved by the things that they see." But hope is of things unseen: "for 
what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8:24">Rm. 8:24</a>). Therefore there is 
no hope in dumb animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hope is an irascible passion. But the irascible faculty 
is in dumb animals. Therefore hope is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The internal passions of animals can be gathered from 
their outward movements: from which it is clear that hope is in dumb 
animals. For if a dog see a hare, or a hawk see a bird, too far off, it 
makes no movement towards it, as having no hope to catch it: whereas, if 
it be near, it makes a movement towards it, as being in hopes of catching 
it. Because as stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>, <A Href="FS026.html#FSQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>, <A Href="FS035.html#FSQ35A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the 
sensitive appetite of dumb animals, and likewise the natural appetite of 
insensible things, result from the apprehension of an intellect, just as 
the appetite of the intellectual nature, which is called the will. But 
there is a difference, in that the will is moved by an apprehension of 
the intellect in the same subject; whereas the movement of the natural 
appetite results from the apprehension of the separate Intellect, Who is 
the Author of nature; as does also the sensitive appetite of dumb 
animals, who act from a certain natural instinct. Consequently, in the 
actions of irrational animals and of other natural things, we observe a 
procedure which is similar to that which we observe in the actions of 
art: and in this way hope and despair are in dumb animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although dumb animals do not know the future, yet an animal 
is moved by its natural instinct to something future, as though it 
foresaw the future. Because this instinct is planted in them by the 
Divine Intellect that foresees the future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The object of hope is not the possible as differentiating 
the true, for thus the possible ensues from the relation of a predicate 
to a subject. The object of hope is the possible as compared to a power. 
For such is the division of the possible given in Metaph. v, 12, i.e. 
into the two kinds we have just mentioned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the thing which is future does not come under the 
object of sight; nevertheless through seeing something present, an 
animal's appetite is moved to seek or avoid something future.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether despair is contrary to hope?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that despair is not contrary to hope. Because "to 
one thing there is one contrary" (Metaph. x, 5). But fear is contrary to 
hope. Therefore despair is not contrary to hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contraries seem to bear on the same thing. But hope and 
despair do not bear on the same thing: since hope regards the good, 
whereas despair arises from some evil that is in the way of obtaining 
good. Therefore hope is not contrary to despair.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, movement is contrary to movement: while repose is in 
opposition to movement as a privation thereof. But despair  seems to 
imply immobility rather than movement. Therefore it is not contrary to 
hope, which implies movement of stretching out towards the hoped-for good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The very name of despair [desperatio] implies that it 
is contrary to hope [spes].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), there is a twofold 
contrariety of movements. One is in respect of approach to contrary 
terms: and this contrariety alone is to be found in the concupiscible 
passions, for instance between love and hatred. The other is according to 
approach and withdrawal with regard to the same term; and is to be found 
in the irascible passions, as stated above (<A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the object 
of hope, which is the arduous good, has the character of a principle of 
attraction, if it be considered in the light of something attainable; and 
thus hope tends thereto, for it denotes a kind of approach. But in so far 
as it is considered as unobtainable, it has the character of a principle 
of repulsion, because, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3, "when men come to an 
impossibility they disperse." And this is how despair stands in regard to 
this object, wherefore it implies a movement of withdrawal: and 
consequently it is contrary to hope, as withdrawal is to approach.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fear is contrary to hope, because their objects, i.e. good 
and evil, are contrary: for this contrariety is found in the irascible 
passions, according as they ensue from the passions of the concupiscible. 
But despair is contrary to hope, only by contrariety of approach and 
withdrawal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Despair does not regard evil as such; sometimes however it 
regards evil accidentally, as making the difficult good impossible to 
obtain. But it can arise from the mere excess of good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Despair implies not only privation of hope, but also a 
recoil from the thing desired, by reason of its being esteemed impossible 
to get. Hence despair, like hope, presupposes desire; because we neither 
hope for nor despair of that which we do not desire to have. For this 
reason, too, each of them regards the good, which is the object of desire.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that experience is not a cause of hope. Because 
experience belongs to the cognitive power; wherefore the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. ii, 1) that "intellectual virtue needs experience and time." But 
hope is not in the cognitive power, but in the appetite, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore experience is not a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 13) that "the old are 
slow to hope, on account of their experience"; whence it  seems to follow 
that experience causes want of hope. But the same cause is not productive 
of opposites. Therefore experience is not a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (De Coel. ii, 5) that "to have 
something to say about everything, without leaving anything out, is 
sometimes a proof of folly." But to attempt everything seems to point to 
great hopes; while folly arises from inexperience. Therefore 
inexperience, rather than experience, seems to be a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) "some are hopeful, 
through having been victorious often and over many opponents": which 
seems to pertain to experience. Therefore experience is a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the object of hope is a future 
good, difficult but possible to obtain. Consequently a thing may be a 
cause of hope, either because it makes something possible to a man: or 
because it makes him think something possible. In the first way hope is 
caused by everything that increases a man's power; e.g. riches, strength, 
and, among others, experience: since by experience man acquires the 
faculty of doing something easily, and the result of this is hope. 
Wherefore Vegetius says (De Re Milit. i): "No one fears to do that which 
he is sure of having learned well."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second way, hope is caused by everything that makes man think 
that he can obtain something: and thus both teaching and persuasion may 
be a cause of hope. And then again experience is a cause of hope, in so 
far as it makes him reckon something possible, which before his 
experience he looked upon as impossible. However, in this way, experience 
can cause a lack of hope: because just as it makes a man think possible 
what he had previously thought impossible; so, conversely, experience 
makes a man consider as impossible that which hitherto he had thought 
possible. Accordingly experience causes hope in two ways, despair in one 
way: and for this reason we may say rather that it causes hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Experience in matters pertaining to action not only 
produces knowledge; it also causes a certain habit, by reason of custom, 
which renders the action easier. Moreover, the intellectual virtue itself 
adds to the power of acting with ease: because it shows something to be 
possible; and thus is a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The old are wanting in hope because of their experience, in 
so far as experience makes them think something impossible. Hence he adds 
(Rhet. ii, 13) that "many evils have befallen them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Folly and inexperience can be a cause of hope accidentally 
as it were, by removing the knowledge which would help one to judge truly 
a thing to be impossible. Wherefore inexperience  is a cause of hope, for 
the same reason as experience causes lack of hope.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hope abounds in young men and drunkards?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that youth and drunkenness are not causes of hope. 
Because hope implies certainty and steadiness; so much so that it is 
compared to an anchor (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++6:19">Heb. 6:19</a>). But young men and drunkards are 
wanting in steadiness; since their minds are easily changed. Therefore 
youth and drunkenness are not causes of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the cause of hope is chiefly 
whatever increases one's power. But youth and drunkenness are united to 
weakness. Therefore they are not causes of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, experience is a cause of hope, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). 
But youth lacks experience. Therefore it is not a cause of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "drunken men 
are hopeful": and (Rhet. ii, 12) that "the young are full of hope."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Youth is a cause of hope for three reasons, as the 
Philosopher states in Rhet. ii, 12: and these three reasons may be 
gathered from the three conditions of the good which is the object of 
hope---namely, that it is future, arduous and possible, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For youth has much of the future before it, and little of the 
past: and therefore since memory is of the past, and hope of the future, 
it has little to remember and lives very much in hope. Again, youths, on 
account of the heat of their nature, are full of spirit; so that their 
heart expands: and it is owing to the heart being expanded that one tends 
to that which is arduous; wherefore youths are spirited and hopeful. 
Likewise they who have not suffered defeat, nor had experience of 
obstacles to their efforts, are prone to count a thing possible to them. 
Wherefore youths, through inexperience of obstacles and of their own 
shortcomings, easily count a thing possible; and consequently are of good 
hope. Two of these causes are also in those who are in drink---viz. heat 
and high spirits, on account of wine, and heedlessness of dangers and 
shortcomings. For the same reason all foolish and thoughtless persons 
attempt everything and are full of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although youths and men in drink lack steadiness in 
reality, yet they are steady in their own estimation, for they think that 
they will steadily obtain that which they hope for.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner, in reply to the Second Objection, we must observe that 
young people and men in drink are indeed unsteady in reality: but, in 
their own estimation, they are capable, for they know not their 
shortcomings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not only experience, but also lack of experience,  is, in 
some way, a cause of hope, as explained above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hope is a cause of love?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope is not a cause of love. Because, 
according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7,9), love is the first of the 
soul's emotions. But hope is an emotion of the soul. Therefore love 
precedes hope, and consequently hope does not cause love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, desire precedes hope. But desire is caused by love, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore hope, too, follows love, and 
consequently is not its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope causes pleasure, as stated above (<A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But 
pleasure is only of the good that is loved. Therefore love precedes hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The gloss commenting on Mt. 1:2, "Abraham begot Isaac, 
and Isaac begot Jacob," says, i.e. "faith begets hope, and hope begets 
charity." But charity is love. Therefore love is caused by hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hope can regard two things. For it regards as its object, 
the good which one hopes for. But since the good we hope for is something 
difficult but possible to obtain; and since it happens sometimes that 
what is difficult becomes possible to us, not through ourselves but 
through others; hence it is that hope regards also that by which 
something becomes possible to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far, then, as hope regards the good we hope to get, it is caused 
by love: since we do not hope save for that which we desire and love. But 
in so far as hope regards one through whom something becomes possible to 
us, love is caused by hope, and not vice versa. Because by the very fact 
that we hope that good will accrue to us through someone, we are moved 
towards him as to our own good; and thus we begin to love him. Whereas 
from the fact that we love someone we do not hope in him, except 
accidentally, that is, in so far as we think that he returns our love. 
Wherefore the fact of being loved by another makes us hope in him; but 
our love for him is caused by the hope we have in him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore the Replies to the Objections are evident.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hope is a help or a hindrance to action?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope is not a help but a hindrance to action. 
Because hope implies security. But security begets negligence which 
hinders action. Therefore hope is a hindrance to action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sorrow hinders action, as stated above (<A Href="FS037.html#FSQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>,  <A Href="FS037.html#FSQ37A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). 
But hope sometimes causes sorrow: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++13:12">Prov. 13:12</a>): "Hope 
that is deferred afflicteth the soul." Therefore hope hinders action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, despair is contrary to hope, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But 
despair, especially in matters of war, conduces to action; for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Sam++2:26">2 Kgs. 2:26</a>), that "it is dangerous to drive people to despair." 
Therefore hope has a contrary effect, namely, by hindering action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9:10">1 Cor. 9:10</a>) that "he that plougheth 
should plough in hope . . . to receive fruit": and the same applies to 
all other actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hope of its very nature is a help to action by making it 
more intense: and this for two reasons. First, by reason of its object, 
which is a good, difficult but possible. For the thought of its being 
difficult arouses our attention; while the thought that it is possible is 
no drag on our effort. Hence it follows that by reason of hope man is 
intent on his action. Secondly, on account of its effect. Because hope, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), causes pleasure; which is a help to 
action, as stated above (<A Href="FS033.html#FSQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>, <A Href="FS033.html#FSQ33A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore hope is conducive to 
action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Hope regards a good to be obtained; security regards an 
evil to be avoided. Wherefore security seems to be contrary to fear 
rather than to belong to hope. Yet security does not beget negligence, 
save in so far as it lessens the idea of difficulty: whereby it also 
lessens the character of hope: for the things in which a man fears no 
hindrance, are no longer looked upon as difficult.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hope of itself causes pleasure; it is by accident that it 
causes sorrow, as stated above (<A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="FS032.html#FSQ32A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[40] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Despair threatens danger in war, on account of a certain 
hope that attaches to it. For they who despair of flight, strive less to 
fly, but hope to avenge their death: and therefore in this hope they 
fight the more bravely, and consequently prove dangerous to the foe.<br>
