<H3 Align="Center">OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL VIRTUES (FIVE ARTICLES)<br>
<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider moral virtues. We shall speak (1) of the difference 
between them and intellectual virtues; (2) of their distinction, one from 
another, in respect of their proper matter; (3) of the difference between 
the chief or cardinal virtues and the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are five points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether every virtue is a moral virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether moral virtue differs from intellectual virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether virtue is adequately divided into moral and intellectual 
virtue?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether there can be moral without intellectual virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether, on the other hand, there can be intellectual without moral 
virtue?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every virtue is a moral virtue. Because moral 
virtue is so called from the Latin "mos," i.e. custom. Now, we can 
accustom ourselves to the acts of all the virtues. Therefore every virtue 
is a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6) that moral virtue is 
"a habit of choosing the rational mean." But every virtue is a habit of 
choosing: since the acts of any virtue can be done from choice. And, 
moreover, every virtue consists in following the rational mean in some 
way, as we shall explain further on (<A Href="FS064.html#FSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="FS064.html#FSQ64ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3). Therefore every 
virtue is a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Cicero says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "virtue is a 
habit like a second nature, in accord with reason." But since every human 
virtue is directed to man's good, it must be in accord with reason: since 
man's good "consists in that which agrees with his reason," as Dionysius 
states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore every virtue is a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. i, 13): "When we speak of a 
man's morals, we do not say that he is wise or intelligent, but that he 
is gentle or sober." Accordingly, then,  wisdom and understanding are not 
moral virtues: and yet they are virtues, as stated above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore not every virtue is a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In order to answer this question clearly, we must 
consider the meaning of the Latin word "mos"; for thus we shall be able 
to discover what a "moral" virtue is. Now "mos" has a twofold meaning. 
For sometimes it means custom, in which sense we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+15%3A1">Acts 15:1</a>): 
"Except you be circumcised after the manner (morem) of Moses, you cannot 
be saved." Sometimes it means a natural or quasi-natural inclination to 
do some particular action, in which sense the word is applied to dumb 
animals. Thus we read (2 Macc. 1:2) that "rushing violently upon the 
enemy, like lions [*Leonum more, i.e. as lions are in the habit of 
doing], they slew them": and the word is used in the same sense in Ps. 
67:7, where we read: "Who maketh men of one manner [moris] to dwell in a 
house." For both these significations there is but one word in Latin; but 
in the Greek there is a distinct word for each, for the word "ethos" is 
written sometimes with a long, and sometimes a short "e".<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now "moral" virtue is so called from "mos" in the sense of a natural or 
quasi-natural inclination to do some particular action. And the other 
meaning of "mos," i.e. "custom," is akin to this: because custom becomes 
a second nature, and produces an inclination similar to a natural one. 
But it is evident that inclination to an action belongs properly to the 
appetitive power, whose function it is to move all the powers to their 
acts, as explained above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore not every virtue is a 
moral virtue, but only those that are in the appetitive faculty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument takes "mos" in the sense of "custom."
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every act of virtue can be done from choice: but no virtue 
makes us choose aright, save that which is in the appetitive part of the 
soul: for it has been stated above that choice is an act of the 
appetitive faculty (<A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore a habit of choosing, i.e. a 
habit which is the principle whereby we choose, is that habit alone which 
perfects the appetitive faculty: although the acts of other habits also 
may be a matter of choice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Nature is the principle of movement" (Phys. ii, text. 3). 
Now to move the faculties to act is the proper function of the appetitive 
power. Consequently to become as a second nature by consenting to the 
reason, is proper to those virtues which are in the appetitive faculty.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether moral virtue differs from intellectual virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that moral virtue does not differ from intellectual 
virtue. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei iv, 21) "that virtue is the art 
of right conduct." But art is an intellectual  virtue. Therefore moral 
and intellectual virtue do not differ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some authors put science in the definition of virtues: 
thus some define perseverance as a "science or habit regarding those 
things to which we should hold or not hold"; and holiness as "a science 
which makes man to be faithful and to do his duty to God." Now science is 
an intellectual virtue. Therefore moral virtue should not be 
distinguished from intellectual virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Soliloq. i, 6) that "virtue is the 
rectitude and perfection of reason." But this belongs to the intellectual 
virtues, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Therefore moral virtue does not 
differ from intellectual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a thing does not differ from that which is included in 
its definition. But intellectual virtue is included in the definition of 
moral virtue: for the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6) that "moral virtue 
is a habit of choosing the mean appointed by reason as a prudent man 
would appoint it." Now this right reason that fixes the mean of moral 
virtue, belongs to an intellectual virtue, as stated in Ethic. vi, 13. 
Therefore moral virtue does not differ from intellectual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in Ethic. i, 13 that "there are two kinds 
of virtue: some we call intellectual; some moral."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Reason is the first principle of all human acts; and 
whatever other principles of human acts may be found, they obey reason 
somewhat, but in various ways. For some obey reason blindly and without 
any contradiction whatever: such are the limbs of the body, provided they 
be in a healthy condition, for as soon as reason commands, the hand or 
the foot proceeds to action. Hence the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3) 
that "the soul rules the body like a despot," i.e. as a master rules his 
slave, who has no right to rebel. Accordingly some held that all the 
active principles in man are subordinate to reason in this way. If this 
were true, for man to act well it would suffice that his reason be 
perfect. Consequently, since virtue is a habit perfecting man in view of 
his doing good actions, it would follow that it is only in the reason, so 
that there would be none but intellectual virtues. This was the opinion 
of Socrates, who said "every virtue is a kind of prudence," as stated in 
Ethic. vi, 13. Hence he maintained that as long as man is in possession 
of knowledge, he cannot sin; and that every one who sins, does so through 
ignorance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is based on a false supposition. Because the appetitive faculty 
obeys the reason, not blindly, but with a certain power of opposition; 
wherefore the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3) that "reason commands the 
appetitive faculty by a politic power," whereby a man rules over subjects 
that are free, having a certain right of opposition. Hence Augustine says 
on Ps. 118 (Serm. 8) that "sometimes we understand [what is right] while 
desire is slow, or follows not at all," in so far as the habits or 
passions of the appetitive faculty cause the use of reason to be impeded 
in  some particular action. And in this way, there is some truth in the 
saying of Socrates that so long as a man is in possession of knowledge he 
does not sin: provided, however, that this knowledge is made to include 
the use of reason in this individual act of choice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly for a man to do a good deed, it is requisite not only that 
his reason be well disposed by means of a habit of intellectual virtue; 
but also that his appetite be well disposed by means of a habit of moral 
virtue. And so moral differs from intellectual virtue, even as the 
appetite differs from the reason. Hence just as the appetite is the 
principle of human acts, in so far as it partakes of reason, so are moral 
habits to be considered virtues in so far as they are in conformity with 
reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine usually applies the term "art" to any form of 
right reason; in which sense art includes prudence which is the right 
reason about things to be done, even as art is the right reason about 
things to be made. Accordingly, when he says that "virtue is the art of 
right conduct," this applies to prudence essentially; but to other 
virtues, by participation, for as much as they are directed by prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All such definitions, by whomsoever given, were based on 
the Socratic theory, and should be explained according to what we have 
said about art (ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same applies to the Third Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Right reason which is in accord with prudence is included 
in the definition of moral virtue, not as part of its essence, but as 
something belonging by way of participation to all the moral virtues, in 
so far as they are all under the direction of prudence.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtue is not adequately divided into moral 
and intellectual. For prudence seems to be a mean between moral and 
intellectual virtue, since it is reckoned among the intellectual virtues 
(Ethic. vi, 3,5); and again is placed by all among the four cardinal 
virtues, which are moral virtues, as we shall show further on (<A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore virtue is not adequately divided into intellectual and 
moral, as though there were no mean between them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contingency, perseverance, and patience are not reckoned 
to be intellectual virtues. Yet neither are they moral virtues; since 
they do not reduce the passions to a mean, and are consistent with an 
abundance of passion. Therefore virtue is not adequately divided into 
intellectual and moral.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith, hope, and charity are virtues. Yet they  are not 
intellectual virtues: for there are only five of these, viz. science, 
wisdom, understanding, prudence, and art, as stated above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,5). Neither are they moral virtues; since they are not about the 
passions, which are the chief concern of moral virtue. Therefore virtue 
is not adequately divided into intellectual and moral.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1) that "virtue is 
twofold, intellectual and moral."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Human virtue is a habit perfecting man in view of his 
doing good deeds. Now, in man there are but two principles of human 
actions, viz. the intellect or reason and the appetite: for these are the 
two principles of movement in man as stated in De Anima iii, text. 48. 
Consequently every human virtue must needs be a perfection of one of 
these principles. Accordingly if it perfects man's speculative or 
practical intellect in order that his deed may be good, it will be an 
intellectual virtue: whereas if it perfects his appetite, it will be a 
moral virtue. It follows therefore that every human virtue is either 
intellectual or moral.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prudence is essentially an intellectual virtue. But 
considered on the part of its matter, it has something in common with the 
moral virtues: for it is right reason about things to be done, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). It is in this sense that it is reckoned with the 
moral virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Contingency and perseverance are not perfections of the 
sensitive appetite. This is clear from the fact that passions abound in 
the continent and persevering man, which would not be the case if his 
sensitive appetite were perfected by a habit making it conformable to 
reason. Contingency and perseverance are, however, perfections of the 
rational faculty, and withstand the passions lest reason be led astray. 
But they fall short of being virtues: since intellectual virtue, which 
makes reason to hold itself well in respect of moral matters, presupposes 
a right appetite of the end, so that it may hold itself aright in respect 
of principles, i.e. the ends, on which it builds its argument: and this 
is wanting in the continent and persevering man. Nor again can an action 
proceeding from two principles be perfect, unless each principle be 
perfected by the habit corresponding to that operation: thus, however 
perfect be the principal agent employing an instrument, it will produce 
an imperfect effect, if the instrument be not well disposed also. Hence 
if the sensitive faculty, which is moved by the rational faculty, is not 
perfect; however perfect the rational faculty may be, the resulting 
action will be imperfect: and consequently the principle of that action 
will not be a virtue. And for this reason, contingency, desisting from 
pleasures, and perseverance in the midst of pains, are not virtues, but 
something less than a virtue, as the Philosopher maintains (Ethic. vii, 
1,9).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Faith, hope, and charity are superhuman virtues: for they 
are virtues of man as sharing in the grace of God.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that moral can be without intellectual virtue. 
Because moral virtue, as Cicero says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) is "a habit 
like a second nature in accord with reason." Now though nature may be in 
accord with some sovereign reason that moves it, there is no need for 
that reason to be united to nature in the same subject, as is evident of 
natural things devoid of knowledge. Therefore in a man there may be a 
moral virtue like a second nature, inclining him to consent to his 
reason, without his reason being perfected by an intellectual virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by means of intellectual virtue man obtains perfect use 
of reason. But it happens at times that men are virtuous and acceptable 
to God, without being vigorous in the use of reason. Therefore it seems 
that moral virtue can be without intellectual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further moral virtue makes us inclined to do good works. But 
some, without depending on the judgment of reason, have a natural 
inclination to do good works. Therefore moral virtues can be without 
intellectual virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxii) that "the other virtues, 
unless we do prudently what we desire to do, cannot be real virtues." But 
prudence is an intellectual virtue, as stated above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). 
Therefore moral virtues cannot be without intellectual virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Moral virtue can be without some of the intellectual 
virtues, viz. wisdom, science, and art; but not without understanding and 
prudence. Moral virtue cannot be without prudence, because it is a habit 
of choosing, i.e. making us choose well. Now in order that a choice be 
good, two things are required. First, that the intention be directed to a 
due end; and this is done by moral virtue, which inclines the appetitive 
faculty to the good that is in accord with reason, which is a due end. 
Secondly, that man take rightly those things which have reference to the 
end: and this he cannot do unless his reason counsel, judge and command 
aright, which is the function of prudence and the virtues annexed to it, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="FS057.html#FSQ57ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6). Wherefore there can be no moral virtue 
without prudence: and consequently neither can there be without 
understanding. For it is by the virtue of understanding that we know 
self-evident principles both in speculative and in practical matters. 
Consequently just as right reason in speculative matters, in so far as it 
proceeds from naturally known principles, presupposes the understanding 
of those principles, so also does prudence, which is the right reason 
about things to be done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The inclination of nature in things devoid of reason is 
without choice: wherefore such an inclination does not of necessity 
require reason. But the inclination of moral virtue is with choice: and 
consequently in order that it may be perfect it  requires that reason be 
perfected by intellectual virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man may be virtuous without having full use of reason as 
to everything, provided he have it with regard to those things which have 
to be done virtuously. In this way all virtuous men have full use of 
reason. Hence those who seem to be simple, through lack of worldly 
cunning, may possibly be prudent, according to Mt. 10:16: "Be ye 
therefore prudent [Douay: 'wise'] as serpents, and simple as doves."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The natural inclination to a good of virtue is a kind of 
beginning of virtue, but is not perfect virtue. For the stronger this 
inclination is, the more perilous may it prove to be, unless it be 
accompanied by right reason, which rectifies the choice of fitting means 
towards the due end. Thus if a running horse be blind, the faster it runs 
the more heavily will it fall, and the more grievously will it be hurt. 
And consequently, although moral virtue be not right reason, as Socrates 
held, yet not only is it "according to right reason," in so far as it 
inclines man to that which is, according to right reason, as the 
Platonists maintained [*Cf. Plato, Meno xli.]; but also it needs to be 
"joined with right reason," as Aristotle declares (Ethic. vi, 13).<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be intellectual without moral 
virtue. Because perfection of what precedes does not depend on the 
perfection of what follows. Now reason precedes and moves the sensitive 
appetite. Therefore intellectual virtue, which is a perfection of the 
reason, does not depend on moral virtue, which is a perfection of the 
appetitive faculty; and can be without it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, morals are the matter of prudence, even as things 
makeable are the matter of art. Now art can be without its proper matter, 
as a smith without iron. Therefore prudence can be without the moral 
virtue, although of all the intellectual virtues, it seems most akin to 
the moral virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prudence is "a virtue whereby we are of good counsel" 
(Ethic. vi, 9). Now many are of good counsel without having the moral 
virtues. Therefore prudence can be without a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> To wish to do evil is directly opposed to moral virtue; 
and yet it is not opposed to anything that can be without moral virtue. 
Now it is contrary to prudence "to sin willingly" (Ethic. vi, 5). 
Therefore prudence cannot be without moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Other intellectual virtues can, but prudence cannot, be 
without moral virtue. The reason for this is that prudence is the right 
reason about things to be done (and this, not merely in general, but also 
in particular); about which things  actions are. Now right reason demands 
principles from which reason proceeds to argue. And when reason argues 
about particular cases, it needs not only universal but also particular 
principles. As to universal principles of action, man is rightly disposed 
by the natural understanding of principles, whereby he understands that 
he should do no evil; or again by some practical science. But this is not 
enough in order that man may reason aright about particular cases. For it 
happens sometimes that the aforesaid universal principle, known by means 
of understanding or science, is destroyed in a particular case by a 
passion: thus to one who is swayed by concupiscence, when he is overcome 
thereby, the object of his desire seems good, although it is opposed to 
the universal judgment of his reason. Consequently, as by the habit of 
natural understanding or of science, man is made to be rightly disposed 
in regard to the universal principles of action; so, in order that he be 
rightly disposed with regard to the particular principles of action, viz. 
the ends, he needs to be perfected by certain habits, whereby it becomes 
connatural, as it were, to man to judge aright to the end. This is done 
by moral virtue: for the virtuous man judges aright of the end of virtue, 
because "such a man is, such does the end seem to him" (Ethic. iii, 5). 
Consequently the right reason about things to be done, viz. prudence, 
requires man to have moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Reason, as apprehending the end, precedes the appetite for 
the end: but appetite for the end precedes the reason, as arguing about 
the choice of the means, which is the concern of prudence. Even so, in 
speculative matters the understanding of principles is the foundation on 
which the syllogism of the reason is based.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It does not depend on the disposition of our appetite 
whether we judge well or ill of the principles of art, as it does, when 
we judge of the end which is the principle in moral matters: in the 
former case our judgment depends on reason alone. Hence art does not 
require a virtue perfecting the appetite, as prudence does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[58] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prudence not only helps us to be of good counsel, but also 
to judge and command well. This is not possible unless the impediment of 
the passions, destroying the judgment and command of prudence, be 
removed; and this is done by moral virtue.<br>
