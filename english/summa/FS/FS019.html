    OF THE GOODNESS AND MALICE OF THE INTERIOR ACT OF THE WILL (TEN ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the goodness of the interior act of the will; under
    which head there are ten points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the goodness of the will
    depends on the subject?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it depends on the object
    alone?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it depends on reason?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it depends on the eternal
    law?
  </p>
  <p><a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether erring reason binds?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the will is evil if it
    follows the erring reason against the law of God?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the goodness of the will
    in regard to the means, depends on the intention of the end?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the degree of goodness or
    malice in the will depends on the degree of good or evil in the
    intention?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether the goodness of the will
    depends on its conformity to the Divine Will?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether it is necessary for the
    human will, in order to be good, to be conformed to the Divine Will, as
    regards the thing willed?<br />

    Whether the goodness of the will depends on the object?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the will does
    not depend on the object. For the will cannot be directed otherwise than to
    what is good: since "evil is outside the scope of the will," as Dionysius
    says (Div. Nom. iv). If therefore the goodness of the will depended on the
    object, it would follow that every act of the will is good, and none bad.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, good is first of all in the end:
    wherefore the goodness of the end, as such, does not depend on any other.
    But, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 5), "goodness of action is the
    end, but goodness of making is never the end": because the latter is always
    ordained to the thing made, as to its end. Therefore the goodness of the act
    of the will does not depend on any object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, such as a thing is, such does it make a
    thing to be. But the object of the will is good, by reason of the goodness
    of nature. Therefore it cannot give moral goodness to the will. Therefore
    the moral goodness of the will does not depend on the object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that
    justice is that habit "from which men wish for just things": and
    accordingly, virtue is a habit from which men wish for good things. But a
    good will is one which is in accordance with virtue. Therefore the goodness
    of the will is from the fact that a man wills that which is good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Good and evil are essential differences of the
    act of the will. Because good and evil of themselves regard the will; just
    as truth and falsehood regard reason; the act of which is divided
    essentially by the difference of truth and falsehood, for as much as an
    opinion is said to be true or false. Consequently good and evil will are
    acts differing in species. Now the specific difference in acts is according
    to objects, as stated above (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore good and
    evil in the acts of the will is derived properly from the objects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The will is not always directed to what
    is truly good, but sometimes to the apparent good; which has indeed some
    measure of good, but not of a good that is simply suitable to be desired.
    Hence it is that the act of the will is not always good, but sometimes
    evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although an action can, in a certain
    way, be man's last end; nevertheless such action is not an act of the will,
    as stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Good is presented to the will as its
    object by the reason: and in so far as it is in accord with reason, it
    enters the moral order, and causes moral goodness in the act of the will:
    because the reason is the principle of human and moral acts, as stated above
    (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).

    Whether the goodness of the will depends on the object alone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the will does
    not depend on the object alone. For the end has a closer relationship to the
    will than to any other power. But the acts of the other powers derive
    goodness not only from the object but also from the end, as we have shown
    above (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore the act also
    of the will derives goodness not only from the object but also from the
    end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the goodness of an action is derived not
    only from the object but also from the circumstances, as stated above (<a
      href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But according to the
    diversity of circumstances there may be diversity of goodness and malice in
    the act of the will: for instance, if a man will, when he ought, where he
    ought, as much as he ought, and how he ought, or if he will as he ought not.
    Therefore the goodness of the will depends not only on the object, but also
    on the circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, ignorance of circumstances excuses
    malice of the will, as stated above (<a href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But it would not be
    so, unless the goodness or malice of the will depended on the circumstances.
    Therefore the goodness and malice of the will depend on the circumstances,
    and not only on the object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> An action does not take its species from the
    circumstances as such, as stated above (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>, ad 2). But good and
    evil are specific differences of the act of the will, as stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore the goodness and malice of the will depend, not on the
    circumstances, but on the object alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In every genus, the more a thing is first, the
    more simple it is, and the fewer the principles of which it consists: thus
    primary bodies are simple. Hence it is to be observed that the first things
    in every genus, are, in some way, simple and consist of one principle. Now
    the principle of the goodness and malice of human actions is taken from the
    act of the will. Consequently the goodness and malice of the act of the will
    depend on some one thing; while the goodness and malice of other acts may
    depend on several things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that one thing which is the principle in each genus, is not something
    accidental to that genus, but something essential thereto: because whatever
    is accidental is reduced to something essential, as to its principle.
    Therefore the goodness of the will's act depends on that one thing alone,
    which of itself causes goodness in the act; and that one thing is the
    object, and not the circumstances, which are accidents, as it were, of the
    act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The end is the object of the will, but
    not of the other powers. Hence, in regard to the act of the will, the
    goodness derived from the object, does not differ from that which is derived
    from the end, as they differ in the acts of the other powers; except perhaps
    accidentally, in so far as one end depends on another, and one act of the
    will on another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Given that the act of the will is fixed
    on some good, no circumstances can make that act bad. Consequently when it
    is said that a man wills a good when he ought not, or where he ought not,
    this can be understood in two ways. First, so that this circumstance is
    referred to the thing willed. And thus the act of the will is not fixed on
    something good: since to will to do something when it ought not to be done,
    is not to will something good. Secondly, so that the circumstance is
    referred to the act of willing. And thus, it is impossible to will something
    good when one ought not to, because one ought always to will what is good:
    except, perhaps, accidentally, in so far as a man by willing some particular
    good, is prevented from willing at the same time another good which he ought
    to will at that time. And then evil results, not from his willing that
    particular good, but from his not willing the other. The same applies to the
    other circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Ignorance of circumstances excuses
    malice of the will, in so far as the circumstance affects the thing willed:
    that is to say, in so far as a man ignores the circumstances of the act
    which he wills.<br />

    Whether the goodness of the will depends on reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the will does
    not depend on reason. For what comes first does not depend on what follows.
    But the good belongs to the will before it belongs to reason, as is clear
    from what has been said above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the goodness
    of the will does not depend on reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 2) that
    the goodness of the practical intellect is "a truth that is in conformity
    with right desire." But right desire is a good will. Therefore the goodness
    of the practical reason depends on the goodness of the will, rather than
    conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the mover does not depend on that which
    is moved, but vice versa. But the will moves the reason and the other
    powers, as stated above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the goodness of
    the will does not depend on reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hilary says (De Trin. x): "It is an unruly
    will that persists in its desires in opposition to reason." But the goodness
    of the will consists in not being unruly. Therefore the goodness of the will
    depends on its being subject to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), the goodness of the will depends properly on the object. Now the
    will's object is proposed to it by reason. Because the good understood is
    the proportionate object of the will; while sensitive or imaginary good is
    proportionate not to the will but to the sensitive appetite: since the will
    can tend to the universal good, which reason apprehends; whereas the
    sensitive appetite tends only to the particular good, apprehended by the
    sensitive power. Therefore the goodness of the will depends on reason, in
    the same way as it depends on the object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The good considered as such, i.e. as
    appetible, pertains to the will before pertaining to the reason. But
    considered as true it pertains to the reason, before, under the aspect of
    goodness, pertaining to the will: because the will cannot desire a good that
    is not previously apprehended by reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher speaks here of the
    practical intellect, in so far as it counsels and reasons about the means:
    for in this respect it is perfected by prudence. Now in regard to the means,
    the rectitude of the reason depends on its conformity with the desire of a
    due end: nevertheless the very desire of the due end presupposes on the part
    of reason a right apprehension of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The will moves the reason in one way:
    the reason moves the will in another, viz. on the part of the object, as
    stated above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).

    Whether the goodness of the will depends on the eternal law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the human will
    does not depend on the eternal law. Because to one thing there is one rule
    and one measure. But the rule of the human will, on which its goodness
    depends, is right reason. Therefore the goodness of the will does not depend
    on the eternal law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "a measure is homogeneous with the thing
    measured" (Metaph. x, 1). But the eternal law is not homogeneous with the
    human will. Therefore the eternal law cannot be the measure on which the
    goodness of the human will depends.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a measure should be most certain. But
    the eternal law is unknown to us. Therefore it cannot be the measure on
    which the goodness of our will depends.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) that
    "sin is a deed, word or desire against the eternal law." But malice of the
    will is the root of sin. Therefore, since malice is contrary to goodness,
    the goodness of the will depends on the eternal law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Wherever a number of causes are subordinate to
    one another, the effect depends more on the first than on the second cause:
    since the second cause acts only in virtue of the first. Now it is from the
    eternal law, which is the Divine Reason, that human reason is the rule of
    the human will, from which the human derives its goodness. Hence it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++4%3A6,7"
      >Ps. 4:6,7</a
    >): "Many say: Who showeth us good things? The light of Thy countenance, O
    Lord, is signed upon us": as though to say: "The light of our reason is able
    to show us good things, and guide our will, in so far as it is the light
    (i.e. derived from) Thy countenance." It is therefore evident that the
    goodness of the human will depends on the eternal law much more than on
    human reason: and when human reason fails we must have recourse to the
    Eternal Reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To one thing there are not several
    proximate measures; but there can be several measures if one is subordinate
    to the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A proximate measure is homogeneous with
    the thing measured; a remote measure is not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the eternal law is unknown to
    us according as it is in the Divine Mind: nevertheless, it becomes known to
    us somewhat, either by natural reason which is derived therefrom as its
    proper image; or by some sort of additional revelation.<br />

    Whether the will is evil when it is at variance with erring reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is not evil when it
    is at variance with erring reason. Because the reason is the rule of the
    human will, in so far as it is derived from the eternal law, as stated above
    (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But erring reason is
    not derived from the eternal law. Therefore erring reason is not the rule of
    the human will. Therefore the will is not evil, if it be at variance with
    erring reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine, the command of a
    lower authority does not bind if it be contrary to the command of a higher
    authority: for instance, if a provincial governor command something that is
    forbidden by the emperor. But erring reason sometimes proposes what is
    against the command of a higher power, namely, God Whose power is supreme.
    Therefore the decision of an erring reason does not bind. Consequently the
    will is not evil if it be at variance with erring reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every evil will is reducible to some
    species of malice. But the will that is at variance with erring reason is
    not reducible to some species of malice. For instance, if a man's reason err
    in telling him to commit fornication, his will in not willing to do so,
    cannot be reduced to any species of malice. Therefore the will is not evil
    when it is at variance with erring reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [79], Article
    [13], conscience is nothing else than the application of knowledge to some
    action. Now knowledge is in the reason. Therefore when the will is at
    variance with erring reason, it is against conscience. But every such will
    is evil; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A23"
      >Rm. 14:23</a
    >): "All that is not of faith"---i.e. all that is against conscience---"is
    sin." Therefore the will is evil when it is at variance with erring
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since conscience is a kind of dictate of the
    reason (for it is an application of knowledge to action, as was stated in
    the FP, Question [19], Article [13]), to inquire whether the will is evil
    when it is at variance with erring reason, is the same as to inquire
    "whether an erring conscience binds." On this matter, some distinguished
    three kinds of actions: for some are good generically; some are indifferent;
    some are evil generically. And they say that if reason or conscience tell us
    to do something which is good generically, there is no error: and in like
    manner if it tell us not to do something which is evil generically; since it
    is the same reason that prescribes what is good and forbids what is evil. On
    the other hand if a man's reason or conscience tells him that he is bound by
    precept to do what is evil in itself; or that what is good in itself, is
    forbidden, then his reason or conscience errs. In like manner if a man's
    reason or conscience tell him, that what is indifferent in itself, for
    instance to raise a straw from the ground, is forbidden or commanded, his
    reason or conscience errs. They say, therefore, that reason or conscience
    when erring in matters of indifference, either by commanding or by
    forbidding them, binds: so that the will which is at variance with that
    erring reason is evil and sinful. But they say that when reason or
    conscience errs in commanding what is evil in itself, or in forbidding what
    is good in itself and necessary for salvation, it does not bind; wherefore
    in such cases the will which is at variance with erring reason or conscience
    is not evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this is unreasonable. For in matters of indifference, the will that is
    at variance with erring reason or conscience, is evil in some way on account
    of the object, on which the goodness or malice of the will depends; not
    indeed on account of the object according as it is in its own nature; but
    according as it is accidentally apprehended by reason as something evil to
    do or to avoid. And since the object of the will is that which is proposed
    by the reason, as stated above (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), from the very fact that a thing is proposed by the reason as being evil,
    the will by tending thereto becomes evil. And this is the case not only in
    indifferent matters, but also in those that are good or evil in themselves.
    For not only indifferent matters can received the character of goodness or
    malice accidentally; but also that which is good, can receive the character
    of evil, or that which is evil, can receive the character of goodness, on
    account of the reason apprehending it as such. For instance, to refrain from
    fornication is good: yet the will does not tend to this good except in so
    far as it is proposed by the reason. If, therefore, the erring reason
    propose it as an evil, the will tends to it as to something evil.
    Consequently the will is evil, because it wills evil, not indeed that which
    is evil in itself, but that which is evil accidentally, through being
    apprehended as such by the reason. In like manner, to believe in Christ is
    good in itself, and necessary for salvation: but the will does not tend
    thereto, except inasmuch as it is proposed by the reason. Consequently if it
    be proposed by the reason as something evil, the will tends to it as to
    something evil: not as if it were evil in itself, but because it is evil
    accidentally, through the apprehension of the reason. Hence the Philosopher
    says (Ethic. vii, 9) that "properly speaking the incontinent man is one who
    does not follow right reason; but accidentally, he is also one who does not
    follow false reason." We must therefore conclude that, absolutely speaking,
    every will at variance with reason, whether right or erring, is always
    evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the judgment of an erring
    reason is not derived from God, yet the erring reason puts forward its
    judgment as being true, and consequently as being derived from God, from
    Whom is all truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The saying of Augustine holds good when
    it is known that the inferior authority prescribes something contrary to the
    command of the higher authority. But if a man were to believe the command of
    the proconsul to be the command of the emperor, in scorning the command of
    the proconsul he would scorn the command of the emperor. In like manner if a
    man were to know that human reason was dictating something contrary to God's
    commandment, he would not be bound to abide by reason: but then reason would
    not be entirely erroneous. But when erring reason proposes something as
    being commanded by God, then to scorn the dictate of reason is to scorn the
    commandment of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whenever reason apprehends something as
    evil, it apprehends it under some species of evil; for instance, as being
    something contrary to a divine precept, or as giving scandal, or for some
    such like reason. And then that evil is reduced to that species of
    malice.<br />

    Whether the will is good when it abides by erring reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is good when it
    abides by erring reason. For just as the will, when at variance with the
    reason, tends to that which reason judges to be evil; so, when in accord
    with reason, it tends to what reason judges to be good. But the will is evil
    when it is at variance with reason, even when erring. Therefore even when it
    abides by erring reason, the will is good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the will is always good, when it abides
    by the commandment of God and the eternal law. But the eternal law and God's
    commandment are proposed to us by the apprehension of the reason, even when
    it errs. Therefore the will is good, even when it abides by erring
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the will is evil when it is at variance
    with erring reason. If, therefore, the will is evil also when it abides by
    erring reason, it seems that the will is always evil when in conjunction
    with erring reason: so that in such a case a man would be in a dilemma, and,
    of necessity, would sin: which is unreasonable. Therefore the will is good
    when it abides by erring reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The will of those who slew the apostles was
    evil. And yet it was in accord with the erring reason, according to Jn.
    16:2: "The hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth
    a service to God." Therefore the will can be evil, when it abides by erring
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whereas the previous question is the same as
    inquiring "whether an erring conscience binds"; so this question is the same
    as inquiring "whether an erring conscience excuses." Now this question
    depends on what has been said above about ignorance. For it was said (<a
      href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) that ignorance
    sometimes causes an act to be involuntary, and sometimes not. And since
    moral good and evil consist in action in so far as it is voluntary, as was
    stated above (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); it is
    evident that when ignorance causes an act to be involuntary, it takes away
    the character of moral good and evil; but not, when it does not cause the
    act to be involuntary. Again, it has been stated above (<a
      href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) that when ignorance is
    in any way willed, either directly or indirectly, it does not cause the act
    to be involuntary. And I call that ignorance "directly" voluntary, to which
    the act of the will tends: and that, "indirectly" voluntary, which is due to
    negligence, by reason of a man not wishing to know what he ought to know, as
    stated above (<a href="FS006.html#FSQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>,
    <a href="FS006.html#FSQ6A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If then reason or conscience err with an error that is involuntary, either
    directly, or through negligence, so that one errs about what one ought to
    know; then such an error of reason or conscience does not excuse the will,
    that abides by that erring reason or conscience, from being evil. But if the
    error arise from ignorance of some circumstance, and without any negligence,
    so that it cause the act to be involuntary, then that error of reason or
    conscience excuses the will, that abides by that erring reason, from being
    evil. For instance, if erring reason tell a man that he should go to another
    man's wife, the will that abides by that erring reason is evil; since this
    error arises from ignorance of the Divine Law, which he is bound to know.
    But if a man's reason, errs in mistaking another for his wife, and if he
    wish to give her her right when she asks for it, his will is excused from
    being evil: because this error arises from ignorance of a circumstance,
    which ignorance excuses, and causes the act to be involuntary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), "good
    results from the entire cause, evil from each particular defect."
    Consequently in order that the thing to which the will tends be called evil,
    it suffices, either that it be evil in itself, or that it be apprehended as
    evil. But in order for it to be good, it must be good in both ways.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The eternal law cannot err, but human
    reason can. Consequently the will that abides by human reason, is not always
    right, nor is it always in accord with the eternal law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as in syllogistic arguments,
    granted one absurdity, others must needs follow; so in moral matters, given
    one absurdity, others must follow too. Thus suppose a man to seek vainglory,
    he will sin, whether he does his duty for vainglory or whether he omit to do
    it. Nor is he in a dilemma about the matter: because he can put aside his
    evil intention. In like manner, suppose a man's reason or conscience to err
    through inexcusable ignorance, then evil must needs result in the will. Nor
    is this man in a dilemma: because he can lay aside his error, since his
    ignorance is vincible and voluntary.<br />

    Whether the goodness of the will, as regards the means, depends on the
    intention of the end?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the will does
    not depend on the intention of the end. For it has been stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) that the goodness of the will depends on the object alone. But as regards
    the means, the object of the will is one thing, and the end intended is
    another. Therefore in such matters the goodness of the will does not depend
    on the intention of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to wish to keep God's commandment,
    belongs to a good will. But this can be referred to an evil end, for
    instance, to vainglory or covetousness, by willing to obey God for the sake
    of temporal gain. Therefore the goodness of the will does not depend on the
    intention of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as good and evil diversify the
    will, so do they diversify the end. But malice of the will does not depend
    on the malice of the end intended; since a man who wills to steal in order
    to give alms, has an evil will, although he intends a good end. Therefore
    neither does the goodness of the will depend on the goodness of the end
    intended.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. ix, 3) that God
    rewards the intention. But God rewards a thing because it is good. Therefore
    the goodness of the will depends on the intention of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The intention may stand in a twofold relation
    to the act of the will; first, as preceding it, secondly as following
    [*Leonine edn.: 'accompanying'] it. The intention precedes the act of the
    will causally, when we will something because we intend a certain end. And
    then the order to the end is considered as the reason of the goodness of the
    thing willed: for instance, when a man wills to fast for God's sake; because
    the act of fasting is specifically good from the very fact that it is done
    for God's sake. Wherefore, since the goodness of the will depends on the
    goodness of the thing willed, as stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), it must, of necessity, depend on the intention of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, intention follows the act of the will, when it is added
    to a preceding act of the will; for instance, a man may will to do
    something, and may afterwards refer it to God. And then the goodness of the
    previous act of the will does not depend on the subsequent intention, except
    in so far as that act is repeated with the subsequent intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the intention is the cause of the
    act of willing, the order to the end is considered as the reason of the
    goodness of the object, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The act of the will cannot be said to be
    good, if an evil intention is the cause of willing. For when a man wills to
    give an alms for the sake of vainglory, he wills that which is good in
    itself, under a species of evil; and therefore, as willed by him, it is
    evil. Wherefore his will is evil. If, however, the intention is subsequent
    to the act of the will, then the latter may be good: and the intention does
    not spoil that act of the will which preceded, but that which is
    repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As we have already stated (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >, ad 1), "evil results from each particular defect, but good from the whole
    and entire cause." Hence, whether the will tend to what is evil in itself,
    even under the species of good; or to the good under the species of evil, it
    will be evil in either case. But in order for the will to be good, it must
    tend to the good under the species of good; in other words, it must will the
    good for the sake of the good.<br />

    Whether the degree of goodness or malice in the will depends on the degree
    of good or evil in the intention?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degree of goodness in the
    will depends on the degree of good in the intention. Because on Mt. 12:35,
    "A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which
    is good," a gloss says: "A man does as much good as he intends." But the
    intention gives goodness not only to the external action, but also to the
    act of the will, as stated above (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >). Therefore the goodness of a man's will is according to the goodness of
    his intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if you add to the cause, you add to the
    effect. But the goodness of the intention is the cause of the good will.
    Therefore a man's will is good, according as his intention is good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in evil actions, a man sins in
    proportion to his intention: for if a man were to throw a stone with a
    murderous intention, he would be guilty of murder. Therefore, for the same
    reason, in good actions, the will is good in proportion to the good
    intended.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The intention can be good, while the will is
    evil. Therefore, for the same reason, the intention can be better, and the
    will less good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In regard to both the act, and the intention of
    the end, we may consider a twofold quantity: one, on the part of the object,
    by reason of a man willing or doing a good that is greater; the other, taken
    from the intensity of the act, according as a man wills or acts intensely;
    and this is more on the part of the agent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If then we speak of these respective quantities from the point of view of
    the object, it is evident that the quantity in the act does not depend on
    the quantity in the intention. With regard to the external act this may
    happen in two ways. First, through the object that is ordained to the
    intended end not being proportionate to that end; for instance, if a man
    were to give ten pounds, he could not realize his intention, if he intended
    to buy a thing worth a hundred pounds. Secondly, on account of the obstacles
    that may supervene in regard to the exterior action, which obstacles we are
    unable to remove: for instance, a man intends to go to Rome, and encounters
    obstacles, which prevent him from going. On the other hand, with regard to
    the interior act of the will, this happens in only one way: because the
    interior acts of the will are in our power, whereas the external actions are
    not. But the will can will an object that is not proportionate to the
    intended end: and thus the will that tends to that object considered
    absolutely, is not so good as the intention. Yet because the intention also
    belongs, in a way, to the act of the will, inasmuch, to wit, as it is the
    reason thereof; it comes to pass that the quantity of goodness in the
    intention redounds upon the act of the will; that is to say, in so far as
    the will wills some great good for an end, although that by which it wills
    to gain so great a good, is not proportionate to that good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we consider the quantity in the intention and in the act, according
    to their respective intensity, then the intensity of the intention redounds
    upon the interior act and the exterior act of the will: since the intention
    stands in relation to them as a kind of form, as is clear from what has been
    said above (<a href="FS012.html#FSQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>,
    <a href="FS012.html#FSQ12A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). And yet considered
    materially, while the intention is intense, the interior or exterior act may
    be not so intense, materially speaking: for instance, when a man does not
    will with as much intensity to take medicine as he wills to regain health.
    Nevertheless the very fact of intending health intensely, redounds, as a
    formal principle, upon the intense volition of medicine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must observe, however, that the intensity of the interior or exterior
    act, may be referred to the intention as its object: as when a man intends
    to will intensely, or to do something intensely. And yet it does not follow
    that he wills or acts intensely; because the quantity of goodness in the
    interior or exterior act does not depend on the quantity of the good
    intended, as is shown above. And hence it is that a man does not merit as
    much as he intends to merit: because the quantity of merit is measured by
    the intensity of the act, as we shall show later on (<a

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This gloss speaks of good as in the
    estimation of God, Who considers principally the intention of the end.
    Wherefore another gloss says on the same passage that "the treasure of the
    heart is the intention, according to which God judges our works." For the
    goodness of the intention, as stated above, redounds, so to speak, upon the
    goodness of the will, which makes even the external act to be meritorious in
    God's sight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The goodness of the intention is not the
    whole cause of a good will. Hence the argument does not prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The mere malice of the intention
    suffices to make the will evil: and therefore too, the will is as evil as
    the intention is evil. But the same reasoning does not apply to goodness, as
    stated above (ad 2).<br />

    Whether the goodness of the will depends on its conformity to the Divine
    will?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness of the human will
    does not depend on its conformity to the Divine will. Because it is
    impossible for man's will to be conformed to the Divine will; as appears
    from the word of Isaias 55:9: "As the heavens are exalted above the earth,
    so are My ways exalted above your ways, and My thoughts above your
    thoughts." If therefore goodness of the will depended on its conformity to
    the Divine will, it would follow that it is impossible for man's will to be
    good. Which is inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as our wills arise from the Divine
    will, so does our knowledge flow from the Divine knowledge. But our
    knowledge does not require to be conformed to God's knowledge; since God
    knows many things that we know not. Therefore there is no need for our will
    to be conformed to the Divine will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the will is a principle of action. But
    our action cannot be conformed to God's. Therefore neither can our will be
    conformed to His.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A39"
      >Mt. 26:39</a
    >): "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt": which words He said, because "He
    wishes man to be upright and to tend to God," as Augustine expounds in the
    Enchiridion [*Enarr. in Ps. 32, serm. i.]. But the rectitude of the will is
    its goodness. Therefore the goodness of the will depends on its conformity
    to the Divine will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >), the goodness of the will depends on the intention of the end. Now the
    last end of the human will is the Sovereign Good, namely, God, as stated
    above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>;
    <a href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the goodness of
    the human will requires it to be ordained to the Sovereign Good, that is, to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this Good is primarily and essentially compared to the Divine will, as
    its proper object. Again, that which is first in any genus is the measure
    and rule of all that belongs to that genus. Moreover, everything attains to
    rectitude and goodness, in so far as it is in accord with its proper
    measure. Therefore, in order that man's will be good it needs to be
    conformed to the Divine will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The human will cannot be conformed to
    the will of God so as to equal it, but only so as to imitate it. In like
    manner human knowledge is conformed to the Divine knowledge, in so far as it
    knows truth: and human action is conformed to the Divine, in so far as it is
    becoming to the agent: and this by way of imitation, not by way of
    equality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From the above may be gathered the replies to the Second and Third
    Objections.<br />

    Whether it is necessary for the human will, in order to be good, to be
    conformed to the Divine will, as regards the thing willed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human will need not always
    be conformed to the Divine will, as regards the thing willed. For we cannot
    will what we know not: since the apprehended good is the object of the will.
    But in many things we know not what God wills. Therefore the human will
    cannot be conformed to the Divine will as to the thing willed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God wills to damn the man whom He
    foresees about to die in mortal sin. If therefore man were bound to conform
    his will to the Divine will, in the point of the thing willed, it would
    follow that a man is bound to will his own damnation. Which is
    inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to will what is against
    filial piety. But if man were to will what God wills, this would sometimes
    be contrary to filial piety: for instance, when God wills the death of a
    father: if his son were to will it also, it would be against filial piety.
    Therefore man is not bound to conform his will to the Divine will, as to the
    thing willed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> (1) On Ps. 32:1, "Praise becometh the
    upright," a gloss says: "That man has an upright heart, who wills what God
    wills." But everyone is bound to have an upright heart. Therefore everyone
    is bound to will what God wills.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) Moreover, the will takes its form from the object, as does every act. If
    therefore man is bound to conform his will to the Divine will, it follows
    that he is bound to conform it, as to the thing willed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) Moreover, opposition of wills arises from men willing different things.
    But whoever has a will in opposition to the Divine will, has an evil will.
    Therefore whoever does not conform his will to the Divine will, as to the
    thing willed, has an evil will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is evident from what has been said above (<a
      href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1"
      >Articles [3]</a
    >,5), the will tends to its object, according as it is proposed by the
    reason. Now a thing may be considered in various ways by the reason, so as
    to appear good from one point of view, and not good from another point of
    view. And therefore if a man's will wills a thing to be, according as it
    appears to be good, his will is good: and the will of another man, who wills
    that thing not to be, according as it appears evil, is also good. Thus a
    judge has a good will, in willing a thief to be put to death, because this
    is just: while the will of another---e.g. the thief's wife or son, who
    wishes him not to be put to death, inasmuch as killing is a natural evil, is
    also good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now since the will follows the apprehension of the reason or intellect; the
    more universal the aspect of the apprehended good, the more universal the
    good to which the will tends. This is evident in the example given above:
    because the judge has care of the common good, which is justice, and
    therefore he wishes the thief's death, which has the aspect of good in
    relation to the common estate; whereas the thief's wife has to consider the
    private, the good of the family, and from this point of view she wishes her
    husband, the thief, not to be put to death. Now the good of the whole
    universe is that which is apprehended by God, Who is the Maker and Governor
    of all things: hence whatever He wills, He wills it under the aspect of the
    common good; this is His own Goodness, which is the good of the whole
    universe. On the other hand, the apprehension of a creature, according to
    its nature, is of some particular good, proportionate to that nature. Now a
    thing may happen to be good under a particular aspect, and yet not good
    under a universal aspect, or vice versa, as stated above. And therefore it
    comes to pass that a certain will is good from willing something considered
    under a particular aspect, which thing God wills not, under a universal
    aspect, and vice versa. And hence too it is, that various wills of various
    men can be good in respect of opposite things, for as much as, under various
    aspects, they wish a particular thing to be or not to be.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But a man's will is not right in willing a particular good, unless he refer
    it to the common good as an end: since even the natural appetite of each
    part is ordained to the common good of the whole. Now it is the end that
    supplies the formal reason, as it were, of willing whatever is directed to
    the end. Consequently, in order that a man will some particular good with a
    right will, he must will that particular good materially, and the Divine and
    universal good, formally. Therefore the human will is bound to be conformed
    to the Divine will, as to that which is willed formally, for it is bound to
    will the Divine and universal good; but not as to that which is willed
    materially, for the reason given above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time in both these respects, the human will is conformed to the
    Divine, in a certain degree. Because inasmuch as it is conformed to the
    Divine will in the common aspect of the thing willed, it is conformed
    thereto in the point of the last end. While, inasmuch as it is not conformed
    to the Divine will in the thing willed materially, it is conformed to that
    will considered as efficient cause; since the proper inclination consequent
    to nature, or to the particular apprehension of some particular thing, comes
    to a thing from God as its efficient cause. Hence it is customary to say
    that a man's will, in this respect, is conformed to the Divine will, because
    it wills what God wishes him to will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There is yet another kind of conformity in respect of the formal cause,
    consisting in man's willing something from charity, as God wills it. And
    this conformity is also reduced to the formal conformity, that is in respect
    of the last end, which is the proper object of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We can know in a general way what God
    wills. For we know that whatever God wills, He wills it under the aspect of
    good. Consequently whoever wills a thing under any aspect of good, has a
    will conformed to the Divine will, as to the reason of the thing willed. But
    we know not what God wills in particular: and in this respect we are not
    bound to conform our will to the Divine will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But in the state of glory, every one will see in each thing that he wills,
    the relation of that thing to what God wills in that particular matter.
    Consequently he will conform his will to God in all things not only
    formally, but also materially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God does not will the damnation of a
    man, considered precisely as damnation, nor a man's death, considered
    precisely as death, because, "He wills all men to be saved" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++2%3A4"
      >1 Tim. 2:4</a
    >); but He wills such things under the aspect of justice. Wherefore in
    regard to such things it suffices for man to will the upholding of God's
    justice and of the natural order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Wherefore the reply to the Third Objection is evident.</p>
  <p>
    To the first argument advanced in a contrary sense, it should be said that a
    man who conforms his will to God's, in the aspect of reason of the thing
    willed, wills what God wills, more than the man, who conforms his will to
    God's, in the point of the very thing willed; because the will tends more to
    the end, than to that which is on account of the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To the second, it must be replied that the species and form of an act are
    taken from the object considered formally, rather than from the object
    considered materially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To the third, it must be said that there is no opposition of wills when
    several people desire different things, but not under the same aspect: but
    there is opposition of wills, when under one and the same aspect, one man
    wills a thing which another wills not. But there is no question of this
    here.<br />
