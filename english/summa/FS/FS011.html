    OF ENJOYMENT [*Or, Fruition], WHICH IS AN ACT OF THE WILL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />

  <p>
    We must now consider enjoyment: concerning which there are four points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether to enjoy is an act of the
    appetitive power?
  </p>

    creature alone, or also to irrational animals?<br />

    last end?

    Whether to enjoy is an act of the appetitive power?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to enjoy belongs not only to
    the appetitive power. For to enjoy seems nothing else than to receive the
    fruit. But it is the intellect, in whose act Happiness consists, as shown
    above (<a href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="FS003.html#FSQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), that receives the fruit
    of human life, which is Happiness. Therefore to enjoy is not an act of the
    appetitive power, but of the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, each power has its proper end, which is
    its perfection: thus the end of sight is to know the visible; of the
    hearing, to perceive sounds; and so forth. But the end of a thing is its
    fruit. Therefore to enjoy belongs to each power, and not only to the
    appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, enjoyment implies a certain delight. But
    sensible delight belongs to sense, which delights in its object: and for the
    same reason, intellectual delight belongs to the intellect. Therefore
    enjoyment belongs to the apprehensive, and not to the appetitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 4; and
    De Trin. x, 10,11): "To enjoy is to adhere lovingly to something for its own
    sake." But love belongs to the appetitive power. Therefore also to enjoy is
    an act of the appetitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "Fruitio" [enjoyment] and "fructus" [fruit]
    seem to refer to the same, one being derived from the other; which from
    which, matters not for our purpose; though it seems probable that the one
    which is more clearly known, was first named. Now those things are most
    manifest to us which appeal most to the senses: wherefore it seems that the
    word "fruition" is derived from sensible fruits. But sensible fruit is that
    which we expect the tree to produce in the last place, and in which a
    certain sweetness is to be perceived. Hence fruition seems to have relation
    to love, or to the delight which one has in realizing the longed-for term,
    which is the end. Now the end and the good is the object of the appetitive
    power. Wherefore it is evident that fruition is the act of the appetitive
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing hinders one and the same thing
    from belonging, under different aspects, to different powers. Accordingly
    the vision of God, as vision, is an act of the intellect, but as a good and
    an end, is the object of the will. And as such is the fruition thereof: so
    that the intellect attains this end, as the executive power, but the will as
    the motive power, moving (the powers) towards the end and enjoying the end
    attained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The perfection and end of every other
    power is contained in the object of the appetitive power, as the proper is
    contained in the common, as stated above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence the perfection
    and end of each power, in so far as it is a good, belongs to the appetitive
    power. Wherefore the appetitive power moves the other powers to their ends;
    and itself realizes the end, when each of them reaches the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In delight there are two things:
    perception of what is becoming; and this belongs to the apprehensive power;
    and complacency in that which is offered as becoming: and this belongs to
    the appetitive power, in which power delight is formally completed.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether to enjoy belongs to the rational creature alone, or also to
    irrational animals?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to enjoy belongs to men alone.
    For Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22) that "it is given to us men to
    enjoy and to use." Therefore other animals cannot enjoy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to enjoy relates to the last end. But
    irrational animals cannot obtain the last end. Therefore it is not for them
    to enjoy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the sensitive appetite is
    beneath the intellectual appetite, so is the natural appetite beneath the
    sensitive. If, therefore, to enjoy belongs to the sensitive appetite, it
    seems that for the same reason it can belong to the natural appetite. But
    this is evidently false, since the latter cannot delight in anything.
    Therefore the sensitive appetite cannot enjoy: and accordingly enjoyment is
    not possible for irrational animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 30): "It
    is not so absurd to suppose that even beasts enjoy their food and any bodily
    pleasure."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was stated above (<a
      href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) to enjoy is not the act of the power that achieves the end as executor,
    but of the power that commands the achievement; for it has been said to
    belong to the appetitive power. Now things void of reason have indeed a
    power of achieving an end by way of execution, as that by which a heavy body
    has a downward tendency, whereas a light body has an upward tendency. Yet
    the power of command in respect of the end is not in them, but in some
    higher nature, which moves all nature by its command, just as in things
    endowed with knowledge, the appetite moves the other powers to their acts.
    Wherefore it is clear that things void of knowledge, although they attain an
    end, have no enjoyment of the end: this is only for those that are endowed
    with knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now knowledge of the end is twofold: perfect and imperfect. Perfect
    knowledge of the end, is that whereby not only is that known which is the
    end and the good, but also the universal formality of the end and the good;
    and such knowledge belongs to the rational nature alone. On the other hand,
    imperfect knowledge is that by which the end and the good are known in the
    particular. Such knowledge is in irrational animals: whose appetitive powers
    do not command with freedom, but are moved according to a natural instinct
    to whatever they apprehend. Consequently, enjoyment belongs to the rational
    nature, in a perfect degree; to irrational animals, imperfectly; to other
    creatures, not at all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of perfect
    enjoyment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Enjoyment need not be of the last end
    simply; but of that which each one chooses for his last end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sensitive appetite follows some
    knowledge; not so the natural appetite, especially in things void of
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of imperfect
    enjoyment. This is clear from his way of speaking: for he says that "it is
    not so absurd to suppose that even beasts enjoy," that is, as it would be,
    if one were to say that they "use."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether enjoyment is only of the last end?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that enjoyment is not only of the
    last end. For the Apostle says (Philem. 20): "Yea, brother, may I enjoy thee
    in the Lord." But it is evident that Paul had not placed his last end in a
    man. Therefore to enjoy is not only of the last end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what we enjoy is the fruit. But the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A22"
      >Gal. 5:22</a
    >): "The fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, peace," and other like things,
    which are not in the nature of the last end. Therefore enjoyment is not only
    of the last end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the acts of the will reflect on one
    another; for I will to will, and I love to love. But to enjoy is an act of
    the will: since "it is the will with which we enjoy," as Augustine says (De
    Trin. x, 10). Therefore a man enjoys his enjoyment. But the last end of man
    is not enjoyment, but the uncreated good alone, which is God. Therefore
    enjoyment is not only of the last end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. x, 11): "A man does
    not enjoy that which he desires for the sake of something else." But the
    last end alone is that which man does not desire for the sake of something
    else. Therefore enjoyment is of the last end alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) the notion of fruit implies two things: first that it should come last;
    second, that it should calm the appetite with a certain sweetness and
    delight. Now a thing is last either simply or relatively; simply, if it be
    referred to nothing else; relatively, if it is the last in a particular
    series. Therefore that which is last simply, and in which one delights as in
    the last end, is properly called fruit; and this it is that one is properly
    said to enjoy. But that which is delightful not in itself, but is desired,
    only as referred to something else, e.g. a bitter potion for the sake of
    health, can nowise be called fruit. And that which has something delightful
    about it, to which a number of preceding things are referred, may indeed by
    called fruit in a certain manner; but we cannot be said to enjoy it properly
    or as though it answered perfectly to the notion of fruit. Hence Augustine
    says (De Trin. x, 10) that "we enjoy what we know, when the delighted will
    is at rest therein." But its rest is not absolute save in the possession of
    the last end: for as long as something is looked for, the movement of the
    will remains in suspense, although it has reached something. Thus in local
    movement, although any point between the two terms is a beginning and an
    end, yet it is not considered as an actual end, except when the movement
    stops there.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i,
    33), "if he had said, 'May I enjoy thee,' without adding 'in the Lord,' he
    would seem to have set the end of his love in him. But since he added that
    he set his end in the Lord, he implied his desire to enjoy Him": as if we
    were to say that he expressed his enjoyment of his brother not as a term but
    as a means.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fruit bears one relation to the tree
    that bore it, and another to man that enjoys it. To the tree indeed that
    bore it, it is compared as effect to cause; to the one enjoying it, as the
    final object of his longing and the consummation of his delight. Accordingly
    these fruits mentioned by the Apostle are so called because they are certain
    effects of the Holy Ghost in us, wherefore they are called "fruits of the
    spirit": but not as though we are to enjoy them as our last end. Or we may
    say with Ambrose that they are called fruits because "we should desire them
    for their own sake": not indeed as though they were not ordained to the last
    end; but because they are such that we ought to find pleasure in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>;
    <a href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), we speak of an end in a
    twofold sense: first, as being the thing itself; secondly, as the attainment
    thereof. These are not, of course, two ends, but one end, considered in
    itself, and in its relation to something else. Accordingly God is the last
    end, as that which is ultimately sought for: while the enjoyment is as the
    attainment of this last end. And so, just as God is not one end, and the
    enjoyment of God, another: so it is the same enjoyment whereby we enjoy God,
    and whereby we enjoy our enjoyment of God. And the same applies to created
    happiness which consists in enjoyment.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether enjoyment is only of the end possessed?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that enjoyment is only of the end
    possessed. For Augustine says (De Trin. x, 1) that "to enjoy is to use
    joyfully, with the joy, not of hope, but of possession." But so long as a
    thing is not had, there is joy, not of possession, but of hope. Therefore
    enjoyment is only of the end possessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="FS011.html#FSQ11A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), enjoyment is not properly otherwise than of the last end: because this
    alone gives rest to the appetite. But the appetite has no rest save in the
    possession of the end. Therefore enjoyment, properly speaking, is only of
    the end possessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to enjoy is to lay hold of the fruit.
    But one does not lay hold of the fruit until one is in possession of the
    end. Therefore enjoyment is only of the end possessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "to enjoy is to adhere lovingly to something
    for its own sake," as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 4). But this is
    possible, even in regard to a thing which is not in our possession.
    Therefore it is possible to enjoy the end even though it be not
    possessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To enjoy implies a certain relation of the will
    to the last end, according as the will has something by way of last end. Now
    an end is possessed in two ways; perfectly and imperfectly. Perfectly, when
    it is possessed not only in intention but also in reality; imperfectly, when
    it is possessed in intention only. Perfect enjoyment, therefore, is of the
    end already possessed: but imperfect enjoyment is also of the end possessed
    not really, but only in intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine speaks there of perfect
    enjoyment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will is hindered in two ways from
    being at rest. First on the part of the object; by reason of its not being
    the last end, but ordained to something else: secondly on the part of the
    one who desires the end, by reason of his not being yet in possession of it.
    Now it is the object that specifies an act: but on the agent depends the
    manner of acting, so that the act be perfect or imperfect, as compared with
    the actual circumstances of the agent. Therefore enjoyment of anything but
    the last end is not enjoyment properly speaking, as falling short of the
    nature of enjoyment. But enjoyment of the last end, not yet possessed, is
    enjoyment properly speaking, but imperfect, on account of the imperfect way
    in which it is possessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One is said to lay hold of or to have an
    end, not only in reality, but also in intention, as stated above.<br />
