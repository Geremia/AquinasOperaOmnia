<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider enjoyment: concerning which there are four points 
of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether to enjoy is an act of the appetitive power?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS011.html#FSQ11A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it belongs to the rational creature alone, or also to 
irrational animals?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to enjoy belongs not only to the appetitive 
power. For to enjoy seems nothing else than to receive the fruit. But it 
is the intellect, in whose act Happiness consists, as shown above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), that receives the fruit of human life, which is Happiness. 
Therefore to enjoy is not an act of the appetitive power, but of the 
intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, each power has its proper end, which is its perfection: 
thus the end of sight is to know the visible; of the  hearing, to 
perceive sounds; and so forth. But the end of a thing is its fruit. 
Therefore to enjoy belongs to each power, and not only to the appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, enjoyment implies a certain delight. But sensible 
delight belongs to sense, which delights in its object: and for the same 
reason, intellectual delight belongs to the intellect. Therefore 
enjoyment belongs to the apprehensive, and not to the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 4; and De Trin. x, 
10,11): "To enjoy is to adhere lovingly to something for its own sake." 
But love belongs to the appetitive power. Therefore also to enjoy is an 
act of the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> "Fruitio" [enjoyment] and "fructus" [fruit] seem to refer 
to the same, one being derived from the other; which from which, matters 
not for our purpose; though it seems probable that the one which is more 
clearly known, was first named. Now those things are most manifest to us 
which appeal most to the senses: wherefore it seems that the word 
"fruition" is derived from sensible fruits. But sensible fruit is that 
which we expect the tree to produce in the last place, and in which a 
certain sweetness is to be perceived. Hence fruition seems to have 
relation to love, or to the delight which one has in realizing the 
longed-for term, which is the end. Now the end and the good is the object 
of the appetitive power. Wherefore it is evident that fruition is the act 
of the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing hinders one and the same thing from belonging, 
under different aspects, to different powers. Accordingly the vision of 
God, as vision, is an act of the intellect, but as a good and an end, is 
the object of the will. And as such is the fruition thereof: so that the 
intellect attains this end, as the executive power, but the will as the 
motive power, moving (the powers) towards the end and enjoying the end 
attained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The perfection and end of every other power is contained in 
the object of the appetitive power, as the proper is contained in the 
common, as stated above (<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence the perfection and end of 
each power, in so far as it is a good, belongs to the appetitive power. 
Wherefore the appetitive power moves the other powers to their ends; and 
itself realizes the end, when each of them reaches the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In delight there are two things: perception of what is 
becoming; and this belongs to the apprehensive power; and complacency in 
that which is offered as becoming: and this belongs to the appetitive 
power, in which power delight is formally completed.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether to enjoy belongs to the rational creature alone, or also to irrational animals? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to enjoy belongs to men alone. For Augustine 
says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22) that "it is given to us men to enjoy and 
to use." Therefore other animals cannot enjoy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to enjoy relates to the last end. But irrational animals 
cannot obtain the last end. Therefore it is not for them to enjoy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the sensitive appetite is beneath the 
intellectual appetite, so is the natural appetite beneath the sensitive. 
If, therefore, to enjoy belongs to the sensitive appetite, it seems that 
for the same reason it can belong to the natural appetite. But this is 
evidently false, since the latter cannot delight in anything. Therefore 
the sensitive appetite cannot enjoy: and accordingly enjoyment is not 
possible for irrational animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 30): "It is not so absurd 
to suppose that even beasts enjoy their food and any bodily pleasure."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was stated above (<A Href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) to enjoy is not the act of the 
power that achieves the end as executor, but of the power that commands 
the achievement; for it has been said to belong to the appetitive power. 
Now things void of reason have indeed a power of achieving an end by way 
of execution, as that by which a heavy body has a downward tendency, 
whereas a light body has an upward tendency. Yet the power of command in 
respect of the end is not in them, but in some higher nature, which moves 
all nature by its command, just as in things endowed with knowledge, the 
appetite moves the other powers to their acts. Wherefore it is clear that 
things void of knowledge, although they attain an end, have no enjoyment 
of the end: this is only for those that are endowed with knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now knowledge of the end is twofold: perfect and imperfect. Perfect 
knowledge of the end, is that whereby not only is that known which is the 
end and the good, but also the universal formality of the end and the 
good; and such knowledge belongs to the rational nature alone. On the 
other hand, imperfect knowledge is that by which the end and the good are 
known in the particular. Such knowledge is in irrational animals: whose 
appetitive powers do not command with freedom, but are moved according to 
a natural instinct to whatever they apprehend. Consequently, enjoyment 
belongs to the rational nature, in a perfect degree; to irrational 
animals, imperfectly; to other creatures, not at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of perfect enjoyment.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Enjoyment need not be of the last end simply; but of that 
which each one chooses for his last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sensitive appetite follows some knowledge;  not so the 
natural appetite, especially in things void of knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of imperfect enjoyment. This is 
clear from his way of speaking: for he says that "it is not so absurd to 
suppose that even beasts enjoy," that is, as it would be, if one were to 
say that they "use."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that enjoyment is not only of the last end. For the 
Apostle says (Philem. 20): "Yea, brother, may I enjoy thee in the Lord." 
But it is evident that Paul had not placed his last end in a man. 
Therefore to enjoy is not only of the last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what we enjoy is the fruit. But the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A22">Gal. 5:22</a>): "The fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, peace," and other like 
things, which are not in the nature of the last end. Therefore enjoyment 
is not only of the last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the acts of the will reflect on one another; for I will 
to will, and I love to love. But to enjoy is an act of the will: since 
"it is the will with which we enjoy," as Augustine says (De Trin. x, 10). 
Therefore a man enjoys his enjoyment. But the last end of man is not 
enjoyment, but the uncreated good alone, which is God. Therefore 
enjoyment is not only of the last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. x, 11): "A man does not enjoy 
that which he desires for the sake of something else." But the last end 
alone is that which man does not desire for the sake of something else. 
Therefore enjoyment is of the last end alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the notion of fruit implies two 
things: first that it should come last; second, that it should calm the 
appetite with a certain sweetness and delight. Now a thing is last either 
simply or relatively; simply, if it be referred to nothing else; 
relatively, if it is the last in a particular series. Therefore that 
which is last simply, and in which one delights as in the last end, is 
properly called fruit; and this it is that one is properly said to enjoy. 
But that which is delightful not in itself, but is desired, only as 
referred to something else, e.g. a bitter potion for the sake of health, 
can nowise be called fruit. And that which has something delightful about 
it, to which a number of preceding things are referred, may indeed by 
called fruit in a certain manner; but we cannot be said to enjoy it 
properly or as though it answered perfectly to the notion of fruit. Hence 
Augustine says (De Trin. x, 10) that "we enjoy what we know, when the 
delighted will is at rest therein." But its rest is not absolute save in 
the possession of the last end: for as long as something is looked for, 
the movement of the will remains in suspense, although it has reached 
something. Thus in local movement, although any point between the two 
terms is a  beginning and an end, yet it is not considered as an actual 
end, except when the movement stops there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 33), "if he had 
said, 'May I enjoy thee,' without adding 'in the Lord,' he would seem to 
have set the end of his love in him. But since he added that he set his 
end in the Lord, he implied his desire to enjoy Him": as if we were to 
say that he expressed his enjoyment of his brother not as a term but as a 
means.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fruit bears one relation to the tree that bore it, and 
another to man that enjoys it. To the tree indeed that bore it, it is 
compared as effect to cause; to the one enjoying it, as the final object 
of his longing and the consummation of his delight. Accordingly these 
fruits mentioned by the Apostle are so called because they are certain 
effects of the Holy Ghost in us, wherefore they are called "fruits of the 
spirit": but not as though we are to enjoy them as our last end. Or we 
may say with Ambrose that they are called fruits because "we should 
desire them for their own sake": not indeed as though they were not 
ordained to the last end; but because they are such that we ought to find 
pleasure in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), we speak of an 
end in a twofold sense: first, as being the thing itself; secondly, as 
the attainment thereof. These are not, of course, two ends, but one end, 
considered in itself, and in its relation to something else. Accordingly 
God is the last end, as that which is ultimately sought for: while the 
enjoyment is as the attainment of this last end. And so, just as God is 
not one end, and the enjoyment of God, another: so it is the same 
enjoyment whereby we enjoy God, and whereby we enjoy our enjoyment of 
God. And the same applies to created happiness which consists in 
enjoyment.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that enjoyment is only of the end possessed. For 
Augustine says (De Trin. x, 1) that "to enjoy is to use joyfully, with 
the joy, not of hope, but of possession." But so long as a thing is not 
had, there is joy, not of possession, but of hope. Therefore enjoyment is 
only of the end possessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="FS011.html#FSQ11A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), enjoyment is not properly 
otherwise than of the last end: because this alone gives rest to the 
appetite. But the appetite has no rest save in the possession of the end. 
Therefore enjoyment, properly speaking, is only of the end possessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to enjoy is to lay hold of the fruit. But one does not 
lay hold of the fruit until one is in possession of the end. Therefore 
enjoyment is only of the end possessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> "to enjoy is to adhere lovingly to something  for its 
own sake," as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 4). But this is 
possible, even in regard to a thing which is not in our possession. 
Therefore it is possible to enjoy the end even though it be not possessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To enjoy implies a certain relation of the will to the 
last end, according as the will has something by way of last end. Now an 
end is possessed in two ways; perfectly and imperfectly. Perfectly, when 
it is possessed not only in intention but also in reality; imperfectly, 
when it is possessed in intention only. Perfect enjoyment, therefore, is 
of the end already possessed: but imperfect enjoyment is also of the end 
possessed not really, but only in intention.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine speaks there of perfect enjoyment.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will is hindered in two ways from being at rest. First 
on the part of the object; by reason of its not being the last end, but 
ordained to something else: secondly on the part of the one who desires 
the end, by reason of his not being yet in possession of it. Now it is 
the object that specifies an act: but on the agent depends the manner of 
acting, so that the act be perfect or imperfect, as compared with the 
actual circumstances of the agent. Therefore enjoyment of anything but 
the last end is not enjoyment properly speaking, as falling short of the 
nature of enjoyment. But enjoyment of the last end, not yet possessed, is 
enjoyment properly speaking, but imperfect, on account of the imperfect 
way in which it is possessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One is said to lay hold of or to have an end, not only in 
reality, but also in intention, as stated above.<br>
