  <h3 align="center">OF THE PRECEPTS OF THE OLD LAW (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the precepts of the Old Law; and (1) how they are
    distinguished from one another; (2) each kind of precept. Under the first
    head there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the Old Law contains
    several precepts or only one?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the Old Law contains any
    moral precepts?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it contains ceremonial
    precepts in addition to the moral precepts?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether besides these it contains
    judicial precepts?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it contains any others
    besides these?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A6THEP1">(6)</a> How the Old Law induced men to
    keep its precepts.

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the Old Law contains only one precept?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law contains but one
    precept. Because a law is nothing else than a precept, as stated above (<a
      href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1"
      >Question [90]</a
    >, <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). Now there is but
    one Old Law. Therefore it contains but one precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A9"
      >Rm. 13:9</a
    >): "If there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: Thou
    shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." But this is only one commandment.
    Therefore the Old Law contained but one commandment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++7%3A12"
      >Mt. 7:12</a
    >): "All things... whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you
    also to them. For this is the Law and the prophets." But the whole of the
    Old Law is comprised in the Law and the prophets. Therefore the whole of the
    Old Law contains but one commandment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++2%3A15"
      >Eph. 2:15</a
    >): "Making void the Law of commandments contained in decrees": where he is
    referring to the Old Law, as the gloss comments, on the passage. Therefore
    the Old Law comprises many commandments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since a precept of law is binding, it is about
    something which must be done: and, that a thing must be done, arises from
    the necessity of some end. Hence it is evident that a precept implies, in
    its very idea, relation to an end, in so far as a thing is commanded as
    being necessary or expedient to an end. Now many things may happen to be
    necessary or expedient to an end; and, accordingly, precepts may be given
    about various things as being ordained to one end. Consequently we must say
    that all the precepts of the Old Law are one in respect of their relation to
    one end: and yet they are many in respect of the diversity of those things
    that are ordained to that end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Old Law is said to be one as being
    ordained to one end: yet it comprises various precepts, according to the
    diversity of the things which it directs to the end. Thus also the art of
    building is one according to the unity of its end, because it aims at the
    building of a house: and yet it contains various rules, according to the
    variety of acts ordained thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A5"
      >1 Tim. 1:5</a
    >), "the end of the commandment is charity"; since every law aims at
    establishing friendship, either between man and man, or between man and God.
    Wherefore the whole Law is comprised in this one commandment, "Thou shalt
    love thy neighbor as thyself," as expressing the end of all commandments:
    because love of one's neighbor includes love of God, when we love our
    neighbor for God's sake. Hence the Apostle put this commandment in place of
    the two which are about the love of God and of one's neighbor, and of which
    Our Lord said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A40"
      >Mt. 22:40</a
    >): "On these two commandments dependeth the whole Law and the prophets."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated in Ethic. ix, 8, "friendship
    towards another arises from friendship towards oneself," in so far as man
    looks on another as on himself. Hence when it is said, "All things
    whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them," this
    is an explanation of the rule of neighborly love contained implicitly in the
    words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself": so that it is an
    explanation of this commandment.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the Old Law contains moral precepts?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law contains no moral
    precepts. For the Old Law is distinct from the law of nature, as stated
    above (<a href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1">Question [91]</a>,
    <a href="FS091.html#FSQ91ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5;
    <a href="FS098.html#FSQ98OUTP1">Question [98]</a>,
    <a href="FS098.html#FSQ98A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But the moral precepts
    belong to the law of nature. Therefore they do not belong to the Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Divine Law should have come to man's
    assistance where human reason fails him: as is evident in regard to things
    that are of faith, which are above reason. But man's reason seems to suffice
    for the moral precepts. Therefore the moral precepts do not belong to the
    Old Law, which is a Divine law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Old Law is said to be "the letter
    that killeth" (2 Cor. 3:6). But the moral precepts do not kill, but quicken,
    according to Ps. 118:93: "Thy justifications I will never forget, for by
    them Thou hast given me life." Therefore the moral precepts do not belong to
    the Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 17:9): "Moreover, He
    gave them discipline [Douay: 'instructions'] and the law of life for an
    inheritance." Now discipline belongs to morals; for this gloss on Heb.
    12:11: "Now all chastisement [disciplina]," etc., says: "Discipline is an
    exercise in morals by means of difficulties." Therefore the Law which was
    given by God comprised moral precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Old Law contained some moral precepts; as
    is evident from Ex. 20:13,15: "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal."
    This was reasonable: because, just as the principal intention of human law
    is to created friendship between man and man; so the chief intention of the
    Divine law is to establish man in friendship with God. Now since likeness is
    the reason of love, according to Ecclus. 13:19: "Every beast loveth its
    like"; there cannot possibly be any friendship of man to God, Who is
    supremely good, unless man become good: wherefore it is written (Lev. 19:2;
    11:45): "You shall be holy, for I am holy." But the goodness of man is
    virtue, which "makes its possessor good" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore it was
    necessary for the Old Law to include precepts about acts of virtue: and
    these are the moral precepts of the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Old Law is distinct from the natural
    law, not as being altogether different from it, but as something added
    thereto. For just as grace presupposes nature, so must the Divine law
    presuppose the natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was fitting that the Divine law
    should come to man's assistance not only in those things for which reason is
    insufficient, but also in those things in which human reason may happen to
    be impeded. Now human reason could not go astray in the abstract, as to the
    universal principles of the natural law; but through being habituated to
    sin, it became obscured in the point of things to be done in detail. But
    with regard to the other moral precepts, which are like conclusions drawn
    from the universal principles of the natural law, the reason of many men
    went astray, to the extend of judging to be lawful, things that are evil in
    themselves. Hence there was need for the authority of the Divine law to
    rescue man from both these defects. Thus among the articles of faith not
    only are those things set forth to which reason cannot reach, such as the
    Trinity of the Godhead; but also those to which right reason can attain,
    such as the Unity of the Godhead; in order to remove the manifold errors to
    which reason is liable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine proves (De Spiritu et
    Litera xiv), even the letter of the law is said to be the occasion of death,
    as to the moral precepts; in so far as, to wit, it prescribes what is good,
    without furnishing the aid of grace for its fulfilment.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the Old Law comprises ceremonial, besides moral, precepts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law does not comprise
    ceremonial, besides moral, precepts. For every law that is given to man is
    for the purpose of directing human actions. Now human actions are called
    moral, as stated above (<a href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore it seems that
    the Old Law given to men should not comprise other than moral precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those precepts that are styled
    ceremonial seem to refer to the Divine worship. But Divine worship is the
    act of a virtue, viz. religion, which, as Tully says (De Invent. ii) "offers
    worship and ceremony to the Godhead." Since, then, the moral precepts are
    about acts of virtue, as stated above (<a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), it seems that the ceremonial precepts should not be distinct from the
    moral.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the ceremonial precepts seem to be those
    which signify something figuratively. But, as Augustine observes (De Doctr.
    Christ. ii, 3,4), "of all signs employed by men words hold the first place."
    Therefore there is no need for the Law to contain ceremonial precepts about
    certain figurative actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A13,14"
      >Dt. 4:13,14</a
    >): "Ten words... He wrote in two tables of stone; and He commanded me at
    that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you
    shall do." But the ten commandments of the Law are moral precepts. Therefore
    besides the moral precepts there are others which are ceremonial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS099.html#FSQ99A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), the Divine law is instituted chiefly in order to direct men to God;
    while human law is instituted chiefly in order to direct men in relation to
    one another. Hence human laws have not concerned themselves with the
    institution of anything relating to Divine worship except as affecting the
    common good of mankind: and for this reason they have devised many
    institutions relating to Divine matters, according as it seemed expedient
    for the formation of human morals; as may be seen in the rites of the
    Gentiles. On the other hand the Divine law directed men to one another
    according to the demands of that order whereby man is directed to God, which
    order was the chief aim of that law. Now man is directed to God not only by
    the interior acts of the mind, which are faith, hope, and love, but also by
    certain external works, whereby man makes profession of his subjection to
    God: and it is these works that are said to belong to the Divine worship.
    This worship is called "ceremony" [the munia, i.e. gifts] of Ceres (who was
    the goddess of fruits), as some say: because, at first, offerings were made
    to God from the fruits: or because, as Valerius Maximus states [*Fact. et
    Dict. Memor. i, 1], the word "ceremony" was introduced among the Latins, to
    signify the Divine worship, being derived from a town near Rome called
    "Caere": since, when Rome was taken by the Gauls, the sacred chattels of the
    Romans were taken thither and most carefully preserved. Accordingly those
    precepts of the Law which refer to the Divine worship are specially called
    ceremonial.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Human acts extend also to the Divine
    worship: and therefore the Old Law given to man contains precepts about
    these matters also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1"
      >Question [91]</a
    >, <a href="FS091.html#FSQ91A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the precepts of the
    natural law are general, and require to be determined: and they are
    determined both by human law and by Divine law. And just as these very
    determinations which are made by human law are said to be, not of natural,
    but of positive law; so the determinations of the precepts of the natural
    law, effected by the Divine law, are distinct from the moral precepts which
    belong to the natural law. Wherefore to worship God, since it is an act of
    virtue, belongs to a moral precept; but the determination of this precept,
    namely that He is to be worshipped by such and such sacrifices, and such and
    such offerings, belongs to the ceremonial precepts. Consequently the
    ceremonial precepts are distinct from the moral precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i), the
    things of God cannot be manifested to men except by means of sensible
    similitudes. Now these similitudes move the soul more when they are not only
    expressed in words, but also offered to the senses. Wherefore the things of
    God are set forth in the Scriptures not only by similitudes expressed in
    words, as in the case of metaphorical expressions; but also by similitudes
    of things set before the eyes, which pertains to the ceremonial precepts.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether, besides the moral and ceremonial precepts, there are also judicial
    precepts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are no judicial precepts
    in addition to the moral and ceremonial precepts in the Old Law. For
    Augustine says (Contra Faust. vi, 2) that in the Old Law there are "precepts
    concerning the life we have to lead, and precepts regarding the life that is
    foreshadowed." Now the precepts of the life we have to lead are moral
    precepts; and the precepts of the life that is foreshadowed are ceremonial.
    Therefore besides these two kinds of precepts we should not put any judicial
    precepts in the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Ps. 118:102, "I have not
    declined from Thy judgments," says, i.e. "from the rule of life Thou hast
    set for me." But a rule of life belongs to the moral precepts. Therefore the
    judicial precepts should not be considered as distinct from the moral
    precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, judgment seems to be an act of justice,
    according to Ps. 93:15: "Until justice be turned into judgment." But acts of
    justice, like the acts of other virtues, belong to the moral precepts.
    Therefore the moral precepts include the judicial precepts, and consequently
    should not be held as distinct from them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A1"
      >Dt. 6:1</a
    >): "These are the precepts and ceremonies, and judgments": where "precepts"
    stands for "moral precepts" antonomastically. Therefore there are judicial
    precepts besides moral and ceremonial precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS099.html#FSQ99ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,3), it belongs to the Divine law to direct men to one another and to God.
    Now each of these belongs in the abstract to the dictates of the natural
    law, to which dictates the moral precepts are to be referred: yet each of
    them has to be determined by Divine or human law, because naturally known
    principles are universal, both in speculative and in practical matters.
    Accordingly just as the determination of the universal principle about
    Divine worship is effected by the ceremonial precepts, so the determination
    of the general precepts of that justice which is to be observed among men is
    effected by the judicial precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore distinguish three kinds of precept in the Old Law; viz.
    "moral" precepts, which are dictated by the natural law; "ceremonial"
    precepts, which are determinations of the Divine worship; and "judicial"
    precepts, which are determinations of the justice to be maintained among
    men. Wherefore the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A12"
      >Rm. 7:12</a
    >) after saying that the "Law is holy," adds that "the commandment is just,
    and holy, and good": "just," in respect of the judicial precepts; "holy,"
    with regard to the ceremonial precepts (since the word
    "sanctus"---"holy"---is applied to that which is consecrated to God); and
    "good," i.e. conducive to virtue, as to the moral precepts.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Both the moral and the judicial precepts
    aim at the ordering of human life: and consequently they are both comprised
    under one of the heads mentioned by Augustine, viz. under the precepts of
    the life we have to lead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Judgment denotes execution of justice,
    by an application of the reason to individual cases in a determinate way.
    Hence the judicial precepts have something in common with the moral
    precepts, in that they are derived from reason; and something in common with
    the ceremonial precepts, in that they are determinations of general
    precepts. This explains why sometimes "judgments" comprise both judicial and
    moral precepts, as in Dt. 5:1: "Hear, O Israel, the ceremonies and
    judgments"; and sometimes judicial and ceremonial precepts, as in Lev. 18:4:
    "You shall do My judgments, and shall observe My precepts," where "precepts"
    denotes moral precepts, while "judgments" refers to judicial and ceremonial
    precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The act of justice, in general, belongs
    to the moral precepts; but its determination to some special kind of act
    belongs to the judicial precepts.<br />

    Whether the Old Law contains any others besides the moral, judicial, and
    ceremonial precepts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law contains others
    besides the moral, judicial, and ceremonial precepts. Because the judicial
    precepts belong to the act of justice, which is between man and man; while
    the ceremonial precepts belong to the act of religion, whereby God is
    worshipped. Now besides these there are many other virtues, viz. temperance,
    fortitude, liberality, and several others, as stated above (<a
      href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore besides the
    aforesaid precepts, the Old Law should comprise others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++11%3A1"
      >Dt. 11:1</a
    >): "Love the Lord thy God, and observe His precepts and ceremonies, His
    judgments and commandments." Now precepts concern moral matters, as stated
    above (<a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore besides
    the moral, judicial and ceremonial precepts, the Law contains others which
    are called "commandments." [*The "commandments" (mandata) spoken of here and
    in the body of this article are not to be confused with the Commandments
    (praecepta) in the ordinary acceptance of the word.]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A17"
      >Dt. 6:17</a
    >): "Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the testimonies and
    ceremonies which I have [Vulg.: 'He hath'] commanded thee." Therefore in
    addition to the above, the Law comprises "testimonies."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++118%3A93"
      >Ps. 118:93</a
    >): "Thy justifications (i.e. "Thy Law," according to a gloss) I will never
    forget." Therefore in the Old Law there are not only moral, ceremonial and
    judicial precepts, but also others, called "justifications."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A1"
      >Dt. 6:1</a
    >): "These are the precepts and ceremonies and judgments which the Lord your
    God commanded... you." And these words are placed at the beginning of the
    Law. Therefore all the precepts of the Law are included under them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some things are included in the Law by way of
    precept; other things, as being ordained to the fulfilment of the precepts.
    Now the precepts refer to things which have to be done: and to their
    fulfilment man is induced by two considerations, viz. the authority of the
    lawgiver, and the benefit derived from the fulfilment, which benefit
    consists in the attainment of some good, useful, pleasurable or virtuous, or
    in the avoidance of some contrary evil. Hence it was necessary that in the
    Old Law certain things should be set forth to indicate the authority of God
    the lawgiver: e.g. Dt. 6:4: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord";
    and Gn. 1:1: "In the beginning God created heaven and earth": and these are
    called "testimonies." Again it was necessary that in the Law certain rewards
    should be appointed for those who observe the Law, and punishments for those
    who transgress; as it may be seen in Dt. 28: "If thou wilt hear the voice of
    the Lord thy God... He will make thee higher than all the nations," etc.:
    and these are called "justifications," according as God punishes or rewards
    certain ones justly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The things that have to be done do not come under the precept except in so
    far as they have the character of a duty. Now a duty is twofold: one
    according to the rule of reason; the other according to the rule of a law
    which prescribes that duty: thus the Philosopher distinguishes a twofold
    just---moral and legal (Ethic. v, 7).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Moral duty is twofold: because reason dictates that something must be done,
    either as being so necessary that without it the order of virtue would be
    destroyed; or as being useful for the better maintaining of the order of
    virtue. And in this sense some of the moral precepts are expressed by way of
    absolute command or prohibition, as "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not
    steal": and these are properly called "precepts." Other things are
    prescribed or forbidden, not as an absolute duty, but as something better to
    be done. These may be called "commandments"; because they are expressed by
    way of inducement and persuasion: an example whereof is seen in Ex. 22:26:
    "If thou take of thy neighbor a garment in pledge, thou shalt give it him
    again before sunset"; and in other like cases. Wherefore Jerome (Praefat. in
    Comment. super Marc.) says that "justice is in the precepts, charity in the
    commandments." Duty as fixed by the Law, belongs to the judicial precepts,
    as regards human affairs; to the "ceremonial" precepts, as regards Divine
    matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless those ordinances also which refer to punishments and rewards
    may be called "testimonies," in so far as they testify to the Divine
    justice. Again all the precepts of the Law may be styled "justifications,"
    as being executions of legal justice. Furthermore the commandments may be
    distinguished from the precepts, so that those things be called "precepts"
    which God Himself prescribed; and those things "commandments" which He
    enjoined [mandavit] through others, as the very word seems to denote.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    From this it is clear that all the precepts of the Law are either moral,
    ceremonial, or judicial; and that other ordinances have not the character of
    a precept, but are directed to the observance of the precepts, as stated
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Justice alone, of all the virtues,
    implies the notion of duty. Consequently moral matters are determinable by
    law in so far as they belong to justice: of which virtue religion is a part,
    as Tully says (De Invent. ii). Wherefore the legal just cannot be anything
    foreign to the ceremonial and judicial precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Replies to the other Objections are clear from what has been said.</p>

    Whether the Old Law should have induced men to the observance of its
    precepts, by means of temporal promises and threats?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law should not have
    induced men to the observance of its precepts, by means of temporal promises
    and threats. For the purpose of the Divine law is to subject man to God by
    fear and love: hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++10%3A12"
      >Dt. 10:12</a
    >): "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that
    thou fear the Lord thy God, and walk in His ways, and love Him?" But the
    desire for temporal goods leads man away from God: for Augustine says (Qq.
    lxxxiii, qu. 36), that "covetousness is the bane of charity." Therefore
    temporal promises and threats seem to be contrary to the intention of a
    lawgiver: and this makes a law worthy of rejection, as the Philosopher
    declares (Polit. ii, 6).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Divine law is more excellent than
    human law. Now, in sciences, we notice that the loftier the science, the
    higher the means of persuasion that it employs. Therefore, since human law
    employs temporal threats and promises, as means of persuading man, the
    Divine law should have used, not these, but more lofty means.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the reward of righteousness and the
    punishment of guilt cannot be that which befalls equally the good and the
    wicked. But as stated in Eccles. 9:2, "all" temporal "things equally happen
    to the just and to the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and to
    the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him that despiseth
    sacrifices." Therefore temporal goods or evils are not suitably set forth as
    punishments or rewards of the commandments of the Divine law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++1%3A19,20"
      >Is. 1:19,20</a
    >): "If you be willing, and will hearken to Me, you shall eat the good
    things of the land. But if you will not, and will provoke Me to wrath: the
    sword shall devour you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As in speculative sciences men are persuaded to
    assent to the conclusions by means of syllogistic arguments, so too in every
    law, men are persuaded to observe its precepts by means of punishments and
    rewards. Now it is to be observed that, in speculative sciences, the means
    of persuasion are adapted to the conditions of the pupil: wherefore the
    process of argument in sciences should be ordered becomingly, so that the
    instruction is based on principles more generally known. And thus also he
    who would persuade a man to the observance of any precepts, needs to move
    him at first by things for which he has an affection; just as children are
    induced to do something, by means of little childish gifts. Now it has been
    said above (<a href="FS098.html#FSQ98OUTP1">Question [98]</a>,
    <a href="FS098.html#FSQ98ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3) that the Old Law
    disposed men to (the coming of) Christ, as the imperfect in comparison
    disposes to the perfect, wherefore it was given to a people as yet imperfect
    in comparison to the perfection which was to result from Christ's coming:
    and for this reason, that people is compared to a child that is still under
    a pedagogue (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A24"
      >Gal. 3:24</a
    >). But the perfection of man consists in his despising temporal things and
    cleaving to things spiritual, as is clear from the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++3%3A13,15"
      >Phil. 3:13,15</a
    >): "Forgetting the things that are behind, I stretch [Vulg.: 'and
    stretching'] forth myself to those that are before... Let us therefore, as
    many as are perfect, be thus minded." Those who are yet imperfect desire
    temporal goods, albeit in subordination to God: whereas the perverse place
    their end in temporalities. It was therefore fitting that the Old Law should
    conduct men to God by means of temporal goods for which the imperfect have
    an affection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Covetousness whereby man places his end
    in temporalities, is the bane of charity. But the attainment of temporal
    goods which man desires in subordination to God is a road leading the
    imperfect to the love of God, according to Ps. 48:19: "He will praise Thee,
    when Thou shalt do well to him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Human law persuades men by means of
    temporal rewards or punishments to be inflicted by men: whereas the Divine
    law persuades men by meas of rewards or punishments to be received from God.
    In this respect it employs higher means.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As any one can see, who reads carefully
    the story of the Old Testament, the common weal of the people prospered
    under the Law as long as they obeyed it; and as soon as they departed from
    the precepts of the Law they were overtaken by many calamities. But certain
    individuals, although they observed the justice of the Law, met with
    misfortunes---either because they had already become spiritual (so that
    misfortune might withdraw them all the more from attachment to temporal
    things, and that their virtue might be tried)---or because, while outwardly
    fulfilling the works of the Law, their heart was altogether fixed on
    temporal goods, and far removed from God, according to Is. 29:13 (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A8"
      >Mt. 15:8</a
    >): "This people honoreth Me with their lips; but their hearts is far from
    Me."<br />
