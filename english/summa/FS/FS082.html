    OF ORIGINAL SIN, AS TO ITS ESSENCE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider original sin as to its essence, and under this head
    there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether original sin is a habit?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether there is but one original
    sin in each man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether original sin is
    concupiscence?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether original sin is equally in
    all?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether original sin is a habit?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that original sin is not a habit.
    For original sin is the absence of original justice, as Anselm states (De
    Concep. Virg. ii, iii, xxvi), so that original sin is a privation. But
    privation is opposed to habit. Therefore original sin is not a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, actual sin has the nature of fault more
    than original sin, in so far as it is more voluntary. Now the habit of
    actual sin has not the nature of a fault, else it would follow that a man
    while asleep, would be guilty of sin. Therefore no original habit has the
    nature of a fault.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in wickedness act always precedes habit,
    because evil habits are not infused, but acquired. Now original sin is not
    preceded by an act. Therefore original sin is not a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in his book on the Baptism of
    infants (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 39) that on account of original sin
    little children have the aptitude of concupiscence though they have not the
    act. Now aptitude denotes some kind of habit. Therefore original sin is a
    habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS049.html#FSQ49OUTP1"
      >Question [49]</a
    >, <a href="FS049.html#FSQ49A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="FS050.html#FSQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>,
    <a href="FS050.html#FSQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), habit is twofold. The
    first is a habit whereby power is inclined to an act: thus science and
    virtue are called habits. In this way original sin is not a habit. The
    second kind of habit is the disposition of a complex nature, whereby that
    nature is well or ill disposed to something, chiefly when such a disposition
    has become like a second nature, as in the case of sickness or health. In
    this sense original sin is a habit. For it is an inordinate disposition,
    arising from the destruction of the harmony which was essential to original
    justice, even as bodily sickness is an inordinate disposition of the body,
    by reason of the destruction of that equilibrium which is essential to
    health. Hence it is that original sin is called the "languor of nature"
    [*Cf. Augustine, In Ps. 118, serm. iii].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As bodily sickness is partly a
    privation, in so far as it denotes the destruction of the equilibrium of
    health, and partly something positive, viz. the very humors that are
    inordinately disposed, so too original sin denotes the privation of original
    justice, and besides this, the inordinate disposition of the parts of the
    soul. Consequently it is not a pure privation, but a corrupt habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Actual sin is an inordinateness of an
    act: whereas original sin, being the sin of nature, is an inordinate
    disposition of nature, and has the character of fault through being
    transmitted from our first parent, as stated above (<a
      href="FS081.html#FSQ81OUTP1"
      >Question [81]</a
    >, <a href="FS081.html#FSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now this inordinate
    disposition of nature is a kind of habit, whereas the inordinate disposition
    of an act is not: and for this reason original sin can be a habit, whereas
    actual sin cannot.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection considers the habit which
    inclines a power to an act: but original sin is not this kind of habit.
    Nevertheless a certain inclination to an inordinate act does follow from
    original sin, not directly, but indirectly, viz. by the removal of the
    obstacle, i.e. original justice, which hindered inordinate movements: just
    as an inclination to inordinate bodily movements results indirectly from
    bodily sickness. Nor is it necessary to says that original sin is a habit
    "infused," or a habit "acquired" (except by the act of our first parent, but
    not by our own act): but it is a habit "inborn" due to our corrupt
    origin.<br />

    Whether there are several original sins in one man?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are many original sins
    in one man. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++1%3A7"
      >Ps. 1:7</a
    >): "Behold I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother
    conceive me." But the sin in which a man is conceived is original sin.
    Therefore there are several original sins in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one and the same habit does not incline
    its subject to contraries: since the inclination of habit is like that of
    nature which tends to one thing. Now original sin, even in one man, inclines
    to various and contrary sins. Therefore original sin is not one habit; but
    several.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, original sin infects every part of the
    soul. Now the different parts of the soul are different subjects of sin, as
    shown above (<a href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>). Since then
    one sin cannot be in different subjects, it seems that original sin is not
    one but several.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A29"
      >Jn. 1:29</a
    >): "Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him Who taketh away the sin of the
    world": and the reason for the employment of the singular is that the "sin
    of the world" is original sin, as a gloss expounds this passage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In one man there is one original sin. Two
    reasons may be assigned for this. The first is on the part of the cause of
    original sin. For it has been stated (<a href="FS081.html#FSQ81OUTP1"
      >Question [81]</a
    >, <a href="FS081.html#FSQ81A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), that the first sin
    alone of our first parent was transmitted to his posterity. Wherefore in one
    man original sin is one in number; and in all men, it is one in proportion,
    i.e. in relation to its first principle. The second reason may be taken from
    the very essence of original sin. Because in every inordinate disposition,
    unity of species depends on the cause, while the unity of number is derived
    from the subject. For example, take bodily sickness: various species of
    sickness proceed from different causes, e.g. from excessive heat or cold, or
    from a lesion in the lung or liver; while one specific sickness in one man
    will be one in number. Now the cause of this corrupt disposition that is
    called original sin, is one only, viz. the privation of original justice,
    removing the subjection of man's mind to God. Consequently original sin is
    specifically one, and, in one man, can be only one in number; while, in
    different men, it is one in species and in proportion, but is numerically
    many.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The employment of the plural---"in
    sins"---may be explained by the custom of the Divine Scriptures in the
    frequent use of the plural for the singular, e.g. "They are dead that sought
    the life of the child"; or by the fact that all actual sins virtually
    pre-exist in original sin, as in a principle so that it is virtually many;
    or by the fact of there being many deformities in the sin of our first
    parent, viz. pride, disobedience, gluttony, and so forth; or by several
    parts of the soul being infected by original sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Of itself and directly, i.e. by its own
    form, one habit cannot incline its subject to contraries. But there is no
    reason why it should not do so, indirectly and accidentally, i.e. by the
    removal of an obstacle: thus, when the harmony of a mixed body is destroyed,
    the elements have contrary local tendencies. In like manner, when the
    harmony of original justice is destroyed, the various powers of the soul
    have various opposite tendencies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Original sin infects the different parts
    of the soul, in so far as they are the parts of one whole; even as original
    justice held all the soul's parts together in one. Consequently there is but
    one original sin: just as there is but one fever in one man, although the
    various parts of the body are affected.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether original sin is concupiscence?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that original sin is not
    concupiscence. For every sin is contrary to nature, according to Damascene
    (De Fide Orth. ii, 4,30). But concupiscence is in accordance with nature,
    since it is the proper act of the concupiscible faculty which is a natural
    power. Therefore concupiscence is not original sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, through original sin "the passions of
    sins" are in us, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A5"
      >Rm. 7:5</a
    >). Now there are several other passions besides concupiscence, as stated
    above (<a href="FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore original sin
    is not concupiscence any more than another passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by original sin, all the parts of the
    soul are disordered, as stated above (<a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, Objection [3]). But the intellect is the highest of the soul's parts, as
    the Philosopher states (Ethic. x, 7). Therefore original sin is ignorance
    rather than concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 15):
    "Concupiscence is the guilt of original sin."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Everything takes its species from its form: and
    it has been stated (<a href="FS082.html#FSQ82A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that
    the species of original sin is taken from its cause. Consequently the formal
    element of original sin must be considered in respect of the cause of
    original sin. But contraries have contrary causes. Therefore the cause of
    original sin must be considered with respect to the cause of original
    justice, which is opposed to it. Now the whole order of original justice
    consists in man's will being subject to God: which subjection, first and
    chiefly, was in the will, whose function it is to move all the other parts
    to the end, as stated above (<a href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), so that the will being
    turned away from God, all the other powers of the soul become inordinate.
    Accordingly the privation of original justice, whereby the will was made
    subject to God, is the formal element in original sin; while every other
    disorder of the soul's powers, is a kind of material element in respect of
    original sin. Now the inordinateness of the other powers of the soul
    consists chiefly in their turning inordinately to mutable good; which
    inordinateness may be called by the general name of concupiscence. Hence
    original sin is concupiscence, materially, but privation of original
    justice, formally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since, in man, the concupiscible power
    is naturally governed by reason, the act of concupiscence is so far natural
    to man, as it is in accord with the order of reason; while, in so far as it
    trespasses beyond the bounds of reason, it is, for a man, contrary to
    reason. Such is the concupiscence of original sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), all the irascible
    passions are reducible to concupiscible passions, as holding the principle
    place: and of these, concupiscence is the most impetuous in moving, and is
    felt most, as stated above (<a href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). Therefore
    original sin is ascribed to concupiscence, as being the chief passion, and
    as including all the others, in a fashion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As, in good things, the intellect and
    reason stand first, so conversely in evil things, the lower part of the soul
    is found to take precedence, for it clouds and draws the reason, as stated
    above (<a href="FS077.html#FSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>,
    <a href="FS077.html#FSQ77ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="FS080.html#FSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>,
    <a href="FS080.html#FSQ80A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence original sin is
    called concupiscence rather than ignorance, although ignorance is comprised
    among the material defects of original sin.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether original sin is equally in all?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that original sin is not equally in
    all. Because original sin is inordinate concupiscence, as stated above (<a
      href="FS082.html#FSQ82A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Now all are not equally prone to acts of concupiscence. Therefore
    original sin is not equally in all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, original sin is an inordinate
    disposition of the soul, just as sickness is an inordinate disposition of
    the body. But sickness is subject to degrees. Therefore original sin is
    subject to degrees.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Nup. et Concep. i,
    23) that "lust transmits original sin to the child." But the act of
    generation may be more lustful in one than in another. Therefore original
    sin may be greater in one than in another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Original sin is the sin of nature, as stated
    above (<a href="FS081.html#FSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>,
    <a href="FS081.html#FSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But nature is equally in
    all. Therefore original sin is too.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are two things in original sin: one is
    the privation of original justice; the other is the relation of this
    privation to the sin of our first parent, from whom it is transmitted to man
    through his corrupt origin. As to the first, original sin has no degrees,
    since the gift of original justice is taken away entirely; and privations
    that remove something entirely, such as death and darkness, cannot be more
    or less, as stated above (<a href="FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="FS073.html#FSQ73A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). In like manner, neither
    is this possible, as to the second: since all are related equally to the
    first principle of our corrupt origin, from which principle original sin
    takes the nature of guilt; for relations cannot be more or less.
    Consequently it is evident that original sin cannot be more in one than in
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Through the bond of original justice
    being broken, which held together all the powers of the soul in a certain
    order, each power of the soul tends to its own proper movement, and the more
    impetuously, as it is stronger. Now it happens that some of the soul's
    powers are stronger in one man than in another, on account of the different
    bodily temperaments. Consequently if one man is more prone than another to
    acts of concupiscence, this is not due to original sin, because the bond of
    original justice is equally broken in all, and the lower parts of the soul
    are, in all, left to themselves equally; but it is due to the various
    dispositions of the powers, as stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sickness of the body, even sickness of
    the same species, has not an equal cause in all; for instance if a fever be
    caused by corruption of the bile, the corruption may be greater or less, and
    nearer to, or further from a vital principle. But the cause of original sin
    is equal to all, so that there is not comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not the actual lust that transmits
    original sin: for, supposing God were to grant to a man to feel no
    inordinate lust in the act of generation, he would still transmit original
    sin; we must understand this to be habitual lust, whereby the sensitive
    appetite is not kept subject to reason by the bonds of original justice.
    This lust is equally in all.<br />
