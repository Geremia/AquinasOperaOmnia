  <h3 align="center">OF CHANGE IN LAWS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider change in laws: under which head there are four points
    of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS097.html#FSQ97A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether human law is changeable?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS097.html#FSQ97A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it should be always
    changed, whenever anything better occurs?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS097.html#FSQ97A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is abolished by custom,
    and whether custom obtains the force of law?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS097.html#FSQ97A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the application of human
    law should be changed by dispensation of those in authority?<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether human law should be changed in any way?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human law should not be
    changed in any way at all. Because human law is derived from the natural
    law, as stated above (<a href="FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>,
    <a href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the natural law
    endures unchangeably. Therefore human law should also remain without any
    change.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 5), a
    measure should be absolutely stable. But human law is the measure of human
    acts, as stated above (<a href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore it should
    remain without change.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is of the essence of law to be just
    and right, as stated above (<a href="FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a
    >, <a href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But that which is
    right once is right always. Therefore that which is law once, should be
    always law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6): "A
    temporal law, however just, may be justly changed in course of time."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1"
      >Question [91]</a
    >, <a href="FS091.html#FSQ91A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), human law is a
    dictate of reason, whereby human acts are directed. Thus there may be two
    causes for the just change of human law: one on the part of reason; the
    other on the part of man whose acts are regulated by law. The cause on the
    part of reason is that it seems natural to human reason to advance gradually
    from the imperfect to the perfect. Hence, in speculative sciences, we see
    that the teaching of the early philosophers was imperfect, and that it was
    afterwards perfected by those who succeeded them. So also in practical
    matters: for those who first endeavored to discover something useful for the
    human community, not being able by themselves to take everything into
    consideration, set up certain institutions which were deficient in many
    ways; and these were changed by subsequent lawgivers who made institutions
    that might prove less frequently deficient in respect of the common weal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the part of man, whose acts are regulated by law, the law can be rightly
    changed on account of the changed condition of man, to whom different things
    are expedient according to the difference of his condition. An example is
    proposed by Augustine (De Lib. Arb. i, 6): "If the people have a sense of
    moderation and responsibility, and are most careful guardians of the common
    weal, it is right to enact a law allowing such a people to choose their own
    magistrates for the government of the commonwealth. But if, as time goes on,
    the same people become so corrupt as to sell their votes, and entrust the
    government to scoundrels and criminals; then the right of appointing their
    public officials is rightly forfeit to such a people, and the choice
    devolves to a few good men."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural law is a participation of
    the eternal law, as stated above (<a href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1"
      >Question [91]</a
    >, <a href="FS091.html#FSQ91A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and therefore endures
    without change, owing to the unchangeableness and perfection of the Divine
    Reason, the Author of nature. But the reason of man is changeable and
    imperfect: wherefore his law is subject to change. Moreover the natural law
    contains certain universal precepts, which are everlasting: whereas human
    law contains certain particular precepts, according to various
    emergencies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A measure should be as enduring as
    possible. But nothing can be absolutely unchangeable in things that are
    subject to change. And therefore human law cannot be altogether
    unchangeable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In corporal things, right is predicated
    absolutely: and therefore, as far as itself is concerned, always remains
    right. But right is predicated of law with reference to the common weal, to
    which one and the same thing is not always adapted, as stated above:
    wherefore rectitude of this kind is subject to change.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether human law should always be changed, whenever something better
    occurs?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human law should be changed,
    whenever something better occurs. Because human laws are devised by human
    reason, like other arts. But in the other arts, the tenets of former times
    give place to others, if something better occurs. Therefore the same should
    apply to human laws.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by taking note of the past we can
    provide for the future. Now unless human laws had been changed when it was
    found possible to improve them, considerable inconvenience would have
    ensued; because the laws of old were crude in many points. Therefore it
    seems that laws should be changed, whenever anything better occurs to be
    enacted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human laws are enacted about single acts
    of man. But we cannot acquire perfect knowledge in singular matters, except
    by experience, which "requires time," as stated in Ethic. ii. Therefore it
    seems that as time goes on it is possible for something better to occur for
    legislation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in the Decretals (Dist. xii, 5):
    "It is absurd, and a detestable shame, that we should suffer those
    traditions to be changed which we have received from the fathers of old."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS097.html#FSQ97A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), human law is rightly changed, in so far as such change is conducive to
    the common weal. But, to a certain extent, the mere change of law is of
    itself prejudicial to the common good: because custom avails much for the
    observance of laws, seeing that what is done contrary to general custom,
    even in slight matters, is looked upon as grave. Consequently, when a law is
    changed, the binding power of the law is diminished, in so far as custom is
    abolished. Wherefore human law should never be changed, unless, in some way
    or other, the common weal be compensated according to the extent of the harm
    done in this respect. Such compensation may arise either from some very
    great and every evident benefit conferred by the new enactment; or from the
    extreme urgency of the case, due to the fact that either the existing law is
    clearly unjust, or its observance extremely harmful. Wherefore the jurist
    says [*Pandect. Justin. lib. i, ff., tit. 4, De Constit. Princip.] that "in
    establishing new laws, there should be evidence of the benefit to be
    derived, before departing from a law which has long been considered
    just."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Rules of art derive their force from
    reason alone: and therefore whenever something better occurs, the rule
    followed hitherto should be changed. But "laws derive very great force from
    custom," as the Philosopher states (Polit. ii, 5): consequently they should
    not be quickly changed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument proves that laws ought to
    be changed: not in view of any improvement, but for the sake of a great
    benefit or in a case of great urgency, as stated above. This answer applies
    also to the Third Objection.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether custom can obtain force of law?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that custom cannot obtain force of
    law, nor abolish a law. Because human law is derived from the natural law
    and from the Divine law, as stated above (<a href="FS093.html#FSQ93OUTP1"
      >Question [93]</a
    >, <a href="FS093.html#FSQ93A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>,
    <a href="FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But human custom cannot
    change either the law of nature or the Divine law. Therefore neither can it
    change human law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, many evils cannot make one good. But he
    who first acted against the law, did evil. Therefore by multiplying such
    acts, nothing good is the result. Now a law is something good; since it is a
    rule of human acts. Therefore law is not abolished by custom, so that the
    mere custom should obtain force of law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the framing of laws belongs to those
    public men whose business it is to govern the community; wherefore private
    individuals cannot make laws. But custom grows by the acts of private
    individuals. Therefore custom cannot obtain force of law, so as to abolish
    the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Ep. ad Casulan. xxxvi): "The
    customs of God's people and the institutions of our ancestors are to be
    considered as laws. And those who throw contempt on the customs of the
    Church ought to be punished as those who disobey the law of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All law proceeds from the reason and will of
    the lawgiver; the Divine and natural laws from the reasonable will of God;
    the human law from the will of man, regulated by reason. Now just as human
    reason and will, in practical matters, may be made manifest by speech, so
    may they be made known by deeds: since seemingly a man chooses as good that
    which he carries into execution. But it is evident that by human speech, law
    can be both changed and expounded, in so far as it manifests the interior
    movement and thought of human reason. Wherefore by actions also, especially
    if they be repeated, so as to make a custom, law can be changed and
    expounded; and also something can be established which obtains force of law,
    in so far as by repeated external actions, the inward movement of the will,
    and concepts of reason are most effectually declared; for when a thing is
    done again and again, it seems to proceed from a deliberate judgment of
    reason. Accordingly, custom has the force of a law, abolishes law, and is
    the interpreter of law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural and Divine laws proceed from
    the Divine will, as stated above. Wherefore they cannot be changed by a
    custom proceeding from the will of man, but only by Divine authority. Hence
    it is that no custom can prevail over the Divine or natural laws: for
    Isidore says (Synon. ii, 16): "Let custom yield to authority: evil customs
    should be eradicated by law and reason."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS096.html#FSQ96OUTP1"
      >Question [96]</a
    >, <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), human laws fail in
    some cases: wherefore it is possible sometimes to act beside the law;
    namely, in a case where the law fails; yet the act will not be evil. And
    when such cases are multiplied, by reason of some change in man, then custom
    shows that the law is no longer useful: just as it might be declared by the
    verbal promulgation of a law to the contrary. If, however, the same reason
    remains, for which the law was useful hitherto, then it is not the custom
    that prevails against the law, but the law that overcomes the custom: unless
    perhaps the sole reason for the law seeming useless, be that it is not
    "possible according to the custom of the country" [*Question [95], Article
    [3]], which has been stated to be one of the conditions of law. For it is
    not easy to set aside the custom of a whole people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The people among whom a custom is
    introduced may be of two conditions. For if they are free, and able to make
    their own laws, the consent of the whole people expressed by a custom counts
    far more in favor of a particular observance, that does the authority of the
    sovereign, who has not the power to frame laws, except as representing the
    people. Wherefore although each individual cannot make laws, yet the whole
    people can. If however the people have not the free power to make their own
    laws, or to abolish a law made by a higher authority; nevertheless with such
    a people a prevailing custom obtains force of law, in so far as it is
    tolerated by those to whom it belongs to make laws for that people: because
    by the very fact that they tolerate it they seem to approve of that which is
    introduced by custom.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the rulers of the people can dispense from human laws?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rulers of the people
    cannot dispense from human laws. For the law is established for the "common
    weal," as Isidore says (Etym. v, 21). But the common good should not be set
    aside for the private convenience of an individual: because, as the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 2), "the good of the nation is more godlike than
    the good of one man." Therefore it seems that a man should not be dispensed
    from acting in compliance with the general law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who are placed over others are
    commanded as follows (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A17"
      >Dt. 1:17</a
    >): "You shall hear the little as well as the great; neither shall you
    respect any man's person, because it is the judgment of God." But to allow
    one man to do that which is equally forbidden to all, seems to be respect of
    persons. Therefore the rulers of a community cannot grant such
    dispensations, since this is against a precept of the Divine law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human law, in order to be just, should
    accord with the natural and Divine laws: else it would not "foster
    religion," nor be "helpful to discipline," which is requisite to the nature
    of law, as laid down by Isidore (Etym. v, 3). But no man can dispense from
    the Divine and natural laws. Neither, therefore, can he dispense from the
    human law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++9%3A17"
      >1 Cor. 9:17</a
    >): "A dispensation is committed to me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Dispensation, properly speaking, denotes a
    measuring out to individuals of some common goods: thus the head of a
    household is called a dispenser, because to each member of the household he
    distributes work and necessaries of life in due weight and measure.
    Accordingly in every community a man is said to dispense, from the very fact
    that he directs how some general precept is to be fulfilled by each
    individual. Now it happens at times that a precept, which is conducive to
    the common weal as a general rule, is not good for a particular individual,
    or in some particular case, either because it would hinder some greater
    good, or because it would be the occasion of some evil, as explained above
    (<a href="FS096.html#FSQ96OUTP1">Question [96]</a>,
    <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But it would be
    dangerous to leave this to the discretion of each individual, except perhaps
    by reason of an evident and sudden emergency, as stated above (<a
      href="FS096.html#FSQ96OUTP1"
      >Question [96]</a
    >, <a href="FS096.html#FSQ96A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Consequently he who
    is placed over a community is empowered to dispense in a human law that
    rests upon his authority, so that, when the law fails in its application to
    persons or circumstances, he may allow the precept of the law not to be
    observed. If however he grant this permission without any such reason, and
    of his mere will, he will be an unfaithful or an imprudent dispenser:
    unfaithful, if he has not the common good in view; imprudent, if he ignores
    the reasons for granting dispensations. Hence Our Lord says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++12%3A42"
      >Lk. 12:42</a
    >): "Who, thinkest thou, is the faithful and wise dispenser [Douay:
    steward], whom his lord setteth over his family?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a person is dispensed from
    observing the general law, this should not be done to the prejudice of, but
    with the intention of benefiting, the common good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not respect of persons if unequal
    measures are served out to those who are themselves unequal. Wherefore when
    the condition of any person requires that he should reasonably receive
    special treatment, it is not respect of persons if he be the object of
    special favor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Natural law, so far as it contains
    general precepts, which never fail, does not allow of dispensations. In
    other precepts, however, which are as conclusions of the general precepts,
    man sometimes grants a dispensation: for instance, that a loan should not be
    paid back to the betrayer of his country, or something similar. But to the
    Divine law each man stands as a private person to the public law to which he
    is subject. Wherefore just as none can dispense from public human law,
    except the man from whom the law derives its authority, or his delegate; so,
    in the precepts of the Divine law, which are from God, none can dispense but
