    OF GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider good and evil in the passions of the soul: and under
    this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS024.html#FSQ24A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether moral good and evil can be
    found in the passions of the soul?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS024.html#FSQ24A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether every passion of the soul
    is morally evil?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS024.html#FSQ24A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether every passion increases or
    decreases the goodness of malice of an act?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS024.html#FSQ24A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether any passion is good or
    evil specifically?

    Whether moral good and evil can be found in the passions of the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no passion of the soul is
    morally good or evil. For moral good and evil are proper to man: since
    "morals are properly predicated of man," as Ambrose says (Super Luc.
    Prolog.). But passions are not proper to man, for he has them in common with
    other animals. Therefore no passion of the soul is morally good or evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the good or evil of man consists in
    "being in accord, or in disaccord with reason," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
    iv). Now the passions of the soul are not in the reason, but in the
    sensitive appetite, as stated above (<a href="FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1"
      >Question [22]</a
    >, <a href="FS022.html#FSQ22A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore they have
    no connection with human, i.e. moral, good or evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 5) that
    "we are neither praised nor blamed for our passions." But we are praised and
    blamed for moral good and evil. Therefore the passions are not morally good
    or evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) while
    speaking of the passions of the soul: "They are evil if our love is evil;
    good if our love is good."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider the passions of the soul in two
    ways: first, in themselves; secondly, as being subject to the command of the
    reason and will. If then the passions be considered in themselves, to wit,
    as movements of the irrational appetite, thus there is no moral good or evil
    in them, since this depends on the reason, as stated above (<a
      href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). If, however, they be
    considered as subject to the command of the reason and will, then moral good
    and evil are in them. Because the sensitive appetite is nearer than the
    outward members to the reason and will; and yet the movements and actions of
    the outward members are morally good or evil, inasmuch as they are
    voluntary. Much more, therefore, may the passions, in so far as they are
    voluntary, be called morally good or evil. And they are said to be
    voluntary, either from being commanded by the will, or from not being
    checked by the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These passions, considered in
    themselves, are common to man and other animals: but, as commanded by the
    reason, they are proper to man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even the lower appetitive powers are
    called rational, in so far as "they partake of reason in some sort" (Ethic.
    i, 13).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher says that we are neither
    praised nor blamed for our passions considered absolutely; but he does not
    exclude their becoming worthy of praise or blame, in so far as they are
    subordinate to reason. Hence he continues: "For the man who fears or is
    angry, is not praised... or blamed, but the man who is angry in a certain
    way, i.e. according to, or against reason."<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether every passion of the soul is evil morally?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the passions of the soul
    are morally evil. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "some call the
    soul's passions diseases or disturbances of the soul" [*Those things which
    the Greeks call {pathe}, we prefer to call disturbances rather than diseases
    (Tusc. iv. 5)]. But every disease or disturbance of the soul is morally
    evil. Therefore every passion of the soul is evil morally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22)
    that "movement in accord with nature is an action, but movement contrary to
    nature is passion." But in movements of the soul, what is against nature is
    sinful and morally evil: hence he says elsewhere (De Fide Orth. ii, 4) that
    "the devil turned from that which is in accord with nature to that which is
    against nature." Therefore these passions are morally evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever leads to sin, has an aspect of
    evil. But these passions lead to sin: wherefore they are called "the
    passions of sins" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A5"
      >Rm. 7:5</a
    >). Therefore it seems that they are morally evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "all
    these emotions are right in those whose love is rightly placed... For they
    fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve for sin, they rejoice in
    good works."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> On this question the opinion of the Stoics
    differed from that of the Peripatetics: for the Stoics held that all
    passions are evil, while the Peripatetics maintained that moderate passions
    are good. This difference, although it appears great in words, is
    nevertheless, in reality, none at all, or but little, if we consider the
    intent of either school. For the Stoics did not discern between sense and
    intellect; and consequently neither between the intellectual and sensitive
    appetite. Hence they did not discriminate the passions of the soul from the
    movements of the will, in so far as the passions of the soul are in the
    sensitive appetite, while the simple movements of the will are in the
    intellectual appetite: but every rational movement of the appetitive part
    they call will, while they called passion, a movement that exceeds the
    limits of reason. Wherefore Cicero, following their opinion (De Tusc.
    Quaest. iii, 4) calls all passions "diseases of the soul": whence he argues
    that "those who are diseased are unsound; and those who are unsound are
    wanting in sense." Hence we speak of those who are wanting in sense of being
    "unsound."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the Peripatetics give the name of "passions" to all the
    movements of the sensitive appetite. Wherefore they esteem them good, when
    they are controlled by reason; and evil when they are not controlled by
    reason. Hence it is evident that Cicero was wrong in disapproving (De Tusc.
    Quaest. iii, 4) of the Peripatetic theory of a mean in the passions, when he
    says that "every evil, though moderate, should be shunned; for, just as a
    body, though it be moderately ailing, is not sound; so, this mean in the
    diseases or passions of the soul, is not sound." For passions are not called
    "diseases" or "disturbances" of the soul, save when they are not controlled
    by reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Hence the reply to the First Objection is evident.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In every passion there is an increase or
    decrease in the natural movement of the heart, according as the heart is
    moved more or less intensely by contraction and dilatation; and hence it
    derives the character of passion. But there is no need for passion to
    deviate always from the order of natural reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The passions of the soul, in so far as
    they are contrary to the order of reason, incline us to sin: but in so far
    as they are controlled by reason, they pertain to virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether passion increases or decreases the goodness or malice of an act?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every passion decreases the
    goodness of a moral action. For anything that hinders the judgment of
    reason, on which depends the goodness of a moral act, consequently decreases
    the goodness of the moral act. But every passion hinders the judgment of
    reason: for Sallust says (Catilin.): "All those that take counsel about
    matters of doubt, should be free from hatred, anger, friendship and pity."
    Therefore passion decreases the goodness of a moral act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more a man's action is like to God,
    the better it is: hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A1"
      >Eph. 5:1</a
    >): "Be ye followers of God, as most dear children." But "God and the holy
    angels feel no anger when they punish... no fellow-feeling with misery when
    they relieve the unhappy," as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5). Therefore
    it is better to do such like deeds without than with a passion of the
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as moral evil depends on its
    relation to reason, so also does moral good. But moral evil is lessened by
    passion: for he sins less, who sins from passion, than he who sins
    deliberately. Therefore he does a better deed, who does well without
    passion, than he who does with passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "the
    passion of pity is obedient to reason, when pity is bestowed without
    violating right, as when the poor are relieved, or the penitent forgiven."
    But nothing that is obedient to reason lessens the moral good. Therefore a
    passion of the soul does not lessen moral good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Stoics held that every passion of the
    soul is evil, they consequently held that every passion of the soul lessens
    the goodness of an act; since the admixture of evil either destroys good
    altogether, or makes it to be less good. And this is true indeed, if by
    passions we understand none but the inordinate movements of the sensitive
    appetite, considered as disturbances or ailments. But if we give the name of
    passions to all the movements of the sensitive appetite, then it belongs to
    the perfection of man's good that his passions be moderated by reason. For
    since man's good is founded on reason as its root, that good will be all the
    more perfect, according as it extends to more things pertaining to man.
    Wherefore no one questions the fact that it belongs to the perfection of
    moral good, that the actions of the outward members be controlled by the law
    of reason. Hence, since the sensitive appetite can obey reason, as stated
    above (<a href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>,
    <a href="FS017.html#FSQ17A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), it belongs to the
    perfection of moral or human good, that the passions themselves also should
    be controlled by reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly just as it is better that man should both will good and do it in
    his external act; so also does it belong to the perfection of moral good,
    that man should be moved unto good, not only in respect of his will, but
    also in respect of his sensitive appetite; according to Ps. 83:3: "My heart
    and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God": where by "heart" we are to
    understand the intellectual appetite, and by "flesh" the sensitive appetite.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passions of the soul may stand in a
    twofold relation to the judgment of reason. First, antecedently: and thus,
    since they obscure the judgment of reason, on which the goodness of the
    moral act depends, they diminish the goodness of the act; for it is more
    praiseworthy to do a work of charity from the judgment of reason than from
    the mere passion of pity. In the second place, consequently: and this in two
    ways. First, by way of redundance: because, to wit, when the higher part of
    the soul is intensely moved to anything, the lower part also follows that
    movement: and thus the passion that results in consequence, in the sensitive
    appetite, is a sign of the intensity of the will, and so indicates greater
    moral goodness. Secondly, by way of choice; when, to wit, a man, by the
    judgment of his reason, chooses to be affected by a passion in order to work
    more promptly with the co-operation of the sensitive appetite. And thus a
    passion of the soul increases the goodness of an action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In God and the angels there is no
    sensitive appetite, nor again bodily members: and so in them good does not
    depend on the right ordering of passions or of bodily actions, as it does in
    us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A passion that tends to evil, and
    precedes the judgment of reason, diminishes sin; but if it be consequent in
    either of the ways mentioned above (Reply OBJ 1), it aggravates the sin, or
    else it is a sign of its being more grievous.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether any passion is good or evil in its species?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no passion of the soul is good
    or evil morally according to its species. Because moral good and evil depend
    on reason. But the passions are in the sensitive appetite; so that
    accordance with reason is accidental to them. Since, therefore, nothing
    accidental belongs to a thing's species, it seems that no passion is good or
    evil according to its species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, acts and passions take their species
    from their object. If, therefore, any passion were good or evil, according
    to its species, it would follow that those passions the object of which is
    good, are specifically good, such as love, desire and joy: and that those
    passions, the object of which is evil, are specifically evil, as hatred,
    fear and sadness. But this is clearly false. Therefore no passion is good or
    evil according to its species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is no species of passion that is
    not to be found in other animals. But moral good is in man alone. Therefore
    no passion of the soul is good or evil according to its species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "pity
    is a kind of virtue." Moreover, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7) that
    modesty is a praiseworthy passion. Therefore some passions are good or evil
    according to their species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We ought, seemingly, to apply to passions what
    has been said in regard to acts (<a href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1"
      >Question [18]</a
    >, <a href="FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6;
    <a href="FS020.html#FSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>,
    <a href="FS020.html#FSQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>)---viz. that the species
    of a passion, as the species of an act, can be considered from two points of
    view. First, according to its natural genus; and thus moral good and evil
    have no connection with the species of an act or passion. Secondly,
    according to its moral genus, inasmuch as it is voluntary and controlled by
    reason. In this way moral good and evil can belong to the species of a
    passion, in so far as the object to which a passion tends, is, of itself, in
    harmony or in discord with reason: as is clear in the case of "shame" which
    is base fear; and of "envy" which is sorrow for another's good: for thus
    passions belong to the same species as the external act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the passions in
    their natural species, in so far as the sensitive appetite is considered in
    itself. But in so far as the sensitive appetite obeys reason, good and evil
    of reason are no longer accidentally in the passions of the appetite, but
    essentially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passions having a tendency to good, are
    themselves good, if they tend to that which is truly good, and in like
    manner, if they turn away from that which is truly evil. On the other hand,
    those passions which consist in aversion from good, and a tendency to evil,
    are themselves evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In irrational animals the sensitive
    appetite does not obey reason. Nevertheless, in so far as they are led by a
    kind of estimative power, which is subject to a higher, i.e. the Divine
    reason, there is a certain likeness of moral good in them, in regard to the
    soul's passions.<br />
