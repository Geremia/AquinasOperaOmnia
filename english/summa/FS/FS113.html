<H3 Align="Center">OF THE EFFECTS OF GRACE (TEN ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the effect of grace; (1) the justification of 
the ungodly, which is the effect of operating grace; and (2) merit, which 
is the effect of cooperating grace. Under the first head there are ten 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is the justification of the ungodly?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether grace is required for it?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether any movement of the free-will is required?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a movement of faith is required?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether a movement of the free-will against sin is required?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the remission of sins is to be reckoned with the foregoing?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the justification of the ungodly is a work of time or is 
sudden?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of the natural order of the things concurring to justification;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether the justification of the ungodly is God's greatest work?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether the justification of the ungodly is miraculous?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is not the 
remission of sins. For sin is opposed not only to justice, but to all the 
other virtues, as stated above (<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now justification signifies 
a certain movement towards justice. Therefore not even remission of sin 
is justification, since movement is from one contrary to the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everything ought to be named from what is predominant in 
it, according to De Anima ii, text. 49. Now the remission of sins is 
brought about chiefly by faith, according to Acts 15:9: "Purifying their 
hearts by faith"; and by charity, according to Prov. 10:12: "Charity 
covereth all sins." Therefore the remission of sins ought to be named 
after faith or charity rather than justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the remission of sins seems to be the same as  being 
called, for whoever is called is afar off, and we are afar off from God 
by sin. But one is called before being justified according to Rm. 8:30: 
"And whom He called, them He also justified." Therefore justification is 
not the remission of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> On Rm. 8:30, "Whom He called, them He also justified," 
the gloss says i.e. "by the remission of sins." Therefore the remission 
of sins is justification.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Justification taken passively implies a movement towards 
heat. But since justice, by its nature, implies a certain rectitude of 
order, it may be taken in two ways: first, inasmuch as it implies a right 
order in man's act, and thus justice is placed amongst the 
virtues---either as particular justice, which directs a man's acts by 
regulating them in relation to his fellowman---or as legal justice, which 
directs a man's acts by regulating them in their relation to the common 
good of society, as appears from Ethic. v, 1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, justice is so-called inasmuch as it implies a certain 
rectitude of order in the interior disposition of a man, in so far as 
what is highest in man is subject to God, and the inferior powers of the 
soul are subject to the superior, i.e. to the reason; and this 
disposition the Philosopher calls "justice metaphorically speaking" 
(Ethic. v, 11). Now this justice may be in man in two ways: first, by 
simple generation, which is from privation to form; and thus 
justification may belong even to such as are not in sin, when they 
receive this justice from God, as Adam is said to have received original 
justice. Secondly, this justice may be brought about in man by a movement 
from one contrary to the other, and thus justification implies a 
transmutation from the state of injustice to the aforesaid state of 
justice. And it is thus we are now speaking of the justification of the 
ungodly, according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++4:5">Rm. 4:5</a>): "But to him that worketh 
not, yet believeth in Him that justifieth the ungodly," etc. And because 
movement is named after its term "whereto" rather than from its term 
"whence," the transmutation whereby anyone is changed by the remission of 
sins from the state of ungodliness to the state of justice, borrows its 
name from its term "whereto," and is called "justification of the 
ungodly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every sin, inasmuch as it implies the disorder of a mind 
not subject to God, may be called injustice, as being contrary to the 
aforesaid justice, according to 1 Jn. 3:4: "Whosoever committeth sin, 
committeth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity." And thus the removal of 
any sin is called the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith and charity imply a special directing of the human 
mind to God by the intellect and will; whereas justice implies a general 
rectitude of order. Hence this transmutation is named after justice 
rather than after charity or faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Being called refers to God's help moving and  exciting our 
mind to give up sin, and this motion of God is not the remission of sins, 
but its cause.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the infusion of grace is required for the remission of guilt, i.e. for the justification of the ungodly?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that for the remission of guilt, which is the 
justification of the ungodly, no infusion of grace is required. For 
anyone may be moved from one contrary without being led to the other, if 
the contraries are not immediate. Now the state of guilt and the state of 
grace are not immediate contraries; for there is the middle state of 
innocence wherein a man has neither grace nor guilt. Hence a man may be 
pardoned his guilt without his being brought to a state of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the remission of guilt consists in the Divine 
imputation, according to Ps. 31:2: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord 
hath not imputed sin." Now the infusion of grace puts something into our 
soul, as stated above (<A Href="FS110.html#FSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>, <A Href="FS110.html#FSQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence the infusion of grace is not 
required for the remission of guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one can be subject to two contraries at once. Now 
some sins are contraries, as wastefulness and miserliness. Hence whoever 
is subject to the sin of wastefulness is not simultaneously subject to 
the sin of miserliness, yet it may happen that he has been subject to it 
hitherto. Hence by sinning with the vice of wastefulness he is freed from 
the sin of miserliness. And thus a sin is remitted without grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++3:24">Rm. 3:24</a>): "Justified freely by His 
grace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> by sinning a man offends God as stated above (<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now an offense is remitted to anyone, only when the soul of the 
offender is at peace with the offended. Hence sin is remitted to us, when 
God is at peace with us, and this peace consists in the love whereby God 
loves us. Now God's love, considered on the part of the Divine act, is 
eternal and unchangeable; whereas, as regards the effect it imprints on 
us, it is sometimes interrupted, inasmuch as we sometimes fall short of 
it and once more require it. Now the effect of the Divine love in us, 
which is taken away by sin, is grace, whereby a man is made worthy of 
eternal life, from which sin shuts him out. Hence we could not conceive 
the remission of guilt, without the infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> More is required for an offender to pardon an offense, than 
for one who has committed no offense, not to be hated. For it may happen 
amongst men that one man neither hates nor loves another. But if the 
other offends him, then the forgiveness of the offense can only spring 
from a special goodwill. Now God's goodwill is said to be restored to man 
by the gift of grace; and hence although a man before sinning may be 
without grace and without guilt, yet that he is without guilt after 
sinning can only  be because he has grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As God's love consists not merely in the act of the Divine 
will but also implies a certain effect of grace, as stated above (<A Href="FS110.html#FSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>, <A Href="FS110.html#FSQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), so likewise, when God does not impute sin to a man, there is 
implied a certain effect in him to whom the sin is not imputed; for it 
proceeds from the Divine love, that sin is not imputed to a man by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i, 26), if to leave 
off sinning was the same as to have no sin, it would be enough if 
Scripture warned us thus: "'My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more?' Now 
this is not enough, but it is added: 'But for thy former sins also pray 
that they may be forgiven thee.'" For the act of sin passes, but the 
guilt remains, as stated above (<A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence when anyone passes 
from the sin of one vice to the sin of a contrary vice, he ceases to have 
the act of the former sin, but he does not cease to have the guilt, hence 
he may have the guilt of both sins at once. For sins are not contrary to 
each other on the part of their turning from God, wherein sin has its 
guilt.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether for the justification of the ungodly is required a movement of the free-will?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no movement of the free-will is required for 
the justification of the ungodly. For we see that by the sacrament of 
Baptism, infants and sometimes adults are justified without a movement of 
their free-will: hence Augustine says (Confess. iv) that when one of his 
friends was taken with a fever, "he lay for a long time senseless and in 
a deadly sweat, and when he was despaired of, he was baptized without his 
knowing, and was regenerated"; which is effected by sanctifying grace. 
Now God does not confine His power to the sacraments. Hence He can 
justify a man without the sacraments, and without any movement of the 
free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man has not the use of reason when asleep, and without 
it there can be no movement of the free-will. But Solomon received from 
God the gift of wisdom when asleep, as related in 3 Kgs. 3 and 2 Paral 1. 
Hence with equal reason the gift of sanctifying grace is sometimes 
bestowed by God on man without the movement of his free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, grace is preserved by the same cause as brings it into 
being, for Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) that "so ought man to 
turn to God as he is ever made just by Him." Now grace is preserved in 
man without a movement of his free-will. Hence it can be infused in the 
beginning without a movement of the free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++6:45">Jn. 6:45</a>): "Every one that hath heard of 
the Father, and hath learned, cometh to Me." Now to learn cannot be 
without a movement of the free-will, since the  learner assents to the 
teacher. Hence, no one comes to the Father by justifying grace without a 
movement of the free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The justification of the ungodly is brought about by God 
moving man to justice. For He it is "that justifieth the ungodly" 
according to Rm. 4:5. Now God moves everything in its own manner, just as 
we see that in natural things, what is heavy and what is light are moved 
differently, on account of their diverse natures. Hence He moves man to 
justice according to the condition of his human nature. But it is man's 
proper nature to have free-will. Hence in him who has the use of reason, 
God's motion to justice does not take place without a movement of the 
free-will; but He so infuses the gift of justifying grace that at the 
same time He moves the free-will to accept the gift of grace, in such as 
are capable of being moved thus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Infants are not capable of the movement of their free-will; 
hence it is by the mere infusion of their souls that God moves them to 
justice. Now this cannot be brought about without a sacrament; because as 
original sin, from which they are justified, does not come to them from 
their own will, but by carnal generation, so also is grace given them by 
Christ through spiritual regeneration. And the same reason holds good 
with madmen and idiots that have never had the use of their free-will. 
But in the case of one who has had the use of his free-will and 
afterwards has lost it either through sickness or sleep, he does not 
obtain justifying grace by the exterior rite of Baptism, or of any other 
sacrament, unless he intended to make use of this sacrament, and this can 
only be by the use of his free-will. And it was in this way that he of 
whom Augustine speaks was regenerated, because both previously and 
afterwards he assented to the Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Solomon neither merited nor received wisdom whilst asleep; 
but it was declared to him in his sleep that on account of his previous 
desire wisdom would be infused into him by God. Hence it is said in his 
person (Wis. 7:7): "I wished, and understanding was given unto me."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it may be said that his sleep was not natural, but was the sleep of 
prophecy, according to Num. 12:6: "If there be among you a prophet of the 
Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a 
dream." In such cases the use of free-will remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet it must be observed that the comparison between the gift of 
wisdom and the gift of justifying grace does not hold. For the gift of 
justifying grace especially ordains a man to good, which is the object of 
the will; and hence a man is moved to it by a movement of the will which 
is a movement of free-will. But wisdom perfects the intellect which 
precedes the will; hence without any complete movement of the free-will, 
the intellect can be enlightened with the gift of wisdom, even as we see 
that things are revealed to men in sleep, according to Job 33:15,16: 
"When deep sleep falleth upon men and they are sleeping in their beds, 
then He  openeth the ears of men, and teaching, instructeth them in what 
they are to learn."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the infusion of justifying grace there is a certain 
transmutation of the human soul, and hence a proper movement of the human 
soul is required in order that the soul may be moved in its own manner. 
But the conservation of grace is without transmutation: no movement on 
the part of the soul is required but only a continuation of the Divine 
influx.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a movement of faith is required for the justification of the ungodly?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no movement of faith is required for the 
justification of the ungodly. For as a man is justified by faith, so also 
by other things, viz. by fear, of which it is written (Ecclus. 1:27): 
"The fear of the Lord driveth out sin, for he that is without fear cannot 
be justified"; and again by charity, according to Lk. 7:47: "Many sins 
are forgiven her because she hath loved much"; and again by humility, 
according to James 4:6: "God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the 
humble"; and again by mercy, according to Prov. 15:27: "By mercy and 
faith sins are purged away." Hence the movement of faith is no more 
required for the justification of the ungodly, than the movements of the 
aforesaid virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the act of faith is required for justification only 
inasmuch as a man knows God by faith. But a man may know God in other 
ways, viz. by natural knowledge, and by the gift of wisdom. Hence no act 
of faith is required for the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there are several articles of faith. Therefore if the 
act of faith is required for the justification of the ungodly, it would 
seem that a man ought to think on every article of faith when he is first 
justified. But this seems inconvenient, since such thought would require 
a long delay of time. Hence it seems that an act of faith is not required 
for the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:1">Rm. 5:1</a>): "Being justified therefore by 
faith, let us have peace with God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) a movement of free-will is 
required for the justification of the ungodly, inasmuch as man's mind is 
moved by God. Now God moves man's soul by turning it to Himself according 
to Ps. 84:7 (Septuagint): "Thou wilt turn us, O God, and bring us to 
life." Hence for the justification of the ungodly a movement of the mind 
is required, by which it is turned to God. Now the first turning to God 
is by faith, according to Heb. 11:6: "He that cometh to God must believe 
that He is." Hence a movement of faith is required for the justification 
of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The movement of faith is not perfect unless it is quickened 
by charity; hence in the justification of the ungodly, a movement of 
charity is infused together with the movement of faith. Now free-will is 
moved to God by being subject to Him; hence an act of filial fear and an 
act of humility also concur. For it may happen that one and the same act 
of free-will springs from different virtues, when one commands and 
another is commanded, inasmuch as the act may be ordained to various 
ends. But the act of mercy counteracts sin either by way of satisfying 
for it, and thus it follows justification; or by way of preparation, 
inasmuch as the merciful obtain mercy; and thus it can either precede 
justification, or concur with the other virtues towards justification, 
inasmuch as mercy is included in the love of our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By natural knowledge a man is not turned to God, according 
as He is the object of beatitude and the cause of justification. Hence 
such knowledge does not suffice for justification. But the gift of wisdom 
presupposes the knowledge of faith, as stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++4:5">Rm. 4:5</a>), "to him that . . . believeth 
in Him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is reputed to justice, 
according to the purpose of the grace of God." Hence it is clear that in 
the justification of the ungodly an act of faith is required in order 
that a man may believe that God justifies man through the mystery of 
Christ.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether for the justification of the ungodly there is required a movement of the free-will towards sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no movement of the free-will towards sin is 
required for the justification of the ungodly. For charity alone suffices 
to take away sin, according to Prov. 10:12: "Charity covereth all sins." 
Now the object of charity is not sin. Therefore for this justification of 
the ungodly no movement of the free-will towards sin is required.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever is tending onward, ought not to look back, 
according to Phil. 3:13,14: "Forgetting the things that are behind, and 
stretching forth myself to those that are before, I press towards the 
mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation." But whoever is stretching 
forth to righteousness has his sins behind him. Hence he ought to forget 
them, and not stretch forth to them by a movement of his free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the justification of the ungodly one sin is not 
remitted without another, for "it is irreverent to expect half a pardon 
from God" [*Cap., Sunt. plures: Dist. iii, De Poenit.]. Hence, in the 
justification of the ungodly, if man's free-will must move against sin, 
he ought to think of all his sins. But this is unseemly, both because a 
great space of time would be required for such thought, and because a man 
could not obtain the forgiveness of  such sins as he had forgotten. Hence 
for the justification of the ungodly no movement of the free-will is 
required.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++31:5">Ps. 31:5</a>): "I will confess against 
myself my injustice to the Lord; and Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of 
my sin."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the justification of the ungodly 
is a certain movement whereby the human mind is moved by God from the 
state of sin to the state of justice. Hence it is necessary for the human 
mind to regard both extremes by an act of free-will, as a body in local 
movement is related to both terms of the movement. Now it is clear that 
in local movement the moving body leaves the term "whence" and nears the 
term "whereto." Hence the human mind whilst it is being justified, must, 
by a movement of its free-will withdraw from sin and draw near to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to withdraw from sin and to draw near to justice, in an act of 
free-will, means detestation and desire. For Augustine says on the words 
"the hireling fleeth," etc. (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++10:12">Jn. 10:12</a>): "Our emotions are the movements 
of our soul; joy is the soul's outpouring; fear is the soul's flight; 
your soul goes forward when you seek; your soul flees, when you are 
afraid." Hence in the justification of the ungodly there must be two acts 
of the free-will---one, whereby it tends to God's justice; the other 
whereby it hates sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to the same virtue to seek one contrary and to 
avoid the other; and hence, as it belongs to charity to love God, so 
likewise, to detest sin whereby the soul is separated from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man ought not to return to those things that are behind, 
by loving them; but, for that matter, he ought to forget them, lest he be 
drawn to them. Yet he ought to recall them to mind, in order to detest 
them; for this is to fly from them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Previous to justification a man must detest each sin he 
remembers to have committed, and from this remembrance the soul goes on 
to have a general movement of detestation with regard to all sins 
committed, in which are included such sins as have been forgotten. For a 
man is then in such a frame of mind that he would be sorry even for those 
he does not remember, if they were present to his memory; and this 
movement cooperates in his justification.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the remission of sins ought to be reckoned amongst the things required for justification?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the remission of sins ought not to be reckoned 
amongst the things required for justification. For the substance of a 
thing is not reckoned together with those that are required for a thing; 
thus a man is not reckoned together with his body and soul. But the 
justification of the ungodly is itself the remission of sins, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the remission of  sins ought not to be reckoned 
among the things required for the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, infusion of grace and remission of sins are the same; as 
illumination and expulsion of darkness are the same. But a thing ought 
not to be reckoned together with itself; for unity is opposed to 
multitude. Therefore the remission of sins ought not to be reckoned with 
the infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the remission of sin follows as effect from cause, from 
the free-will's movement towards God and sin; since it is by faith and 
contrition that sin is forgiven. But an effect ought not to be reckoned 
with its cause; since things thus enumerated together, and, as it were, 
condivided, are by nature simultaneous. Hence the remission of sins ought 
not to be reckoned with the things required for the justification of the 
ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In reckoning what is required for a thing we ought not 
to pass over the end, which is the chief part of everything. Now the 
remission of sins is the end of the justification of the ungodly; for it 
is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++27:9">Is. 27:9</a>): "This is all the fruit, that the sin thereof 
should be taken away." Hence the remission of sins ought to be reckoned 
amongst the things required for justification.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are four things which are accounted to be necessary 
for the justification of the ungodly, viz. the infusion of grace, the 
movement of the free-will towards God by faith, the movement of the 
free-will towards sin, and the remission of sins. The reason for this is 
that, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the justification of the ungodly is a 
movement whereby the soul is moved by God from a state of sin to a state 
of justice. Now in the movement whereby one thing is moved by another, 
three things are required: first, the motion of the mover; secondly, the 
movement of the moved; thirdly, the consummation of the movement, or the 
attainment of the end. On the part of the Divine motion, there is the 
infusion of grace; on the part of the free-will which is moved, there are 
two movements---of departure from the term "whence," and of approach to 
the term "whereto"; but the consummation of the movement or the 
attainment of the end of the movement is implied in the remission of 
sins; for in this is the justification of the ungodly completed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The justification of the ungodly is called the remission of 
sins, even as every movement has its species from its term. Nevertheless, 
many other things are required in order to reach the term, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The infusion of grace and the remission of sin may be 
considered in two ways: first, with respect to the substance of the act, 
and thus they are the same; for by the same act God bestows grace and 
remits sin. Secondly, they may be considered on the part of the objects; 
and thus they differ by the difference between guilt, which is taken 
away, and grace, which is infused;  just as in natural things generation 
and corruption differ, although the generation of one thing is the 
corruption of another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This enumeration is not the division of a genus into its 
species, in which the things enumerated must be simultaneous; but it is 
division of the things required for the completion of anything; and in 
this enumeration we may have what precedes and what follows, since some 
of the principles and parts of a composite thing may precede and some 
follow.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the justification of the ungodly takes place in an instant or successively?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly does not take 
place in an instant, but successively, since, as already stated (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), 
for the justification of the ungodly, there is required a movement of 
free-will. Now the act of the free-will is choice, which requires the 
deliberation of counsel, as stated above (<A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence, since 
deliberation implies a certain reasoning process, and this implies 
succession, the justification of the ungodly would seem to be successive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the free-will's movement is not without actual 
consideration. But it is impossible to understand many things actually 
and at once, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence, since for the 
justification of the ungodly there is required a movement of the 
free-will towards several things, viz. towards God and towards sin, it 
would seem impossible for the justification of the ungodly to be in an 
instant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a form that may be greater or less, e.g. blackness or 
whiteness, is received successively by its subject. Now grace may be 
greater or less, as stated above (<A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112OUTP1">Question [112]</a>, <A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Hence it is not received 
suddenly by its subject. Therefore, seeing that the infusion of grace is 
required for the justification of the ungodly, it would seem that the 
justification of the ungodly cannot be in an instant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the free-will's movement, which cooperates in 
justification, is meritorious; and hence it must proceed from grace, 
without which there is no merit, as we shall state further on (<A Href="FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="FS114.html#FSQ114A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now a thing receives its form before operating by this form. Hence 
grace is first infused, and then the free-will is moved towards God and 
to detest sin. Hence justification is not all at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if grace is infused into the soul, there must be an 
instant when it first dwells in the soul; so, too, if sin is forgiven 
there must be a last instant that man is in sin. But it cannot be the 
same instant, otherwise opposites would be in the same simultaneously. 
Hence they must be two successive instants; between which there must be 
time, as the Philosopher says (Phys. vi, 1). Therefore the justification 
of the ungodly takes place not  all at once, but successively.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The justification of the ungodly is caused by the 
justifying grace of the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit comes to men's 
minds suddenly, according to Acts 2:2: "And suddenly there came a sound 
from heaven as of a mighty wind coming," upon which the gloss says that 
"the grace of the Holy Ghost knows no tardy efforts." Hence the 
justification of the ungodly is not successive, but instantaneous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The entire justification of the ungodly consists as to 
its origin in the infusion of grace. For it is by grace that free-will is 
moved and sin is remitted. Now the infusion of grace takes place in an 
instant and without succession. And the reason of this is that if a form 
be not suddenly impressed upon its subject, it is either because that 
subject is not disposed, or because the agent needs time to dispose the 
subject. Hence we see that immediately the matter is disposed by a 
preceding alteration, the substantial form accrues to the matter; thus 
because the atmosphere of itself is disposed to receive light, it is 
suddenly illuminated by a body actually luminous. Now it was stated 
(<A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112OUTP1">Question [112]</a>, <A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that God, in order to infuse grace into the soul, needs no 
disposition, save what He Himself has made. And sometimes this sufficient 
disposition for the reception of grace He makes suddenly, sometimes 
gradually and successively, as stated above (<A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112OUTP1">Question [112]</a>, <A Href="FS112.html#FSQ112A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). For the 
reason why a natural agent cannot suddenly dispose matter is that in the 
matter there is a resistant which has some disproportion with the power 
of the agent; and hence we see that the stronger the agent, the more 
speedily is the matter disposed. Therefore, since the Divine power is 
infinite, it can suddenly dispose any matter whatsoever to its form; and 
much more man's free-will, whose movement is by nature instantaneous. 
Therefore the justification of the ungodly by God takes place in an 
instant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The movement of the free-will, which concurs in the 
justification of the ungodly, is a consent to detest sin, and to draw 
near to God; and this consent takes place suddenly. Sometimes, indeed, it 
happens that deliberation precedes, yet this is not of the substance of 
justification, but a way of justification; as local movement is a way of 
illumination, and alteration to generation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), there is nothing to 
prevent two things being understood at once, in so far as they are 
somehow one; thus we understand the subject and predicate together, 
inasmuch as they are united in the order of one affirmation. And in the 
same manner can the free-will be moved to two things at once in so far as 
one is ordained to the other. Now the free-will's movement towards sin is 
ordained to the free-will's movement towards God, since a man detests 
sin, as contrary to God, to Whom he wishes to cling. Hence in the 
justification of the ungodly the free-will simultaneously detests sin and 
turns to God, even as a body approaches one point and withdraws from 
another  simultaneously.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reason why a form is not received instantaneously in 
the matter is not the fact that it can inhere more or less; for thus the 
light would not be suddenly received in the air, which can be illumined 
more or less. But the reason is to be sought on the part of the 
disposition of the matter or subject, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The same instant the form is acquired, the thing begins to 
operate with the form; as fire, the instant it is generated moves 
upwards, and if its movement was instantaneous, it would be terminated in 
the same instant. Now to will and not to will---the movements of the 
free-will---are not successive, but instantaneous. Hence the 
justification of the ungodly must not be successive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 5 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The succession of opposites in the same subject must be 
looked at differently in the things that are subject to time and in those 
that are above time. For in those that are in time, there is no last 
instant in which the previous form inheres in the subject; but there is 
the last time, and the first instant that the subsequent form inheres in 
the matter or subject; and this for the reason, that in time we are not 
to consider one instant, since neither do instants succeed each other 
immediately in time, nor points in a line, as is proved in Physic. vi, 1. 
But time is terminated by an instant. Hence in the whole of the previous 
time wherein anything is moving towards its form, it is under the 
opposite form; but in the last instant of this time, which is the first 
instant of the subsequent time, it has the form which is the term of the 
movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 5 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in those that are above time, it is otherwise. For if there be any 
succession of affections or intellectual conceptions in them (as in the 
angels), such succession is not measured by continuous time, but by 
discrete time, even as the things measured are not continuous, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP053.html#FPQ53OUTP1">Question [53]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP053.html#FPQ53ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). In these, therefore, there is a last instant 
in which the preceding is, and a first instant in which the subsequent 
is. Nor must there be time in between, since there is no continuity of 
time, which this would necessitate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[7] R.O. 5 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the human mind, which is justified, is, in itself, above time, but 
is subject to time accidentally, inasmuch as it understands with 
continuity and time, with respect to the phantasms in which it considers 
the intelligible species, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP085.html#FPQ85ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). We must, 
therefore, decide from this about its change as regards the condition of 
temporal movements, i.e. we must say that there is no last instant that 
sin inheres, but a last time; whereas there is a first instant that grace 
inheres; and in all the time previous sin inhered.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the infusion of grace is naturally the first of the things  required for the justification of the ungodly?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the infusion of grace is not what is naturally 
required first for the justification of the ungodly. For we withdraw from 
evil before drawing near to good, according to Ps. 33:15: "Turn away from 
evil, and do good." Now the remission of sins regards the turning away 
from evil, and the infusion of grace regards the turning to good. Hence 
the remission of sin is naturally before the infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the disposition naturally precedes the form to which it 
disposes. Now the free-will's movement is a disposition for the reception 
of grace. Therefore it naturally precedes the infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin hinders the soul from tending freely to God. Now a 
hindrance to movement must be removed before the movement takes place. 
Hence the remission of sin and the free-will's movement towards sin are 
naturally before the infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The cause is naturally prior to its effect. Now the 
infusion of grace is the cause of whatever is required for the 
justification of the ungodly, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore it is 
naturally prior to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The aforesaid four things required for the justification 
of the ungodly are simultaneous in time, since the justification of the 
ungodly is not successive, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>); but in the order of 
nature, one is prior to another; and in their natural order the first is 
the infusion of grace; the second, the free-will's movement towards God; 
the third, the free-will's movement towards sin; the fourth, the 
remission of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this is that in every movement the motion of the mover is 
naturally first; the disposition of the matter, or the movement of the 
moved, is second; the end or term of the movement in which the motion of 
the mover rests, is last. Now the motion of God the Mover is the infusion 
of grace, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>); the movement or disposition of the 
moved is the free-will's double movement; and the term or end of the 
movement is the remission of sin, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence in their 
natural order the first in the justification of the ungodly is the 
infusion of grace; the second is the free-will's movement towards God; 
the third is the free-will's movement towards sin, for he who is being 
justified detests sin because it is against God, and thus the free-will's 
movement towards God naturally precedes the free-will's movement towards 
sin, since it is its cause and reason; the fourth and last is the 
remission of sin, to which this transmutation is ordained as to an end, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,6).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The withdrawal from one term and approach to another may be 
looked at in two ways: first, on the part of the thing moved, and thus 
the withdrawal from a term naturally precedes  the approach to a term, 
since in the subject of movement the opposite which is put away is prior 
to the opposite which the subject moved attains to by its movement. But 
on the part of the agent it is the other way about, since the agent, by 
the form pre-existing in it, acts for the removal of the opposite form; 
as the sun by its light acts for the removal of darkness, and hence on 
the part of the sun, illumination is prior to the removal of darkness; 
but on the part of the atmosphere to be illuminated, to be freed from 
darkness is, in the order of nature, prior to being illuminated, although 
both are simultaneous in time. And since the infusion of grace and the 
remission of sin regard God Who justifies, hence in the order of nature 
the infusion of grace is prior to the freeing from sin. But if we look at 
what is on the part of the man justified, it is the other way about, 
since in the order of nature the being freed from sin is prior to the 
obtaining of justifying grace. Or it may be said that the term "whence" 
of justification is sin; and the term "whereto" is justice; and that 
grace is the cause of the forgiveness of sin and of obtaining of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The disposition of the subject precedes the reception of 
the form, in the order of nature; yet it follows the action of the agent, 
whereby the subject is disposed. And hence the free-will's movement 
precedes the reception of grace in the order of nature, and follows the 
infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 9), in movements of the 
soul the movement toward the speculative principle or the practical end 
is the very first, but in exterior movements the removal of the 
impediment precedes the attainment of the end. And as the free-will's 
movement is a movement of the soul, in the order of nature it moves 
towards God as to its end, before removing the impediment of sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the justification of the ungodly is God's greatest work?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is not God's 
greatest work. For it is by the justification of the ungodly that we 
attain the grace of a wayfarer. Now by glorification we receive heavenly 
grace, which is greater. Hence the glorification of angels and men is a 
greater work than the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the justification of the ungodly is ordained to the 
particular good of one man. But the good of the universe is greater than 
the good of one man, as is plain from Ethic. i, 2. Hence the creation of 
heaven and earth is a greater work than the justification of the ungodly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to make something from nothing, where there is nought to 
cooperate with the agent, is greater than to make something with the 
cooperation of the recipient. Now in the work of creation something is 
made from nothing, and hence nothing can  cooperate with the agent; but 
in the justification of the ungodly God makes something from something, 
i.e. a just man from a sinner, and there is a cooperation on man's part, 
since there is a movement of the free-will, as stated above (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence 
the justification of the ungodly is not God's greatest work.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++144:9">Ps. 144:9</a>): "His tender mercies are over 
all His works," and in a collect [*Tenth Sunday after Pentecost] we say: 
"O God, Who dost show forth Thine all-mightiness most by pardoning and 
having mercy," and Augustine, expounding the words, "greater than these 
shall he do" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++14:12">Jn. 14:12</a>) says that "for a just man to be made from a 
sinner, is greater than to create heaven and earth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A work may be called great in two ways: first, on the 
part of the mode of action, and thus the work of creation is the greatest 
work, wherein something is made from nothing; secondly, a work may be 
called great on account of what is made, and thus the justification of 
the ungodly, which terminates at the eternal good of a share in the 
Godhead, is greater than the creation of heaven and earth, which 
terminates at the good of mutable nature. Hence, Augustine, after saying 
that "for a just man to be made from a sinner is greater than to create 
heaven and earth," adds, "for heaven and earth shall pass away, but the 
justification of the ungodly shall endure."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, we must bear in mind that a thing is called great in two ways: 
first, in an absolute quantity, and thus the gift of glory is greater 
than the gift of grace that sanctifies the ungodly; and in this respect 
the glorification of the just is greater than the justification of the 
ungodly. Secondly, a thing may be said to be great in proportionate 
quantity, and thus the gift of grace that justifies the ungodly is 
greater than the gift of glory that beatifies the just, for the gift of 
grace exceeds the worthiness of the ungodly, who are worthy of 
punishment, more than the gift of glory exceeds the worthiness of the 
just, who by the fact of their justification are worthy of glory. Hence 
Augustine says: "Let him that can, judge whether it is greater to create 
the angels just, than to justify the ungodly. Certainly, if they both 
betoken equal power, one betokens greater mercy."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus the reply to the first is clear.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good of the universe is greater than the particular 
good of one, if we consider both in the same genus. But the good of grace 
in one is greater than the good of nature in the whole universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection rests on the manner of acting, in which way 
creation is God's greatest work.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the justification of the ungodly is a miraculous work?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the justification of the ungodly is a 
miraculous work. For miraculous works are greater than non-miraculous. 
Now the justification of the ungodly is greater than the other miraculous 
works, as is clear from the quotation from Augustine (<A Href="FS113.html#FSQ113A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Hence the 
justification of the ungodly is a miraculous work.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the movement of the will in the soul is like the natural 
inclination in natural things. But when God works in natural things 
against their inclination of their nature, it is a miraculous work, as 
when He gave sight to the blind or raised the dead. Now the will of the 
ungodly is bent on evil. Hence, since God in justifying a man moves him 
to good, it would seem that the justification of the ungodly is 
miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as wisdom is a gift of God, so also is justice. Now it 
is miraculous that anyone should suddenly obtain wisdom from God without 
study. Therefore it is miraculous that the ungodly should be justified by 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Miraculous works are beyond natural power. Now the 
justification of the ungodly is not beyond natural power; for Augustine 
says (De Praed. Sanct. v) that "to be capable of having faith and to be 
capable of having charity belongs to man's nature; but to have faith and 
charity belongs to the grace of the faithful." Therefore the 
justification of the ungodly is not miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In miraculous works it is usual to find three things: the 
first is on the part of the active power, because they can only be 
performed by Divine power; and they are simply wondrous, since their 
cause is hidden, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP105.html#FPQ105A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). And thus both the 
justification of the ungodly and the creation of the world, and, 
generally speaking, every work that can be done by God alone, is 
miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in certain miraculous works it is found that the form 
introduced is beyond the natural power of such matter, as in the 
resurrection of the dead, life is above the natural power of such a body. 
And thus the justification of the ungodly is not miraculous, because the 
soul is naturally capable of grace; since from its having been made to 
the likeness of God, it is fit to receive God by grace, as Augustine 
says, in the above quotation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, in miraculous works something is found besides the usual and 
customary order of causing an effect, as when a sick man suddenly and 
beyond the wonted course of healing by nature or art, receives perfect 
health; and thus the justification of the ungodly is sometimes miraculous 
and sometimes not. For the common and wonted course of justification is 
that God moves the soul interiorly and that man is converted to God, 
first by an imperfect conversion, that it may afterwards become perfect; 
because "charity begun merits increase, and when increased merits 
perfection," as Augustine says (In Epist. Joan. Tract. v). Yet God 
sometimes moves  the soul so vehemently that it reaches the perfection of 
justice at once, as took place in the conversion of Paul, which was 
accompanied at the same time by a miraculous external prostration. Hence 
the conversion of Paul is commemorated in the Church as miraculous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Certain miraculous works, although they are less than the 
justification of the ungodly, as regards the good caused, are beyond the 
wonted order of such effects, and thus have more of the nature of a 
miracle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not a miraculous work, whenever a natural thing is 
moved contrary to its inclination, otherwise it would be miraculous for 
water to be heated, or for a stone to be thrown upwards; but only 
whenever this takes place beyond the order of the proper cause, which 
naturally does this. Now no other cause save God can justify the ungodly, 
even as nothing save fire can heat water. Hence the justification of the 
ungodly by God is not miraculous in this respect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[113] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man naturally acquires wisdom and knowledge from God by 
his own talent and study. Hence it is miraculous when a man is made wise 
or learned outside this order. But a man does not naturally acquire 
justifying grace by his own action, but by God's. Hence there is no 
parity.<br>
