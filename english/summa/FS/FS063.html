  <h3 align="center">OF THE CAUSE OF VIRTUES (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the cause of virtues; and under this head there are
    four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether virtue is in us by nature?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether any virtue is caused in us
    by habituation?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether any moral virtues are in
    us by infusion?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether virtue acquired by
    habituation, is of the same species as infused virtue?<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether virtue is in us by nature?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtue is in us by nature. For
    Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14): "Virtues are natural to us and are
    equally in all of us." And Antony says in his sermon to the monks: "If the
    will contradicts nature it is perverse, if it follow nature it is virtuous."
    Moreover, a gloss on Mt. 4:23, "Jesus went about," etc., says: "He taught
    them natural virtues, i.e. chastity, justice, humility, which man possesses
    naturally."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the virtuous good consists in accord
    with reason, as was clearly shown above (<a href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2). But that which
    accords with reason is natural to man; since reason is part of man's nature.
    Therefore virtue is in man by nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is in us from birth is said
    to be natural to us. Now virtues are in some from birth: for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+31%3A18">Job 31:18</a>):
    "From my infancy mercy grew up with me; and it came out with me from my
    mother's womb." Therefore virtue is in man by nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is in man by nature is common to all
    men, and is not taken away by sin, since even in the demons natural gifts
    remain, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). But virtue is not in all men;
    and is cast out by sin. Therefore it is not in man by nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> With regard to corporeal forms, it has been
    maintained by some that they are wholly from within, by those, for instance,
    who upheld the theory of "latent forms" [*Anaxagoras; Cf. FP, Question [45],
    Article [8]; Question [65], Article [4]]. Others held that forms are
    entirely from without, those, for instance, who thought that corporeal forms
    originated from some separate cause. Others, however, esteemed that they are
    partly from within, in so far as they pre-exist potentially in matter; and
    partly from without, in so far as they are brought into act by the agent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner with regard to sciences and virtues, some held that they are
    wholly from within, so that all virtues and sciences would pre-exist in the
    soul naturally, but that the hindrances to science and virtue, which are due
    to the soul being weighed down by the body, are removed by study and
    practice, even as iron is made bright by being polished. This was the
    opinion of the Platonists. Others said that they are wholly from without,
    being due to the inflow of the active intellect, as Avicenna maintained.
    Others said that sciences and virtues are within us by nature, so far as we
    are adapted to them, but not in their perfection: this is the teaching of
    the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 1), and is nearer the truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To make this clear, it must be observed that there are two ways in which
    something is said to be natural to a man; one is according to his specific
    nature, the other according to his individual nature. And, since each thing
    derives its species from its form, and its individuation from matter, and,
    again, since man's form is his rational soul, while his matter is his body,
    whatever belongs to him in respect of his rational soul, is natural to him
    in respect of his specific nature; while whatever belongs to him in respect
    of the particular temperament of his body, is natural to him in respect of
    his individual nature. For whatever is natural to man in respect of his
    body, considered as part of his species, is to be referred, in a way, to the
    soul, in so far as this particular body is adapted to this particular
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In both these ways virtue is natural to man inchoatively. This is so in
    respect of the specific nature, in so far as in man's reason are to be found
    instilled by nature certain naturally known principles of both knowledge and
    action, which are the nurseries of intellectual and moral virtues, and in so
    far as there is in the will a natural appetite for good in accordance with
    reason. Again, this is so in respect of the individual nature, in so far as
    by reason of a disposition in the body, some are disposed either well or ill
    to certain virtues: because, to wit, certain sensitive powers are acts of
    certain parts of the body, according to the disposition of which these
    powers are helped or hindered in the exercise of their acts, and, in
    consequence, the rational powers also, which the aforesaid sensitive powers
    assist. In this way one man has a natural aptitude for science, another for
    fortitude, another for temperance: and in these ways, both intellectual and
    moral virtues are in us by way of a natural aptitude, inchoatively, but not
    perfectly, since nature is determined to one, while the perfection of these
    virtues does not depend on one particular mode of action, but on various
    modes, in respect of the various matters, which constitute the sphere of
    virtue's action, and according to various circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore evident that all virtues are in us by nature, according to
    aptitude and inchoation, but not according to perfection, except the
    theological virtues, which are entirely from without.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two argue
    about the nurseries of virtue which are in us by nature, inasmuch as we are
    rational beings. The third objection must be taken in the sense that, owing
    to the natural disposition which the body has from birth, one has an
    aptitude for pity, another for living temperately, another for some other
    virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether any virtue is caused in us by habituation?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtues can not be caused in
    us by habituation. Because a gloss of Augustine [*Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi
    cvi.] commenting on Rm. 14:23, "All that is not of faith is sin," says: "The
    whole life of an unbeliever is a sin: and there is no good without the
    Sovereign Good. Where knowledge of the truth is lacking, virtue is a mockery
    even in the best behaved people." Now faith cannot be acquired by means of
    works, but is caused in us by God, according to Eph. 2:8: "By grace you are
    saved through faith." Therefore no acquired virtue can be in us by
    habituation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin and virtue are contraries, so that
    they are incompatible. Now man cannot avoid sin except by the grace of God,
    according to Wis. 8:21: "I knew that I could not otherwise be continent,
    except God gave it." Therefore neither can any virtues be caused in us by
    habituation, but only by the gift of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, actions which lead toward virtue, lack
    the perfection of virtue. But an effect cannot be more perfect than its
    cause. Therefore a virtue cannot be caused by actions that precede it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that good is
    more efficacious than evil. But vicious habits are caused by evil acts. Much
    more, therefore, can virtuous habits be caused by good acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We have spoken above (<a
      href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1"
      >Question [51]</a
    >, <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3) in a general way
    about the production of habits from acts; and speaking now in a special way
    of this matter in relation to virtue, we must take note that, as stated
    above (<a href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), man's virtue perfects
    him in relation to good. Now since the notion of good consists in "mode,
    species, and order," as Augustine states (De Nat. Boni. iii) or in "number,
    weight, and measure," as expressed in Wis. 11:21, man's good must needs be
    appraised with respect to some rule. Now this rule is twofold, as stated
    above (<a href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), viz. human reason and
    Divine Law. And since Divine Law is the higher rule, it extends to more
    things, so that whatever is ruled by human reason, is ruled by the Divine
    Law too; but the converse does not hold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows that human virtue directed to the good which is defined according
    to the rule of human reason can be caused by human acts: inasmuch as such
    acts proceed from reason, by whose power and rule the aforesaid good is
    established. On the other hand, virtue which directs man to good as defined
    by the Divine Law, and not by human reason, cannot be caused by human acts,
    the principle of which is reason, but is produced in us by the Divine
    operation alone. Hence Augustine in giving the definition of the latter
    virtue inserts the words, "which God works in us without us" (Super Ps. 118,
    Serm. xxvi). It is also of these virtues that the First Objection holds
    good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mortal sin is incompatible with divinely
    infused virtue, especially if this be considered in its perfect state. But
    actual sin, even mortal, is compatible with humanly acquired virtue; because
    the use of a habit in us is subject to our will, as stated above (<a
      href="FS049.html#FSQ49OUTP1"
      >Question [49]</a
    >, <a href="FS049.html#FSQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and one sinful act
    does not destroy a habit of acquired virtue, since it is not an act but a
    habit, that is directly contrary to a habit. Wherefore, though man cannot
    avoid mortal sin without grace, so as never to sin mortally, yet he is not
    hindered from acquiring a habit of virtue, whereby he may abstain from evil
    in the majority of cases, and chiefly in matters most opposed to reason.
    There are also certain mortal sins which man can nowise avoid without grace,
    those, namely, which are directly opposed to the theological virtues, which
    are in us through the gift of grace. This, however, will be more fully
    explained later (<a href="FS109.html#FSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>,
    <a href="FS109.html#FSQ109A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>,
    <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), certain seeds or
    principles of acquired virtue pre-exist in us by nature. These principles
    are more excellent than the virtues acquired through them: thus the
    understanding of speculative principles is more excellent than the science
    of conclusions, and the natural rectitude of the reason is more excellent
    than the rectification of the appetite which results through the appetite
    partaking of reason, which rectification belongs to moral virtue.
    Accordingly human acts, in so far as they proceed from higher principles,
    can cause acquired human virtues.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether any moral virtues are in us by infusion?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no virtues besides the
    theological virtues are infused in us by God. Because God does not do by
    Himself, save perhaps sometimes miraculously, those things that can be done
    by second causes; for, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv), "it is God's rule
    to bring about extremes through the mean." Now intellectual and moral
    virtues can be caused in us by our acts, as stated above (<a
      href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Therefore it is not reasonable that they should be caused in us by
    infusion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, much less superfluity is found in God's
    works than in the works of nature. Now the theological virtues suffice to
    direct us to supernatural good. Therefore there are no other supernatural
    virtues needing to be caused in us by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nature does not employ two means where
    one suffices: much less does God. But God sowed the seeds of virtue in our
    souls, according to a gloss on Heb. 1 [*Cf. Jerome on Gal. 1: 15,16].
    Therefore it is unfitting for Him to cause in us other virtues by means of
    infusion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 8:7): "She teacheth
    temperance and prudence and justice and fortitude."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Effects must needs be proportionate to their
    causes and principles. Now all virtues, intellectual and moral, that are
    acquired by our actions, arise from certain natural principles pre-existing
    in us, as above stated (<a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>,
    <a href="FS051.html#FSQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): instead of which natural
    principles, God bestows on us the theological virtues, whereby we are
    directed to a supernatural end, as stated (<a href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore we need to
    receive from God other habits corresponding, in due proportion, to the
    theological virtues, which habits are to the theological virtues, what the
    moral and intellectual virtues are to the natural principles of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some moral and intellectual virtues can
    indeed be caused in us by our actions: but such are not proportionate to the
    theological virtues. Therefore it was necessary for us to receive, from God
    immediately, others that are proportionate to these virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The theological virtues direct us
    sufficiently to our supernatural end, inchoatively: i.e. to God Himself
    immediately. But the soul needs further to be perfected by infused virtues
    in regard to other things, yet in relation to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of those naturally instilled
    principles does not extend beyond the capacity of nature. Consequently man
    needs in addition to be perfected by other principles in relation to his
    supernatural end.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether virtue by habituation belongs to the same species as infused
    virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that infused virtue does not differ
    in species from acquired virtue. Because acquired and infused virtues,
    according to what has been said (<a href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), do not differ seemingly, save in relation to the last end. Now human
    habits and acts are specified, not by their last, but by their proximate
    end. Therefore the infused moral or intellectual virtue does not differ from
    the acquired virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, habits are known by their acts. But the
    act of infused and acquired temperance is the same, viz. to moderate desires
    of touch. Therefore they do not differ in species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, acquired and infused virtue differ as
    that which is wrought by God immediately, from that which is wrought by a
    creature. But the man whom God made, is of the same species as a man
    begotten naturally; and the eye which He gave to the man born blind, as one
    produced by the power of generation. Therefore it seems that acquired and
    infused virtue belong to the same species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Any change introduced into the difference
    expressed in a definition involves a difference of species. But the
    definition of infused virtue contains the words, "which God works in us
    without us," as stated above (<a href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore acquired
    virtue, to which these words cannot apply, is not of the same species as
    infused virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold specific difference among
    habits. The first, as stated above (<a href="FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1"
      >Question [54]</a
    >, <a href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="FS056.html#FSQ56A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="FS060.html#FSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is taken from the
    specific and formal aspects of their objects. Now the object of every virtue
    is a good considered as in that virtue's proper matter: thus the object of
    temperance is a good in respect of the pleasures connected with the
    concupiscence of touch. The formal aspect of this object is from reason
    which fixes the mean in these concupiscences: while the material element is
    something on the part of the concupiscences. Now it is evident that the mean
    that is appointed in such like concupiscences according to the rule of human
    reason, is seen under a different aspect from the mean which is fixed
    according to Divine rule. For instance, in the consumption of food, the mean
    fixed by human reason, is that food should not harm the health of the body,
    nor hinder the use of reason: whereas, according to the Divine rule, it
    behooves man to "chastise his body, and bring it into subjection" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++9%3A27"
      >1 Cor. 9:27</a
    >), by abstinence in food, drink and the like. It is therefore evident that
    infused and acquired temperance differ in species; and the same applies to
    the other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other specific differences among habits is taken from the things to
    which they are directed: for a man's health and a horse's are not of the
    same species, on account of the difference between the natures to which
    their respective healths are directed. In the same sense, the Philosopher
    says (Polit. iii, 3) that citizens have diverse virtues according as they
    are well directed to diverse forms of government. In the same way, too,
    those infused moral virtues, whereby men behave well in respect of their
    being "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household [Douay:
    'domestics'] of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++2%3A19"
      >Eph. 2:19</a
    >), differ from the acquired virtues, whereby man behaves well in respect of
    human affairs.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Infused and acquired virtue differ not
    only in relation to the ultimate end, but also in relation to their proper
    objects, as stated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Both acquired and infused temperance
    moderate desires for pleasures of touch, but for different reasons, as
    stated: wherefore their respective acts are not identical.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God gave the man born blind an eye for
    the same act as the act for which other eyes are formed naturally:
    consequently it was of the same species. It would be the same if God wished
    to give a man miraculously virtues, such as those that are acquired by acts.
    But the case is not so in the question before us, as stated.<br />
