</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the cause of virtues; and under this head there are 
four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether virtue is in us by nature?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether any virtue is caused in us by habituation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether any moral virtues are in us by infusion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether virtue acquired by habituation, is of the same species as 
infused virtue?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtue is in us by nature. For Damascene says 
(De Fide Orth. iii, 14): "Virtues are natural to us and are equally in 
all of us." And Antony says in his sermon to the monks: "If the will 
contradicts nature it is perverse, if it follow nature it is virtuous." 
Moreover, a gloss on Mt. 4:23, "Jesus went about," etc., says: "He taught 
them natural virtues, i.e. chastity, justice, humility, which man 
possesses naturally."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the virtuous good consists in accord with reason, as was 
clearly shown above (<A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2). But that which accords with 
reason is natural to man; since reason is part of man's nature. Therefore 
virtue is in man by nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is in us from birth is said to be natural to 
us. Now virtues are in some from birth: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+31%3A18">Job 31:18</a>): 
"From my infancy mercy grew up with me; and it came out with me from my 
mother's womb." Therefore virtue is in man by nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is in man by nature is common to all men, and 
is not taken away by sin, since even in the demons natural gifts remain, 
as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). But virtue is not in all men; and is 
cast out by sin. Therefore it is not in man by nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> With regard to corporeal forms, it has been maintained by 
some that they are wholly from within, by those, for instance, who upheld 
the theory of "latent forms" [*Anaxagoras; Cf. FP, Question [45], Article [8]; Question [65], 
Article [4]]. Others held that forms are entirely from without, those, for 
instance, who thought that corporeal forms originated from some separate 
cause. Others, however, esteemed that they are partly from within, in so 
far as they pre-exist potentially in matter; and partly from without, in 
so far as they are brought into act by the agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner with regard to sciences and virtues, some held that they 
are wholly from within, so that all virtues and sciences would pre-exist 
in the soul naturally, but that the hindrances to science and virtue, 
which are due to the soul being weighed down by the body, are removed by 
study and practice, even as iron is made bright by being polished. This 
was the opinion of the Platonists. Others said that they are wholly from 
without, being due to the inflow of the active intellect, as Avicenna 
maintained. Others said that sciences and virtues are within us by 
nature, so far as we are adapted to them, but not in their perfection: 
this is the teaching of the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 1), and is nearer the 
truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To make this clear, it must be observed that there are two ways in which 
something is said to be natural to a man; one is according to his 
specific nature, the other according to his individual nature. And, since 
each thing derives its species from its form, and its individuation from 
matter, and, again, since man's form is his rational soul, while his 
matter is his body,  whatever belongs to him in respect of his rational 
soul, is natural to him in respect of his specific nature; while whatever 
belongs to him in respect of the particular temperament of his body, is 
natural to him in respect of his individual nature. For whatever is 
natural to man in respect of his body, considered as part of his species, 
is to be referred, in a way, to the soul, in so far as this particular 
body is adapted to this particular soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In both these ways virtue is natural to man inchoatively. This is so in 
respect of the specific nature, in so far as in man's reason are to be 
found instilled by nature certain naturally known principles of both 
knowledge and action, which are the nurseries of intellectual and moral 
virtues, and in so far as there is in the will a natural appetite for 
good in accordance with reason. Again, this is so in respect of the 
individual nature, in so far as by reason of a disposition in the body, 
some are disposed either well or ill to certain virtues: because, to wit, 
certain sensitive powers are acts of certain parts of the body, according 
to the disposition of which these powers are helped or hindered in the 
exercise of their acts, and, in consequence, the rational powers also, 
which the aforesaid sensitive powers assist. In this way one man has a 
natural aptitude for science, another for fortitude, another for 
temperance: and in these ways, both intellectual and moral virtues are in 
us by way of a natural aptitude, inchoatively, but not perfectly, since 
nature is determined to one, while the perfection of these virtues does 
not depend on one particular mode of action, but on various modes, in 
respect of the various matters, which constitute the sphere of virtue's 
action, and according to various circumstances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore evident that all virtues are in us by nature, according 
to aptitude and inchoation, but not according to perfection, except the 
theological virtues, which are entirely from without.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two argue 
about the nurseries of virtue which are in us by nature, inasmuch as we 
are rational beings. The third objection must be taken in the sense that, 
owing to the natural disposition which the body has from birth, one has 
an aptitude for pity, another for living temperately, another for some 
other virtue.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any virtue is caused in us by habituation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtues can not be caused in us by 
habituation. Because a gloss of Augustine [*Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi 
cvi.] commenting on Rm. 14:23, "All that is not of faith is sin," says: 
"The whole life of an unbeliever is a sin: and there is no good without 
the Sovereign Good. Where knowledge of the truth is lacking, virtue is a 
mockery even in the best behaved people." Now faith cannot be acquired by 
means of works, but is caused in us by God, according to Eph. 2:8: "By 
grace you are saved through faith." Therefore no acquired virtue can be 
in us by habituation. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin and virtue are contraries, so that they are 
incompatible. Now man cannot avoid sin except by the grace of God, 
according to Wis. 8:21: "I knew that I could not otherwise be continent, 
except God gave it." Therefore neither can any virtues be caused in us by 
habituation, but only by the gift of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, actions which lead toward virtue, lack the perfection of 
virtue. But an effect cannot be more perfect than its cause. Therefore a 
virtue cannot be caused by actions that precede it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that good is more 
efficacious than evil. But vicious habits are caused by evil acts. Much 
more, therefore, can virtuous habits be caused by good acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We have spoken above (<A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3) in a general way 
about the production of habits from acts; and speaking now in a special 
way of this matter in relation to virtue, we must take note that, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), man's virtue perfects him in relation to 
good. Now since the notion of good consists in "mode, species, and 
order," as Augustine states (De Nat. Boni. iii) or in "number, weight, 
and measure," as expressed in Wis. 11:21, man's good must needs be 
appraised with respect to some rule. Now this rule is twofold, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), viz. human reason and Divine Law. And since 
Divine Law is the higher rule, it extends to more things, so that 
whatever is ruled by human reason, is ruled by the Divine Law too; but 
the converse does not hold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that human virtue directed to the good which is defined 
according to the rule of human reason can be caused by human acts: 
inasmuch as such acts proceed from reason, by whose power and rule the 
aforesaid good is established. On the other hand, virtue which directs 
man to good as defined by the Divine Law, and not by human reason, cannot 
be caused by human acts, the principle of which is reason, but is 
produced in us by the Divine operation alone. Hence Augustine in giving 
the definition of the latter virtue inserts the words, "which God works 
in us without us" (Super Ps. 118, Serm. xxvi). It is also of these 
virtues that the First Objection holds good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mortal sin is incompatible with divinely infused virtue, 
especially if this be considered in its perfect state. But actual sin, 
even mortal, is compatible with humanly acquired virtue; because the use 
of a habit in us is subject to our will, as stated above (<A Href="FS049.html#FSQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="FS049.html#FSQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): 
and one sinful act does not destroy a habit of acquired virtue, since it 
is not an act but a habit, that is directly contrary to a habit. 
Wherefore, though man cannot avoid mortal sin without grace, so as never 
to sin mortally, yet he is not hindered from acquiring a habit of virtue, 
whereby he may abstain from evil in the majority of cases, and chiefly in 
matters most opposed to reason. There are also certain mortal sins which 
man can nowise avoid without grace, those, namely, which are  directly 
opposed to the theological virtues, which are in us through the gift of 
grace. This, however, will be more fully explained later (<A Href="FS109.html#FSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>, <A Href="FS109.html#FSQ109A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), certain seeds or 
principles of acquired virtue pre-exist in us by nature. These principles 
are more excellent than the virtues acquired through them: thus the 
understanding of speculative principles is more excellent than the 
science of conclusions, and the natural rectitude of the reason is more 
excellent than the rectification of the appetite which results through 
the appetite partaking of reason, which rectification belongs to moral 
virtue. Accordingly human acts, in so far as they proceed from higher 
principles, can cause acquired human virtues.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any moral virtues are in us by infusion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no virtues besides the theological virtues are 
infused in us by God. Because God does not do by Himself, save perhaps 
sometimes miraculously, those things that can be done by second causes; 
for, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv), "it is God's rule to bring about 
extremes through the mean." Now intellectual and moral virtues can be 
caused in us by our acts, as stated above (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it is not 
reasonable that they should be caused in us by infusion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, much less superfluity is found in God's works than in 
the works of nature. Now the theological virtues suffice to direct us to 
supernatural good. Therefore there are no other supernatural virtues 
needing to be caused in us by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nature does not employ two means where one suffices: 
much less does God. But God sowed the seeds of virtue in our souls, 
according to a gloss on Heb. 1 [*Cf. Jerome on Gal. 1: 15,16]. Therefore 
it is unfitting for Him to cause in us other virtues by means of infusion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 8:7): "She teacheth temperance and 
prudence and justice and fortitude."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Effects must needs be proportionate to their causes and 
principles. Now all virtues, intellectual and moral, that are acquired by 
our actions, arise from certain natural principles pre-existing in us, as 
above stated (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="FS051.html#FSQ51A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): instead of which natural principles, 
God bestows on us the theological virtues, whereby we are directed to a 
supernatural end, as stated (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore we need to receive 
from God other habits corresponding, in due proportion, to the 
theological virtues, which habits are to the theological virtues, what 
the moral and intellectual virtues are to the natural principles of 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some moral and intellectual virtues can indeed be  caused 
in us by our actions: but such are not proportionate to the theological 
virtues. Therefore it was necessary for us to receive, from God 
immediately, others that are proportionate to these virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The theological virtues direct us sufficiently to our 
supernatural end, inchoatively: i.e. to God Himself immediately. But the 
soul needs further to be perfected by infused virtues in regard to other 
things, yet in relation to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of those naturally instilled principles does not 
extend beyond the capacity of nature. Consequently man needs in addition 
to be perfected by other principles in relation to his supernatural end.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether virtue by habituation belongs to the same species as infused virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that infused virtue does not differ in species from 
acquired virtue. Because acquired and infused virtues, according to what 
has been said (<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), do not differ seemingly, save in relation to the 
last end. Now human habits and acts are specified, not by their last, but 
by their proximate end. Therefore the infused moral or intellectual 
virtue does not differ from the acquired virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, habits are known by their acts. But the act of infused 
and acquired temperance is the same, viz. to moderate desires of touch. 
Therefore they do not differ in species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, acquired and infused virtue differ as that which is 
wrought by God immediately, from that which is wrought by a creature. But 
the man whom God made, is of the same species as a man begotten 
naturally; and the eye which He gave to the man born blind, as one 
produced by the power of generation. Therefore it seems that acquired and 
infused virtue belong to the same species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Any change introduced into the difference expressed in 
a definition involves a difference of species. But the definition of 
infused virtue contains the words, "which God works in us without us," as 
stated above (<A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore acquired virtue, to which these 
words cannot apply, is not of the same species as infused virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold specific difference among habits. The 
first, as stated above (<A Href="FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS056.html#FSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>, <A Href="FS056.html#FSQ56A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="FS060.html#FSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is taken 
from the specific and formal aspects of their objects. Now the object of 
every virtue is a good considered as in that virtue's proper matter: thus 
the object of temperance is a good in respect of the pleasures connected 
with the concupiscence of touch. The formal aspect of this object is from 
reason which fixes the mean in these concupiscences: while the material 
element is something on the part of the concupiscences. Now it is evident 
that the mean  that is appointed in such like concupiscences according to 
the rule of human reason, is seen under a different aspect from the mean 
which is fixed according to Divine rule. For instance, in the consumption 
of food, the mean fixed by human reason, is that food should not harm the 
health of the body, nor hinder the use of reason: whereas, according to 
the Divine rule, it behooves man to "chastise his body, and bring it into 
subjection" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9%3A27">1 Cor. 9:27</a>), by abstinence in food, drink and the like. It 
is therefore evident that infused and acquired temperance differ in 
species; and the same applies to the other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other specific differences among habits is taken from the things to 
which they are directed: for a man's health and a horse's are not of the 
same species, on account of the difference between the natures to which 
their respective healths are directed. In the same sense, the Philosopher 
says (Polit. iii, 3) that citizens have diverse virtues according as they 
are well directed to diverse forms of government. In the same way, too, 
those infused moral virtues, whereby men behave well in respect of their 
being "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household [Douay: 
'domestics'] of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++2%3A19">Eph. 2:19</a>), differ from the acquired virtues, 
whereby man behaves well in respect of human affairs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Infused and acquired virtue differ not only in relation to 
the ultimate end, but also in relation to their proper objects, as stated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Both acquired and infused temperance moderate desires for 
pleasures of touch, but for different reasons, as stated: wherefore their 
respective acts are not identical.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[63] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God gave the man born blind an eye for the same act as the 
act for which other eyes are formed naturally: consequently it was of the 
same species. It would be the same if God wished to give a man 
miraculously virtues, such as those that are acquired by acts. But the 
case is not so in the question before us, as stated.<br>
