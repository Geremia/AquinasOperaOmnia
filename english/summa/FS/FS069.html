points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the beatitudes differ from the gifts and virtues?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A2THEP1">(2)</a> Of the rewards of the beatitudes: whether they refer to this life?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the beatitudes do not differ from the virtues 
and gifts. For Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) assigns the 
beatitudes recited by Matthew (v 3, seqq.) to the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost; and Ambrose in his commentary on Luke 6:20, seqq., ascribes the 
beatitudes mentioned there, to the four cardinal virtues. Therefore the 
beatitudes do not differ from the virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there are but two rules of the human will: the reason 
and the eternal law, as stated above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="FS021.html#FSQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the 
virtues perfect man in relation to reason; while the gifts perfect him in 
relation to the eternal law of the Holy Ghost, as is clear from what has 
been said (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3, seqq.). Therefore there cannot be anything 
else pertaining to the rectitude of the human will, besides the virtues 
and gifts. Therefore the beatitudes do not differ from them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the beatitudes are included meekness, justice, and 
mercy, which are said to be virtues. Therefore the beatitudes do not 
differ from the virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Certain things are included among the beatitudes, that 
are neither virtues nor gifts, e.g. poverty, mourning, and peace. 
Therefore the beatitudes differ from the virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), happiness is 
the last end of human life. Now one is said to possess the end already, 
when one hopes to possess it; wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 
9) that "children are said to be happy because they are full of hope"; 
and the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A24">Rm. 8:24</a>): "We are saved by hope." Again, we hope 
to obtain an end, because we are suitably moved towards that end, and 
approach thereto; and this implies some action. And a man is moved 
towards, and approaches the happy end by works of virtue, and above all 
by the works of the gifts, if we speak of eternal happiness, for which 
our reason is not sufficient, since we need to be moved by the Holy 
Ghost, and to be perfected with His gifts that we may obey and follow 
him. Consequently the beatitudes differ from the virtues and gifts, not 
as habit, but as act from habit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine and Ambrose assign the beatitudes to the gifts 
and virtues, as acts are ascribed to habits. But the  gifts are more 
excellent than the cardinal virtues, as stated above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). 
Wherefore Ambrose, in explaining the beatitudes propounded to the throng, 
assigns them to the cardinal virtues, whereas Augustine, who is 
explaining the beatitudes delivered to the disciples on the mountain, and 
so to those who were more perfect, ascribes them to the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument proves that no other habits, besides the 
virtues and gifts, rectify human conduct.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Meekness is to be taken as denoting the act of meekness: 
and the same applies to justice and mercy. And though these might seem to 
be virtues, they are nevertheless ascribed to gifts, because the gifts 
perfect man in all matters wherein the virtues perfect him, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="FS068.html#FSQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the rewards assigned to the beatitudes refer to this life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rewards assigned to the beatitudes do not 
refer to this life. Because some are said to be happy because they hope 
for a reward, as stated above (<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the object of hope is future 
happiness. Therefore these rewards refer to the life to come.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, certain punishments are set down in opposition to the 
beatitudes, Lk. 6:25, where we read: "Woe to you that are filled; for you 
shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh, for you shall mourn and weep." 
Now these punishments do not refer to this life, because frequently men 
are not punished in this life, according to Job 21:13: "They spend their 
days in wealth." Therefore neither do the rewards of the beatitudes refer 
to this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the kingdom of heaven which is set down as the reward of 
poverty is the happiness of heaven, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix) 
[*Cf. De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 1]. Again, abundant fullness is not to be 
had save in the life to come, according to Ps. 16:15: "I shall be filled 
[Douay: 'satisfied'] when Thy glory shall appear." Again, it is only in 
the future life that we shall see God, and that our Divine sonship will 
be made manifest, according to 1 Jn. 3:2: "We are now the sons of God; 
and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that, when He 
shall appear, we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as He 
is." Therefore these rewards refer to the future life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): "These 
promises can be fulfilled in this life, as we believe them to have been 
fulfilled in the apostles. For no words can express that complete change 
into the likeness even of an angel, which is promised to us after this 
life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Expounders of Holy Writ are not agreed in speaking of 
these rewards. For some, with Ambrose (Super Luc. v),  hold that all 
these rewards refer to the life to come; while Augustine (De Serm. Dom. 
in Monte i, 4) holds them to refer to the present life; and Chrysostom in 
his homilies (In Matth. xv) says that some refer to the future, and some 
to the present life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make the matter clear we must take note that hope of future 
happiness may be in us for two reasons. First, by reason of our having a 
preparation for, or a disposition to future happiness; and this is by way 
of merit; secondly, by a kind of imperfect inchoation of future happiness 
in holy men, even in this life. For it is one thing to hope that the tree 
will bear fruit, when the leaves begin to appear, and another, when we 
see the first signs of the fruit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, those things which are set down as merits in the 
beatitudes, are a kind of preparation for, or disposition to happiness, 
either perfect or inchoate: while those that are assigned as rewards, may 
be either perfect happiness, so as to refer to the future life, or some 
beginning of happiness, such as is found in those who have attained 
perfection, in which case they refer to the present life. Because when a 
man begins to make progress in the acts of the virtues and gifts, it is 
to be hoped that he will arrive at perfection, both as a wayfarer, and as 
a citizen of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Hope regards future happiness as the last end: yet it may 
also regard the assistance of grace as that which leads to that end, 
according to Ps. 27:7: "In Him hath my heart hoped, and I have been 
helped."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although sometimes the wicked do not undergo temporal 
punishment in this life, yet they suffer spiritual punishment. Hence 
Augustine says (Confess. i): "Thou hast decreed, and it is so, 
Lord---that the disordered mind should be its own punishment." The 
Philosopher, too, says of the wicked (Ethic. ix, 4) that "their soul is 
divided against itself . . . one part pulls this way, another that"; and 
afterwards he concludes, saying: "If wickedness makes a man so miserable, 
he should strain every nerve to avoid vice." In like manner, although, on 
the other hand, the good sometimes do not receive material rewards in 
this life, yet they never lack spiritual rewards, even in this life, 
according to Mt. 19:29, and Mk. 10:30: "Ye shall receive a hundred times 
as much" even "in this time."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All these rewards will be fully consummated in the life to 
come: but meanwhile they are, in a manner, begun, even in this life. 
Because the "kingdom of heaven," as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv; *Cf. 
De Serm. Dom. in Monte, i, 1), can denote the beginning of perfect 
wisdom, in so far as "the spirit" begins to reign in men. The 
"possession" of the land denotes the well-ordered affections of the soul 
that rests, by its desire, on the solid foundation of the eternal 
inheritance, signified by "the land." They are "comforted" in this life, 
by receiving the Holy Ghost, Who is called the "Paraclete," i.e. the 
Comforter. They  "have their fill," even in this life, of that food of 
which Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4%3A34">Jn. 4:34</a>): "My meat is to do the will of Him that 
sent Me." Again, in this life, men "obtain" God's "Mercy." Again, the eye 
being cleansed by the gift of understanding, we can, so to speak, "see 
God." Likewise, in this life, those who are the "peacemakers" of their 
own movements, approach to likeness to God, and are called "the children 
of God." Nevertheless these things will be more perfectly fulfilled in 
heaven.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the beatitudes are suitably enumerated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the beatitudes are unsuitably enumerated. For 
the beatitudes are assigned to the gifts, as stated above (<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). 
Now some of the gifts, viz. wisdom and understanding, belong to the 
contemplative life: yet no beatitude is assigned to the act of 
contemplation, for all are assigned to matters connected with the active 
life. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, not only do the executive gifts belong to the active 
life, but also some of the directive gifts, e.g. knowledge and counsel: 
yet none of the beatitudes seems to be directly connected with the acts 
of knowledge or counsel. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently 
indicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, among the executive gifts connected with the active 
life, fear is said to be connected with poverty, while piety seems to 
correspond to the beatitude of mercy: yet nothing is included directly 
connected with justice. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently 
enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, many other beatitudes are mentioned in Holy Writ. Thus, 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+5%3A17">Job 5:17</a>): "Blessed is the man whom God correcteth"; and 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++i,+1">Ps. i, 1</a>): "Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the 
ungodly"; and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++3%3A13">Prov. 3:13</a>): "Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom." 
Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> On the other hand, it seems that too many are mentioned. For 
there are seven gifts of the Holy Ghost: whereas eight beatitudes are 
indicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, only four beatitudes are indicated in the sixth chapter 
of Luke. Therefore the seven or eight mentioned in Matthew 5 are too many.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> These beatitudes are most suitably enumerated. To make 
this evident it must be observed that beatitude has been held to consist 
in one of three things: for some have ascribed it to a sensual life, 
some, to an active life, and some, to a contemplative life [*See Question [3]]. 
Now these three kinds of happiness stand in different relations to future 
beatitude, by hoping for which we are said to be happy. Because sensual 
happiness, being  false and contrary to reason, is an obstacle to future 
beatitude; while happiness of the active life is a disposition of future 
beatitude; and contemplative happiness, if perfect, is the very essence 
of future beatitude, and, if imperfect, is a beginning thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And so Our Lord, in the first place, indicated certain beatitudes as 
removing the obstacle of sensual happiness. For a life of pleasure 
consists of two things. First, in the affluence of external goods, 
whether riches or honors; from which man is withdrawn---by a virtue so 
that he uses them in moderation---and by a gift, in a more excellent way, 
so that he despises them altogether. Hence the first beatitude is: 
"Blessed are the poor in spirit," which may refer either to the contempt 
of riches, or to the contempt of honors, which results from humility. 
Secondly, the sensual life consists in following the bent of one's 
passions, whether irascible or concupiscible. From following the 
irascible passions man is withdrawn---by a virtue, so that they are kept 
within the bounds appointed by the ruling of reason---and by a gift, in a 
more excellent manner, so that man, according to God's will, is 
altogether undisturbed by them: hence the second beatitude is: "Blessed 
are the meek." From following the concupiscible passions, man is 
withdrawn---by a virtue, so that man uses these passions in 
moderation---and by gift, so that, if necessary, he casts them aside 
altogether; nay more, so that, if need be, he makes a deliberate choice 
of sorrow [*Cf. Question [35], Article [3]]; hence the third beatitude is: "Blessed are 
they that mourn."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Active life consists chiefly in man's relations with his neighbor, 
either by way of duty or by way of spontaneous gratuity. To the former we 
are disposed---by a virtue, so that we do not refuse to do our duty to 
our neighbor, which pertains to justice---and by a gift, so that we do 
the same much more heartily, by accomplishing works of justice with an 
ardent desire, even as a hungry and thirsty man eats and drinks with 
eager appetite. Hence the fourth beatitude is: "Blessed are they that 
hunger and thirst after justice." With regard to spontaneous favors we 
are perfected---by a virtue, so that we give where reason dictates we 
should give, e.g. to our friends or others united to us; which pertains 
to the virtue of liberality--and by a gift, so that, through reverence 
for God, we consider only the needs of those on whom we bestow our 
gratuitous bounty: hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++14%3A12,13">Lk. 14:12,13</a>): "When thou makest 
a dinner or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren," etc . . . 
"but . . . call the poor, the maimed," etc.; which, properly, is to have 
mercy: hence the fifth beatitude is: "Blessed are the merciful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Those things which concern the contemplative life, are either final 
beatitude itself, or some beginning thereof: wherefore they are included 
in the beatitudes, not as merits, but as rewards. Yet the effects of the 
active life, which dispose man for the contemplative life, are included 
in the beatitudes. Now the effect of the active life, as regards those 
virtues and gifts whereby man is perfected in himself, is the cleansing 
of man's heart, so that  it is not defiled by the passions: hence the 
sixth beatitude is: "Blessed are the clean of heart." But as regards the 
virtues and gifts whereby man is perfected in relation to his neighbor, 
the effect of the active life is peace, according to Is. 32:17: "The work 
of justice shall be peace": hence the seventh beatitude is "Blessed are 
the peacemakers."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The acts of the gifts which belong to the active life are 
indicated in the merits: but the acts of the gifts pertaining to the 
contemplative life are indicated in the rewards, for the reason given 
above. Because to "see God" corresponds to the gift of understanding; and 
to be like God by being adoptive "children of God," corresponds to the 
gift of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In things pertaining to the active life, knowledge is not 
sought for its own sake, but for the sake of operation, as even the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 2). And therefore, since beatitude implies 
something ultimate, the beatitudes do not include the acts of those gifts 
which direct man in the active life, such acts, to wit, as are elicited 
by those gifts, as, e.g. to counsel is the act of counsel, and to judge, 
the act of knowledge: but, on the other hand, they include those 
operative acts of which the gifts have the direction, as, e.g. mourning 
in respect of knowledge, and mercy in respect of counsel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In applying the beatitudes to the gifts we may consider two 
things. One is likeness of matter. In this way all the first five 
beatitudes may be assigned to knowledge and counsel as to their directing 
principles: whereas they must be distributed among the executive gifts: 
so that, to wit, hunger and thirst for justice, and mercy too, correspond 
to piety, which perfects man in his relations to others; meekness to 
fortitude, for Ambrose says on Lk. 6:22: "It is the business of fortitude 
to conquer anger, and to curb indignation," fortitude being about the 
irascible passions: poverty and mourning to the gift of fear, whereby man 
withdraws from the lusts and pleasures of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we may consider the motives of the beatitudes: and, in this 
way, some of them will have to be assigned differently. Because the 
principal motive for meekness is reverence for God, which belongs to 
piety. The chief motive for mourning is knowledge, whereby man knows his 
failings and those of worldly things, according to Eccles. 1:18: "He that 
addeth knowledge, addeth also sorrow [Vulg: labor]." The principal motive 
for hungering after the works of justice is fortitude of the soul: and 
the chief motive for being merciful is God's counsel, according to Dan. 
4:24: "Let my counsel be acceptable to the king [Vulg: to thee, O king]: 
and redeem thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of 
mercy to the poor." It is thus that Augustine assigns them (De Serm. Dom. 
in Monte i, 4).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> All the beatitudes mentioned in Holy Writ must be reduced 
to these, either as to the merits or as to the rewards: because they must 
all belong either to the active or to the  contemplative life. 
Accordingly, when we read, "Blessed is the man whom the Lord correcteth," 
we must refer this to the beatitude of mourning: when we read, "Blessed 
is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly," we must 
refer it to cleanness of heart: and when we read, "Blessed is the man 
that findeth wisdom," this must be referred to the reward of the seventh 
beatitude. The same applies to all others that can be adduced.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The eighth beatitude is a confirmation and declaration of 
all those that precede. Because from the very fact that a man is 
confirmed in poverty of spirit, meekness, and the rest, it follows that 
no persecution will induce him to renounce them. Hence the eighth 
beatitude corresponds, in a way, to all the preceding seven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Luke relates Our Lord's sermon as addressed to the 
multitude (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++6%3A17">Lk. 6:17</a>). Hence he sets down the beatitudes according to the 
capacity of the multitude, who know no other happiness than pleasure, 
temporal and earthly: wherefore by these four beatitudes Our Lord 
excludes four things which seem to belong to such happiness. The first of 
these is abundance of external goods, which he sets aside by saying: 
"Blessed are ye poor." The second is that man be well off as to his body, 
in food and drink, and so forth; this he excludes by saying in the second 
place: "Blessed are ye that hunger." The third is that it should be well 
with man as to joyfulness of heart, and this he puts aside by saying: 
"Blessed are ye that weep now." The fourth is the outward favor of man; 
and this he excludes, saying, fourthly: "Blessed shall you be, when men 
shall hate you." And as Ambrose says on Lk. 6:20, "poverty corresponds to 
temperance, which is unmoved by delights; hunger, to justice, since who 
hungers is compassionate and, through compassion gives; mourning, to 
prudence, which deplores perishable things; endurance of men's hatred 
belongs to fortitude."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the rewards of the beatitudes are suitably enumerated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rewards of the beatitudes are unsuitably 
enumerated. Because the kingdom of heaven, which is eternal life, 
contains all good things. Therefore, once given the kingdom of heaven, no 
other rewards should be mentioned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the kingdom of heaven is assigned as the reward, both of 
the first and of the eighth beatitude. Therefore, on the same ground it 
should have been assigned to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the beatitudes are arranged in the ascending order, as 
Augustine remarks (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): whereas the rewards seem 
to be placed in the descending order, since to "possess the land" is less 
than to possess "the kingdom of heaven." Therefore these rewards are 
unsuitably enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Our Lord Who  propounded these 
rewards.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> These rewards are most suitably assigned, considering the 
nature of the beatitudes in relation to the three kinds of happiness 
indicated above (<A Href="FS069.html#FSQ69A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). For the first three beatitudes concerned the 
withdrawal of man from those things in which sensual happiness consists: 
which happiness man desires by seeking the object of his natural desire, 
not where he should seek it, viz. in God, but in temporal and perishable 
things. Wherefore the rewards of the first three beatitudes correspond to 
these things which some men seek to find in earthly happiness. For men 
seek in external things, viz. riches and honors, a certain excellence and 
abundance, both of which are implied in the kingdom of heaven, whereby 
man attains to excellence and abundance of good things in God. Hence Our 
Lord promised the kingdom of heaven to the poor in spirit. Again, cruel 
and pitiless men seek by wrangling and fighting to destroy their enemies 
so as to gain security for themselves. Hence Our Lord promised the meek a 
secure and peaceful possession of the land of the living, whereby the 
solid reality of eternal goods is denoted. Again, men seek consolation 
for the toils of the present life, in the lusts and pleasures of the 
world. Hence Our Lord promises comfort to those that mourn.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other beatitudes belong to the works of active happiness, which are 
the works of virtues directing man in his relations to his neighbor: from 
which operations some men withdraw through inordinate love of their own 
good. Hence Our Lord assigns to these beatitudes rewards in 
correspondence with the motives for which men recede from them. For there 
are some who recede from acts of justice, and instead of rendering what 
is due, lay hands on what is not theirs, that they may abound in temporal 
goods. Wherefore Our Lord promised those who hunger after justice, that 
they shall have their fill. Some, again, recede from works of mercy, lest 
they be busied with other people's misery. Hence Our Lord promised the 
merciful that they should obtain mercy, and be delivered from all misery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two beatitudes belong to contemplative happiness or beatitude: 
hence the rewards are assigned in correspondence with the dispositions 
included in the merit. For cleanness of the eye disposes one to see 
clearly: hence the clean of heart are promised that they shall see God. 
Again, to make peace either in oneself or among others, shows a man to be 
a follower of God, Who is the God of unity and peace. Hence, as a reward, 
he is promised the glory of the Divine sonship, consisting in perfect 
union with God through consummate wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. xv in Matth.), all these rewards 
are one in reality, viz. eternal happiness, which the human intellect 
cannot grasp. Hence it was necessary to describe it by means of various 
boons known to us, while observing due proportion to the merits to which 
those rewards are assigned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the eighth beatitude is a confirmation of  all the 
beatitudes, so it deserves all the rewards of the beatitudes. Hence it 
returns to the first, that we may understand all the other rewards to be 
attributed to it in consequence. Or else, according to Ambrose (Super 
Luc. v), the kingdom of heaven is promised to the poor in spirit, as 
regards the glory of the soul; but to those who suffer persecution in 
their bodies, it is promised as regards the glory of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[69] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rewards are also arranged in ascending order. For it is 
more to possess the land of the heavenly kingdom than simply to have it: 
since we have many things without possessing them firmly and peacefully. 
Again, it is more to be comforted in the kingdom than to have and possess 
it, for there are many things the possession of which is accompanied by 
sorrow. Again, it is more to have one's fill than simply to be comforted, 
because fulness implies abundance of comfort. And mercy surpasses 
satiety, for thereby man receives more than he merited or was able to 
desire. And yet more is it to see God, even as he is a greater man who 
not only dines at court, but also sees the king's countenance. Lastly, 
the highest place in the royal palace belongs to the king's son.<br>
