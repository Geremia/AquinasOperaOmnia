<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next place, since venial and mortal sins differ in respect of the 
debt of punishment, we must consider them. First, we shall consider 
venial sin as compared with mortal sin; secondly, we shall consider 
venial sin in itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether venial sin is fittingly condivided with mortal sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they differ generically?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether venial sin is a disposition to mortal sin?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin is unfittingly condivided with 
mortal sin. For Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27): "Sin is a word, 
deed or desire contrary to the eternal law." But the fact of being 
against the eternal law makes a sin to be mortal. Consequently every sin 
is mortal. Therefore venial sin is not condivided with mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++10%3A31">1 Cor. 10:31</a>): "Whether you eat or 
drink, or whatever else you do; do all to the glory of God." Now whoever 
sins breaks this commandment, because sin is not done for God's glory. 
Consequently, since to break a commandment is to commit a mortal sin, it 
seems that whoever sins, sins mortally. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever cleaves to a thing by love, cleaves either as 
enjoying it, or as using it, as Augustine states (De Doctr. Christ. i, 
3,4). But no person, in sinning, cleaves to a mutable good as using it: 
because he does not refer it to that good which gives us happiness, 
which, properly speaking, is to use, according to Augustine (De Doctr. 
Christ. i, 3,4). Therefore whoever sins enjoys a mutable good. Now "to 
enjoy what we should use is human perverseness," as Augustine again says 
(Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 30). Therefore, since "perverseness" [*The Latin 
'pervertere' means to overthrow, to destroy, hence 'perversion' of God's 
law is a mortal sin.] denotes a mortal sin, it seems that whoever sins, 
sins mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever approaches one term, from that very fact turns 
away from the opposite. Now whoever sins, approaches a mutable good, and, 
consequently turns away from the immutable good, so that he sins 
mortally. Therefore venial sin is unfittingly condivided with mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. xli in Joan.), that "a crime is 
one that merits damnation, and a venial sin, one that does not." But a 
crime denotes a mortal sin. Therefore venial sin is fittingly condivided 
with mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Certain terms do not appear to be mutually opposed, if 
taken in their proper sense, whereas they are opposed if taken 
metaphorically: thus "to smile" is not opposed to "being dry"; but if we 
speak of the smiling meadows when they are decked with flowers and fresh 
with green hues this is opposed to drought. In like manner if mortal be 
taken literally as referring to the death of the body, it does not imply 
opposition to venial, nor belong to the same genus. But if mortal be 
taken metaphorically, as applied to sin, it is opposed to that which is 
venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For sin, being a sickness of the soul, as stated above (<A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="FS071.html#FSQ71A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 2), is said to be mortal by comparison 
with a disease, which is said to be mortal, through causing an 
irreparable defect consisting in the corruption of a principle, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now the principle of the spiritual life, which is a 
life in accord with virtue, is the order to the last end, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and if this order be corrupted, it cannot be 
repaired by any intrinsic principle, but by the power of God alone, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), because disorders in things referred to the 
end, are repaired through the end, even as an error about conclusions can 
be repaired through the truth of the principles. Hence the defect of 
order to the last end cannot be repaired through something else as a 
higher principle, as neither can an error about principles. Wherefore 
such sins are called mortal, as being irreparable. On the other hand, 
sins which imply a disorder in things referred to the end, the order to 
the end itself being preserved, are reparable. These sins are called 
venial: because a sin receives its acquittal [veniam] when the debt of 
punishment is taken away, and this ceases when the  sin ceases, as 
explained above (<A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, mortal and venial are mutually opposed as reparable and 
irreparable: and I say this with reference to the intrinsic principle, 
but not to the Divine power, which can repair all diseases, whether of 
the body or of the soul. Therefore venial sin is fittingly condivided 
with mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The division of sin into venial and mortal is not a 
division of a genus into its species which have an equal share of the 
generic nature: but it is the division of an analogous term into its 
parts, of which it is predicated, of the one first, and of the other 
afterwards. Consequently the perfect notion of sin, which Augustine 
gives, applies to mortal sin. On the other hand, venial sin is called a 
sin, in reference to an imperfect notion of sin, and in relation to 
mortal sin: even as an accident is called a being, in relation to 
substance, in reference to the imperfect notion of being. For it is not 
"against" the law, since he who sins venially neither does what the law 
forbids, nor omits what the law prescribes to be done; but he acts 
"beside" the law, through not observing the mode of reason, which the law 
intends.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This precept of the Apostle is affirmative, and so it does 
not bind for all times. Consequently everyone who does not actually refer 
all his actions to the glory of God, does not therefore act against this 
precept. In order, therefore, to avoid mortal sin each time that one 
fails actually to refer an action to God's glory, it is enough to refer 
oneself and all that one has to God habitually. Now venial sin excludes 
only actual reference of the human act to God's glory, and not habitual 
reference: because it does not exclude charity, which refers man to God 
habitually. Therefore it does not follow that he who sins venially, sins 
mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that sins venially, cleaves to temporal good, not as 
enjoying it, because he does not fix his end in it, but as using it, by 
referring it to God, not actually but habitually.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Mutable good is not considered to be a term in 
contraposition to the immutable good, unless one's end is fixed therein: 
because what is referred to the end has not the character of finality.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial and mortal sin do not differ 
generically, so that some sins be generically mortal, and some 
generically venial. Because human acts are considered to be generically 
good or evil according to their matter or object, as stated above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now either mortal or venial sin may be committed in regard to any 
object or matter: since man can love any mutable good, either less than 
God, which may be a venial sin, or more than God, which is a mortal sin. 
Therefore venial and mortal  sin do not differ generically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a sin 
is called mortal when it is irreparable, venial when it can be repaired. 
Now irreparability belongs to sin committed out of malice, which, 
according to some, is irremissible: whereas reparability belongs to sins 
committed through weakness or ignorance, which are remissible. Therefore 
mortal and venial sin differ as sin committed through malice differs from 
sin committed through weakness or ignorance. But, in this respect, sins 
differ not in genus but in cause, as stated above (<A Href="FS077.html#FSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="FS077.html#FSQ77A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 1). 
Therefore venial and mortal sin do not differ generically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74A3A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>) that 
sudden movements both of the sensuality and of the reason are venial 
sins. But sudden movements occur in every kind of sin. Therefore no sins 
are generically venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine, in a sermon on Purgatory (De Sanctis, serm. 
xli), enumerates certain generic venial sins, and certain generic mortal 
sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Venial sin is so called from "venia" [pardon]. 
Consequently a sin may be called venial, first of all, because it has 
been pardoned: thus Ambrose says that "penance makes every sin venial": 
and this is called venial "from the result." Secondly, a sin is called 
venial because it does not contain anything either partially or totally, 
to prevent its being pardoned: partially, as when a sin contains 
something diminishing its guilt, e.g. a sin committed through weakness or 
ignorance: and this is called venial "from the cause": totally, through 
not destroying the order to the last end, wherefore it deserves temporal, 
but not everlasting punishment. It is of this venial sin that we wish to 
speak now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For as regards the first two, it is evident that they have no 
determinate genus: whereas venial sin, taken in the third sense, can have 
a determinate genus, so that one sin may be venial generically, and 
another generically mortal, according as the genus or species of an act 
is determined by its object. For, when the will is directed to a thing 
that is in itself contrary to charity, whereby man is directed to his 
last end, the sin is mortal by reason of its object. Consequently it is a 
mortal sin generically, whether it be contrary to the love of God, e.g. 
blasphemy, perjury, and the like, or against the love of one's neighbor, 
e.g. murder, adultery, and such like: wherefore such sins are mortal by 
reason of their genus. Sometimes, however, the sinner's will is directed 
to a thing containing a certain inordinateness, but which is not contrary 
to the love of God and one's neighbor, e.g. an idle word, excessive 
laughter, and so forth: and such sins are venial by reason of their genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, since moral acts derive their character of goodness and 
malice, not only from their objects, but also from some disposition of 
the agent, as stated above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,6), it  happens sometimes that a 
sin which is venial generically by reason of its object, becomes mortal 
on the part of the agent, either because he fixes his last end therein, 
or because he directs it to something that is a mortal sin in its own 
genus; for example, if a man direct an idle word to the commission of 
adultery. In like manner it may happen, on the part of the agent, that a 
sin generically mortal because venial, by reason of the act being 
imperfect, i.e. not deliberated by reason, which is the proper principle 
of an evil act, as we have said above in reference to sudden movements of 
unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The very fact that anyone chooses something that is 
contrary to divine charity, proves that he prefers it to the love of God, 
and consequently, that he loves it more than he loves God. Hence it 
belongs to the genus of some sins, which are of themselves contrary to 
charity, that something is loved more than God; so that they are mortal 
by reason of their genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers those sins which are venial from 
their cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers those sins which are venial by 
reason of the imperfection of the act.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin is not a disposition to mortal sin. 
For one contrary does not dispose to another. But venial and mortal sin 
are condivided as contrary to one another, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Therefore venial sin is not a disposition to mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an act disposes to something of like species, wherefore 
it is stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2, that "from like acts like dispositions 
and habits are engendered." But mortal and venial sin differ in genus or 
species, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore venial sin does not dispose to 
mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a sin is called venial because it disposes to mortal 
sin, it follows that whatever disposes to mortal sin is a venial sin. Now 
every good work disposes to mortal sin; wherefore Augustine says in his 
Rule (Ep. ccxi) that "pride lies in wait for good works that it may 
destroy them." Therefore even good works would be venial sins, which is 
absurd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 19:1): "He that contemneth small 
things shall fall by little and little." Now he that sins venially seems 
to contemn small things. Therefore by little and little he is disposed to 
fall away together into mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A disposition is a kind of cause; wherefore as there is a 
twofold manner of cause, so is there a twofold manner of  disposition. 
For there is a cause which moves directly to the production of the 
effect, as a hot thing heats: and there is a cause which moves 
indirectly, by removing an obstacle, as he who displaces a pillar is said 
to displace the stone that rests on it. Accordingly an act of sin 
disposes to something in two ways. First, directly, and thus it disposes 
to an act of like species. In this way, a sin generically venial does 
not, primarily and of its nature, dispose to a sin generically mortal, 
for they differ in species. Nevertheless, in this same way, a venial sin 
can dispose, by way of consequence, to a sin which is mortal on the part 
of the agent: because the disposition or habit may be so far strengthened 
by acts of venial sin, that the lust of sinning increases, and the sinner 
fixes his end in that venial sin: since the end for one who has a habit, 
as such, is to work according to that habit; and the consequence will be 
that, by sinning often venially, he becomes disposed to a mortal sin. 
Secondly, a human act disposes to something by removing an obstacle 
thereto. In this way a sin generically venial can dispose to a sin 
generically mortal. Because he that commits a sin generically venial, 
turns aside from some particular order; and through accustoming his will 
not to be subject to the due order in lesser matters, is disposed not to 
subject his will even to the order of the last end, by choosing something 
that is a mortal sin in its genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial and mortal sin are not condivided in contrariety to 
one another, as though they were species of one genus, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), but as an accident is condivided with substance. Wherefore 
an accident can be a disposition to a substantial form, so can a venial 
sin dispose to mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Venial sin is not like mortal sin in species; but it is in 
genus, inasmuch as they both imply a defect of due order, albeit in 
different ways, as stated (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A good work is not, of itself, a disposition to mortal sin; 
but it can be the matter or occasion of mortal sin accidentally; whereas 
a venial sin, of its very nature, disposes to mortal sin, as stated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a venial sin can become mortal?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a venial sin can become a mortal sin. For 
Augustine in explaining the words of Jn. 3:36: "He that believeth not the 
Son, shall not see life," says (Tract. xii in Joan.): "The slightest," 
i.e. venial, "sins kill if we make little of them." Now a sin is called 
mortal through causing the spiritual death of the soul. Therefore a 
venial sin can become mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a movement in the sensuality before the consent of 
reason, is a venial sin, but after consent, is a mortal sin, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="FS074.html#FSQ74A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 2). Therefore a venial sin can become mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, venial and mortal sin differ as curable and incurable 
disease, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But a curable disease may become 
incurable. Therefore a venial sin may become mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a disposition may become a habit. Now venial sin is a 
disposition to mortal, as stated (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore a venial sin can 
become mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The fact of a venial sin becoming a mortal sin may be 
understood in three ways. First, so that the same identical act be at 
first a venial, and then a mortal sin. This is impossible: because a sin, 
like any moral act, consists chiefly in an act of the will: so that an 
act is not one morally, if the will be changed, although the act be 
continuous physically. If, however, the will be not changed, it is not 
possible for a venial sin to become mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this may be taken to mean that a sin generically venial, 
becomes mortal. This is possible, in so far as one may fix one's end in 
that venial sin, or direct it to some mortal sin as end, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this may be understood in the sense of many venial sins 
constituting one mortal sin. If this be taken as meaning that many venial 
sins added together make one mortal sin, it is false, because all the 
venial sins in the world cannot incur a debt of punishment equal to that 
of one mortal sin. This is evident as regards the duration of the 
punishment, since mortal sin incurs a debt of eternal punishment, while 
venial sin incurs a debt of temporal punishment, as stated above (<A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,5). It is also evident as regards the pain of loss, because mortal 
sins deserve to be punished by the privation of seeing God, to which no 
other punishment is comparable, as Chrysostom states (Hom. xxiv in 
Matth.). It is also evident as regards the pain of sense, as to the 
remorse of conscience; although as to the pain of fire, the punishments 
may perhaps not be improportionate to one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, this be taken as meaning that many venial sins make one 
mortal sin dispositively, it is true, as was shown above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) with 
regard to the two different manners of disposition, whereby venial sin 
disposes to mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is referring to the fact of many venial sins 
making one mortal sin dispositively.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same movement of the sensuality which preceded the 
consent of reason can never become a mortal sin; but the movement of the 
reason in consenting is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Disease of the body is not an act, but an abiding 
disposition; wherefore, while remaining the same disease, it may undergo 
change. On the other hand, venial sin is a transient act, which cannot be 
taken up again: so that in this respect the comparison fails. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A disposition that becomes a habit, is like an imperfect 
thing in the same species; thus imperfect science, by being perfected, 
becomes a habit. On the other hand, venial sin is a disposition to 
something differing generically, even as an accident which disposes to a 
substantial form, into which it is never changed.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a circumstance can make a venial sin to be mortal?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a circumstance can make a venial sin mortal. 
For Augustine says in a sermon on Purgatory (De Sanctis, serm. xli) that 
"if anger continue for a long time, or if drunkenness be frequent, they 
become mortal sins." But anger and drunkenness are not mortal but venial 
sins generically, else they would always be mortal sins. Therefore a 
circumstance makes a venial sin to be mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Master says ( Sentent. ii, D, 24) that delectation, 
if morose [*See Question [74], Article [6]], is a mortal sin, but that if it be not 
morose, it is a venial sin. Now moroseness is a circumstance. Therefore a 
circumstance makes a venial sin to be mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, evil and good differ more than venial and mortal sin, 
both of which are generically evil. But a circumstance makes a good act 
to be evil, as when a man gives an alms for vainglory. Much more, 
therefore, can it make a venial sin to be mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Since a circumstance is an accident, its quantity 
cannot exceed that of the act itself, derived from the act's genus, 
because the subject always excels its accident. If, therefore, an act be 
venial by reason of its genus, it cannot become mortal by reason of an 
accident: since, in a way, mortal sin infinitely surpasses the quantity 
of venial sin, as is evident from what has been said (<A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="FS087.html#FSQ87A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS007.html#FSQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="FS007.html#FSQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4; <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5ATHEP1">Articles [10]</a>,11), when we were treating of circumstances, a circumstance, as such, is 
an accident of the moral act: and yet a circumstance may happen to be 
taken as the specific difference of a moral act, and then it loses its 
nature of circumstance, and constitutes the species of the moral act. 
This happens in sins when a circumstance adds the deformity of another 
genus; thus when a man has knowledge of another woman than his wife, the 
deformity of his act is opposed to chastity; but if this other be another 
man's wife, there is an additional deformity opposed to justice which 
forbids one to take what belongs to another; and accordingly this 
circumstance constitutes a new species of sin known as adultery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, impossible for a circumstance to make a venial sin 
become mortal, unless it adds the deformity of another species.  For it 
has been stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that the deformity of a venial sin consists 
in a disorder affecting things that are referred to the end, whereas the 
deformity of a mortal sin consists in a disorder about the last end. 
Consequently it is evident that a circumstance cannot make a venial sin 
to be mortal, so long as it remains a circumstance, but only when it 
transfers the sin to another species, and becomes, as it were, the 
specific difference of the moral act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Length of time is not a circumstance that draws a sin to 
another species, nor is frequency or custom, except perhaps by something 
accidental supervening. For an action does not acquire a new species 
through being repeated or prolonged, unless by chance something supervene 
in the repeated or prolonged act to change its species, e.g. 
disobedience, contempt, or the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore reply to the objection by saying that since anger is a 
movement of the soul tending to the hurt of one's neighbor, if the angry 
movement tend to a hurt which is a mortal sin generically, such as murder 
or robbery, that anger will be a mortal sin generically: and if it be a 
venial sin, this will be due to the imperfection of the act, in so far as 
it is a sudden movement of the sensuality: whereas, if it last a long 
time, it returns to its generic nature, through the consent of reason. 
If, on the other hand, the hurt to which the angry movement tends, is a 
sin generically venial, for instance, if a man be angry with someone, so 
as to wish to say some trifling word in jest that would hurt him a 
little, the anger will not be mortal sin, however long it last, unless 
perhaps accidentally; for instance, if it were to give rise to great 
scandal or something of the kind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to drunkenness we reply that it is a mortal sin by reason of 
its genus; for, that a man, without necessity, and through the mere lust 
of wine, make himself unable to use his reason, whereby he is directed to 
God and avoids committing many sins, is expressly contrary to virtue. 
That it be a venial sin, is due some sort of ignorance or weakness, as 
when a man is ignorant of the strength of the wine, or of his own 
unfitness, so that he has no thought of getting drunk, for in that case 
the drunkenness is not imputed to him as a sin, but only the excessive 
drink. If, however, he gets drunk frequently, this ignorance no longer 
avails as an excuse, for his will seems to choose to give way to 
drunkenness rather than to refrain from excess of wine: wherefore the sin 
returns to its specific nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Morose delectation is not a mortal sin except in those 
matters which are mortal sins generically. In such matters, if the 
delectation be not morose, there is a venial sin through imperfection of 
the act, as we have said with regard to anger (ad 1): because anger is 
said to be lasting, and delectation to be morose, on account of the 
approval of the deliberating reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A circumstance does not make a good act to be evil, unless 
it constitute the species of a sin, as we have stated  above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a mortal sin can become venial?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a mortal sin can become venial. Because venial 
sin is equally distant from mortal, as mortal sin is from venial. But a 
venial sin can become mortal, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore also a 
mortal sin can become venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, venial and mortal sin are said to differ in this, that 
he who sins mortally loves a creature more than God, while he who sins 
venially loves the creature less than God. Now it may happen that a 
person in committing a sin generically mortal, loves a creature less than 
God; for instance, if anyone being ignorant that simple fornication is a 
mortal sin, and contrary to the love of God, commits the sin of 
fornication, yet so as to be ready, for the love of God, to refrain from 
that sin if he knew that by committing it he was acting counter to the 
love of God. Therefore his will be a venial sin; and accordingly a mortal 
sin can become venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, Objection [3]), good is more distant 
from evil, than venial from mortal sin. But an act which is evil in 
itself, can become good; thus to kill a man may be an act of justice, as 
when a judge condemns a thief to death. Much more therefore can a mortal 
sin become venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> An eternal thing can never become temporal. But mortal 
sin deserves eternal punishment, whereas venial sin deserves temporal 
punishment. Therefore a mortal sin can never become venial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Venial and mortal differ as perfect and imperfect in the 
genus of sin, as stated above (<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). Now the imperfect can become 
perfect, by some sort of addition: and, consequently, a venial sin can 
become mortal, by the addition of some deformity pertaining to the genus 
of mortal sin, as when a man utters an idle word for the purpose of 
fornication. On the other hand, the perfect cannot become imperfect, by 
addition; and so a mortal sin cannot become venial, by the addition of a 
deformity pertaining to the genus of venial sin, for the sin is not 
diminished if a man commit fornication in order to utter an idle word; 
rather is it aggravated by the additional deformity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless a sin which is generically mortal, can become venial by 
reason of the imperfection of the act, because then it does not 
completely fulfil the conditions of a moral act, since it is not a 
deliberate, but a sudden act, as is evident from what we have said above 
(<A Href="FS088.html#FSQ88A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). This happens by a kind of subtraction, namely, of deliberate 
reason. And since a moral act takes its species from deliberate reason, 
the result is that by such a subtraction the species of the act is 
destroyed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial differs from mortal as imperfect from perfect, even 
as a boy differs from a man. But the boy becomes a man and not vice 
versa. Hence the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the ignorance be such as to excuse sin altogether, as 
the ignorance of a madman or an imbecile, then he that commits 
fornication in a state of such ignorance, commits no sin either mortal or 
venial. But if the ignorance be not invincible, then the ignorance itself 
is a sin, and contains within itself the lack of the love of God, in so 
far as a man neglects to learn those things whereby he can safeguard 
himself in the love of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[88] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Contra Mendacium vii), "those things 
which are evil in themselves, cannot be well done for any good end." Now 
murder is the slaying of the innocent, and this can nowise be well done. 
But, as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. i, 4,5), the judge who sentences a 
thief to death, or the soldier who slays the enemy of the common weal, 
are not murderers.<br>
