</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider (1) what happiness is, and (2) what things are 
required for it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether happiness is something uncreated?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">(2)</a> If it be something created, whether it is an operation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is an operation of the sensitive, or only of the 
intellectual part?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A4THEP1">(4)</a> If it be an operation of the intellectual part, whether it is an 
operation of the intellect, or of the will?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A5THEP1">(5)</a> If it be an operation of the intellect, whether it is an operation 
of the speculative or of the practical intellect?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A6THEP1">(6)</a> If it be an operation of the speculative intellect, whether it 
consists in the consideration of speculative sciences?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether it consists in the consideration of separate substances viz. 
angels?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it consists in the sole contemplation of God seen in His 
Essence?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness is something uncreated. For Boethius 
says (De Consol. iii): "We must needs confess that God is happiness 
itself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, happiness is the supreme good. But it belongs to God to 
be the supreme good. Since, then, there are not several supreme goods, it 
seems that happiness is the same as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness is the last end, to which man's will tends 
naturally. But man's will should tend to nothing else as an end, but to 
God, Who alone is to be enjoyed, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 
5,22). Therefore happiness is the same as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing made is uncreated. But man's happiness is 
something made; because according to Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 3): 
"Those things are to be enjoyed which make us happy." Therefore happiness 
is not something uncreated. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), our end is 
twofold. First, there is the thing itself which we desire to attain: thus 
for the miser, the end is money. Secondly there is the attainment or 
possession, the use or enjoyment of the thing desired; thus we may say 
that the end of the miser is the possession of money; and the end of the 
intemperate man is to enjoy something pleasurable. In the first sense, 
then, man's last end is the uncreated good, namely, God, Who alone by His 
infinite goodness can perfectly satisfy man's will. But in the second 
way, man's last end is something created, existing in him, and this is 
nothing else than the attainment or enjoyment of the last end. Now the 
last end is called happiness. If, therefore, we consider man's happiness 
in its cause or object, then it is something uncreated; but if we 
consider it as to the very essence of happiness, then it is something 
created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God is happiness by His Essence: for He is happy not by 
acquisition or participation of something else, but by His Essence. On 
the other hand, men are happy, as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), by 
participation; just as they are called "gods," by participation. And this 
participation of happiness, in respect of which man is said to be happy, 
is something created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Happiness is called man's supreme good, because it is the 
attainment or enjoyment of the supreme good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Happiness is said to be the last end, in the same way as 
the attainment of the end is called the end.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness is not an operation. For the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A22">Rm. 6:22</a>): "You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, 
life everlasting." But life is not an operation, but the very being of 
living things. Therefore the last end, which is happiness, is not an 
operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iii) that happiness is "a 
state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things." But state does 
not indicate operation. Therefore happiness is not an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness signifies something existing in the happy one: 
since it is man's final perfection. But the meaning of operation does not 
imply anything existing in the operator, but rather something proceeding 
therefrom. Therefore happiness is not an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, happiness remains in the happy one. Now operation does 
not remain, but passes. Therefore happiness is not an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, to one man there is one happiness. But operations are 
many. Therefore happiness is not an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, happiness is in the happy one uninterruptedly. But human 
operation is often interrupted; for instance, by sleep, or some other 
occupation, or by cessation. Therefore happiness is not an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that "happiness is 
an operation according to perfect virtue."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In so far as man's happiness is something created, 
existing in him, we must needs say that it is an operation. For happiness 
is man's supreme perfection. Now each thing is perfect in so far as it is 
actual; since potentiality without act is imperfect. Consequently 
happiness must consist in man's last act. But it is evident that 
operation is the last act of the operator, wherefore the Philosopher 
calls it "second act" (De Anima ii, 1): because that which has a form can 
be potentially operating, just as he who knows is potentially 
considering. And hence it is that in other things, too, each one is said 
to be "for its operation" (De Coel ii, 3). Therefore man's happiness must 
of necessity consist in an operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Life is taken in two senses. First for the very being of 
the living. And thus happiness is not life: since it has been shown (<A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) that the being of a man, no matter in what it may consist, is not 
that man's happiness; for of God alone is it true that His Being is His 
Happiness. Secondly, life means the operation of the living, by which 
operation the principle of life is made actual: thus we speak of active 
and contemplative life, or of a life of pleasure. And in this sense 
eternal life is said to be the last end, as is clear from Jn. 17:3: "This 
is eternal life, that they may know Thee, the only true God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Boethius, in defining happiness, considered happiness in 
general: for considered thus it is the perfect common good; and he 
signified this by saying that happiness is "a state made perfect by the 
aggregate of all good things," thus implying that the state of a happy 
man consists in possessing the perfect good. But Aristotle expressed the 
very essence of happiness, showing by what man is established in this 
state, and that it is by some kind of operation. And so it is that he 
proves happiness to be "the perfect good" (Ethic. i, 7).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated in Metaph. ix, 7 action is twofold. One proceeds 
from the agent into outward matter, such as "to burn" and "to cut." And 
such an operation cannot be happiness: for such an operation is an action 
and a perfection, not of the agent, but rather of the patient, as is 
stated in the same passage. The other is an action that remains in the 
agent, such as to feel, to understand, and to will: and such an action is 
a perfection and an act of the agent. And such an operation can be 
happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since happiness signifies some final perfection; according 
as various things capable of happiness can attain to various degrees of 
perfection, so must there be various meanings applied to happiness. For 
in God there is happiness essentially; since His very Being is His 
operation, whereby He enjoys no other than Himself. In the happy angels, 
the final perfection is in respect of some operation, by which they are 
united to the Uncreated Good: and this operation of theirs is one only 
and everlasting. But in men, according to their present state of life, 
the final perfection is in respect of an operation whereby man is united 
to God: but this operation neither can be continual, nor, consequently, 
is it one only, because operation is multiplied by being discontinued. 
And for this reason in the present state of life, perfect happiness 
cannot be attained by man. Wherefore the Philosopher, in placing man's 
happiness in this life (Ethic. i, 10), says that it is imperfect, and 
after a long discussion, concludes: "We call men happy, but only as men." 
But God has promised us perfect happiness, when we shall be "as the 
angels . . . in heaven" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++22%3A30">Mt. 22:30</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently in regard to this perfect happiness, the objection fails: 
because in that state of happiness, man's mind will be united to God by 
one, continual, everlasting operation. But in the present life, in as far 
as we fall short of the unity and continuity of that operation so do we 
fall short of perfect happiness. Nevertheless it is a participation of 
happiness: and so much the greater, as the operation can be more 
continuous and more one. Consequently the active life, which is busy with 
many things, has less of happiness than the contemplative life, which is 
busied with one thing, i.e. the contemplation of truth. And if at any 
time man is not actually engaged in this operation, yet since he can 
always easily turn to it, and since he ordains the very cessation, by 
sleeping or occupying himself otherwise, to the aforesaid occupation, the 
latter seems, as it were, continuous. From these remarks the replies to 
Objections 5 and 6 are evident.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether happiness is an operation of the sensitive part, or of the intellective part only?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness consists in an operation of the 
senses also. For there is no more excellent operation in man than that of 
the senses, except the intellective operation. But in us the intellective 
operation depends on the sensitive: since "we cannot understand without a 
phantasm" (De Anima iii, 7). Therefore happiness consists in an operation 
of the senses also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iii) that happiness is "a 
state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things." But some goods 
are sensible, which we attain by the operation of the senses. Therefore 
it seems that the operation of the senses is needed for happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness is the perfect good, as we find  proved in 
Ethic. i, 7: which would not be true, were not man perfected thereby in 
all his parts. But some parts of the soul are perfected by sensitive 
operations. Therefore sensitive operation is required for happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Irrational animals have the sensitive operation in 
common with us: but they have not happiness in common with us. Therefore 
happiness does not consist in a sensitive operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may belong to happiness in three ways: (1) 
essentially, (2) antecedently, (3) consequently. Now the operation of 
sense cannot belong to happiness essentially. For man's happiness 
consists essentially in his being united to the Uncreated Good, Which is 
his last end, as shown above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): to Which man cannot be united by an 
operation of his senses. Again, in like manner, because, as shown above 
(<A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), man's happiness does not consist in goods of the body, 
which goods alone, however, we attain through the operation of the senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless the operations of the senses can belong to happiness, both 
antecedently and consequently: antecedently, in respect of imperfect 
happiness, such as can be had in this life, since the operation of the 
intellect demands a previous operation of the sense; consequently, in 
that perfect happiness which we await in heaven; because at the 
resurrection, "from the very happiness of the soul," as Augustine says 
(Ep. ad Dioscor.) "the body and the bodily senses will receive a certain 
overflow, so as to be perfected in their operations"; a point which will 
be explained further on when we treat of the resurrection (<A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [82]</a>-85). But then the operation whereby man's mind is united to God will not 
depend on the senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection proves that the operation of the senses is 
required antecedently for imperfect happiness, such as can be had in this 
life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Perfect happiness, such as the angels have, includes the 
aggregate of all good things, by being united to the universal source of 
all good; not that it requires each individual good. But in this 
imperfect happiness, we need the aggregate of those goods that suffice 
for the most perfect operation of this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In perfect happiness the entire man is perfected, in the 
lower part of his nature, by an overflow from the higher. But in the 
imperfect happiness of this life, it is otherwise; we advance from the 
perfection of the lower part to the perfection of the higher part.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness consists in an act of the will. For 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 10,11), that man's happiness consists in 
peace; wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++147%3A3">Ps. 147:3</a>): "Who hath placed peace in thy 
end [Douay: 'borders']". But peace pertains to the will. Therefore man's 
happiness is in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, happiness is the supreme good. But good is the object of 
the will. Therefore happiness consists in an operation of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the last end corresponds to the first mover: thus the 
last end of the whole army is victory, which is the end of the general, 
who moves all the men. But the first mover in regard to operations is the 
will: because it moves the other powers, as we shall state further on 
(<A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="FS009.html#FSQ9ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). Therefore happiness regards the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if happiness be an operation, it must needs be man's 
most excellent operation. But the love of God, which is an act of the 
will, is a more excellent operation than knowledge, which is an operation 
of the intellect, as the Apostle declares (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13">1 Cor. 13</a>). Therefore it seems 
that happiness consists in an act of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that "happy is he who 
has whatever he desires, and desires nothing amiss." And a little further 
on (6) he adds: "He is most happy who desires well, whatever he desires: 
for good things make a man happy, and such a man already possesses some 
good---i.e. a good will." Therefore happiness consists in an act of the 
will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++17%3A3">Jn. 17:3</a>): "This is eternal life: that 
they may know Thee, the only true God." Now eternal life is the last end, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). Therefore man's happiness consists in the 
knowledge of God, which is an act of the intellect.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) two things are needed for 
happiness: one, which is the essence of happiness: the other, that is, as 
it were, its proper accident, i.e. the delight connected with it. I say, 
then, that as to the very essence of happiness, it is impossible for it 
to consist in an act of the will. For it is evident from what has been 
said (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2; <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>) that happiness is the attainment of the last 
end. But the attainment of the end does not consist in the very act of 
the will. For the will is directed to the end, both absent, when it 
desires it; and present, when it is delighted by resting therein. Now it 
is evident that the desire itself of the end is not the attainment of the 
end, but is a movement towards the end: while delight comes to the will 
from the end being present; and not conversely, is a thing made present, 
by the fact that the will delights in it. Therefore, that the end be 
present to him who desires it, must be due to something else than an act 
of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Body Para. 2/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is evidently the case in regard to sensible ends. For if the 
acquisition of money were through an act of the will, the covetous man 
would have it from the very moment that he wished for it. But at the 
moment it is far from him; and he attains it, by grasping it in his hand, 
or in some like manner; and then he delights in the money got. And so it 
is with an intelligible end. For at first we desire to attain an 
intelligible end; we attain it, through its being made present to us by 
an act of the intellect; and then the delighted will rests in the end 
when attained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, therefore, the essence of happiness consists in an act of the 
intellect: but the delight that results from happiness pertains to the 
will. In this sense Augustine says (Confess. x, 23) that happiness is 
"joy in truth," because, to wit, joy itself is the consummation of 
happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Peace pertains to man's last end, not as though it were the 
very essence of happiness; but because it is antecedent and consequent 
thereto: antecedent, in so far as all those things are removed which 
disturb and hinder man in attaining the last end: consequent inasmuch as 
when man has attained his last end, he remains at peace, his desire being 
at rest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will's first object is not its act: just as neither is 
the first object of the sight, vision, but a visible thing. Wherefore, 
from the very fact that happiness belongs to the will, as the will's 
first object, it follows that it does not belong to it as its act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellect apprehends the end before the will does: yet 
motion towards the end begins in the will. And therefore to the will 
belongs that which last of all follows the attainment of the end, viz. 
delight or enjoyment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Love ranks above knowledge in moving, but knowledge 
precedes love in attaining: for "naught is loved save what is known," as 
Augustine says (De Trin. x, 1). Consequently we first attain an 
intelligible end by an act of the intellect; just as we first attain a 
sensible end by an act of sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> He who has whatever he desires, is happy, because he has 
what he desires: and this indeed is by something other than the act of 
his will. But to desire nothing amiss is needed for happiness, as a 
necessary disposition thereto. And a good will is reckoned among the good 
things which make a man happy, forasmuch as it is an inclination of the 
will: just as a movement is reduced to the genus of its terminus, for 
instance, "alteration" to the genus "quality."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether happiness is an operation of the speculative, or of the practical intellect?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that happiness is an operation of the  practical 
intellect. For the end of every creature consists in becoming like God. 
But man is like God, by his practical intellect, which is the cause of 
things understood, rather than by his speculative intellect, which 
derives its knowledge from things. Therefore man's happiness consists in 
an operation of the practical intellect rather than of the speculative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, happiness is man's perfect good. But the practical 
intellect is ordained to the good rather than the speculative intellect, 
which is ordained to the true. Hence we are said to be good, in reference 
to the perfection of the practical intellect, but not in reference to the 
perfection of the speculative intellect, according to which we are said 
to be knowing or understanding. Therefore man's happiness consists in an 
act of the practical intellect rather than of the speculative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness is a good of man himself. But the speculative 
intellect is more concerned with things outside man; whereas the 
practical intellect is concerned with things belonging to man himself, 
viz. his operations and passions. Therefore man's happiness consists in 
an operation of the practical intellect rather than of the speculative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. i, 8) that "contemplation is 
promised us, as being the goal of all our actions, and the everlasting 
perfection of our joys."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Happiness consists in an operation of the speculative 
rather than of the practical intellect. This is evident for three 
reasons. First because if man's happiness is an operation, it must needs 
be man's highest operation. Now man's highest operation is that of his 
highest power in respect of its highest object: and his highest power is 
the intellect, whose highest object is the Divine Good, which is the 
object, not of the practical but of the speculative intellect. 
Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in 
the contemplation of Divine things. And since that "seems to be each 
man's self, which is best in him," according to Ethic. ix, 8, and x, 7, 
therefore such an operation is most proper to man and most delightful to 
him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is evident from the fact that contemplation is sought 
principally for its own sake. But the act of the practical intellect is 
not sought for its own sake but for the sake of action: and these very 
actions are ordained to some end. Consequently it is evident that the 
last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the 
practical intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it is again evident, from the fact that in the contemplative 
life man has something in common with things above him, viz. with God and 
the angels, to whom he is made like by happiness. But in things 
pertaining to the active life, other animals also have something in 
common with man, although imperfectly. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to 
come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such 
as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, and secondarily in an operation of 
the practical intellect directing human actions and passions, as stated 
in Ethic. x, 7,8.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The asserted likeness of the practical intellect to God is 
one of proportion; that is to say, by reason of its standing in relation 
to what it knows, as God does to what He knows. But the likeness of the 
speculative intellect to God is one of union and "information"; which is 
a much greater likeness. And yet it may be answered that, in regard to 
the principal thing known, which is His Essence, God has not practical 
but merely speculative knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The practical intellect is ordained to good which is 
outside of it: but the speculative intellect has good within it, viz. the 
contemplation of truth. And if this good be perfect, the whole man is 
perfected and made good thereby: such a good the practical intellect has 
not; but it directs man thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument would hold, if man himself were his own last 
end; for then the consideration and direction of his actions and passions 
would be his happiness. But since man's last end is something outside of 
him, to wit, God, to Whom we reach out by an operation of the speculative 
intellect; therefore, man's happiness consists in an operation of the 
speculative intellect rather than of the practical intellect.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether happiness consists in the consideration of speculative sciences?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in the consideration 
of speculative sciences. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that 
"happiness is an operation according to perfect virtue." And in 
distinguishing the virtues, he gives no more than three speculative 
virtues---"knowledge," "wisdom" and "understanding," which all belong to 
the consideration of speculative sciences. Therefore man's final 
happiness consists in the consideration of speculative sciences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which all desire for its own sake, seems to be 
man's final happiness. Now such is the consideration of speculative 
sciences; because, as stated in Metaph. i, 1, "all men naturally desire 
to know"; and, a little farther on (2), it is stated that speculative 
sciences are sought for their own sakes. Therefore happiness consists in 
the consideration of speculative sciences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, happiness is man's final perfection. Now everything is 
perfected, according as it is reduced from potentiality to act. But the 
human intellect is reduced to act by  the consideration of speculative 
sciences. Therefore it seems that in the consideration of these sciences, 
man's final happiness consists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++9%3A23">Jer. 9:23</a>): "Let not the wise man glory 
in his wisdom": and this is said in reference to speculative sciences. 
Therefore man's final happiness does not consist in the consideration of 
these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4), man's happiness is twofold, 
one perfect, the other imperfect. And by perfect happiness we are to 
understand that which attains to the true notion of happiness; and by 
imperfect happiness that which does not attain thereto, but partakes of 
some particular likeness of happiness. Thus perfect prudence is in man, 
with whom is the idea of things to be done; while imperfect prudence is 
in certain irrational animals, who are possessed of certain particular 
instincts in respect of works similar to works of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly perfect happiness cannot consist essentially in the 
consideration of speculative sciences. To prove this, we must observe 
that the consideration of a speculative science does not extend beyond 
the scope of the principles of that science: since the entire science is 
virtually contained in its principles. Now the first principles of 
speculative sciences are received through the senses, as the Philosopher 
clearly states at the beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 1), and at the end 
of the Posterior Analytics (ii, 15). Wherefore the entire consideration 
of speculative sciences cannot extend farther than knowledge of sensibles 
can lead. Now man's final happiness, which is his final perfection cannot 
consist in the knowledge of sensibles. For a thing is not perfected by 
something lower, except in so far as the lower partakes of something 
higher. Now it is evident that the form of a stone or of any sensible, is 
lower than man. Consequently the intellect is not perfected by the form 
of a stone, as such, but inasmuch as it partakes of a certain likeness to 
that which is above the human intellect, viz. the intelligible light, or 
something of the kind. Now whatever is by something else is reduced to 
that which is of itself. Therefore man's final perfection must needs be 
through knowledge of something above the human intellect. But it has been 
shown (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP088.html#FPQ88OUTP1">Question [88]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP088.html#FPQ88A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), that man cannot acquire through sensibles, the 
knowledge of separate substances, which are above the human intellect. 
Consequently it follows that man's happiness cannot consist in the 
consideration of speculative sciences. However, just as in sensible forms 
there is a participation of the higher substances, so the consideration 
of speculative sciences is a certain participation of true and perfect 
happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In his book on Ethics the Philosopher treats of imperfect 
happiness, such as can be had in this life, as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not only is perfect happiness naturally desired,  but also 
any likeness or participation thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our intellect is reduced to act, in a fashion, by the 
consideration of speculative sciences, but not to its final and perfect 
act.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness consists in the knowledge of 
separate substances, namely, angels. For Gregory says in a homily (xxvi 
in Evang.): "It avails nothing to take part in the feasts of men, if we 
fail to take part in the feasts of angels"; by which he means final 
happiness. But we can take part in the feasts of the angels by 
contemplating them. Therefore it seems that man's final happiness 
consists in contemplating the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the final perfection of each thing is for it to be 
united to its principle: wherefore a circle is said to be a perfect 
figure, because its beginning and end coincide. But the beginning of 
human knowledge is from the angels, by whom men are enlightened, as 
Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv). Therefore the perfection of the human 
intellect consists in contemplating the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, each nature is perfect, when united to a higher nature; 
just as the final perfection of a body is to be united to the spiritual 
nature. But above the human intellect, in the natural order, are the 
angels. Therefore the final perfection of the human intellect is to be 
united to the angels by contemplation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++9%3A24">Jer. 9:24</a>): "Let him that glorieth, 
glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me." Therefore man's 
final glory or happiness consists only in the knowledge of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), man's perfect happiness consists 
not in that which perfects the intellect by some participation, but in 
that which is so by its essence. Now it is evident that whatever is the 
perfection of a power is so in so far as the proper formal object of that 
power belongs to it. Now the proper object of the intellect is the true. 
Therefore the contemplation of whatever has participated truth, does not 
perfect the intellect with its final perfection. Since, therefore, the 
order of things is the same in being and in truth (Metaph ii, 1); 
whatever are beings by participation, are true by participation. Now 
angels have being by participation: because in God alone is His Being His 
Essence, as shown in the FP, Question [44], Article [1]. It follows that contemplation 
of Him makes man perfectly happy. However, there is no reason why we 
should not admit a certain imperfect happiness in the contemplation of 
the angels; and higher indeed than in the consideration of speculative 
science. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We shall take part in the feasts of the angels, by 
contemplating not only the angels, but, together with them, also God 
Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to those that hold human souls to be created by 
the angels, it seems fitting enough, that man's happiness should consist 
in the contemplation of the angels, in the union, as it were, of man with 
his beginning. But this is erroneous, as stated in FP, Question [90], Article [3]. 
Wherefore the final perfection of the human intellect is by union with 
God, Who is the first principle both of the creation of the soul and of 
its enlightenment. Whereas the angel enlightens as a minister, as stated 
in the FP, Question [111], Article [2], ad 2. Consequently, by his ministration he helps 
man to attain to happiness; but he is not the object of man's happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The lower nature may reach the higher in two ways. First, 
according to a degree of the participating power: and thus man's final 
perfection will consist in his attaining to a contemplation such as that 
of the angels. Secondly, as the object is attained by the power: and thus 
the final perfection of each power is to attain that in which is found 
the fulness of its formal object.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man's happiness consists in the vision of the divine essence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man's happiness does not consist in the vision 
of the Divine Essence. For Dionysius says (Myst. Theol. i) that by that 
which is highest in his intellect, man is united to God as to something 
altogether unknown. But that which is seen in its essence is not 
altogether unknown. Therefore the final perfection of the intellect, 
namely, happiness, does not consist in God being seen in His Essence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the higher the perfection belongs to the higher nature. 
But to see His own Essence is the perfection proper to the Divine 
intellect. Therefore the final perfection of the human intellect does not 
reach to this, but consists in something less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3%3A2">1 Jn. 3:2</a>): "When He shall appear, we 
shall be like to Him; and [Vulg.: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Final and perfect happiness can consist in nothing else 
than the vision of the Divine Essence. To make this clear, two points 
must be observed. First, that man is not perfectly happy, so long as 
something remains for him to desire and seek: secondly, that the 
perfection of any power is determined by the nature of its object. Now 
the object of the intellect is "what a thing is," i.e. the essence of a 
thing, according to De Anima  iii, 6. Wherefore the intellect attains 
perfection, in so far as it knows the essence of a thing. If therefore an 
intellect knows the essence of some effect, whereby it is not possible to 
know the essence of the cause, i.e. to know of the cause "what it is"; 
that intellect cannot be said to reach that cause simply, although it may 
be able to gather from the effect the knowledge of that the cause is. 
Consequently, when man knows an effect, and knows that it has a cause, 
there naturally remains in the man the desire to know about the cause, 
"what it is." And this desire is one of wonder, and causes inquiry, as is 
stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics (i, 2). For instance, if a 
man, knowing the eclipse of the sun, consider that it must be due to some 
cause, and know not what that cause is, he wonders about it, and from 
wondering proceeds to inquire. Nor does this inquiry cease until he 
arrive at a knowledge of the essence of the cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If therefore the human intellect, knowing the essence of some created 
effect, knows no more of God than "that He is"; the perfection of that 
intellect does not yet reach simply the First Cause, but there remains in 
it the natural desire to seek the cause. Wherefore it is not yet 
perfectly happy. Consequently, for perfect happiness the intellect needs 
to reach the very Essence of the First Cause. And thus it will have its 
perfection through union with God as with that object, in which alone 
man's happiness consists, as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,7; <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius speaks of the knowledge of wayfarers journeying 
towards happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[3] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the end has a twofold 
acceptation. First, as to the thing itself which is desired: and in this 
way, the same thing is the end of the higher and of the lower nature, and 
indeed of all things, as stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Secondly, as to the 
attainment of this thing; and thus the end of the higher nature is 
different from that of the lower, according to their respective habitudes 
to that thing. So then in the happiness of God, Who, in understanding his 
Essence, comprehends It, is higher than that of a man or angel who sees 
It indeed, but comprehends It not.<br>
