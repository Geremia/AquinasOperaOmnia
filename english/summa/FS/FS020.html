the external action?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that good and evil are in the external action prior 
to being in the act of the will. For the will derives goodness from its 
object, as stated above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). But the external action is the 
object of the interior act of the will: for a man is said to will to 
commit a theft, or to will to give an alms. Therefore good and evil are 
in the external action, prior to being in the act of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the aspect of good belongs first to the end: since what 
is directed to the end receives the aspect of good from its relation to 
the end. Now whereas the act of the will cannot be an end, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), the act of another power can be an end. 
Therefore good is in the act of some other power prior to being in the 
act of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the act of the will stands in a formal relation to the 
external action, as stated above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But that which is formal 
is subsequent; since form is something added to matter. Therefore good 
and evil are in the external action, prior to being in the act of the 
will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Retract. i, 9) that "it is by the will 
that we sin, and that we behave aright." Therefore moral good and evil 
are first in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> External actions may be said to be good or bad in two 
ways. First, in regard to their genus, and the circumstances connected 
with them: thus the giving of alms, if the required conditions be 
observed, is said to be good. Secondly, a thing is said to be good or 
evil, from its relation to the end: thus the giving of alms for vainglory 
is said to be evil. Now, since the end is the will's proper object, it is 
evident that this aspect of good or evil, which the external action 
derives from its relation to the end, is to be found first of all in the 
act of the will, whence it passes to the external action. On the other 
hand, the goodness or malice which the external action has of itself, on 
account of its  being about due matter and its being attended by due 
circumstances, is not derived from the will, but rather from the reason. 
Consequently, if we consider the goodness of the external action, in so 
far as it comes from reason's ordination and apprehension, it is prior to 
the goodness of the act of the will: but if we consider it in so far as 
it is in the execution of the action done, it is subsequent to the 
goodness of the will, which is its principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The exterior action is the object of the will, inasmuch as 
it is proposed to the will by the reason, as good apprehended and 
ordained by the reason: and thus it is prior to the good in the act of 
the will. But inasmuch as it is found in the execution of the action, it 
is an effect of the will, and is subsequent to the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The end precedes in the order of intention, but follows in 
the order of execution.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A form as received into matter, is subsequent to matter in 
the order of generation, although it precedes it in the order of nature: 
but inasmuch as it is in the active cause, it precedes in every way. Now 
the will is compared to the exterior action, as its efficient cause. 
Wherefore the goodness of the act of the will, as existing in the active 
cause, is the form of the exterior action.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the whole goodness and malice of the external action depends on the goodness of the will?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the whole goodness and malice of the external 
action depend on the goodness of the will. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++7:18">Mt. 7:18</a>): 
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree 
bring forth good fruit." But, according to the gloss, the tree signifies 
the will, and fruit signifies works. Therefore, it is impossible for the 
interior act of the will to be good, and the external action evil, or 
vice versa.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Retract. i, 9) that there is no sin 
without the will. If therefore there is no sin in the will, there will be 
none in the external action. And so the whole goodness or malice of the 
external action depends on the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good and evil of which we are speaking now are 
differences of the moral act. Now differences make an essential division 
in a genus, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vii, 12). Since 
therefore an act is moral from being voluntary, it seems that goodness 
and malice in an act are derived from the will alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Mendac. vii), that "there are 
some actions which neither a good end nor a good will can make good."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), we may consider a twofold  
goodness or malice in the external action: one in respect of due matter 
and circumstances; the other in respect of the order to the end. And that 
which is in respect of the order to the end, depends entirely on the 
will: while that which is in respect of due matter or circumstances, 
depends on the reason: and on this goodness depends the goodness of the 
will, in so far as the will tends towards it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it must be observed, as was noted above (<A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FS019.html#FSQ19A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1), that 
for a thing to be evil, one single defect suffices, whereas, for it to be 
good simply, it is not enough for it to be good in one point only, it 
must be good in every respect. If therefore the will be good, both from 
its proper object and from its end, if follows that the external action 
is good. But if the will be good from its intention of the end, this is 
not enough to make the external action good: and if the will be evil 
either by reason of its intention of the end, or by reason of the act 
willed, it follows that the external action is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If the good tree be taken to signify the good will, it must 
be in so far as the will derives goodness from the act willed and from 
the end intended.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man sins by his will, not only when he wills an evil end; 
but also when he wills an evil act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Voluntariness applies not only to the interior act of the 
will, but also to external actions, inasmuch as they proceed from the 
will and the reason. Consequently the difference of good and evil is 
applicable to both the interior and external act.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the goodness and malice of the external action are the same as those of the interior act?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goodness and malice of the interior act of 
the will are not the same as those of the external action. For the 
principle of the interior act is the interior apprehensive or appetitive 
power of the soul; whereas the principle of the external action is the 
power that accomplishes the movement. Now where the principles of action 
are different, the actions themselves are different. Moreover, it is the 
action which is the subject of goodness or malice: and the same accident 
cannot be in different subjects. Therefore the goodness of the interior 
act cannot be the same as that of the external action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "A virtue makes that, which has it, good, and renders 
its action good also" (Ethic. ii, 6). But the intellective virtue in the 
commanding power is distinct from the moral virtue in the power 
commanded, as is declared in Ethic. i, 13. Therefore the goodness of the 
interior act, which belongs to the commanding power, is distinct from the 
goodness of the external action, which belongs to the power commanded. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be cause and effect; since nothing 
is its own cause. But the goodness of the interior act is the cause of 
the goodness of the external action, or vice versa, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore it is not the same goodness in each.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It was shown above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) that the act of the 
will is the form, as it were, of the external action. Now that which 
results from the material and formal element is one thing. Therefore 
there is but one goodness of the internal and external act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the interior act of the 
will, and the external action, considered morally, are one act. Now it 
happens sometimes that one and the same individual act has several 
aspects of goodness or malice, and sometimes that it has but one. Hence 
we must say that sometimes the goodness or malice of the interior act is 
the same as that of the external action, and sometimes not. For as we 
have already said (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), these two goodnesses or malices, of the 
internal and external acts, are ordained to one another. Now it may 
happen, in things that are subordinate to something else, that a thing is 
good merely from being subordinate; thus a bitter draught is good merely 
because it procures health. Wherefore there are not two goodnesses, one 
the goodness of health, and the other the goodness of the draught; but 
one and the same. On the other hand it happens sometimes that that which 
is subordinate to something else, has some aspect of goodness in itself, 
besides the fact of its being subordinate to some other good: thus a 
palatable medicine can be considered in the light of a pleasurable good, 
besides being conducive to health.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore say that when the external action derives goodness or 
malice from its relation to the end only, then there is but one and the 
same goodness of the act of the will which of itself regards the end, and 
of the external action, which regards the end through the medium of the 
act of the will. But when the external action has goodness or malice of 
itself, i.e. in regard to its matter and circumstances, then the goodness 
of the external action is distinct from the goodness of the will in 
regarding the end; yet so that the goodness of the end passes into the 
external action, and the goodness of the matter and circumstances passes 
into the act of the will, as stated above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that the internal and external actions 
are different in the physical order: yet distinct as they are in that 
respect, they combine to form one thing in the moral order, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in Ethic. vi, 12, a moral virtue is ordained to 
the act of that virtue, which act is the end, as it were, of that virtue; 
whereas prudence, which is in the reason, is ordained to things directed 
to the end. For this reason various virtues are necessary. But right 
reason in regard to the very end  of a virtue has no other goodness than 
the goodness of that virtue, in so far as the goodness of the reason is 
participated in each virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When a thing is derived by one thing from another, as from 
a univocal efficient cause, then it is not the same in both: thus when a 
hot thing heats, the heat of the heater is distinct from the heat of the 
thing heated, although it be the same specifically. But when a thing is 
derived from one thing from another, according to analogy or proportion, 
then it is one and the same in both: thus the healthiness which is in 
medicine or urine is derived from the healthiness of the animal's body; 
nor is health as applied to urine and medicine, distinct from health as 
applied to the body of an animal, of which health medicine is the cause, 
and urine the sign. It is in this way that the goodness of the external 
action is derived from the goodness of the will, and vice versa; viz. 
according to the order of one to the other.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the external action adds any goodness or malice to that of the interior act?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the external action does not add any goodness 
or malice to that of the interior action. For Chrysostom says (Hom. xix 
in Mt.): "It is the will that is rewarded for doing good, or punished for 
doing evil." Now works are the witnesses of the will. Therefore God seeks 
for works not on His own account, in order to know how to judge; but for 
the sake of others, that all may understand how just He is. But good or 
evil is to be estimated according to God's judgment rather than according 
to the judgment of man. Therefore the external action adds no goodness or 
malice to that of the interior act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the goodness and malice of the interior and external 
acts are one and the same, as stated above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But increase is the 
addition of one thing to another. Therefore the external action does not 
add to the goodness or malice of the interior act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the entire goodness of created things does not add to 
the Divine Goodness, because it is entirely derived therefrom. But 
sometimes the entire goodness of the external action is derived from the 
goodness of the interior act, and sometimes conversely, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore neither of them adds to the goodness or malice of 
the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Every agent intends to attain good and avoid evil. If 
therefore by the external action no further goodness or malice be added, 
it is to no purpose that he who has a good or an evil will, does a good 
deed or refrains from an evil deed. Which is unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of the goodness which the external action 
derives from the will tending to the end, then the external  action adds 
nothing to this goodness, unless it happens that the will in itself is 
made better in good things, or worse in evil things. This, seemingly, may 
happen in three ways. First in point of number; if, for instance, a man 
wishes to do something with a good or an evil end in view, and does not 
do it then, but afterwards wills and does it, the act of his will is 
doubled and a double good, or a double evil is the result. Secondly, in 
point of extension: when, for instance, a man wishes to do something for 
a good or an evil end, and is hindered by some obstacle, whereas another 
man perseveres in the movement of the will until he accomplish it in 
deed; it is evident that the will of the latter is more lasting in good 
or evil, and in this respect, is better or worse. Thirdly, in point of 
intensity: for these are certain external actions, which, in so far as 
they are pleasurable, or painful, are such as naturally to make the will 
more intense or more remiss; and it is evident that the more intensely 
the will tends to good or evil, the better or worse it is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if we speak of the goodness which the external action 
derives from its matter and due circumstances, thus it stands in relation 
to the will as its term and end. And in this way it adds to the goodness 
or malice of the will; because every inclination or movement is perfected 
by attaining its end or reaching its term. Wherefore the will is not 
perfect, unless it be such that, given the opportunity, it realizes the 
operation. But if this prove impossible, as long as the will is perfect, 
so as to realize the operation if it could; the lack of perfection 
derived from the external action, is simply involuntary. Now just as the 
involuntary deserves neither punishment nor reward in the accomplishment 
of good or evil deeds, so neither does it lessen reward or punishment, if 
a man through simple involuntariness fail to do good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Chrysostom is speaking of the case where a man's will is 
complete, and does not refrain from the deed save through the 
impossibility of achievement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument applies to that goodness which the external 
action derives from the will as tending to the end. But the goodness 
which the external action takes from its matter and circumstances, is 
distinct from that which it derives from the end; but it is not distinct 
from that which it has from the very act willed, to which it stands in 
the relation of measure and cause, as stated above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this the reply to the Third Objection is evident.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the consequences of the external action 
increase its goodness or malice. For the effect pre-exists virtually in 
its cause. But the consequences result from the action  as an effect from 
its cause. Therefore they pre-exist virtually in actions. Now a thing is 
judged to be good or bad according to its virtue, since a virtue "makes 
that which has it to be good" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore the consequences 
increase the goodness or malice of an action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the good actions of his hearers are consequences 
resulting from the words of a preacher. But such goods as these redound 
to the merit of the preacher, as is evident from Phil. 4:1: "My dearly 
beloved brethren, my joy and my crown." Therefore the consequences of an 
action increase its goodness or malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, punishment is not increased, unless the fault increases: 
wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25:2">Dt. 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of the sin 
shall the measure also of the stripes be." But the punishment is 
increased on account of the consequences; for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++21:29">Ex. 21:29</a>): 
"But if the ox was wont to push with his horn yesterday and the day 
before, and they warned his master, and he did not shut him up, and he 
shall kill a man or a woman, then the ox shall be stoned, and his owner 
also shall be put to death." But he would not have been put to death, if 
the ox, although he had not been shut up, had not killed a man. Therefore 
the consequences increase the goodness or malice of an action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if a man do something which may cause death, by 
striking, or by sentencing, and if death does not ensue, he does not 
contract irregularity: but he would if death were to ensue. Therefore the 
consequence of an action increase its goodness or malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The consequences do not make an action that was evil, 
to be good; nor one that was good, to be evil. For instance, if a man 
give an alms to a poor man who makes bad use of the alms by committing a 
sin, this does not undo the good done by the giver; and, in like manner, 
if a man bear patiently a wrong done to him, the wrongdoer is not thereby 
excused. Therefore the consequences of an action doe not increase its 
goodness or malice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The consequences of an action are either foreseen or not. 
If they are foreseen, it is evident that they increase the goodness or 
malice. For when a man foresees that many evils may follow from his 
action, and yet does not therefore desist therefrom, this shows his will 
to be all the more inordinate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the consequences are not foreseen, we must make a distinction. 
Because if they follow from the nature of the action and in the majority 
of cases, in this respect, the consequences increase the goodness or 
malice of that action: for it is evident that an action is specifically 
better, if better results can follow from it; and specifically worse, if 
it is of a nature to produce worse results. On the other hand, if the 
consequences follow by accident and seldom, then they do not increase the 
goodness or malice of the action: because we do not judge of a thing 
according  to that which belongs to it by accident, but only according to 
that which belongs to it of itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The virtue of a cause is measured by the effect that flows 
from the nature of the cause, not by that which results by accident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good actions done by the hearers, result from the 
preacher's words, as an effect that flows from their very nature. Hence 
they redound to the merit of the preacher: especially when such is his 
intention.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The consequences for which that man is ordered to be 
punished, both follow from the nature of the cause, and are supposed to 
be foreseen. For this reason they are reckoned as punishable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument would prove if irregularity were the result 
of the fault. But it is not the result of the fault, but of the fact, and 
of the obstacle to the reception of a sacrament.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one and the same external action can be both good and evil?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one and the same external action can be both 
good and evil. For "movement, if continuous, is one and the same" (Phys. 
v, 4). But one continuous movement can be both good and bad: for 
instance, a man may go to church continuously, intending at first 
vainglory, and afterwards the service of God. Therefore one and the same 
action can be both good and bad.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iii, 3), action and 
passion are one act. But the passion may be good, as Christ's was; and 
the action evil, as that of the Jews. Therefore one and the same act can 
be both good and evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since a servant is an instrument, as it were, of his 
master, the servant's action is his master's, just as the action of a 
tool is the workman's action. But it may happen that the servant's action 
result from his master's good will, and is therefore good: and from the 
evil will of the servant, and is therefore evil. Therefore the same 
action can be both good and evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The same thing cannot be the subject of contraries. But 
good and evil are contraries. Therefore the same action cannot be both 
good and evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The same thing cannot be the subject of contraries. But 
good and evil are contraries. Therefore the same action cannot be both 
good and evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing hinders a thing from being one, in so far as it 
is in one genus, and manifold, in so far as it is  referred to another 
genus. Thus a continuous surface is one, considered as in the genus of 
quantity; and yet it is manifold, considered as to the genus of color, if 
it be partly white, and partly black. And accordingly, nothing hinders an 
action from being one, considered in the natural order; whereas it is not 
one, considered in the moral order; and vice versa, as we have stated 
above (<A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 1). For continuous walking is one 
action, considered in the natural order: but it may resolve itself into 
many actions, considered in the moral order, if a change take place in 
the walker's will, for the will is the principle of moral actions. If 
therefore we consider one action in the moral order, it is impossible for 
it to be morally both good and evil. Whereas if it be one as to natural 
and not moral unity, it can be both good and evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This continual movement which proceeds from various 
intentions, although it is one in the natural order, is not one in the 
point of moral unity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Action and passion belong to the moral order, in so far as 
they are voluntary. And therefore in so far as they are voluntary in 
respect of wills that differ, they are two distinct things, and good can 
be in one of them while evil is in the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[20] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The action of the servant, in so far as it proceeds from 
the will of the servant, is not the master's action: but only in so far 
as it proceeds from the master's command. Wherefore the evil will of the 
servant does not make the action evil in this respect.<br>
