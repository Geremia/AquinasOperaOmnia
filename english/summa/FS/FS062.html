four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there are any theological virtues?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not any theological virtues. For 
according to Phys. vii, text. 17, "virtue is the disposition of a perfect 
thing to that which is best: and by perfect, I mean that which is 
disposed according to nature." But that which is Divine is above man's 
nature. Therefore the theological virtues are not virtues of a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, theological virtues are quasi-Divine virtues. But the 
Divine virtues are exemplars, as stated above (<A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="FS061.html#FSQ61A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), which are 
not in us but in God. Therefore the theological virtues are not virtues 
of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues are so called because they 
direct us to God, Who is the first beginning and last end of all things. 
But by the very nature of his reason and will, man is directed to his 
first beginning and last end. Therefore there is no need for any habits 
of theological virtue, to direct the reason and will to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The precepts of the Law are about acts of virtue. Now 
the Divine Law contains precepts about the acts of faith, hope, and 
charity: for it is written (Ecclus. 2:8, seqq.): "Ye that fear the Lord 
believe Him," and again, "hope in Him," and again, "love Him." Therefore 
faith, hope, and charity are virtues directing us to God. Therefore they 
are theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man is perfected by virtue, for those actions whereby he 
is directed to happiness, as was explained above (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>, <A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Now man's 
happiness is twofold, as was also stated above (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>, <A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). One is 
proportionate to human nature, a happiness, to wit, which man can obtain 
by means of his natural principles. The other is a happiness surpassing 
man's nature, and which man can obtain by the power of God alone, by a 
kind of participation of the Godhead, about which it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Pt++1%3A4">2 Pt. 1:4</a>) that by Christ we are made "partakers of the Divine nature." And 
because such happiness surpasses the capacity of human nature, man's 
natural principles which enable him to act well according to his 
capacity, do not suffice to direct man to this same happiness. Hence it 
is necessary for man to receive from God some additional principles, 
whereby he may be directed to supernatural happiness, even as he is 
directed to his connatural end, by means of his natural principles, 
albeit not without Divine assistance. Such like principles are called 
"theological virtues": first, because their object is God, inasmuch as 
they direct us aright to God: secondly, because they are infused in us by 
God alone: thirdly, because these virtues are not made known to us, save 
by Divine revelation, contained in Holy Writ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A certain nature may be ascribed to a certain thing in two 
ways. First, essentially: and thus these theological virtues surpass the 
nature of man. Secondly, by participation, as kindled wood partakes of 
the nature of fire: and thus, after a fashion, man becomes a partaker of 
the Divine Nature, as stated above: so that these virtues are 
proportionate to man in respect of the Nature of which he is made a 
partaker.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These virtues are called Divine, not as though God were 
virtuous by reason of them, but because of them God makes us virtuous, 
and directs us to Himself. Hence they are not exemplar but exemplate 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reason and will are naturally directed to God, inasmuch 
as He is the beginning and end of nature, but in proportion to nature. 
But the reason and will, according to their nature, are not sufficiently 
directed to Him in so far as He is the object of supernatural happiness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the theological virtues are distinct from the intellectual and moral virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the theological virtues are not distinct from 
the moral and intellectual virtues. For the theological virtues, if they 
be in a human soul, must needs perfect it, either as to the intellective, 
or as to the appetitive part. Now the virtues which perfect the 
intellective part are called intellectual; and the virtues which perfect 
the appetitive part, are called moral. Therefore, the theological virtues 
are not distinct from the moral and intellectual virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues are those which direct us to 
God. Now, among the intellectual virtues there is one which directs us to 
God: this is wisdom, which is about Divine things, since it considers the 
highest cause. Therefore the theological virtues are not distinct from 
the intellectual virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Moribus Eccl. xv) shows how the four 
cardinal virtues are the "order of love." Now love is charity, which is a 
theological virtue. Therefore the moral virtues are not distinct from the 
theological.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which is above man's nature is distinct from that 
which is according to his nature. But the theological virtues are above 
man's nature; while the intellectual and moral virtues are in proportion 
to his nature, as clearly shown above (<A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="FS058.html#FSQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore they are 
distinct from one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), habits are 
specifically distinct from one another in respect of the formal 
difference of their objects. Now the object of the theological virtues is 
God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of 
our reason. On the other hand, the object of the intellectual and moral 
virtues is something comprehensible to human reason. Wherefore the 
theological virtues are specifically distinct from the moral and 
intellectual virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellectual and moral virtues perfect man's intellect 
and appetite according to the capacity of human nature; the theological 
virtues, supernaturally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The wisdom which the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 3,7) reckons 
as an intellectual virtue, considers Divine things so far as they are 
open to the research of human reason. Theological virtue, on the other 
hand, is about those same things so far as they surpass human reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Though charity is love, yet love is not always charity. 
When, then, it is stated that every virtue is the order of love, this can 
be understood either of love in the general sense, or of the love of 
charity. If it be understood of love, commonly so called, then each 
virtue is stated to be the order of love, in so  far as each cardinal 
virtue requires ordinate emotions; and love is the root and cause of 
every emotion, as stated above (<A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FS028.html#FSQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="FS028.html#FSQ28A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="FS041.html#FSQ41A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). If, however, it be understood of the love of charity, it 
does not mean that every other virtue is charity essentially: but that 
all other virtues depend on charity in some way, as we shall show further 
on (<A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="FS065.html#FSQ65ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5; <A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS023.html#SSQ23A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether faith, hope, and charity are fittingly reckoned as theological virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith, hope, and charity are not fittingly 
reckoned as three theological virtues. For the theological virtues are in 
relation to Divine happiness, what the natural inclination is in relation 
to the connatural end. Now among the virtues directed to the connatural 
end there is but one natural virtue, viz. the understanding of 
principles. Therefore there should be but one theological virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues are more perfect than the 
intellectual and moral virtues. Now faith is not reckoned among the 
intellectual virtues, but is something less than a virtue, since it is 
imperfect knowledge. Likewise hope is not reckoned among the moral 
virtues, but is something less than a virtue, since it is a passion. Much 
less therefore should they be reckoned as theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the theological virtues direct man's soul to God. Now 
man's soul cannot be directed to God, save through the intellective part, 
wherein are the intellect and will. Therefore there should be only two 
theological virtues, one perfecting the intellect, the other, the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A13">1 Cor. 13:13</a>): "Now there remain 
faith, hope, charity, these three."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the theological virtues direct 
man to supernatural happiness in the same way as by the natural 
inclination man is directed to his connatural end. Now the latter happens 
in respect of two things. First, in respect of the reason or intellect, 
in so far as it contains the first universal principles which are known 
to us by the natural light of the intellect, and which are reason's 
starting-point, both in speculative and in practical matters. Secondly, 
through the rectitude of the will which tends naturally to good as 
defined by reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But these two fall short of the order of supernatural happiness, 
according to 1 Cor. 2:9: "The eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither 
hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for 
them that love Him." Consequently in respect of both the above things man 
needed to receive in addition something supernatural to direct him to a 
supernatural end. First, as regards the intellect, man receives certain 
supernatural  principles, which are held by means of a Divine light: 
these are the articles of faith, about which is faith. Secondly, the will 
is directed to this end, both as to that end as something 
attainable---and this pertains to hope---and as to a certain spiritual 
union, whereby the will is, so to speak, transformed into that end---and 
this belongs to charity. For the appetite of a thing is moved and tends 
towards its connatural end naturally; and this movement is due to a 
certain conformity of the thing with its end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intellect requires intelligible species whereby to 
understand: consequently there is need of a natural habit in addition to 
the power. But the very nature of the will suffices for it to be directed 
naturally to the end, both as to the intention of the end and as to its 
conformity with the end. But the nature of the power is insufficient in 
either of these respects, for the will to be directed to things that are 
above its nature. Consequently there was need for an additional 
supernatural habit in both respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith and hope imply a certain imperfection: since faith is 
of things unseen, and hope, of things not possessed. Hence faith and 
hope, in things that are subject to human power, fall short of the notion 
of virtue. But faith and hope in things which are above the capacity of 
human nature surpass all virtue that is in proportion to man, according 
to 1 Cor. 1:25: "The weakness of God is stronger than men."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Two things pertain to the appetite, viz. movement to the 
end, and conformity with the end by means of love. Hence there must needs 
be two theological virtues in the human appetite, namely, hope and 
charity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether faith precedes hope, and hope charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the order of the theological virtues is not 
that faith precedes hope, and hope charity. For the root precedes that 
which grows from it. Now charity is the root of all the virtues, 
according to Eph. 3:17: "Being rooted and founded in charity." Therefore 
charity precedes the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i): "A man cannot love 
what he does not believe to exist. But if he believes and loves, by doing 
good works he ends in hoping." Therefore it seems that faith precedes 
charity, and charity hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, love is the principle of all our emotions, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS062.html#FSQ62A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). Now hope is a kind of emotion, since it is a passion, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore charity, which is love, precedes 
hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle enumerates them thus (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A13">1 Cor. 13:13</a>): "Now 
there remain faith, hope, charity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Order is twofold: order of generation, and order of 
perfection. By order of generation, in respect of which matter precedes 
form, and the imperfect precedes the perfect, in one same subject faith 
precedes hope, and hope charity, as to their acts: because habits are all 
infused together. For the movement of the appetite cannot tend to 
anything, either by hoping or loving, unless that thing be apprehended by 
the sense or by the intellect. Now it is by faith that the intellect 
apprehends the object of hope and love. Hence in the order of generation, 
faith precedes hope and charity. In like manner a man loves a thing 
because he apprehends it as his good. Now from the very fact that a man 
hopes to be able to obtain some good through someone, he looks on the man 
in whom he hopes as a good of his own. Hence for the very reason that a 
man hopes in someone, he proceeds to love him: so that in the order of 
generation, hope precedes charity as regards their respective acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the order of perfection, charity precedes faith and hope: because 
both faith and hope are quickened by charity, and receive from charity 
their full complement as virtues. For thus charity is the mother and the 
root of all the virtues, inasmuch as it is the form of them all, as we 
shall state further on (<A Href="../SS.html">SS</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../SS/SS023.html#SSQ23A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of that hope whereby a man hopes to 
obtain bliss through the merits which he has already: this belongs to 
hope quickened by and following charity. But it is possible for a man 
before having charity, to hope through merits not already possessed, but 
which he hopes to possess.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[62] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), in treating of the passions, 
hope regards two things. One as its principal object, viz. the good hoped 
for. With regard to this, love always precedes hope: for good is never 
hoped for unless it be desired and loved. Hope also regards the person 
from whom a man hopes to be able to obtain some good. With regard to 
this, hope precedes love at first; though afterwards hope is increased by 
love. Because from the fact that a man thinks that he can obtain a good 
through someone, he begins to love him: and from the fact that he loves 
him, he then hopes all the more in him.<br>
