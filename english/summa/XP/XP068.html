<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider children of illegitimate birth. Under this head 
there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP068.html#XPQ68A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether those born out of true marriage are illegitimate?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP068.html#XPQ68A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether children should suffer any loss through being illegitimate?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP068.html#XPQ68A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they can be legitimized?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that children born out of true marriage are 
legitimate. For he that is born according to law is called a legitimate 
son. Now everyone is born according to law, at least the law of nature, 
which has more force than any other. Therefore every child is to be 
called legitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is the common saying that a legitimate child is one 
born of a legitimate marriage, or of a marriage that is deemed legitimate 
in the eyes of the Church. Now it happens sometimes that a marriage is 
deemed legitimate in the eyes of the Church, whereas there is some 
impediment affecting its validity; which impediment may be known to the 
parties who marry in the presence of the Church: or they may marry in 
secret and be ignorant of the impediment, in which case their marriage 
would seem legitimate in the eyes of the Church, for the very reason that 
it is not prevented by the Church. Therefore children born out of true 
marriage are not illegitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Illegitimate is that which is against the law. Now 
those who are born out of wedlock are born contrary to the law. Therefore 
they are illegitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Children are of four conditions. Some are natural and 
legitimate, for instance those who are born of a true and lawful 
marriage; some are natural and illegitimate, as those who are born of 
fornication; some are legitimate and not natural, as adopted children; 
some are neither legitimate nor natural; such are those born of adultery 
or incest, for these are born not only against the positive law, but 
against the express natural law. Hence we must grant that some children 
are illegitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although those who are born of an unlawful intercourse are 
born according to the nature common to man and all animals, they are born 
contrary to the law of nature which is proper to man: since fornication, 
adultery, and the like are contrary to the law of nature. Hence the like 
are not legitimate by any law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ignorance, unless it be affected, excuses  unlawful 
intercourse from sin. Wherefore those who contract together in good faith 
in the presence of the Church, although there be an impediment, of which 
however they are ignorant, sin not, nor are their children illegitimate. 
If, however, they know of the impediment, although the Church upholds 
their marriage because she knows not of the impediment, they are not 
excused from sin, nor do their children avoid being illegitimate. Neither 
are they excused if they know not of the impediment and marry secretly, 
because such ignorance would appear to be affected.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether children should suffer any loss through being illegitimate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that children ought not to suffer any loss through 
being illegitimate. For a child should not be punished on account of his 
father's sin, according to the Lord's saying (Ezech. 18:20). But it is 
not his own but his father's fault that he is born of an unlawful union. 
Therefore he should not incur a loss on this account.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human justice is copied from Divine. Now God confers 
natural goods equally on legitimate and illegitimate children. Therefore 
illegitimate should be equalled to legitimate children according to human 
laws.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++25%3A5,6">Gn. 25:5,6</a>) that "Abraham gave all his 
possessions to Isaac, and that to the children of the concubines he gave 
gifts": and yet the latter were not born of an unlawful intercourse. Much 
more, therefore, ought those born of an unlawful intercourse to incur 
loss by not inheriting their father's property.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A person is said to incur a loss for some cause in two 
ways: First, because he is deprived of his due, and thus an illegitimate 
child incurs no loss. Secondly, because something is not due to him, 
which might have been due otherwise, and thus an illegitimate son incurs 
a twofold loss. First because he is excluded from legitimate acts such as 
offices and dignities, which require a certain respectability in those 
who perform them. Secondly, he incurs a loss by not succeeding to his 
father's inheritance. Nevertheless natural sons can inherit a sixth only, 
whereas spurious children cannot inherit any portion, although by natural 
law their parents are bound to provide for their needs. Hence it is part 
of a bishop's care to compel both parents to provide for them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To incur a loss in this second way is not a punishment. 
Hence we do not say that a person is punished by not succeeding to the 
throne through not being the king's son. In like manner it is no 
punishment to an illegitimate child that he has no right to that which 
belongs to the legitimate children.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Illegitimate intercourse is contrary to the law, not as an 
act of the generative power, but as proceeding from a  wicked will. Hence 
an illegitimate son incurs a loss, not in those things which come to him 
by his natural origin, but in those things which are dependent on the 
will for being done or possessed.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an illegitimate son can be legitimized?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an illegitimate son cannot be legitimized. For 
the legitimate child is as far removed from the illegitimate as the 
illegitimate from the legitimate. But a legitimate child is never made 
illegitimate. Neither, therefore, is an illegitimate child ever made 
legitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, illegitimate intercourse begets an illegitimate child. 
But illegitimate intercourse never becomes legitimate. Neither, 
therefore, can an illegitimate son become legitimate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> What is done by the law can be undone by the law. Now 
the illegitimacy of children is an effect of positive law. Therefore an 
illegitimate child can be legitimized by one who has legal authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> An illegitimate child can be legitimized, not so that he 
be born of a legitimate intercourse, because this intercourse is a thing 
of the past and can never be legitimized from the moment that it was once 
illegitimate. But the child is said to be legitimized, in so far as the 
losses which an illegitimate child ought to incur are withdrawn by the 
authority of the law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are six ways of becoming legitimate: two according to the canons 
(Cap. Conquestus; Cap. Tanta), namely when a man marries the woman of 
whom he has an unlawful child (if it were not a case of adultery), and by 
special indulgence and dispensation of the lord Pope. The other four ways 
are according to the laws: (1) If the father offer his natural son to the 
emperor's court, for by this very fact the son is legitimate on account 
of the reputation of the court; (2) if the father designate him in his 
will as his legitimate heir, and the son afterwards offer the will to the 
emperor; (3) if there be no legitimate son and the son himself offer 
himself to the emperor; (4) if the father designate him as legitimate in 
a public document or in a document signed by three witnesses, without 
calling him natural.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A favor may be bestowed on a person without injustice, but 
a person cannot be damnified except for a fault. Hence an illegitimate 
child can be legitimized rather than "vice versa"; for although a 
legitimate son is sometimes deprived of his inheritance on account of his 
fault, he is not said to be illegitimate, because he was legitimately 
begotten.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[68] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Illegitimate intercourse has an inherent inseparable defect 
whereby it is opposed to the law: and  consequently it cannot be 
legitimized. Nor is there any comparison with an illegitimate child who 
has no such defect.<br>
