<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider those on whom the power of the keys can be 
exercised. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP020.html#XPQ20A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a priest can use the key, which he has, on any man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP020.html#XPQ20A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a priest can always absolve his subject?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP020.html#XPQ20A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether anyone can use the keys on his superior?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a priest can use the key which he has, on any 
man. For the power of the keys was bestowed on priests by Divine 
authority in the words: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall 
forgive, they are forgiven them" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++20:22,23">Jn. 20:22,23</a>). But this was said 
without any restriction. Therefore he that has the key, can use it on any 
without restriction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a material key that opens one lock, opens all locks of 
the same pattern. Now every sin of every man is the same kind of obstacle 
against entering into heaven. Therefore if a  priest can, by means of the 
key which he has, absolve one man, he can do the same for all others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priesthood of the New Testament is more perfect than 
that of the Old Testament. But the priest of the Old Testament could use 
the power which he had of discerning between different kinds of leprosy, 
with regard to all indiscriminately. Much more therefore can the priest 
of the Gospel use his power with regard to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Appendix of Gratian: "It is not 
lawful for every priest to loose or bind another priest's parishioner." 
Therefore a priest cannot absolve everybody.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, judgment in spiritual matters should be better regulated than 
in temporal matters. But in temporal matters a judge cannot judge 
everybody. Therefore, since the use of the keys is a kind of judgment, it 
is not within the competency of a priest to use his key with regard to 
everyone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> That which has to do with singular matters is not equally 
in the power of all. Thus, even as besides the general principles of 
medicine, it is necessary to have physicians, who adapt those general 
principles to individual patients or diseases, according to their various 
requirements, so in every kingdom, besides that one who proclaims the 
universal precepts of law, there is need for others to adapt those 
precepts to individual cases, according as each case demands. For this 
reason, in the heavenly hierarchy also, under the Powers who rule 
indiscriminately, a place is given to the Principalities, who are 
appointed to individual kingdoms, and to the Angels who are given charge 
over individual men, as we have explained above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP113.html#FPQ113OUTP1">Question [113]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP113.html#FPQ113ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). 
Consequently there should be a like order of authority in the Church 
Militant, so that an indiscriminate authority over all should be vested 
in one individual, and that there should be others under him, having 
distinct authority over various people. Now the use of the keys implies a 
certain power to exercise authority, whereby the one on whom the keys are 
used, becomes the proper matter of that act. Therefore he that has power 
over all indiscriminately, can use the keys on all, whereas those who 
have received authority over distinct persons, cannot use the keys on 
everyone, but only on those over whom they are appointed, except in cases 
of necessity, when the sacraments should be refused to no one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A twofold power is required in order to absolve from sins, 
namely, power of order and power of jurisdiction. The former power is 
equally in all priests, but not the latter. And therefore, when our Lord 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++20:23">Jn. 20:23</a>) gave all the apostles in general, the power of forgiving 
sins, this is to be understood of the power which results from receiving 
orders, wherefore these words are addressed to priests when they are 
ordained. But to Peter in particular He gave the power of forgiving sins 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++16:19">Mt. 16:19</a>), that we may understand that he has the power of jurisdiction 
before the others. But the power of orders, considered in itself, extends 
to  all who can be absolved: wherefore our Lord said indeterminately, 
"Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them," on the 
understanding that this power should be used in dependence on the power 
given to Peter, according to His appointment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A material key can open only its own lock. nor can any 
active force act save on its own matter. Now a man becomes the matter of 
the power of order by jurisdiction: and consequently no one can use the 
key in respect of another over whom he has not jurisdiction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The people of Israel were one people, and had but one 
temple, so that there was no need for a distinction in priestly 
jurisdiction, as there is now in the Church which comprises various 
peoples and nations.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a priest can always absolve his subject?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a priest cannot always absolve his subject. 
For, as Augustine says (De vera et false Poenitentia [*Work of an unknown 
author]), "no man should exercise the priestly office, unless he be free 
from those things which he condemns in others." But a priest might happen 
to share in a sin committed by his subject, e.g. by knowledge of a woman 
who is his subject. Therefore it seems that he cannot always use the 
power of the keys on his subjects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by the power of the keys a man is healed of all his 
shortcomings. Now it happens sometimes that a sin has attached to it a 
defect of irregularity or a sentence of excommunication, from which a 
simple priest cannot absolve. Therefore it seems that he cannot use the 
power of the keys on such as are shackled by these things in the above 
manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the judgment and power of our priesthood was 
foreshadowed by the judgment of the ancient priesthood. Now according to 
the Law, the lesser judges were not competent to decide all cases, and 
had recourse to the higher judges, according to Ex. 24:14: "If any 
question shall arise" among you, "you shall refer it to them." It seems, 
therefore, that a priest cannot absolve his subject from graver sins, but 
should refer him to his superior.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whoever has charge of the principal has charge of the 
accessory. Now priests are charged with the dispensation of the Eucharist 
to their subjects, to which sacrament the absolution of sins is 
subordinate [*Cf. Question [17], Article [2], ad 1]. Therefore, as far as the power of 
the keys is concerned, a priest can absolve his subject from any sins 
whatever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, grace, however small, removes all sin. But a priest dispenses 
sacraments whereby grace is given. Therefore, as far as the power of the 
keys is concerned, he can absolve from all sins. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The power of order, considered in itself, extends to the 
remission of all sins. But since, as stated above, the use of this power 
requires jurisdiction which inferiors derive from their superiors, it 
follows that the superior can reserve certain matters to himself, the 
judgment of which he does not commit to his inferior; otherwise any 
simple priest who has jurisdiction can absolve from any sin. Now there 
are five cases in which a simple priest must refer his penitent to his 
superior. The first is when a public penance has to be imposed, because 
in that case the bishop is the proper minister of the sacrament. The 
second is the case of those who are excommunicated when the inferior 
priest cannot absolve a penitent through the latter being excommunicated 
by his superior. The third case is when he finds that an irregularity has 
been contracted, for the dispensation of which he has to have recourse to 
his superior. The fourth is the case of arson. The fifth is when it is 
the custom in a diocese for the more heinous crimes to be reserved to the 
bishop, in order to inspire fear, because custom in these cases either 
gives the power or takes it away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this case the priest should not hear the confession of 
his accomplice, with regard to that particular sin, but must refer her to 
another: nor should she confess to him but should ask permission to go to 
another, or should have recourse to his superior if he refused, both on 
account of the danger, and for the sake of less shame. If, however, he 
were to absolve her it would be valid*: because when Augustine says that 
they should not be guilty of the same sin, he is speaking of what is 
congruous, not of what is essential to the sacrament. [*Benedict XIV 
declared the absolution of an accomplice "in materia turpi" to be 
invalid.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Penance delivers man from all defects of guilt, but not 
from all defects of punishment, since even after doing penance for 
murder, a man remains irregular. Hence a priest can absolve from a crime, 
but for the remission of the punishment he must refer the penitent to the 
superior, except in the case of excommunication, absolution from which 
should precede absolution from sin, for as long as a man is 
excommunicated, he cannot receive any sacrament of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection considers those cases in which superiors 
reserve the power of jurisdiction to themselves.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can use the keys with regard to his superior?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man cannot use the keys in respect of a 
superior. For every sacramental act requires its proper matter. Now the 
proper matter for the use of the keys, is a person who is subject, as 
stated above (<A Href="XP019.html#XPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="XP019.html#XPQ19A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore a priest cannot use the keys in 
respect of one who is not his subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Church Militant is an image of the Church  
Triumphant. Now in the heavenly Church an inferior angel never cleanses, 
enlightens or perfects a higher angel. Therefore neither can an inferior 
priest exercise on a superior a hierarchical action such as absolution.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the judgment of Penance should be better regulated than 
the judgment of an external court. Now in the external court an inferior 
cannot excommunicate or absolve his superior. Therefore, seemingly, 
neither can he do so in the penitential court.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The higher prelate is also "compassed with infirmity," 
and may happen to sin. Now the power of the keys is the remedy for sin. 
Therefore, since he cannot use the key on himself, for he cannot be both 
judge and accused at the same time, it seems that an inferior can use the 
power of the keys on him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, absolution which is given through the power of the keys, is 
ordained to the reception of the Eucharist. But an inferior can give 
Communion to his superior, if the latter asks him to. Therefore he can 
use the power of the keys on him if he submit to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The power of the keys, considered in itself, is 
applicable to all, as stated above (<A Href="XP020.html#XPQ20A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): and that a priest is unable to 
use the keys on some particular person is due to his power being limited 
to certain individuals. Therefore he who limited his power can extend it 
to whom he wills, so that he can give him power over himself, although he 
cannot use the power of the keys on himself, because this power requires 
to be exercised on a subject, and therefore on someone else, for no man 
can be subject to himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the bishop whom a simple priest absolves is his 
superior absolutely speaking, yet he is beneath him in so far as he 
submits himself as a sinner to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the angels there can be no defect by reason of which the 
higher angel can submit to the lower, such as there can happen to be 
among men; and so there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> External judgment is according to men, whereas the judgment 
of confession is according to God, in Whose sight a man is lessened by 
sinning, which is not the case in human prelacy. Therefore just as in 
external judgment no man can pass sentence of excommunication on himself, 
so neither can he empower another to excommunicate him. On the other 
hand, in the tribunal of conscience he can give another the power to 
absolve him, though he cannot use that power himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[20] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be replied that absolution in the tribunal of the 
confessional belongs principally to the power of the keys and 
consequently to the power of jurisdiction, whereas excommunication 
regards jurisdiction exclusively. And, as to the power of orders,  all 
are equal, but not as to jurisdiction. Wherefore there is no comparison.<br>
