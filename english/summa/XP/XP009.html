<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the quality of confession: under which head there 
are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP009.html#XPQ9A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether confession can be lacking in form?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP009.html#XPQ9A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether confession ought to be entire?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that confession cannot be lacking in form. For it 
is written (Ecclus. 17:26): "Praise [confession] perisheth from the dead 
as nothing." But a man without charity is dead, because charity is the 
life of the soul. Therefore there can be no confession without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, confession is condivided with contrition and 
satisfaction. But contrition and satisfaction are impossible without 
charity. Therefore confession is also impossible without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is necessary in confession that the word should agree 
with the thought for the very name of confession requires this. Now if a 
man confess while remaining attached to sin, his word is not in accord 
with his thought, since in his heart he holds to sin, while he condemns 
it with his lips. Therefore such a man does not confess.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Every man is bound to confess his mortal sins. Now if a 
man in mortal sin has confessed once, he is not bound to confess the same 
sins again, because, as no man knows himself to have charity, no man 
would know of him that he had confessed. Therefore it is not necessary 
that confession should be quickened by charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Confession is an act of virtue, and is part of a 
sacrament. In so far as it is an act of virtue, it has the property of 
being meritorious, and thus is of no avail without charity, which is the 
principle of merit. But in so far as it is part of a sacrament, it 
subordinates the penitent to the priest who has the keys of the Church, 
and who by means of the confession knows the conscience of the person 
confessing. In this way it is possible for confession to be in one who is 
not contrite, for he can make his sins known to the priest, and subject 
himself to the keys of the Church: and though he does not receive the 
fruit of absolution then, yet he will begin to receive it, when he is 
sincerely contrite, as happens in the other sacraments: wherefore he is 
not bound to repeat his confession, but to confess his lack of sincerity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These words must be understood as referring to the 
receiving of the fruit of confession, which none can receive who is not 
in the state of charity. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Contrition and satisfaction are offered to God: but 
confession is made to man: hence it is essential to contrition and 
satisfaction, but not to confession, that man should be united to God by 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who declares the sins which he has, speaks the truth; 
and thus his thought agrees with his lips or words, as to the substance 
of confession, though it is discordant with the purpose of confession.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether confession should be entire?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary for confession to be 
entire, namely, for a man to confess all his sins to one priest. For 
shame conduces to the diminution of punishment. Now the greater the 
number of priests to whom a man confesses, the greater his shame. 
Therefore confession is more fruitful if it be divided among several 
priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, confession is necessary in Penance in order that 
punishment may be enjoined for sin according to the judgment of the 
priest. Now a sufficient punishment for different sins can be imposed by 
different priests. Therefore it is not necessary to confess all one's 
sins to one priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man after going to confession and 
performing his penance, remembers a mortal sin, which escaped his memory 
while confessing, and that his own priest to whom he confessed first is 
no longer available, so that he can only confess that sin to another 
priest, and thus he will confess different sins to different priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the sole reason for confessing one's sins to a priest is 
in order to receive absolution. Now sometimes, the priest who hears a 
confession can absolve from some of the sins, but not from all. Therefore 
in such a case at all events the confession need not be entire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hypocrisy is an obstacle to Penance. But it savors of 
hypocrisy to divide one's confession, as Augustine says [*De vera et 
falsa Poenitentia, work of an unknown author]. Therefore confession 
should be entire. Further, confession is a part of Penance. But Penance 
should be entire. Therefore confession also should be entire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In prescribing medicine for the body, the physician 
should know not only the disease for which he is prescribing, but also 
the general constitution of the sick person, since one disease is 
aggravated by the addition of another, and a medicine which would be 
adapted to one disease, would be harmful to another. The same is to be 
said in regard to sins, for one is aggravated when another is added to 
it; and a remedy which would be  suitable for one sin, might prove an 
incentive to another, since sometimes a man is guilty of contrary sins, 
as Gregory says (Pastoral. iii, 3). Hence it is necessary for confession 
that man confess all the sins that he calls to mind, and if he fails to 
do this, it is not a confession, but a pretense of confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a man's shame is multiplied when he makes a 
divided confession to different confessors, yet all his different shames 
together are not so great as that with which he confesses all his sins 
together: because one sin considered by itself does not prove the evil 
disposition of the sinner, as when it is considered in conjunction with 
several others, for a man may fall into one sin through ignorance or 
weakness, but a number of sins proves the malice of the sinner, or his 
great corruption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The punishment imposed by different priests would not be 
sufficient, because each would only consider one sin by itself, and not 
the gravity which it derives from being in conjunction with another. 
Moreover sometimes the punishment which would be given for one sin would 
foster another. Again the priest in hearing a confession takes the place 
of God, so that confession should be made to him just as contrition is 
made to God: wherefore as there would be no contrition unless one were 
contrite for all the sins which one calls to mind, so is there no 
confession unless one confess all the sins that one remembers committing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some say that when a man remembers a sin which he had 
previously forgotten, he ought to confess again the sins which he had 
confessed before, especially if he cannot go to the same priest to whom 
his previous confession was made, in order that the total quantity of his 
sins may be made known to one priest. But this does not seem necessary, 
because sin takes its quantity both from itself and from the conjunction 
of another; and as to the sins which he confessed he had already 
manifested their quantity which they have of themselves, while as to the 
sin which he had forgotten, in order that the priest may know the 
quantity which it has under both the above heads, it is enough that the 
penitent declare it explicitly, and confess the others in general, saying 
that he had confessed many sins in his previous confession, but had 
forgotten this particular one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although the priest may be unable to absolve the penitent 
from all his sins, yet the latter is bound to confess all to him, that he 
may know the total quantity of his guilt, and refer him to the superior 
with regard to the sins from which he cannot absolve him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one may confess through another, or by writing?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one may confess through another, or by 
writing. For confession is necessary in order that the penitent's 
conscience may be made known to the priest. But a man can make his 
conscience known to the priest, through another or by  writing. Therefore 
it is enough to confess through another or by writing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some are not understood by their own priests on account 
of a difference of language, and consequently cannot confess save through 
others. Therefore it is not essential to the sacrament that one should 
confess by oneself, so that if anyone confesses through another in any 
way whatever, it suffices for his salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is essential to the sacrament that a man should 
confess to his own priest, as appears from what has been said (<A Href="XP008.html#XPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>, <A Href="XP008.html#XPQ8A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now sometimes a man's own priest is absent, so that the penitent 
cannot speak to him with his own voice. But he could make his conscience 
known to him by writing. Therefore it seems that he ought to manifest his 
conscience to him by writing to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Man is bound to confess his sins even as he is bound to 
confess his faith. But confession of faith should be made "with the 
mouth," as appears from Rm. 10:10: therefore confession of sins should 
also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, who sinned by himself should, by himself, do penance. But 
confession is part of penance. Therefore the penitent should confess his 
own sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Confession is not only an act of virtue, but also part of 
a sacrament. Now, though, in so far as it is an act of virtue it matters 
not how it is done, even if it be easier to do it in one way than in 
another, yet, in so far as it is part of a sacrament, it has a 
determinate act, just as the other sacraments have a determinate matter. 
And as in Baptism, in order to signify the inward washing, we employ that 
element which is chiefly used in washing, so in the sacramental act which 
is intended for manifestation we generally make use of that act which is 
most commonly employed for the purpose of manifestation, viz. our own 
words; for other ways have been introduced as supplementary to this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as in Baptism it is not enough to wash with anything, 
but it is necessary to wash with a determinate element, so neither does 
it suffice, in Penance, to manifest one's sins anyhow, but they must be 
declared by a determinate act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is enough for one who is ignorant of a language, to 
confess by writing, or by signs, or by an interpreter, because a man is 
not bound to do more than he can: although a man is not able or obliged 
to receive Baptism, except with water, which is from an entirely external 
source and is applied to us by another: whereas the act of confession is 
from within and is performed by ourselves, so that when we cannot confess 
in one way, we must confess as we can.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the absence of one's own priest, confession  may be made 
even to a layman, so that there is no necessity to confess in writing, 
because the act of confession is more essential than the person to whom 
confession is made.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sixteen conditions usually assigned are necessary for confession?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the conditions assigned by masters, and 
contained in the following lines, are not requisite for confession:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Simple, humble, pure, faithful,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Frequent, undisguised, discreet, voluntary,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;   shamefaced,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Entire, secret, tearful, not delayed,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Courageously accusing, ready to obey.
For fidelity, simplicity, and courage are virtues by themselves, and 
therefore should not be reckoned as conditions of confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing is "pure" when it is not mixed with anything 
else: and "simplicity," in like manner, removes composition and 
admixture. Therefore one or the other is superfluous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to confess more than once a sin which he 
has committed but once. Therefore if a man does not commit a sin again, 
his penance need not be "frequent."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, confession is directed to satisfaction. But satisfaction 
is sometimes public. Therefore confession should not always be "secret."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, that which is not in our power is not required of us. 
But it is not in our power to shed "tears." Therefore it is not required 
of those who confess.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We have the authority of the masters who assigned the 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some of the above conditions are essential to confession, 
and some are requisite for its well-being. Now those things which are 
essential to confession belong to it either as to an act of virtue, or as 
to part of a sacrament. If in the first way, it is either by reason of 
virtue in general, or by reason of the special virtue of which it is the 
act, or by reason of the act itself. Now there are four conditions of 
virtue in general, as stated in Ethic. ii, 4. The first is knowledge, in 
respect of which confession is said to be "discreet," inasmuch as 
prudence is required in every act of virtue: and this discretion consists 
in giving greater weight to greater sins. The second condition is choice, 
because acts of virtue should be voluntary, and in this respect 
confession is said to be "voluntary." The third condition  is that the 
act be done for a particular purpose, viz. the due end, and in this 
respect confession is said to be "pure," i.e. with a right intention. The 
fourth condition is that one should act immovably, and in this respect it 
is said that confession should be "courageous," viz. that the truth 
should not be forsaken through shame.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now confession is an act of the virtue of penance. First of all it takes 
its origin in the horror which one conceives for the shamefulness of sin, 
and in this respect confession should be "full of shame," so as not to be 
a boastful account of one's sins, by reason of some worldly vanity 
accompanying it. Then it goes on to deplore the sin committed, and in 
this respect it is said to be "tearful." Thirdly, it culminates in 
self-abjection, and in this respect it should be "humble," so that one 
confesses one's misery and weakness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; By reason of its very nature, viz. confession, this act is one of 
manifestation: which manifestation can be hindered by four things: first, 
by falsehood, and in this respect confession is said to be "faithful," 
i.e. true. Secondly, by the use of vague words, and against this 
confession is said to be "open," so as not to be wrapped up in vague 
words; thirdly, by "multiplicity" of words, in which respect it is said 
to be "simple" indicating that the penitent should relate only such 
matters as affect the gravity of the sin; fourthly none of those things 
should be suppressed which should be made known, and in this respect 
confession should be "entire."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far as confession is part of a sacrament it is subject to the 
judgment of the priest who is the minister of the sacrament. Wherefore it 
should be an "accusation" on the part of the penitent, should manifest 
his "readiness to obey" the priest, should be "secret" as regards the 
nature of the court wherein the hidden affairs of conscience are tried.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-being of confession requires that it should be "frequent"; and 
"not delayed," i.e. that the sinner should confess at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is nothing unreasonable in one virtue being a 
condition of the act of another virtue, through this act being commanded 
by that virtue; or through the mean which belongs to one virtue 
principally, belonging to other virtues by participation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The condition "pure" excludes perversity of intention, from 
which man is cleansed: but the condition "simple" excludes the 
introduction of unnecessary matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This is not necessary for confession, but is a condition of 
its well-being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Confession should be made not publicly but privately, lest 
others be scandalized, and led to do evil through  hearing the sins 
confessed. On the other hand, the penance enjoined in satisfaction does 
not give rise to scandal, since like works of satisfaction are done 
sometimes for slight sins, and sometimes for none at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[9] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> We must understand this to refer to tears of the heart.
