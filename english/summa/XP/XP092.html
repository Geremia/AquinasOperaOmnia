    OF THE VISION OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE IN REFERENCE TO THE BLESSED* (THREE
    ARTICLES) [*Cf. FP, Question [12]]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider matters concerning the blessed after the
    general judgment. We shall consider: (1) Their vision of the Divine essence,
    wherein their bliss consists chiefly; (2) Their bliss and their mansions;
    (3) Their relations with the damned; (4) Their gifts, which are contained in
    their bliss; (5) The crowns which perfect and adorn their happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP092.html#XPQ92A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the saints will see God in
    His essence?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP092.html#XPQ92A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they will see Him with the
    eyes of the body?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP092.html#XPQ92A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether in seeing God they will
    see all that God sees?

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the human intellect can attain to the vision of God in His
    essence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human intellect cannot
    attain to the vision of God in His essence. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A18"
      >Jn. 1:18</a
    >): "No man hath seen God at any time"; and Chrysostom in his commentary
    says (Hom. xiv in Joan.) that "not even the heavenly essences, namely the
    Cherubim and Seraphim, have ever been able to see Him as He is." Now, only
    equality with the angels is promised to men (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >): "They... shall be as the angels of God in heaven." Therefore neither
    will the saints in heaven see God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius argues thus (Div. Nom. i):
    "Knowledge is only of existing things." Now whatever exists is finite, since
    it is confined to a certain genus: and therefore God, since He is infinite,
    is above all existing things. Therefore there is no knowledge of Him, and He
    is above all knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Dionysius (De Myst. Theol. i) shows that
    the most perfect way in which our intellect can be united to God is when it
    is united to Him as to something unknown. Now that which is seen in its
    essence is not unknown. Therefore it is impossible for our intellect to see
    God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Ep. ad Caium Monach.)
    that "the darkness"---for thus he calls the abundance of light---"which
    screens God is impervious to all illuminations, and hidden from all
    knowledge: and if anyone in seeing God understood what he saw, he saw not
    God Himself, but one of those things that are His." Therefore no created
    intellect will be able to see God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, according to Dionysius (Ep. ad Hieroth.)
    "God is invisible on account of His surpassing glory." Now His glory
    surpasses the human intellect in heaven even as on the way. Therefore since
    He is invisible on the way, so will He be in heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, since the intelligible object is the
    perfection of the intellect, there must needs be proportion between
    intelligible and intellect, as between the visible object and the sight. But
    there is no possible proportion between our intellect and the Divine
    essence, since an infinite distance separates them. Therefore our intellect
    will be unable to attain to the vision of the Divine essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, God is more distant from our intellect
    than the created intelligible is from our senses. But the senses can nowise
    attain to the sight of a spiritual creature. Therefore neither will our
    intellect be able to attain to the vision of the Divine essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, whenever the intellect understands
    something actually it needs to be informed with the likeness of the object
    understood, which likeness is the principle of the intellectual operation
    terminating in that object, even as heat is the principle of heating.
    Accordingly if our intellect understands God, this must be by means of some
    likeness informing the intellect itself. Now this cannot be the very essence
    of God, since form and thing informed must needs have one being, while the
    Divine essence differs from our intellect in essence and being. Therefore
    the form whereby our intellect is informed in understanding God must needs
    be a likeness impressed by God on our intellect. But this likeness, being
    something created, cannot lead to the knowledge of God except as an effect
    leads to the knowledge of its cause. Therefore it is impossible for our
    intellect to see God except through His effect. But to see God through His
    effect is not to see Him in His essence. Therefore our intellect will be
    unable to see God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, the Divine essence is more distant from
    our intellect than any angel or intelligence. Now according to Avicenna
    (Metaph. iii), "the existence of an intelligence in our intellect does not
    imply that its essence is in our intellect," because in that case our
    knowledge of the intelligence would be a substance and not an accident, "but
    that its likeness is impressed on our intellect." Therefore neither is God
    in our intellect, to be understood by us, except in so far as an impression
    of Him is in our intellect. But this impression cannot lead to the knowledge
    of the Divine essence, for since it is infinitely distant from the Divine
    essence, it degenerates to another image much more than if the image of a
    white thing were to degenerate to the image of a black thing. Therefore,
    just as a person in whose sight the image of a white thing degenerates to
    the image of a black thing, on account of an indisposition in the organ, is
    not said to see a white thing, so neither will our intellect be able to see
    God in His essence, since it understands God only by means of this
    impression.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, "In things devoid of matter that which understands is the same
    as that which is understood" (De Anima iii). Now God is supremely devoid of
    matter. Since then our intellect, which is created, cannot attain to be an
    uncreated essence, it is impossible for our intellect to see God in His
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, whatever is seen in its essence is known as to what it is. But
    our intellect cannot know of God what He is, but only what He is not as
    Dionysius (Coel. Hier. ii) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. i) declare.
    Therefore our intellect will be unable to see God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, every infinite thing, as such, is unknown. But God is in every
    way infinite. Therefore He is altogether unknown. Therefore it will be
    impossible for Him to be seen in His essence by a created intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, Augustine says (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii): "God is by nature
    invisible." Now that which is in God by nature cannot be otherwise.
    Therefore it is impossible for Him to be seen in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, whatever is in one way and is seen in another way is not seen as
    it is. Now God is in one way and will be seen in another way by the saints
    in heaven: for He according to His own mode, but will be seen by the saints
    according to their mode. Therefore He will not be seen by the saints as He
    is, and thus will not be seen in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, that which is seen through a medium is not seen in its essence.
    Now God will be seen in heaven through a medium which is the light of glory,
    according to Ps. 35:10, "In Thy light we shall see light." Therefore He will
    not be seen in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, in heaven God will be seen face to face, according to 1 Cor.
    13:12. Now when we see a man face to face, we see him through his likeness.
    Therefore in heaven God will be seen through His likeness, and consequently
    not in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 13:12</a
    >): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner, but then face to face."
    Now that which is seen face to face is seen in its essence. Therefore God
    will be seen in His essence by the saints in heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++3%3A2"
      >1 Jn. 3:2</a
    >): "When He shall appear we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him
    as He is." Therefore we shall see Him in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, a gloss on 1 Cor. 15:24, "When He shall have delivered up the
    kingdom to God and the Father," says: "Where," i.e. in heaven, "the essence
    of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost shall be seen: this is given to the clean of
    heart alone and is the highest bliss." Therefore the blessed will see God in
    His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A21"
      >Jn. 14:21</a
    >): "He that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father; and I will love him, and
    will manifest Myself to him." Now that which is manifested is seen in its
    essence. Therefore God will be seen in His essence by the saints in
    heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Gregory commenting (Moral. xviii) on the words of Ex. 33:20, "Man
    shall not see Me and live," disapproves of the opinion of those who said
    that "in this abode of bliss God can be seen in His glory but not in His
    nature; for His glory differs not from His nature." But His nature is His
    essence. Therefore He will be seen in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the desire of the saints cannot be altogether frustrated. Now the
    common desire of the saints is to see God in His essence, according to Ex.
    33:13, "Show me Thy glory"; Ps. 79:20, "Show Thy face and we shall be
    saved"; and Jn. 14:8, "Show us the Father and it is enough for us."
    Therefore the saints will see God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Even as we hold by faith that the last end of
    man's life is to see God, so the philosophers maintained that man's ultimate
    happiness is to understand immaterial substances according to their being.
    Hence in reference to this question we find that philosophers and
    theologians encounter the same difficulty and the same difference of
    opinion. For some philosophers held that our passive intellect can never
    come to understand separate substances. thus Alfarabius expresses himself at
    the end of his Ethics, although he says the contrary in his book On the
    Intelligence, as the Commentator attests (De Anima iii). In like manner
    certain theologians held that the human intellect can never attain to the
    vision of God in His essence. on either side they were moved by the distance
    which separates our intellect from the Divine essence and from separate
    substances. For since the intellect in act is somewhat one with the
    intelligible object in act, it would seem difficult to understand how the
    created intellect is made to be an uncreated essence. Wherefore Chrysostom
    says (Hom. xiv in Joan.): "How can the creature see the uncreated?" Those
    who hold the passive intellect to be the subject of generation and
    corruption, as being a power dependent on the body, encounter a still
    greater difficulty not only as regards the vision of God but also as regards
    the vision of any separate substances. But this opinion is altogether
    untenable. First, because it is in contradiction to the authority of
    canonical scripture, as Augustine declares (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii).
    Secondly, because, since understanding is an operation most proper to man,
    it follows that his happiness must be held to consist in that operation when
    perfected in him. Now since the perfection of an intelligent being as such
    is the intelligible object, if in the most perfect operation of his
    intellect man does not attain to the vision of the Divine essence, but to
    something else, we shall be forced to conclude that something other than God
    is the object of man's happiness: and since the ultimate perfection of a
    thing consists in its being united to its principle, it follows that
    something other than God is the effective principle of man, which is absurd,
    according to us, and also according to the philosophers who maintain that
    our souls emanate from the separate substances, so that finally we may be
    able to understand these substances. Consequently, according to us, it must
    be asserted that our intellect will at length attain to the vision of the
    Divine essence, and according to the philosophers, that it will attain to
    the vision of separate substances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It remains, then, to examine how this may come about. For some, like
    Alfarabius and Avempace, held that from the very fact that our intellect
    understands any intelligible objects whatever, it attains to the vision of a
    separate substance. To prove this they employ two arguments. The first is
    that just as the specific nature is not diversified in various individuals,
    except as united to various individuating principles, so the idea understood
    is not diversified in me and you, except in so far as it is united to
    various imaginary forms: and consequently when the intellect separates the
    idea understood from the imaginary forms, there remains a quiddity
    understood, which is one and the same in the various persons understanding
    it, and such is the quiddity of a separate substance. Hence, when our
    intellect attains to the supreme abstraction of any intelligible quiddity,
    it thereby understands the quiddity of the separate substance that is
    similar to it. The second argument is that our intellect has a natural
    aptitude to abstract the quiddity from all intelligible objects having a
    quiddity. If, then, the quiddity which it abstracts from some particular
    individual be a quiddity without a quiddity, the intellect by understanding
    it understands the quiddity of the separate substance which has a like
    disposition, since separate substances are subsisting quiddities without
    quiddities; for the quiddity of a simple thing is the simple thing itself,
    as Avicenna says (Met. iii). On the other hand if the quiddity abstracted
    from this particular sensible be a quiddity that has a quiddity, it follows
    that the intellect has a natural aptitude to abstract this quiddity, and
    consequently since we cannot go on indefinitely, we shall come to some
    quiddity without a quiddity, and this is what we understand by a separate
    quiddity [*Cf. FP, Question [88], Article [2]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this reasoning is seemingly inconclusive. First, because the quiddity of
    the material substance, which the intellect abstracts, is not of the same
    nature as the quiddity of the separate substances, and consequently from the
    fact that our intellect abstracts the quiddities of material substances and
    knows them, it does not follow that it knows the quiddity of a separate
    substance, especially of the Divine essence, which more than any other is of
    a different nature from any created quiddity. Secondly, because granted that
    it be of the same nature, nevertheless the knowledge of a composite thing
    would not lead to the knowledge of a separate substance, except in the point
    of the most remote genus, namely substance: and such a knowledge is
    imperfect unless it reach to the properties of a thing. For to know a man
    only as an animal is to know him only in a restricted sense and potentially:
    and much less is it to know only the nature of substance in him. Hence to
    know God thus, or other separate substances, is not to see the essence of
    God or the quiddity of a separate substance, but to know Him in His effect
    and in a mirror as it were. For this reason Avicenna in his Metaphysics.
    propounds another way of understanding separate substances, to wit that
    separate substances are understood by us by means of intentions of their
    quiddities, such intentions being images of their substances, not indeed
    abstracted therefrom, since they are immaterial, but impressed thereby on
    our souls. But this way also seems inadequate to the Divine vision which we
    seek. For it is agreed that "whatever is received into any thing is therein
    after the mode of the recipient": and consequently the likeness of the
    Divine essence impressed on our intellect will be according to the mode of
    our intellect: and the mode of our intellect falls short of a perfect
    reception of the Divine likeness. Now the lack of perfect likeness may occur
    in as many ways, as unlikeness may occur. For in one way there is a
    deficient likeness, when the form is participated according to the same
    specific nature, but not in the same measure of perfection: such is the
    defective likeness in a subject that has little whiteness in comparison with
    one that has much. In another way the likeness is yet more defective, when
    it does not attain to the same specific nature but only to the same generic
    nature: such is the likeness of an orange-colored or yellowish object in
    comparison with a white one. In another way, still more defective is the
    likeness when it does not attain to the same generic nature, but only to a
    certain analogy or proportion: such is the likeness of whiteness to man, in
    that each is a being: and in this way every likeness received into a
    creature is defective in comparison with the Divine essence. Now in order
    that the sight know whiteness, it is necessary for it to receive the
    likeness of whiteness according to its specific nature, although not
    according to the same manner of being because the form has a manner of being
    in the sense other from that which it has in the thing outside the soul: for
    if the form of yellowness were received into the eye, the eye would not be
    said to see whiteness. In like manner in order that the intellect understand
    a quiddity, it is necessary for it to receive its likeness according to the
    same specific nature, although there may possibly not be the same manner of
    being on either side: for the form which is in the intellect or sense is not
    the principle of knowledge according to its manner of being on both sides,
    but according to its common ratio with the external object. Hence it is
    clear that by no likeness received in the created intellect can God be
    understood, so that His essence be seen immediately. And for this reason
    those who held the Divine essence to be seen in this way alone, said that
    the essence itself will not be seen, but a certain brightness, as it were a
    radiance thereof. Consequently neither does this way suffice for the Divine
    vision that we seek.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore we must take the other way, which also certain philosophers held,
    namely Alexander and Averroes (De Anima iii.). For since in every knowledge
    some form is required whereby the object is known or seen, this form by
    which the intellect is perfected so as to see separate substances is neither
    a quiddity abstracted by the intellect from composite things, as the first
    opinion maintained, nor an impression left on our intellect by the separate
    substance, as the second opinion affirmed; but the separate substance itself
    united to our intellect as its form, so as to be both that which is
    understood, and that whereby it is understood. And whatever may be the case
    with other separate substances, we must nevertheless allow this to be our
    way of seeing God in His essence, because by whatever other form our
    intellect were informed, it could not be led thereby to the Divine essence.
    This, however, must not be understood as though the Divine essence were in
    reality the form of our intellect, or as though from its conjunction with
    our intellect there resulted one being simply, as in natural things from the
    natural form and matter: but the meaning is that the proportion of the
    Divine essence to our intellect is as the proportion of form to matter. For
    whenever two things, one of which is the perfection of the other, are
    received into the same recipient, the proportion of one to the other, namely
    of the more perfect to the less perfect, is as the proportion of form to
    matter: thus light and color are received into a transparent object, light
    being to color as form to matter. When therefore intellectual light is
    received into the soul, together with the indwelling Divine essence, though
    they are not received in the same way, the Divine essence will be to the
    intellect as form to matter: and that this suffices for the intellect to be
    able to see the Divine essence by the Divine essence itself may be shown as
    follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As from the natural form (whereby a thing has being) and matter, there
    results one thing simply, so from the form whereby the intellect
    understands, and the intellect itself, there results one thing intelligibly.
    Now in natural things a self-subsistent thing cannot be the form of any
    matter, if that thing has matter as one of its parts, since it is impossible
    for matter to be the form of a thing. But if this self-subsistent thing be a
    mere form, nothing hinders it from being the form of some matter and
    becoming that whereby the composite itself is [*Literally,---and becoming
    the 'whereby-it-is' of the composite itself] as instanced in the soul. Now
    in the intellect we must take the intellect itself in potentiality as
    matter, and the intelligible species as form; so that the intellect actually
    understanding will be the composite as it were resulting from both. Hence if
    there be a self-subsistent thing, that has nothing in itself besides that
    which is intelligible, such a thing can by itself be the form whereby the
    intellect understands. Now a thing is intelligible in respect of its
    actuality and not of its potentiality (Met. ix): in proof of which an
    intelligible form needs to be abstracted from matter and from all the
    properties of matter. Therefore, since the Divine essence is pure act, it
    will be possible for it to be the form whereby the intellect understands:
    and this will be the beatific vision. Hence the Master says (Sent. ii, D, 1)
    that the union of the body with the soul is an illustration of the blissful
    union of the spirit with God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted can be explained in
    three ways, according to Augustine (De Videndo Deo: Ep. cxlvii). In one way
    as excluding corporeal vision, whereby no one ever saw or will see God in
    His essence; secondly, as excluding intellectual vision of God in His
    essence from those who dwell in this mortal flesh; thirdly, as excluding the
    vision of comprehension from a created intellect. It is thus that Chrysostom
    understands the saying wherefore he adds: "By seeing, the evangelist means a
    most clear perception, and such a comprehension as the Father has of the
    Son." This also is the meaning of the evangelist, since he adds: "The
    Only-begotten Son Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him":
    his intention being to prove the Son to be God from His comprehending
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as God, by His infinite essence,
    surpasses all existing things which have a determinate being, so His
    knowledge, whereby He knows, is above all knowledge. Wherefore as our
    knowledge is to our created essence, so is the Divine knowledge to His
    infinite essence. Now two things contribute to knowledge, to wit, the knower
    and the thing known. Again, the vision whereby we shall see God in His
    essence is the same whereby God sees Himself, as regards that whereby He is
    seen, because as He sees Himself in His essence so shall we also see Him.
    But as regards the knower there is the difference that is between the Divine
    intellect and ours. Now in the order of knowledge the object known follows
    the form by which we know, since by the form of a stone we see a stone:
    whereas the efficacy of knowledge follows the power of the knower: thus he
    who has stronger sight sees more clearly. Consequently in that vision we
    shall see the same thing that God sees, namely His essence, but not so
    effectively.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Dionysius is speaking there of the
    knowledge whereby wayfarers know God by a created form, whereby our
    intellect is informed so as to see God. But as Augustine says (De Videndo
    Deo: Ep. cxlvii), "God evades every form of our intellect," because whatever
    form our intellect conceive, that form is out of proportion to the Divine
    essence. Hence He cannot be fathomed by our intellect: but our most perfect
    knowledge of Him as wayfarers is to know that He is above all that our
    intellect can conceive, and thus we are united to Him as to something
    unknown. In heaven, however, we shall see Him by a form which is His
    essence, and we shall be united to Him as to something known.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> God is light (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A9"
      >Jn. 1:9</a
    >). Now illumination is the impression of light on an illuminated object.
    And since the Divine essence is of a different mode from any likeness
    thereof impressed on the intellect, he (Dionysius) says that the "Divine
    darkness is impervious to all illumination," because, to wit, the Divine
    essence, which he calls "darkness" on account of its surpassing brightness,
    remains undemonstrated by the impression on our intellect, and consequently
    is "hidden from all knowledge." Therefore if anyone in seeing God conceives
    something in his mind, this is not God but one of God's effects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although the glory of God surpasses any
    form by which our intellect is informed now, it does not surpass the Divine
    essence, which will be the form of our intellect in heaven: and therefore
    although it is invisible now, it will be visible then.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Although there can be no proportion
    between finite and infinite, since the excess of the infinite over the
    finite is indeterminate, there can be proportionateness or a likeness to
    proportion between them: for as a finite thing is equal to some finite
    thing, so is an infinite thing equal to an infinite thing. Now in order that
    a thing be known totally, it is sometimes necessary that there be proportion
    between knower and known, because the power of the knower needs to be
    adequate to the knowableness of the thing known, and equality is a kind of
    proportion. Sometimes, however, the knowableness of the thing surpasses the
    power of the knower, as when we know God, or conversely when He knows
    creatures: and then there is no need for proportion between knower and
    known, but only for proportionateness; so that, to wit, as the knower is to
    the knowable object, so is the knowable object to the fact of its being
    known: and this proportionateness suffices for the infinite to be known by
    the finite, or conversely.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that proportion according to the strict sense in which it
    is employed signifies a ratio of quantity to quantity based on a certain
    fixed excess or equality; but is further transferred to denote any ratio of
    any one thing to another; and in this sense we say that matter should be
    proportionate to its form. In this sense nothing hinders our intellect,
    although finite, being described as proportionate to the vision of the
    Divine essence; but not to the comprehension thereof, on account of its
    immensity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> Likeness and distance are twofold. One
    is according to agreement in nature; and thus God is more distant from the
    created intellect than the created intelligible is from the sense. The other
    is according to proportionateness; and thus it is the other way about, for
    sense is not proportionate to the knowledge of the immaterial, as the
    intellect is proportionate to the knowledge of any immaterial object
    whatsoever. It is this likeness and not the former that is requisite for
    knowledge, for it is clear that the intellect understanding a stone is not
    like it in its natural being; thus also the sight apprehends red honey and
    red gall, though it does not apprehend sweet honey, for the redness of gall
    is more becoming to honey as visible, than the sweetness of honey to
    honey.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> In the vision wherein God will be seen
    in His essence, the Divine essence itself will be the form, as it were, of
    the intellect, by which it will understand: nor is it necessary for them to
    become one in being, but only to become one as regards the act of
    understanding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> We do not uphold the saying of Avicenna
    as regards the point at issue, for in this other philosophers also disagree
    with him. Unless perhaps we might say that Avicenna refers to the knowledge
    of separate substances, in so far as they are known by the habits of
    speculative sciences and the likeness of other things. Hence he makes this
    statement in order to prove that in us knowledge is not a substance but an
    accident. Nevertheless, although the Divine essence is more distant, as to
    the property of its nature, from our intellect, than is the substance of an
    angel, it surpasses it in the point of intelligibility, since it is pure act
    without any admixture of potentiality, which is not the case with other
    separate substances. Nor will that knowledge whereby we shall see God in His
    essence be in the genus of accident as regards that whereby He will be seen,
    but only as regards the act of the one who understands Him, for this act
    will not be the very substance either of the person understanding or of the
    thing understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: A substance that is separate from matter understands both itself and
    other things; and in both cases the authority quoted can be verified. For
    since the very essence of a separate substance is of itself intelligible and
    actual, through being separate from matter, it is clear that when a separate
    substance understands itself, that which understands and that which is
    understood are absolutely identical, for it does not understand itself by an
    intention abstracted from itself, as we understand material objects. And
    this is apparently the meaning of the Philosopher (De Anima iii.) as
    indicated by the Commentator (De Anima iii). But when it understands other
    things, the object actually understood becomes one with the intellect in
    act, in so far as the form of the object understood becomes the form of the
    intellect, for as much as the intellect is in act; not that it becomes
    identified with the essence of the intellect, as Avicenna proves (De
    Natural. vi.), because the essence of the intellect remains one under two
    forms whereby it understands two things in succession, in the same way as
    primary matter remains one under various forms. Hence also the Commentator
    (De Anima iii.) compares the passive intellect, in this respect, to primary
    matter. Thus it by no means follows that our intellect in seeing God becomes
    the very essence of God, but that the latter is compared to it as its
    perfection or form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: These and all like authorities must be understood to refer to the
    knowledge whereby we know God on the way, for the reason given above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: The infinite is unknown if we take it in the privative sense, as such,
    because it indicates removal of completion whence knowledge of a thing is
    derived. Wherefore the infinite amounts to the same as matter subject to
    privation, as stated in Phys. iii. But if we take the infinite in the
    negative sense, it indicates the absence of limiting matter, since even a
    form is somewhat limited by its matter. Hence the infinite in this sense is
    of itself most knowable; and it is in this way that God is infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Augustine is speaking of bodily vision, by which God will never be seen.
    This is evident from what precedes: "For no man hath seen God at any time,
    nor can any man see Him as these things which we call visible are seen: in
    this way He is by nature invisible even as He is incorruptible." As,
    however, He is by nature supremely being, so He is in Himself supremely
    intelligible. But that He be for a time not understood by us is owing to our
    defect: wherefore that He be seen by us after being unseen is owing to a
    change not in Him but in us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: In heaven God will be seen by the saints as He is, if this be referred to
    the mode of the object seen, for the saints will see that God has the mode
    which He has. But if we refer the mode to the knower, He will not be seen as
    He is, because the created intellect will not have so great an efficacy in
    seeing, as the Divine essence has to the effect of being seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: There is a threefold medium both in bodily and in intellectual vision.
    The first is the medium "under which" the object is seen, and this is
    something perfecting the sight so as to see in general, without determining
    the sight to any particular object. Such is bodily light in relation to
    bodily vision; and the light of the active intellect in relation to the
    passive intellect, in so far as this light is a medium. The second is the
    light "by which" the object is seen, and this is the visible form whereby
    either sight is determined to a special object, for instance by the form of
    a stone to know a stone. The third is the medium "in which" it is seen; and
    this is something by gazing on which the sight is led to something else:
    thus by looking in a mirror it is led to see the things reflected in the
    mirror, and by looking at an image it is led to the thing represented by the
    image. In this way, too, the intellect from knowing an effect is led to the
    cause, or conversely. Accordingly in the heavenly vision there will be no
    third medium, so that, to wit, God be known by the images of other things,
    as He is known now, for which reason we are said to see now in a glass: nor
    will there be the second medium, because the essence itself of God will be
    that whereby our intellect will see God. But there will only be the first
    medium, which will upraise our intellect so that it will be possible for it
    to be united to the uncreated substance in the aforesaid manner. Yet this
    medium will not cause that knowledge to be mediate, because it does not come
    in between the knower and the thing known, but is that which gives the
    knower the power to know [*Cf. FP, Question [12], Article [5]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Corporeal creatures are not said to be seen immediately, except when that
    which in them is capable of being brought into conjunction with the sight is
    in conjunction therewith. Now they are not capable of being in conjunction
    with the sight of their essence on account of their materiality: hence they
    are seen immediately when their image is in conjunction with the sight. But
    God is able to be united to the intellect by His essence: wherefore He would
    not be seen immediately, unless His essence were united to the intellect:
    and this vision, which is effected immediately, is called "vision of face."
    Moreover the likeness of the corporeal object is received into the sight
    according to the same ratio as it is in the object, although not according
    to the same mode of being. Wherefore this likeness leads to the object
    directly: whereas no likeness can lead our intellect in this way to God, as
    shown above: and for this reason the comparison fails.<br />

    Whether after the resurrection the saints will see God with the eyes of the
    body? [*Cf. FP, Question [12], Article [3]]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that after the resurrection the
    saints will see God with the eyes of the body. Because the glorified eye has
    greater power than one that is not glorified. Now the blessed Job saw God
    with his eyes (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+42%3A5"
      >Job 42:5</a
    >): "With the hearing of the ear, I have heard Thee, but now my eye seeth
    Thee." Much more therefore will the glorified eye be able to see God in His
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+19%3A26"
      >Job 19:26</a
    >): "In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour [Vulg.: 'my God']." Therefore in
    heaven God will be seen with the eyes of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further. Augustine, speaking of the sight of the
    glorified eyes, expresses himself as follows (De Civ. Dei xxii): "A greater
    power will be in those eyes, not to see more keenly, as certain serpents or
    eagles are reported to see (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed by
    these animals they can see only corporeal things), but to see even
    incorporeal things." Now any power that is capable of knowing incorporeal
    things can be upraised to see God. Therefore the glorified eyes will be able
    to see God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the disparity of corporeal to
    incorporeal things is the same as of incorporeal to corporeal. Now the
    incorporeal eye can see corporeal things. Therefore the corporeal eye can
    see the incorporeal: and consequently the same conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Gregory, commenting on Job 4:16, "There
    stood one whose countenance I knew not," says (Moral. v): "Man who, had he
    been willing to obey the command, would have been spiritual in the flesh,
    became, by sinning, carnal even in mind." Now through becoming carnal in
    mind, "he thinks only of those things which he draws to his soul by the
    images of bodies" (Moral. v). Therefore when he will be spiritual in the
    flesh (which is promised to the saints after the resurrection), he will be
    able even in the flesh to see spiritual things. Therefore the same
    conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, man can be beatified by God alone. Now
    he will be beatified not only in soul but also in body. Therefore God will
    be visible not only to his intellect but also to his flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, even as God is present to the intellect
    by His essence, so will He be to the senses, because He will be "all in all"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A28"
      >1 Cor. 15:28</a
    >). Now He will be seen by the intellect through the union of His essence
    therewith. Therefore He will also be visible to the sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose, commenting on Lk. 1:2, "There
    appeared to him an angel," says: "God is not sought with the eyes of the
    body, nor surveyed by the sight, nor clasped by the touch." Therefore God
    will by no means be visible to the bodily sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Jerome, commenting on Is. 6:1, "I saw the Lord sitting," says: "The
    Godhead not only of the Father, but also of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is
    visible, not to carnal eyes, but only to the eyes of the mind, of which it
    is said: Blessed are the pure in heart."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Jerome says again (as quoted by Augustine, Ep. cxlvii): "An
    incorporeal thing is invisible to a corporeal eye." But God is supremely
    incorporeal. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Augustine says (De Videndo Deo, Ep. cxlvii): "No man hath seen God
    as He is at any time, neither in this life, nor in the angelic life, in the
    same way as these visible things which are seen with the corporeal sight."
    Now the angelic life is the life of the blessed, wherein they will live
    after the resurrection. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. xiv.), "man is said to be made to
    God's image inasmuch as he is able to see God." But man is in God's image as
    regards his mind, and not as regards his flesh. Therefore he will see God
    with his mind and not with his flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is perceptible to the senses of the
    body in two ways, directly and indirectly. A thing is perceptible directly
    if it can act directly on the bodily senses. And a thing can act directly
    either on sense as such or on a particular sense as such. That which acts
    directly in this second way on a sense is called a proper sensible, for
    instance color in relation to the sight, and sound in relation to the
    hearing. But as sense as such makes use of a bodily organ, nothing can be
    received therein except corporeally, since whatever is received into a thing
    is therein after the mode of the recipient. Hence all sensibles act on the
    sense as such, according to their magnitude: and consequently magnitude and
    all its consequences, such as movement, rest, number, and the like, are
    called common sensibles, and yet they are direct objects of sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    An indirect object of sense is that which does not act on the sense, neither
    as sense nor as a particular sense, but is annexed to those things that act
    on sense directly: for instance Socrates; the son of Diares; a friend and
    the like which are the direct object of the intellect's knowledge in the
    universal, and in the particular are the object of the cogitative power in
    man, and of the estimative power in other animals. The external sense is
    said to perceive things of this kind, although indirectly, when the
    apprehensive power (whose province it is to know directly this thing known),
    from that which is sensed directly, apprehends them at once and without any
    doubt or discourse (thus we see that a person is alive from the fact that he
    speaks): otherwise the sense is not said to perceive it even indirectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I say then that God can nowise be seen with the eyes of the body, or
    perceived by any of the senses, as that which is seen directly, neither
    here, nor in heaven: for if that which belongs to sense as such be removed
    from sense, there will be no sense, and in like manner if that which belongs
    to sight as sight be removed therefrom, there will be no sight. Accordingly
    seeing that sense as sense perceives magnitude, and sight as such a sense
    perceives color, it is impossible for the sight to perceive that which is
    neither color nor magnitude, unless we call it a sense equivocally. Since
    then sight and sense will be specifically the same in the glorified body, as
    in a non-glorified body, it will be impossible for it to see the Divine
    essence as an object of direct vision; yet it will see it as an object of
    indirect vision, because on the one hand the bodily sight will see so great
    a glory of God in bodies, especially in the glorified bodies and most of all
    in the body of Christ, and, on the other hand, the intellect will see God so
    clearly, that God will be perceived in things seen with the eye of the body,
    even as life is perceived in speech. For although our intellect will not
    then see God from seeing His creatures, yet it will see God in His creatures
    seen corporeally. This manner of seeing God corporeally is indicated by
    Augustine (De Civ. Dei xxii), as is clear if we take note of his words, for
    he says: "It is very credible that we shall so see the mundane bodies of the
    new heaven and the new earth, as to see most clearly God everywhere present,
    governing all corporeal things, not as we now see the invisible things of
    God as understood by those that are made, but as when we see men... we do
    not believe but see that they live."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of Job refers to the
    spiritual eye, of which the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A18"
      >Eph. 1:18</a
    >): "The eyes of our [Vulg.: 'your'] heart enlightened."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The passage quoted does not mean that we
    are to see God with the eyes of the flesh, but that, in the flesh, we shall
    see God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In these words Augustine speaks as one
    inquiring and conditionally. This appears from what he had said before:
    "Therefore they will have an altogether different power, if they shall see
    that incorporeal nature": and then he goes on to say: "Accordingly a greater
    power," etc., and afterwards he explains himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> All knowledge results from some kind of
    abstraction from matter. Wherefore the more a corporeal form is abstracted
    from matter, the more is it a principle of knowledge. Hence it is that a
    form existing in matter is in no way a principle of knowledge, while a form
    existing in the senses is somewhat a principle of knowledge, in so far as it
    is abstracted from matter, and a form existing in the intellect is still
    better a principle of knowledge. Therefore the spiritual eye, whence the
    obstacle to knowledge is removed, can see a corporeal object: but it does
    not follow that the corporeal eye, in which the cognitive power is deficient
    as participating in matter, be able to know perfectly incorporeal objects of
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although the mind that has become carnal
    cannot think but of things received from the senses, it thinks of them
    immaterially. In like manner whatever the sight apprehends it must always
    apprehend it corporeally: wherefore it cannot know things which cannot be
    apprehended corporeally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Beatitude is the perfection of man as
    man. And since man is man not through his body but through his soul, and the
    body is essential to man, in so far as it is perfected by the soul: it
    follows that man's beatitude does not consist chiefly otherwise than in an
    act of the soul, and passes from the soul on to the body by a kind of
    overflow, as explained above (<a href="XP085.html#XPQ85OUTP1"
      >Question [85]</a
    >, <a href="XP085.html#XPQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Yet our body will
    have a certain beatitude from seeing God in sensible creatures: and
    especially in Christ's body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The intellect can perceive spiritual
    things, whereas the eyes of the body cannot: wherefore the intellect will be
    able to know the Divine essence united to it, but the eyes of the body will
    not.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the saints, seeing God in His

    1.): "The angels know all things in the World of God, before they happen."
    Now the saints will be equal to the angels of God (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >). Therefore the saints also in seeing God see all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Dial. iv.): "Since all see
    God there with equal clearness, what do they not know, who know Him Who
    knows all things?" and he refers to the blessed who see God in His essence.
    Therefore those who see God in His essence know all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is stated in De Anima (iii, text. 7),
    that "when an intellect understands the greatest things, it is all the more
    able to understand the least things." Now God is the greatest of
    intelligible things. Therefore the power of the intellect is greatly
    increased by understanding Him. Therefore the intellect seeing Him
    understands all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the intellect is not hindered from
    understanding a thing except by this surpassing it. Now no creature
    surpasses the intellect that understands God, since, as Gregory says (Dial.
    ii.), "to the soul which sees its Creator all creatures are small."
    Therefore those who see God in His essence know all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every passive power that is not reduced
    to act is imperfect. Now the passive intellect of the human soul is a power
    that is passive as it were to the knowledge of all things, since "the
    passive intellect is in which all are in potentiality" (De Anima iii, text.
    18). If then in that beatitude it were not to understand all things, it
    would remain imperfect, which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, whoever sees a mirror sees the things
    reflected in the mirror. Now all things are reflected in the Word of God as
    in a mirror, because He is the type and image of all. Therefore the saints
    who see the Word in its essence see all created things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, according to Prov. 10:24, "to the just
    their desire shall be given." Now the just desire to know all things, since
    "all men desire naturally to know," and nature is not done away by glory.
    Therefore God will grant them to know all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, ignorance is one of the penalties of the
    present life [*Cf. FS, Question [85], Article [3]]. Now all penalty will be
    removed from the saints by glory. Therefore all ignorance will be removed:
    and consequently they will know all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, the beatitude of the saints is in their
    soul before being in their body. Now the bodies of the saints will be
    reformed in glory to the likeness of Christ's body (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++3%3A21"
      >Phil. 3:21</a
    >). Therefore their souls will be perfected in likeness to the soul of
    Christ. Now Christ's soul sees all things in the Word. Therefore all the
    souls of the saints will also see all things in the Word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, the intellect, like the senses, knows all the things with the
    image of which it is informed. Now the Divine essence shows a thing forth
    more clearly than any other image thereof. Therefore since in that blessed
    vision the Divine essence becomes the form as it were of our intellect, it
    would seem that the saints seeing God see all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, the Commentator says (De Anima iii), that "if the active
    intellect were the form of the passive intellect, we should understand all
    things." Now the Divine essence represents all things more clearly than the
    active intellect. Therefore the intellect that sees God in His essence knows
    all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Further, the lower angels are enlightened by the higher about the things
    they are ignorant of, for the reason that they know not all things. Now
    after the day of judgment, one angel will not enlighten another; for then
    all superiority will cease, as a gloss observes on 1 Cor. 15:24, "When He
    shall have brought to nought," etc. Therefore the lower angels will then
    know all things, and for the same reason all the other saints who will see
    God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Hier. Eccles. vi): "The
    higher angels cleanse the lower angels from ignorance." Now the lower angels
    see the Divine essence. Therefore an angel while seeing the Divine essence
    may be ignorant of certain things. But the soul will not see God more
    perfectly than an angel. Therefore the souls seeing God will not necessarily
    see all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Christ alone has the spirit not "by measure" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A34"
      >Jn. 3:34</a
    >). Now it becomes Christ, as having the spirit without measure, to know all
    things in the Word: wherefore it is stated in the same place (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A35"
      >Jn. 3:35</a
    >) that "the Father... hath given all things into His hand." Therefore none
    but Christ is competent to know all things in the Word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the more perfectly a principle is known, the more of its effects
    are known thereby. Now some of those who see God in His essence will know
    God more perfectly than others. Therefore some will know more things than
    others, and consequently every one will not know all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God by seeing his essence knows all things
    whatsoever that are, shall be, or have been: and He is said to know these
    things by His "knowledge of vision," because He knows them as though they
    were present in likeness to corporeal vision. Moreover by seeing this
    essence He knows all that He can do, although He never did them, nor ever
    will: else He would not know His power perfectly; since a power cannot be
    known unless its objects be known: and this is called His "science" or
    "knowledge of simple intelligence." Now it is impossible for a created
    intellect, by seeing the Divine essence, to know all that God can do,
    because the more perfectly a principle is known, the more things are known
    in it; thus in one principle of demonstration one who is quick of
    intelligence sees more conclusions than one who is slow of intelligence.
    Since then the extent of the Divine power is measured according to what it
    can do, if an intellect were to see in the Divine essence all that God can
    do, its perfection in understanding would equal in extent the Divine power
    in producing its effects, and thus it would comprehend the Divine power,
    which is impossible for any created intellect to do. Yet there is a created
    intellect, namely the soul of Christ [*Cf. TP, Question [16], Article [2]],
    which knows in the Word all that God knows by the knowledge of vision. But
    regarding others who see the Divine essence there are two opinions. For some
    say that all who see God in His essence see all that God sees by His
    knowledge of vision. This, however, is contrary to the sayings of holy men,
    who hold that angels are ignorant of some things; and yet it is clear that
    according to faith all the angels see God in His essence. Wherefore others
    say that others than Christ, although they see God in His essence, do not
    see all that God sees because they do not comprehend the Divine essence. For
    it is not necessary that he who knows a cause should know all its effects,
    unless he comprehend the cause: and this is not in the competency of a
    created intellect. Consequently of those who see God in His essence, each
    one sees in His essence so much the more things according as he sees the
    Divine essence the more clearly: and hence it is that one is able to
    instruct another concerning these things. Thus the knowledge of the angels
    and of the souls of the saints can go on increasing until the day of
    judgment, even as other things pertaining to the accidental reward. But
    afterwards it will increase no more, because then will be the final state of
    things, and in that state it is possible that all will know everything that
    God knows by the knowledge of vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of Isidore, that "the angels
    know in the Word all things before they happen," cannot refer to those
    things which God knows only by the knowledge of simple intelligence, because
    those things will never happen; but it must refer to those things which God
    knows only by the knowledge of vision. Even of these he does not say that
    all the angels know them all, but that perhaps some do; and that even those
    who know do not know all perfectly. For in one and the same thing there are
    many intelligible aspects to be considered, such as its various properties
    and relations to other things: and it is possible that while one thing is
    known in common by two persons, one of them perceives more aspects, and that
    the one learns these aspects from the other. Hence Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
    iv) that "the lower angels learn from the higher angels the intelligible
    aspects of things." Wherefore it does not follow that even the angels who
    know all creatures are able to see all that can be understood in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It follows from this saying of Gregory
    that this blessed vision suffices for the seeing of all things on the part
    of the Divine essence, which is the medium by which one sees, and whereby
    God sees all things. That all things, however, are not seen is owing to the
    deficiency of the created intellect which does not comprehend the Divine
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The created intellect sees the Divine
    essence not according to the mode of that same essence, but according to its
    own mode which is finite. Hence its efficacy in knowing would need to be
    infinitely increased by reason of that vision in order for it to know all
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Defective knowledge results not only
    from excess and deficiency of the knowable object in relation to the
    intellect, but also from the fact that the aspect of knowableness is not
    united to the intellect: thus sometimes the sight sees not a stone, through
    the image of the stone not being united to it. And although the Divine
    essence which is the type of all things is united to the intellect of one
    who sees God, it is united thereto not as the type of all things, but as the
    type of some and of so much the more according as one sees the Divine
    essence more fully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> When a passive power is perceptible by
    several perfections in order, if it be perfected with its ultimate
    perfection, it is not said to be imperfect, even though it lack some of the
    preceding dispositions. Now all knowledge by which the created intellect is
    perfected is directed to the knowledge of God as its end. Wherefore he who
    sees God in His essence, even though he know nothing else, would have a
    perfect intellect: nor is his intellect more perfect through knowing
    something else besides Him, except in so far as it sees Him more fully.
    Hence Augustine says (Confess. v.): "Unhappy is he who knoweth all these"
    (namely, creatures), "and knoweth not Thee: but happy whoso knoweth Thee,
    though he know not these. And whoso knoweth both Thee and them is not the
    happier for them but for Thee only."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> This mirror has a will: and even as He
    will show Himself to whom He will, so will He show in Himself whatsoever He
    will. Nor does the comparison with a material mirror hold, for it is not in
    its power to be seen or not to be seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that in a material mirror both object and mirror are seen
    under their proper image; although the mirror be seen through an image
    received from the thing itself, whereas the stone is seen through its proper
    image reflected in some other thing, where the reason for seeing the one is
    the reason for seeing the other. But in the uncreated mirror a thing is seen
    through the form of the mirror, just as an effect is seen through the image
    of its cause and conversely. Consequently it does not follow that whoever
    sees the eternal mirror sees all that is reflected in that mirror: since he
    who sees the cause does not of necessity see all its effects, unless he
    comprehend the cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The desire of the saints to know all
    things will be fulfilled by the mere fact of their seeing God: just as their
    desire to possess all good things will be fulfilled by their possessing God.
    For as God suffices the affections in that He has perfect goodness, and by
    possessing Him we possess all goods as it were, so does the vision of Him
    suffice the intellect: "Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A8">Jn. 14:8</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> Ignorance properly so called denotes a
    privation and thus it is a punishment: for in this way ignorance is
    nescience of things, the knowledge of which is a duty or a necessity. Now
    the saints in heaven will not be ignorant of any of these things. Sometimes,
    however, ignorance is taken in a broad sense of any kind of nescience: and
    thus the angels and saints in heaven will be ignorant of certain things.
    Hence Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "the angels will be cleansed from
    their ignorance." In this sense ignorance is not a penalty but a defect. Nor
    is it necessary for all such defects to be done away by glory: for thus we
    might say that it was a defect in Pope Linus that he did not attain to the
    glory of Peter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> Our body will be conformed to the body
    of Christ in glory, in likeness but not in equality, for it will be endowed
    with clarity even as Christ's body, but not equally. In like manner our soul
    will have glory in likeness to the soul of Christ, but not in equality
    thereto: thus it will have knowledge even as Christ's soul, but not so
    great, so as to know all as Christ's soul does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Although the Divine essence is the type of all things knowable it will
    not be united to each created intellect according as it is the type of all.
    Hence the objection proves nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: The active intellect is a form proportionate to the passive intellect;
    even as the passive power of matter is proportionate to the power of the
    natural agent, so that whatsoever is in the passive power of matter or the
    passive intellect is in the active power of the active intellect or of the
    natural agent. Consequently if the active intellect become the form of the
    passive intellect, the latter must of necessity know all those things to
    which the power of the active intellect extends. But the Divine essence is
    not a form proportionate to our intellect in this sense. Hence the
    comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b
    >: Nothing hinders us from saying that after the judgment day, when the
    glory of men and angels will be consummated once for all, all the blessed
    will know all that God knows by the knowledge of vision, yet so that not all
    will see all in the Divine essence. Christ's soul, however, will see clearly
    all things therein, even as it sees them now; while others will see therein
    a greater or lesser number of things according to the degree of clearness
    wherewith they will know God: and thus Christ's soul will enlighten all
    other souls concerning those things which it sees in the Word better than
    others. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++21%3A23"
      >Apoc. 21:23</a
    >): "The glory of God shall enlighten the city of Jerusalem [*Vulg.: 'hath
    enlightened it'], and the Lamb is the lamp thereof." In like manner the
    higher souls will enlighten the lower (not indeed with a new enlightening,
    so as to increase the knowledge of the lower), but with a kind of continued
    enlightenment; thus we might understand the sun to enlighten the atmosphere
    while at a standstill. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++12%3A3"
      >Dan. 12:3</a
    >): "They that instruct many to justice" shall shine "as stars for all
    eternity." The statement that the superiority of the orders will cease
    refers to their present ordinate ministry in our regard, as is clear from
    the same gloss.<br />
