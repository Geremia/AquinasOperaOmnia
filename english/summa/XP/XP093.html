<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider the happiness of the saints and their mansions. 
Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP093.html#XPQ93A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the happiness of the saints will increase after the judgment?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP093.html#XPQ93A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the degrees of happiness should be called mansions?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP093.html#XPQ93A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the various mansions differ according to various degrees of 
charity?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the happiness of the saints will not be 
greater after the judgment than before. For the nearer a thing approaches 
to the Divine likeness, the more perfectly does it participate happiness. 
Now the soul is more like God when separated from the body than when 
united to it. Therefore its happiness is greater before being reunited to 
the body than after.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, power is more effective when it is united than when 
divided. Now the soul is more united when separated from the body than 
when it is joined to the body. Therefore it has then greater power for 
operation, and consequently has a more perfect share of happiness, since 
this consists in action [*Cf. FS, Question [3], Article [2]].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, beatitude consists in an act of the speculative 
intellect. Now the intellect, in its act, makes no use of a bodily organ; 
and consequently by being reunited to the body the soul does not become 
capable of more perfect understanding. Therefore the soul's happiness is 
not greater after than before the judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, nothing can be greater than the infinite, and  so the 
addition of the finite to the infinite does not result in something 
greater than the infinite by itself. Now the beatified soul before its 
reunion with the body is rendered happy by rejoicing in the infinite 
good, namely God; and after the resurrection of the body it will rejoice 
in nothing else except perhaps the glory of the body, and this is a 
finite good. Therefore their joy after the resumption of the body will 
not be greater than before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Apoc. 6:9, "I saw under the altar the souls 
of them that were slain," says: "At present the souls of the saints are 
under the altar, i.e. less exalted than they will be." Therefore their 
happiness will be greater after the resurrection than after their death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, just as happiness is bestowed on the good as a reward, so is 
unhappiness awarded to the wicked. But the unhappiness of the wicked 
after reunion with their bodies will be greater than before, since they 
will be punished not only in the soul but also in the body. Therefore the 
happiness of the saints will be greater after the resurrection of the 
body than before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is manifest that the happiness of the saints will 
increase in extent after the resurrection, because their happiness will 
then be not only in the soul but also in the body. Moreover, the soul's 
happiness also will increase in extent, seeing that the soul will rejoice 
not only in its own good, but also in that of the body. We may also say 
that the soul's happiness will increase in intensity [*Cf. FS, Question [4], Article [5]
, ad 5, where St. Thomas retracts this statement]. For man's body may be 
considered in two ways: first, as being dependent on the soul for its 
completion; secondly, as containing something that hampers the soul in 
its operations, through the soul not perfectly completing the body. As 
regards the first way of considering the body, its union with the soul 
adds a certain perfection to the soul, since every part is imperfect, and 
is completed in its whole; wherefore the whole is to the part as form to 
matter. Consequently the soul is more perfect in its natural being, when 
it is in the whole---namely, man who results from the union of soul and 
body---than when it is a separate part. But as regards the second 
consideration the union of the body hampers the perfection of the soul, 
wherefore it is written (Wis. 9:15) that "the corruptible body is a load 
upon the soul." If, then, there be removed from the body all those things 
wherein it hampers the soul's action, the soul will be simply more 
perfect while existing in such a body than when separated therefrom. Now 
the more perfect a thing is in being, the more perfectly is it able to 
operate: wherefore the operation of the soul united to such a body will 
be more perfect than the operation of the separated soul. But the 
glorified body will be a body of this description, being altogether 
subject to the spirit. Therefore, since beatitude consists in an 
operation [*Cf. FS, Question [3], Article [2], seqq.], the soul's happiness after its 
reunion with the body will be more perfect than before. For just as the 
soul separated from a corruptible body is able to operate more perfectly 
than when  united thereto, so after it has been united to a glorified 
body, its operation will be more perfect than while it was separated. Now 
every imperfect thing desires its perfection. Hence the separated soul 
naturally desires reunion with the body and on account of this desire 
which proceeds from the soul's imperfection its operation whereby it is 
borne towards God is less intense. This agrees with the saying of 
Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35) that "on account of the body's desire it 
is held back from tending with all its might to that sovereign good."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The soul united to a glorified body is more like to God 
than when separated therefrom, in so far as when united it has more 
perfect being. For the more perfect a thing is the more it is like to 
God: even so the heart, the perfection of whose life consists in 
movement, is more like to God while in movement than while at rest, 
although God is never moved.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A power which by its own nature is capable of being in 
matter is more effective when subjected in matter than when separated 
from matter, although absolutely speaking a power separate from matter is 
more effective.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although in the act of understanding the soul does not make 
use of the body, the perfection of the body will somewhat conduce to the 
perfection of the intellectual operation in so far as through being 
united to a glorified body, the soul will be more perfect in its nature, 
and consequently more effective in its operation, and accordingly the 
good itself of the body will conduce instrumentally, as it were, to the 
operation wherein happiness consists: thus the Philosopher asserts 
(Ethic. i, 8,10) that external goods conduce instrumentally to the 
happiness of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although finite added to infinite does not make a greater 
thing, it makes more things, since finite and infinite are two things, 
while infinite taken by itself is one. Now the greater extent of joy 
regards not a greater thing but more things. Wherefore joy is increased 
in extent, through referring to God and to the body's glory, in 
comparison with the joy which referred to God. Moreover, the body's glory 
will conduce to the intensity of the joy that refers to God, in so far as 
it will conduce to the more perfect operation whereby the soul tends to 
God: since the more perfect is a becoming operation, the greater the 
delight [*Cf. FS, Question [32], Article [1]], as stated in Ethic. x, 8.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the degrees of beatitude should be called mansions?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of beatitude should not be called 
mansions. For beatitude implies the notion of a reward: whereas mansion 
denotes nothing pertaining to a reward. Therefore the various degrees of 
beatitude should not be called mansions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, mansion seemingly denotes a place. Now the  place where 
the saint will be beatified is not corporeal but spiritual, namely God 
Who is one. Therefore there is but one mansion: and consequently the 
various degrees of beatitude should not be called mansions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as in heaven there will be men of various merits, so are 
there now in purgatory, and were in the limbo of the fathers. But various 
mansions are not distinguished in purgatory and limbo. Therefore in like 
manner neither should they be distinguished in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14:2">Jn. 14:2</a>): "In My Father's house there 
are many mansions": and Augustine expounds this in reference to the 
different degrees of rewards (Tract. lxvii in Joan.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in every well-ordered city there is a distinction of mansions. 
Now the heavenly kingdom is compared to a city (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++21:2">Apoc. 21:2</a>). Therefore we 
should distinguish various mansions there according to the various 
degrees of beatitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since local movement precedes all other movements, terms 
of movement, distance and the like are derived from local movement to all 
other movements according to the Philosopher (Phys., liber viii, 7). Now 
the end of local movement is a place, and when a thing has arrived at 
that place it remains there at rest and is maintained therein. Hence in 
every movement this very rest at the end of the movement is called an 
establishment [collocatio] or mansion. Wherefore since the term movement 
is transferred to the actions of the appetite and will, the attainment of 
the end of an appetitive movement is called a mansion or establishment: 
so that the unity of a house corresponds to the unity of beatitude which 
unity is on the part of the object, and the plurality of mansions 
corresponds to the differences of beatitude on the part of the blessed: 
even so we observe in natural things that there is one same place above 
to which all light objects tend, whereas each one reaches it more 
closely, according as it is lighter, so that they have various mansions 
corresponding to their various lightness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Mansion implies the notion of end and consequently of 
reward which is the end of merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though there is one spiritual place, there are different 
degrees of approaching thereto: and the various mansions correspond to 
these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who were in limbo or are now in purgatory have not 
yet attained to their end. Wherefore various mansions are not 
distinguished in purgatory or limbo, but only in heaven and hell, wherein 
is the end of the good and of the wicked.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the various mansions are not distinguished 
according to the various degrees of charity. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++25:15">Mt. 25:15</a>): "He gave to every one according to his proper virtue [Douay: 
'ability']." Now the proper ability of a thing is its natural power. 
Therefore the gifts also of grace and glory are distributed according to 
the different degrees of natural power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++61:12">Ps. 61:12</a>): "Thou wilt render to every 
man according to his works." Now that which is rendered is the measure of 
beatitude. Therefore the degrees of beatitude are distinguished according 
to the diversity of works and not according to the diversity of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, reward is due to act and not to habit: hence "it is not 
the strongest who are crowned but those who engage in the conflict" 
(Ethic. i, 8) and "he . . . shall not be [Vulg.: 'is not'] crowned except 
he strive lawfully." Now beatitude is a reward. Therefore the various 
degrees of beatitude will be according to the various degrees of works 
and not according to the various degrees of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The more one will be united to God the happier will one 
be. Now the measure of charity is the measure of one's union with God. 
Therefore the diversity of beatitude will be according to the difference 
of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, "if one thing simply follows from another thing simply, the 
increase of the former follows from the increase of the latter." Now to 
have beatitude follows from having charity. Therefore to have greater 
beatitude follows from having greater charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The distinctive principle of the mansions or degrees of 
beatitude is twofold, namely proximate and remote. The proximate 
principle is the difference of disposition which will be in the blessed, 
whence will result the difference of perfection in them in respect to the 
beatific operation: while the remote principle is the merit by which they 
have obtained that beatitude. In the first way the mansions are 
distinguished according to the charity of heaven, which the more perfect 
it will be in any one, the more will it render him capable of the Divine 
clarity, on the increase of which will depend the increase in perfection 
of the Divine vision. In the second way the mansions are distinguished 
according to the charity of the way. For our actions are meritorious, not 
by the very substance of the action, but only by the habit of virtue with 
which they are informed. Now every virtue obtains its meritorious 
efficacy from charity [*Cf. FS, Question [114], Article [4]], which has the end itself 
for its object [*Cf. SS, Question [24], Article [3], ad 1]. Hence the diversity of merit 
is all traced to the diversity of charity, and thus the charity of the 
way will distinguish the mansions by way of merit. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this passage "virtue" denotes not the natural ability 
alone, but the natural ability together with the endeavour to obtain 
grace [*Cf. SS, Question [23], Article [8]]. Consequently virtue in this sense will be a 
kind of material disposition to the measure of grace and glory that one 
will receive. But charity is the formal complement of merit in relation 
to glory, and therefore the distinction of degrees in glory depends on 
the degrees of charity rather than on the degrees of the aforesaid virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Works in themselves do not demand the payment of a reward, 
except as informed by charity: and therefore the various degrees of glory 
will be according to the various degrees of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[93] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the habit of charity or of any virtue whatever is 
not a merit to which a reward is due, it is none the less the principle 
and reason of merit in the act: and consequently according to its 
diversity is the diversity of rewards. This does not prevent our 
observing a certain degree of merit in the act considered generically, 
not indeed in relation to the essential reward which is joy in God, but 
in relation to some accidental reward, which is joy in some created good.<br>
