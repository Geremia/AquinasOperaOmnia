<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the effect of this sacrament: under which head 
there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP030.html#XPQ30A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Extreme Unction avails for the remission of sins?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Extreme Unction avails for the remission of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Extreme Unction does not avail for the 
remission of sins. For when a thing can be attained by one means, no 
other is needed. Now repentance is required in the recipient of Extreme 
Unction for the remission of his sins. Therefore sins are not remitted by 
Extreme Unction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there are no more than three things in sin, the stain, 
the debt of punishment, and the remnants of sin. Now Extreme Unction does 
not remit the stain without contrition, and this remits sin even without 
Unction; nor does it remit the punishment, for if the recipient recover, 
he is still bound to fulfill the satisfaction enjoined; nor does it take 
away the remnants of sin, since the dispositions remaining from preceding 
acts still remain, as may easily be seen after recovery. Therefore  
remission of sins is by no means the effect of Extreme Unction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, remission of sins takes place, not successively, but 
instantaneously. On the other hand, Extreme Unction is not done all at 
once, since several anointings are required. Therefore the remission of 
sins is not its effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+5%3A15">James 5:15</a>): "If he be in sins, they 
shall be forgiven him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, every sacrament of the New Law confers grace. Now grace effects 
the forgiveness of sins. Therefore since Extreme Unction is a sacrament 
of the New Law, its effect is the remission of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Each sacrament was instituted for the purpose of one 
principal effect, though it may, in consequence, produce other effects 
besides. And since a sacrament causes what it signifies, the principal 
effect of a sacrament must be gathered from its signification. Now this 
sacrament is conferred by way of a kind of medicament, even as Baptism is 
conferred by way of washing, and the purpose of a medicament is to expel 
sickness. Hence the chief object of the institution of this sacrament is 
to cure the sickness of sin. Therefore, just as Baptism is a spiritual 
regeneration, and Penance, a spiritual resurrection, so Extreme Unction 
is a spiritual healing or cure. Now just as a bodily cure presupposes 
bodily life in the one who is cured, so does a spiritual cure presuppose 
spiritual life. Hence this sacrament is not an antidote to those defects 
which deprive man of spiritual life, namely. original and mortal sin, but 
is a remedy for such defects as weaken man spiritually, so as to deprive 
him of perfect vigor for acts of the life of grace or of glory; which 
defects consist in nothing else but a certain weakness and unfitness, the 
result in us of actual or original sin. against which weakness man is 
strengthened by this sacrament. Since, however, this strength is given by 
grace, which is incompatible with sin, it follows that. in consequence, 
if it finds any sin, either mortal or venial, it removes it as far as the 
guilt is concerned, provided there be no obstacle on the part of the 
recipient; just as we have stated to be the case with regard to the 
Eucharist and Confirmation (<A Href="../TP.html">TP</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP073.html#TPQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP073.html#TPQ73A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="../TP.html">TP</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP079.html#TPQ79A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence, 
too, James speaks of the remission of sin as being conditional, for he 
says: "If he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him," viz. as to the 
guilt. Because it does not always blot out sin, since it does not always 
find any: but it always remits in respect of the aforesaid weakness which 
some call the remnants of sin. Some, however, maintain that it is 
instituted chiefly as a remedy for venial sin which cannot be cured 
perfectly in this lifetime: for which reason the sacrament of the dying 
is ordained specially against venial sin. But this does not seem to be 
true, since Penance also blots out venial sins sufficiently during this 
life as to their guilt, and that we cannot avoid them after doing 
penance, does not cancel the effect of the previous penance; moreover 
this is part of the weakness mentioned above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently we must say that the principal effect of this sacrament is 
the remission of sin, as to its remnants, and, consequently, even as to 
its guilt, if it find it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the principal effect of a sacrament can be 
obtained without actually receiving that sacrament (either without any 
sacrament at all, or indirectly by means of some other sacrament), yet it 
never can be obtained without the purpose of receiving that sacrament. 
And so, since Penance was instituted chiefly against actual sin, 
whichever other sacrament may blot out sin indirectly, it does not 
exclude the necessity of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Extreme Unction remits sin in some way as to those three 
things. For, although the stain of sin is not washed out without 
contrition, yet this sacrament, by the grace which it bestows, makes the 
movement of the free will towards sin to be one of contrition, just as 
may occur in the Eucharist and Confirmation. Again it diminishes the debt 
of temporal punishment; and this indirectly, in as much as it takes away 
weakness, for a strong man bears the same punishment more easily than a 
weak man. Hence it does not follow that the measure of satisfaction is 
diminished. As to the remnants of sin, they do not mean here those 
dispositions which result from acts, and are inchoate habits so to speak, 
but a certain spiritual debility in the mind, which debility being 
removed, though such like habits or dispositions remain, the mind is not 
so easily prone to sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When many actions are ordained to one effect, the last is 
formal with respect to all the others that precede, and acts by virtue of 
them: wherefore by the last anointing is infused grace which gives the 
sacrament its effect.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether bodily health is an effect of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that bodily health is not an effect of this 
sacrament. For every sacrament is a spiritual remedy. Now a spiritual 
remedy is ordained to spiritual health, just as a bodily remedy is 
ordained to health of the body. Therefore bodily health is not an effect 
of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments always produce their effect in those who 
approach them in the proper dispositions. Now sometimes the recipient of 
this sacrament does not receive bodily health, no matter how devoutly he 
receives it. Therefore bodily health is not its effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the efficacy of this sacrament is notified to us in the 
fifth chapter of James. Now healing is ascribed there as the effect, not 
of the anointing, but of the prayer, for he says: "The prayer of faith 
shall save the sick man." Therefore bodily healing is not an effect of 
this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The operation of the Church is more  efficacious since 
Christ's Passion than before. Now, before the Passion, those whom the 
apostles anointed with oil were healed (Mk. 6:13). Therefore unction has 
its effect now in healing bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the sacraments produce their effect by signifying it. Now 
Baptism signifies and effects a spiritual washing, through the bodily 
washing in which it consists outwardly. Therefore Extreme Unction 
signifies and causes a spiritual healing through the bodily healing which 
it effects externally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as Baptism causes a spiritual cleansing from 
spiritual stains by means of a bodily washing, so this sacrament causes 
an inward healing by means of an outward sacramental healing: and even as 
the baptismal washing has the effect of a bodily washing, since it 
effects even a bodily cleansing, so too, Extreme Unction has the effect 
of a bodily remedy, namely a healing of the body. But there is a 
difference, for as much as the bodily washing causes a bodily cleansing 
by a natural property of the bodily element, and consequently always 
causes it, whereas Extreme Unction causes a bodily healing, not by a 
natural property of the matter, but by the Divine power which works 
reasonably. And since reasonable working never produces a secondary 
effect, except in so far as it is required for the principal effect, it 
follows that a bodily healing does not always ensue from this sacrament, 
but only when it is requisite for the spiritual healing: and then it 
produces it always, provided there be no obstacle on the part of the 
recipient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection proves that bodily health is not the 
principal effect of this sacrament: and this is true.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Second Objection is clear from what has been said above 
(cf. <A Href="XP029.html#XPQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="XP029.html#XPQ29A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This prayer is the form of this sacrament as stated above 
(<A Href="XP029.html#XPQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="XP029.html#XPQ29ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,9). Hence, so far as its form is concerned, this sacrament 
derives from it its efficacy in healing the body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this sacrament imprints a character?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament imprints a character. For a 
character is a distinctive sign. Now just as one who is baptized is 
distinguished from one who is not so is one who is anointed, from one who 
is not. Therefore, just as Baptism imprints a character so does Extreme 
Unction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is an anointing in the sacraments or order and 
Confirmation, as there is in this sacrament. But a character is imprinted 
in those sacraments. Therefore a character is imprinted in this one also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sacrament contains something that is a reality 
only, something that is a sacrament only, and something  that is both 
reality and sacrament. Now nothing in this sacrament can be assigned as 
both reality and sacrament except a character. Therefore in this 
sacrament also, a character is imprinted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No sacrament that imprints a character is repeated. But 
this sacrament is repeated as we shall state further on (<A Href="XP033.html#XPQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>). 
Therefore it does not imprint a character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, a sacramental character causes a distinction among those who 
are in the present Church. But Extreme Unction is given to one who is 
departing from the present Church. Therefore it does not imprint a 
character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A character is not imprinted except in those sacraments 
whereby man is deputed to some sacred duty. Now this sacrament is for no 
other purpose than a remedy, and man is not deputed thereby to do or 
receive anything holy. Therefore it does not imprint a character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A character marks a distinction of . states with regard to 
duties which have to be performed in the Church, a distinction which a 
man does not receive by being anointed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The unction of orders and Confirmation, is the unction of 
consecration whereby a man is deputed to some sacred duty, whereas this 
unction is remedial. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[30] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In this sacrament, that which is both reality and sacrament 
is not a character, but a certain inward devotion which is a kind of 
spiritual anointing.<br>
