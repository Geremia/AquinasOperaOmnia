<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the possibility of satisfaction, under which head 
there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP013.html#XPQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man can make satisfaction to God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP013.html#XPQ13A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether one man can make satisfaction for another?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man cannot make satisfaction to God. For 
satisfaction should balance the offense, as shown above (<A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>, <A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). 
But an offense against God is infinite, since it is measured by the 
person against whom it is committed, for it is a greater offense to 
strike a prince than anyone else. Therefore, as no action of man can be 
infinite, it seems that he cannot make satisfaction to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a slave cannot make compensation for a debt, since all 
that he has is his master's. But we are the slaves of God, and whatever 
good we have, we owe to Him. Therefore, as  satisfaction is compensation 
for a past offense, it seems that we cannot offer it to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if all that a man has suffices not to pay one debt, he 
cannot pay another debt. Now all that man is, all that he can do, and all 
that he has, does not suffice to pay what he owes for the blessing of 
creation, wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++40%3A16">Is. 40:16</a>) that "the wood of Libanus 
shall not be enough for a burnt offering [*Vulg.: 'Libanus shall not be 
enough to burn, nor the beasts thereof for a burnt offering']." Therefore 
by no means can he make satisfaction for the debt resulting from the 
offense committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man is bound to spend all his time in the service of 
God. Now time once lost cannot be recovered, wherefore, as Seneca 
observes (Lib. i, Ep. i, ad Lucilium) loss of time is a very grievous 
matter. Therefore man cannot make compensation to God, and the same 
conclusion follows as before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, mortal actual sin is more grievous than original sin. 
But none could satisfy for original sin unless he were both God and man. 
Neither, therefore, can he satisfy for actual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome [*Pelagius, Expos. Fidei ad Damasum] says: 
"Whoever maintains that God has commanded anything impossible to man, let 
him be anathema." But satisfaction is commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++3%3A8">Lk. 3:8</a>): "Bring forth . 
. . fruits worthy of penance." Therefore it is possible to make 
satisfaction to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, God is more merciful than any man. But it is possible to make 
satisfaction to a man. Therefore it is possible to make satisfaction to 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, there is due satisfaction when the punishment balances the 
fault, since "justice is the same as counterpassion," as the Pythagoreans 
said [*Aristotle, Ethic. v, 5; Cf. SS, Question [61], Article [4]]. Now punishment may 
equal the pleasure contained in a sin committed. Therefore satisfaction 
can be made to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man becomes God's debtor in two ways; first, by reason of 
favors received, secondly, by reason of sin committed: and just as 
thanksgiving or worship or the like regard the debt for favors received, 
so satisfaction regards the debt for sin committed. Now in giving honor 
to one's parents or to the gods, as indeed the Philosopher says (Ethic. 
viii, 14), it is impossible to repay them measure for measure, but it 
suffices that man repay as much as he can, for friendship does not demand 
measure for measure, but what is possible. Yet even this is equal 
somewhat, viz. according to proportion, for as the debt due to God is, in 
comparison with God, so is what man can do, in comparison with himself, 
so that in another way the form of justice is preserved. It is the same 
as regards satisfaction. Consequently man cannot make satisfaction to God 
if "satis" [enough] denotes quantitative equality; but he can, if it 
denote proportionate equality, as  explained above, and as this suffices 
for justice, so does it suffice for satisfaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the offense derived a certain infinity from the 
infinity of the Divine majesty, so does satisfaction derive a certain 
infinity from the infinity of Divine mercy, in so far as it is quickened 
by grace, whereby whatever man is able to repay becomes acceptable. 
Others, however, say that the offense is infinite as regards the 
aversion, and in this respect it is pardoned gratuitously, but that it is 
finite as turning to a mutable good, in which respect it is possible to 
make satisfaction for it. But this is not to the point, since 
satisfaction does not answer to sin, except as this is an offense against 
God, which is a matter, not of turning to a creature but of turning away 
from God. Others again say that even as regards the aversion it is 
possible to make satisfaction for sin in virtue of Christ's merit, which 
was, in a way, infinite. And this comes to the same as what we said 
before, since grace is given to believers through faith in the Mediator. 
If, however, He were to give grace otherwise, satisfaction would suffice 
in the way explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man, who was made to God's image, has a certain share of 
liberty, in so far as he is master of his actions through his free-will; 
so that, through acting by his free-will, he can make satisfaction to 
God, for though it belongs to God, in so far as it was bestowed on him by 
God, yet it was freely bestowed on him, that he might be his own master, 
which cannot be said of a slave.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument proves that it is impossible to make 
equivalent satisfaction to God, but not that it is impossible to make 
sufficient satisfaction to Him. For though man owes God all that he is 
able to give Him, yet it is not necessary for his salvation that he 
should actually do the whole of what he is able to do, for it is 
impossible for him, according to his present state of life, to put forth 
his whole power into any one single thing, since he has to be heedful 
about many things. And so his conduct is subject to a certain measure, 
viz. the fulfillment of God's commandments, over and above which he can 
offer something by way of satisfaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Though man cannot recover the time that is past, he can in 
the time that follows make compensation for what he should have done in 
the past, since the commandment did not exact from him the fulfillment of 
his whole power, as stated above (ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Though original sin has less of the nature of sin than 
actual sin has, yet it is a more grievous evil, because it is an 
infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could 
not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one man can fulfill satisfactory punishment for another? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one man cannot fulfill satisfactory punishment 
for another. Because merit is requisite for satisfaction. Now one man 
cannot merit or demerit for another, since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++61%3A12">Ps. 61:12</a>): 
"Thou wilt render to every man according to his works." Therefore one man 
cannot make satisfaction for another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, satisfaction is condivided with contrition and 
confession. But one man cannot be contrite or confess for another. 
Neither therefore can one make satisfaction for another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by praying for another one merits also for oneself. If 
therefore a man can make satisfaction for another, he satisfies for 
himself by satisfying for another, so that if a man satisfy for another 
he need not make satisfaction for his own sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if one can satisfy for another, as soon as he takes the 
debt of punishment on himself, this other is freed from his debt. 
Therefore the latter will go straight to heaven, if he die after the 
whole of his debt of punishment has been taken up by another; else, if he 
be punished all the same, a double punishment will be paid for the same 
sin, viz. by him who has begun to make satisfaction, and by him who is 
punished in Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++6%3A2">Gal. 6:2</a>): "Bear ye one another's 
burdens." Therefore it seems that one can bear the burden of punishment 
laid upon another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, charity avails more before God than before man. Now before man, 
one can pay another's debt for love of him. Much more, therefore, can 
this be done before the judgment seat of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Satisfactory punishment has a twofold purpose, viz. to 
pay the debt, and to serve as a remedy for the avoidance of sin. 
Accordingly, as a remedy against future sin, the satisfaction of one does 
not profit another, for the flesh of one man is not tamed by another's 
fast; nor does one man acquire the habit of well-doing, through the 
actions of another, except accidentally, in so far as a man, by his good 
actions, may merit an increase of grace for another, since grace is the 
most efficacious remedy for the avoidance of sin. But this is by way of 
merit rather than of satisfaction. on the other hand, as regards the 
payment of the debt, one man can satisfy for another, provided he be in a 
state of charity, so that his works may avail for satisfaction. Nor is it 
necessary that he who satisfies for another should undergo a greater 
punishment than the principal would have to undergo (as some maintain, 
who argue that a man profits more by his own punishment than by 
another's), because punishment derives its power of satisfaction chiefly 
from charity whereby man bears it. And since greater charity is evidenced 
by a man satisfying for another than for himself, less punishment is 
required of him who satisfies for another, than of the principal: 
wherefore we read in the Lives of the Fathers (v, 5) of one who for love 
of his brother did  penance for a sin which his brother had not 
committed, and that on account of his charity his brother was released 
from a sin which he had committed. Nor is it necessary that the one for 
whom satisfaction is made should be unable to make satisfaction himself, 
for even if he were able, he would be released from his debt when the 
other satisfied in his stead. But this is necessary in so far as the 
satisfactory punishment is medicinal: so that a man is not to be allowed 
to do penance for another, unless there be evidence of some defect in the 
penitent, either bodily, so that he is unable to bear it, or spiritual, 
so that he is not ready to undergo it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The essential reward is bestowed on a man according to his 
disposition, because the fulness of the sight of God will be according to 
the capacity of those who see Him. Wherefore just as one man is not 
disposed thereto by another's act, so one man does not merit the 
essential reward for another, unless his merit has infinite efficacy, as 
the merit of Christ, whereby children come to eternal life through 
Baptism. On the other hand, the temporal punishment due to sin after the 
guilt has been forgiven is not measured according to the disposition of 
the man to whom it is due, since sometimes the better man owes a greater 
debt of punishment. Consequently one man can merit for another as regards 
release from punishment, and one man's act becomes another's, by means of 
charity whereby we are "all one in Christ" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A28">Gal. 3:28</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Contrition is ordained against the guilt which affects a 
man's disposition to goodness or malice, so that one man is not freed 
from guilt by another's contrition. In like manner by confession a man 
submits to the sacraments of the Church: nor can one man receive a 
sacrament instead of another, since in a sacrament grace is given to the 
recipient, not to another. Consequently there is no comparison between 
satisfaction and contrition and confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the payment of the debt we consider the measure of the 
punishment, whereas in merit we regard the root which is charity: 
wherefore he that, through charity, merits for another, at least 
congruously, merits more for himself; yet he that satisfies for another 
does not also satisfy for himself, because the measure of the punishment 
does not suffice for the sins of both, although by satisfying for another 
he merits something greater than the release from punishment, viz. 
eternal life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> If this man bound himself to undergo a certain punishment, 
he would not be released from the debt before paying it: wherefore he 
himself will suffer the punishment, as long as the other makes 
satisfaction for him: and if he do not this, then both are debtors in 
respect of fulfilling this punishment, one for the sin committed, the 
other for his omission, so that it does not follow that one sin is twice 
punished.<br>
