  <p>
    We must now consider the possibility of satisfaction, under which head there
    are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP013.html#XPQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether man can make satisfaction
    to God?
  </p>

    satisfaction for another?

  <h3 align="left">Whether man can make satisfaction to God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man cannot make satisfaction
    to God. For satisfaction should balance the offense, as shown above (<a
      href="XP012.html#XPQ12OUTP1"
      >Question [12]</a
    >, <a href="XP012.html#XPQ12ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). But an offense
    against God is infinite, since it is measured by the person against whom it
    is committed, for it is a greater offense to strike a prince than anyone
    else. Therefore, as no action of man can be infinite, it seems that he
    cannot make satisfaction to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a slave cannot make compensation for a
    debt, since all that he has is his master's. But we are the slaves of God,
    and whatever good we have, we owe to Him. Therefore, as satisfaction is
    compensation for a past offense, it seems that we cannot offer it to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if all that a man has suffices not to
    pay one debt, he cannot pay another debt. Now all that man is, all that he
    can do, and all that he has, does not suffice to pay what he owes for the
    blessing of creation, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++40%3A16"
      >Is. 40:16</a
    >) that "the wood of Libanus shall not be enough for a burnt offering
    [*Vulg.: 'Libanus shall not be enough to burn, nor the beasts thereof for a
    burnt offering']." Therefore by no means can he make satisfaction for the
    debt resulting from the offense committed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man is bound to spend all his time in
    the service of God. Now time once lost cannot be recovered, wherefore, as
    Seneca observes (Lib. i, Ep. i, ad Lucilium) loss of time is a very grievous
    matter. Therefore man cannot make compensation to God, and the same
    conclusion follows as before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, mortal actual sin is more grievous than
    original sin. But none could satisfy for original sin unless he were both
    God and man. Neither, therefore, can he satisfy for actual sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome [*Pelagius, Expos. Fidei ad Damasum]
    says: "Whoever maintains that God has commanded anything impossible to man,
    let him be anathema." But satisfaction is commanded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++3%3A8"
      >Lk. 3:8</a
    >): "Bring forth... fruits worthy of penance." Therefore it is possible to
    make satisfaction to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, God is more merciful than any man. But it is possible to make
    satisfaction to a man. Therefore it is possible to make satisfaction to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, there is due satisfaction when the punishment balances the fault,
    since "justice is the same as counterpassion," as the Pythagoreans said
    [*Aristotle, Ethic. v, 5; Cf. SS, Question [61], Article [4]]. Now
    punishment may equal the pleasure contained in a sin committed. Therefore
    satisfaction can be made to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man becomes God's debtor in two ways; first, by
    reason of favors received, secondly, by reason of sin committed: and just as
    thanksgiving or worship or the like regard the debt for favors received, so
    satisfaction regards the debt for sin committed. Now in giving honor to
    one's parents or to the gods, as indeed the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii,
    14), it is impossible to repay them measure for measure, but it suffices
    that man repay as much as he can, for friendship does not demand measure for
    measure, but what is possible. Yet even this is equal somewhat, viz.
    according to proportion, for as the debt due to God is, in comparison with
    God, so is what man can do, in comparison with himself, so that in another
    way the form of justice is preserved. It is the same as regards
    satisfaction. Consequently man cannot make satisfaction to God if "satis"
    [enough] denotes quantitative equality; but he can, if it denote
    proportionate equality, as explained above, and as this suffices for
    justice, so does it suffice for satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the offense derived a certain
    infinity from the infinity of the Divine majesty, so does satisfaction
    derive a certain infinity from the infinity of Divine mercy, in so far as it
    is quickened by grace, whereby whatever man is able to repay becomes
    acceptable. Others, however, say that the offense is infinite as regards the
    aversion, and in this respect it is pardoned gratuitously, but that it is
    finite as turning to a mutable good, in which respect it is possible to make
    satisfaction for it. But this is not to the point, since satisfaction does
    not answer to sin, except as this is an offense against God, which is a
    matter, not of turning to a creature but of turning away from God. Others
    again say that even as regards the aversion it is possible to make
    satisfaction for sin in virtue of Christ's merit, which was, in a way,
    infinite. And this comes to the same as what we said before, since grace is
    given to believers through faith in the Mediator. If, however, He were to
    give grace otherwise, satisfaction would suffice in the way explained
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man, who was made to God's image, has a
    certain share of liberty, in so far as he is master of his actions through
    his free-will; so that, through acting by his free-will, he can make
    satisfaction to God, for though it belongs to God, in so far as it was
    bestowed on him by God, yet it was freely bestowed on him, that he might be
    his own master, which cannot be said of a slave.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument proves that it is
    impossible to make equivalent satisfaction to God, but not that it is
    impossible to make sufficient satisfaction to Him. For though man owes God
    all that he is able to give Him, yet it is not necessary for his salvation
    that he should actually do the whole of what he is able to do, for it is
    impossible for him, according to his present state of life, to put forth his
    whole power into any one single thing, since he has to be heedful about many
    things. And so his conduct is subject to a certain measure, viz. the
    fulfillment of God's commandments, over and above which he can offer
    something by way of satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Though man cannot recover the time that
    is past, he can in the time that follows make compensation for what he
    should have done in the past, since the commandment did not exact from him
    the fulfillment of his whole power, as stated above (ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Though original sin has less of the
    nature of sin than actual sin has, yet it is a more grievous evil, because
    it is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it
    could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man.<br />

    Whether one man can fulfill satisfactory punishment for another?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one man cannot fulfill
    satisfactory punishment for another. Because merit is requisite for
    satisfaction. Now one man cannot merit or demerit for another, since it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++61%3A12"
      >Ps. 61:12</a
    >): "Thou wilt render to every man according to his works." Therefore one
    man cannot make satisfaction for another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, satisfaction is condivided with
    contrition and confession. But one man cannot be contrite or confess for
    another. Neither therefore can one make satisfaction for another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by praying for another one merits also
    for oneself. If therefore a man can make satisfaction for another, he
    satisfies for himself by satisfying for another, so that if a man satisfy
    for another he need not make satisfaction for his own sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if one can satisfy for another, as soon
    as he takes the debt of punishment on himself, this other is freed from his
    debt. Therefore the latter will go straight to heaven, if he die after the
    whole of his debt of punishment has been taken up by another; else, if he be
    punished all the same, a double punishment will be paid for the same sin,
    viz. by him who has begun to make satisfaction, and by him who is punished
    in Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++6%3A2"
      >Gal. 6:2</a
    >): "Bear ye one another's burdens." Therefore it seems that one can bear
    the burden of punishment laid upon another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, charity avails more before God than before man. Now before man, one
    can pay another's debt for love of him. Much more, therefore, can this be
    done before the judgment seat of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Satisfactory punishment has a twofold purpose,
    viz. to pay the debt, and to serve as a remedy for the avoidance of sin.
    Accordingly, as a remedy against future sin, the satisfaction of one does
    not profit another, for the flesh of one man is not tamed by another's fast;
    nor does one man acquire the habit of well-doing, through the actions of
    another, except accidentally, in so far as a man, by his good actions, may
    merit an increase of grace for another, since grace is the most efficacious
    remedy for the avoidance of sin. But this is by way of merit rather than of
    satisfaction. on the other hand, as regards the payment of the debt, one man
    can satisfy for another, provided he be in a state of charity, so that his
    works may avail for satisfaction. Nor is it necessary that he who satisfies
    for another should undergo a greater punishment than the principal would
    have to undergo (as some maintain, who argue that a man profits more by his
    own punishment than by another's), because punishment derives its power of
    satisfaction chiefly from charity whereby man bears it. And since greater
    charity is evidenced by a man satisfying for another than for himself, less
    punishment is required of him who satisfies for another, than of the
    principal: wherefore we read in the Lives of the Fathers (v, 5) of one who
    for love of his brother did penance for a sin which his brother had not
    committed, and that on account of his charity his brother was released from
    a sin which he had committed. Nor is it necessary that the one for whom
    satisfaction is made should be unable to make satisfaction himself, for even
    if he were able, he would be released from his debt when the other satisfied
    in his stead. But this is necessary in so far as the satisfactory punishment
    is medicinal: so that a man is not to be allowed to do penance for another,
    unless there be evidence of some defect in the penitent, either bodily, so
    that he is unable to bear it, or spiritual, so that he is not ready to
    undergo it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The essential reward is bestowed on a
    man according to his disposition, because the fulness of the sight of God
    will be according to the capacity of those who see Him. Wherefore just as
    one man is not disposed thereto by another's act, so one man does not merit
    the essential reward for another, unless his merit has infinite efficacy, as
    the merit of Christ, whereby children come to eternal life through Baptism.
    On the other hand, the temporal punishment due to sin after the guilt has
    been forgiven is not measured according to the disposition of the man to
    whom it is due, since sometimes the better man owes a greater debt of
    punishment. Consequently one man can merit for another as regards release
    from punishment, and one man's act becomes another's, by means of charity
    whereby we are "all one in Christ" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A28"
      >Gal. 3:28</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Contrition is ordained against the guilt
    which affects a man's disposition to goodness or malice, so that one man is
    not freed from guilt by another's contrition. In like manner by confession a
    man submits to the sacraments of the Church: nor can one man receive a
    sacrament instead of another, since in a sacrament grace is given to the
    recipient, not to another. Consequently there is no comparison between
    satisfaction and contrition and confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the payment of the debt we consider
    the measure of the punishment, whereas in merit we regard the root which is
    charity: wherefore he that, through charity, merits for another, at least
    congruously, merits more for himself; yet he that satisfies for another does
    not also satisfy for himself, because the measure of the punishment does not
    suffice for the sins of both, although by satisfying for another he merits
    something greater than the release from punishment, viz. eternal life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> If this man bound himself to undergo a
    certain punishment, he would not be released from the debt before paying it:
    wherefore he himself will suffer the punishment, as long as the other makes
    satisfaction for him: and if he do not this, then both are debtors in
    respect of fulfilling this punishment, one for the sin committed, the other
    for his omission, so that it does not follow that one sin is twice
    punished.<br />
