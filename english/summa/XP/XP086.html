<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider the conditions in which the bodies of the damned 
will rise again. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP086.html#XPQ86A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the bodies of the damned will rise again with their 
deformities?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the bodies of the damned will rise again with 
their deformities. For that which was appointed as a punishment for sin 
should not cease except the sin be forgiven. Now the lack of limbs that 
results from mutilation, as well as all other bodily deformities, are 
appointed as punishments for sin. Therefore these deformities will not be 
taken away from the damned, seeing that they will not have received the 
forgiveness of their sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the saints will rise again to final happiness, 
so the wicked will rise again to final unhappiness. Now when the saints 
rise again nothing will be taken from them that can pertain to their 
perfection, therefore nothing pertaining to the defect or unhappiness of 
the wicked will be taken from them at the resurrection. But such are 
their deformities. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as deformity is a defect of the passible body, so 
is slowness of movement. Now slowness of movement will not be taken from 
the bodies of the damned at the resurrection, since their bodies will not 
be agile. Therefore for the same reason neither will their deformity be 
taken away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A52">1 Cor. 15:52</a>): "The dead shall rise 
again incorruptible"; where a gloss says: "The dead, i.e. sinners, or all 
the dead in general shall rise again incorruptible, i.e. without the loss 
of any limbs." Therefore the wicked will rise again without their 
deformities.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, there will be nothing in the damned to lessen the sense of 
pain. But sickness hinders the sense of pain by weakening the organ of 
sense, and in like manner the lack of a limb would prevent pain from 
affecting the whole body. Therefore the damned will rise again without 
these defects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Deformity in the human body is of two kinds. One arises 
from the lack of a limb: thus we say that a mutilated person is deformed, 
because he lacks due proportion of the parts to the whole. Deformities of 
this kind, without any doubt, will not be in the bodies of the damned, 
since all bodies of both wicked and good will rise again whole. Another 
deformity arises from the undue disposition of the parts, by reason of 
undue quantity, quality, or place---which deformity is, moreover, 
incompatible with due proportion of parts to whole. Concerning these 
deformities and like defects such as fevers and similar ailments which 
sometimes result in deformity, Augustine remained undecided and doubtful 
(Enchiridion xcii) as the Master remarks (Sent. iv, D, 44). Among modern 
masters, however, there are two opinions on this point. For some say that 
such like deformities and defects will remain in the bodies of the 
damned, because they consider that those who are damned are sentenced to 
utmost unhappiness wherefrom no affliction should be rebated. But this 
would seem unreasonable. For in the restoration of the rising body we 
look to its natural perfection rather than to its previous condition: 
wherefore those who die under perfect age will rise again in the stature 
of youth, as stated above (<A Href="XP081.html#XPQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="XP081.html#XPQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently those who had 
natural defects in the body, or deformities resulting therefrom, will be 
restored without those defects or deformities at the resurrection, unless 
the demerit of sin prevent; and so if a person rise again with such 
defects and deformities, this will be for his punishment. Now the mode of 
punishment is according to the measure of guilt. And a sinner who is 
about to be damned may be burdened with less grievous sins and yet have 
deformities and defects which one who is about to be damned has not, 
while burdened with more grievous sins. Wherefore if he who had 
deformities in this life rise again with them, while the other who had 
them not in this life, and therefore, as is clear, will rise again 
without them, though deserving of greater punishment, the mode of the 
punishment would not correspond to the amount of guilt; in fact it would 
seem that a man is more punished on account of the pains which he 
suffered in this world; which is absurd. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence others say with more reason, that He Who fashioned nature will 
wholly restore the body's nature at the resurrection. Wherefore whatever 
defect or deformity was in the body through corruption, or weakness of 
nature or of natural principles (for instance fever, purblindness, and so 
forth) will be entirely done away at the resurrection: whereas those 
defects in the human body which are the natural result of its natural 
principles, such as heaviness, passibility, and the like, will be in the 
bodies of the damned, while they will be removed from the bodies of the 
elect by the glory of the resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since in every tribunal punishment is inflicted according 
to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, the punishments which in this 
temporal life are inflicted for some particular sin are themselves 
temporal, and extend not beyond the term of this life. Hence although the 
damned are not pardoned their sins, it does not follow that there they 
will undergo the same punishments as they have in this world: but the 
Divine justice demands that there they shall suffer more severe 
punishment for eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no parity between the good and the wicked, because 
a thing can be altogether good, but not altogether evil. Hence the final 
happiness of the saints requires that they should be altogether exempt 
from all evil; whereas the final unhappiness of the wicked will not 
exclude all good, because "if a thing be wholly evil it destroys itself," 
as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 5). Hence it is necessary for the 
good of their nature to underlie the unhappiness of the damned, which 
good is the work of their perfect Creator, Who will restore that same 
nature to the perfection of its species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Slowness of movement is one of those defects which are the 
natural result of the principles of the human body; but deformity is not, 
and consequently the comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the bodies of the damned will be incorruptible?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the bodies of the damned will be corruptible. 
For everything composed of contraries must necessarily be corruptible. 
Now the bodies of the damned will be composed of the contraries whereof 
they are composed even now, else they would not be the same, neither 
specifically nor, in consequence, numerically. Therefore they will be 
corruptible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if the bodies of the damned will not be corruptible, 
this will be due either to nature, or to grace, or to glory. But it will 
not be by nature, since they will be of the same nature as now; nor will 
it be by grace or glory, since they will lack these things altogether. 
Therefore they will be corruptible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it would seem inconsistent to withdraw the greatest of 
punishments from those who are in the highest degree of  unhappiness. Now 
death is the greatest of punishments, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. 
iii, 6). Therefore death should not be withdrawn from the damned, since 
they are in the highest degree of unhappiness. Therefore their bodies 
will be corruptible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++9%3A6">Apoc. 9:6</a>): "In those days men shall 
seek death, and shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and 
death shall fly from them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the damned will be punished with an everlasting punishment both 
in soul and body (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++25%3A46">Mt. 25:46</a>): "These shall go into everlasting 
punishment." But this would not be possible if their bodies were 
corruptible. Therefore their bodies will be incorruptible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since in every movement there must needs be a principle 
of movement, movement or change may be withdrawn from a movable in two 
ways: first through absence of a principle of movement, secondly through 
an obstacle to the principle of movement. Now corruption is a kind of 
change: and consequently a body which is corruptible on account of the 
nature of its principles may be rendered incorruptible in two ways. First 
by the total removal of the principle which leads to corruption, and in 
this way the bodies of the damned will be incorruptible. For since the 
heaven is the first principle of alteration in virtue of its local 
movement, and all other secondary agents act in virtue thereof and as 
though moved thereby, it follows that at the cessation of the heavenly 
movement there is no longer any agent that can change the body by 
altering it from its natural property. Wherefore after the resurrection, 
and the cessation of the heavenly movement, there will be no quality 
capable of altering the human body from its natural quality. Now 
corruption, like generation, is the term of alteration. Hence the bodies 
of the damned will be incorruptible, and this will serve the purpose of 
Divine justice, since living for ever they will be punished for ever. 
This is in keeping with the demands of Divine justice, as we shall state 
further on (<A Href="XP086.html#XPQ86A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), even as now the corruptibility of bodies serves the 
purpose of Divine providence, by which through the corruption of one 
thing another is generated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this happens through the principle of corruption being 
hindered, and in this way the body of Adam was incorruptible, because the 
conflicting qualities that exist in man's body were withheld by the grace 
of innocence from conducing to the body's dissolution: and much more will 
they be withheld in the glorified bodies, which will be wholly subject to 
the spirit. Thus after the general resurrection the two aforesaid modes 
of incorruptibility will be united together in the bodies of the blessed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The contraries of which bodies are composed are conducive 
to corruption as secondary principles. For the first active principle 
thereof is the heavenly movement: wherefore given the movement of the 
heaven, it is necessary for a body composed of contraries to be corrupted 
unless some more powerful cause prevent  it: whereas if the heavenly 
movement be withdrawn, the contraries of which a body is composed do not 
suffice to cause corruption, even in accordance with nature, as explained 
above. But the philosophers were ignorant of a cessation in the heavenly 
movement; and consequently they held that a body composed of contraries 
is without fail corrupted in accordance with nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This incorruptibility will result from nature, not as 
though there were some principle of incorruption in the bodies of the 
damned, but on account of the cessation of the active principle of 
corruption, as shown above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although death is simply the greatest of punishments, yet 
nothing prevents death conducing, in a certain respect, to a cessation of 
punishments; and consequently the removal of death may contribute to the 
increase of punishment. For as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 9), "Life 
is pleasant to all, for all desire to be . . . But we must not apply this 
to a wicked or corrupt life, nor one passed in sorrow." Accordingly just 
as life is simply pleasant, but not the life that is passed in sorrows, 
so too death, which is the privation of life, is painful simply, and the 
greatest of punishments, inasmuch as it deprives one of the primary good, 
namely being, with which other things are withdrawn. But in so far as it 
deprives one of a wicked life, and of such as is passed in sorrow, it is 
a remedy for pains, since it puts an end to them. and consequently the 
withdrawal of death leads to the increase of punishments by making them 
everlasting. If however we say that death is penal by reason of the 
bodily pain which the dying feel, without doubt the damned will continue 
to feel a far greater pain: wherefore they are said to be in "everlasting 
death," according to the Psalm (48:15): "Death shall feed upon them."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the bodies of the damned will be impassible?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the bodies of the damned will be impassible. 
For, according to the Philosopher (Topic. vi), "increase of passion 
results in loss of substance." Now "if a finite thing be continually 
lessened, it must needs at length be done away" (Phys. i, 4). Therefore 
if the bodies of the damned will be passible, and will be ever suffering, 
they will at length be done away and corrupted: and this has been shown 
to be false (<A Href="XP086.html#XPQ86A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore they will be impassible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every agent likens the patient to itself. If then the 
bodies of the damned are passive to the fire the fire will liken them to 
itself. Now fire does not consume bodies except in so far as in likening 
them to itself it disintegrates them. Therefore if the bodies of the 
damned will be passible they will at length be consumed by the fire, and 
thus the same conclusion follows as before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those animals, for instance the salamander,  which are 
said to remain living in fire without being destroyed, are not distressed 
by the fire: because an animal is not distressed by bodily pain, unless 
the body in some way is hurt thereby. If therefore the bodies of the 
damned can, like the aforesaid animals, remain in the fire without being 
corrupted, as Augustine asserts (De Civ. Dei xxi, 2,4), it would seem 
that they will suffer no distress there: which would not be the case 
unless their bodies were impassible. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the bodies of the damned be passible, the pain 
resulting from their suffering, seemingly, will surpass all present 
bodily pain, even as the joy of the saints will surpass all present joy. 
Now in this life it sometimes happens that the soul is severed from the 
body through excess of pain. Much more therefore if those bodies will be 
passible, the souls will be separate from the bodies through excess of 
pain, and thus those bodies will be corrupted: which is false. Therefore 
those bodies will be impassible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A52">1 Cor. 15:52</a>): "And we shall be 
changed": and a gloss says: "We---the good alone---will be changed with 
the unchangeableness and impassibility of glory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, even as the body co-operates with the soul in merit, so does it 
co-operate in sin. Now on account of the former co-operation not only the 
soul but also the body will be rewarded after the resurrection. Therefore 
in like manner the bodies of the damned will be punished; which would not 
be the case were they impassible. Therefore they will be passible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The principal cause of the bodies of the damned not being 
consumed by fire will be the Divine justice by which their bodies will be 
consigned to everlasting punishment. Now the Divine justice is served 
also by the natural disposition, whether on the part of the passive body 
or on the part of the active causes; for since passiveness is a kind of 
receptiveness, there are two kinds of passion, corresponding to two ways 
in which one thing is receptive of another. For a form may be received 
into a subject materially according to its natural being, just as the air 
receives heat from fire materially; and corresponding to this manner of 
reception there is a kind of passion which we call "passion of nature." 
In another way one thing is received into another spiritually by way of 
an "intention," just as the likeness of whiteness is received into the 
air and in the pupil: this reception is like that whereby the soul 
receives the likeness of things: wherefore corresponding to this mode of 
reception is another mode of passion which we call "passion of the soul." 
Since therefore after the resurrection and the cessation of the heavenly 
movement it will be impossible for a body to be altered by its natural 
quality, as stated above (<A Href="XP086.html#XPQ86A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it will not be possible for any body to 
be passive with a passion of nature. Consequently as regards this mode of 
passion the bodies of the damned will be impassible even as they will be 
incorruptible. Yet after the heaven has ceased to move, there will still 
remain the passion which is after the  manner of the soul, since the air 
will both receive light from the sun, and will convey the variety of 
colors to the sight. Wherefore in respect of this mode of passion the 
bodies of the damned will be passible. But the glorified bodies, albeit 
they receive something, and are in a manner patient to sensation, will 
nevertheless not be passive, since they will receive nothing to distress 
or hurt them, as will the bodies of the damned, which for this reason are 
said to be passible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of the passion whereby the 
patient is changed from its natural disposition. But this kind of passion 
will not be in the bodies of the damned, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of the agent is in the patient in two ways. 
First, in the same way as in the agent, and thus it is in all univocal 
agents, for instance a thing that is hot makes another thing hot, and 
fire generates fire. Secondly, otherwise than in the agent, and thus it 
is in all equivocal agents. In these it happens sometimes that a form 
which is in the agent spiritually is received into the patient 
materially: thus the form of the house built by the craftsman is 
materially in itself, but spiritually in the mind of the craftsman. On 
the other hand, sometimes it is in the agent materially, but is received 
into the patient spiritually: thus whiteness is materially on the wall 
wherein it is received, whereas it is spiritually in the pupil and in the 
transferring medium. And so it is in the case at issue, because the 
species which is in the fire materially is received spiritually into the 
bodies of the damned; thus it is that the fire will assimilate the bodies 
of the damned to itself, without consuming them withal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (De Prop. Element.), "no 
animal can live in fire." Galen also (De simp. medic.) says "that there 
is no body which at length is not consumed by fire"; although sometimes 
certain bodies may remain in fire without hurt, such as ebony. The 
instance of the salamander is not altogether apposite, since it cannot 
remain in the fire without being at last consumed, as do the bodies of 
the damned in hell. Nor does it follow that because the bodies of the 
damned suffer no corruption from the fire, they therefore are not 
tormented by the fire, because the sensible object has a natural aptitude 
to please or displease the senses, not only as regards its natural action 
of stimulating or injuring the organ, but also as regards its spiritual 
action: since when the sensible object is duly proportionate to the 
sense, it pleases, whereas the contrary is the result when it is in 
excess or defect. Hence subdued colors and harmonious sounds are 
pleasing, whereas discordant sounds displease the hearing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[86] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Pain does not sever the soul from the body, in so far as it 
is confined to a power of the soul which feels the pain, but in so far as 
the passion of the soul leads to the body being changed from its natural 
disposition. Thus it is that we see that through anger the body becomes 
heated, and through fear, chilled:  whereas after the resurrection it 
will be impossible for the body to be changed from its natural
