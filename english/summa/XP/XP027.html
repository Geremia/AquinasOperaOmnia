</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider those whom indulgences avail: under which head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether indulgences avail those who are in mortal sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they avail religious?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they avail a person who does not fulfill the conditions for 
which the indulgence is given?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether they avail him who grants them?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an indulgence avails those who are in mortal 
sin. For one person can merit grace and many other good things for 
another, even though he be in mortal sin. Now indulgences derive their 
efficacy from the application of the saints' merits to an individual. 
Therefore they are effective in one who is in mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater the need, the more room there is for pity. 
Now a man who is in mortal sin is in very great need. Therefore all the 
more should pity be extended to him by indulgence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A dead member receives no inflow from the other members 
that are living. But one who is in mortal sin, is like a dead member. 
Therefore he receives no inflow, through indulgences, from the merits of 
living members.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some hold that indulgences avail those even who are in 
mortal sin, for the acquiring of grace, but not for the remission of 
their punishment, since none can be freed from punishment who is not yet 
freed from guilt. For he who has not yet  been reached by God's operation 
unto the remission of guilt, cannot receive the remission of his 
punishment from the minister of the Church neither by indulgences nor in 
the tribunal of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this opinion seems to be untrue. Because, although those merits 
which are applied by means of an indulgence, might possibly avail a 
person so that he could merit grace (by way of congruity and 
impetration), yet it is not for this reason that they are applied, but 
for the remission of punishment. Hence they do not avail those who are in 
mortal sin, and consequently, true contrition and confession are demanded 
as conditions for gaining all indulgences. If however the merits were 
applied by such a form as this: "I grant you a share in the merits of the 
whole Church---or of one congregation, or of one specified person," then 
they might avail a person in mortal sin so that he could merit something, 
as the foregoing opinion holds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although he who is in mortal sin is in greater need of 
help, yet he is less capable of receiving it.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether indulgences avail religious?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that indulgences do not avail religious. For there 
is no reason to bring supplies to those who supply others out of their 
own abundance. Now indulgences are derived from the abundance of works of 
satisfaction to be found in religious. Therefore it is unreasonable for 
them to profit by indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing detrimental to religious life should be done in 
the Church. But, if indulgences were to avail religious, this would be 
detrimental to regular discipline, because religious would become lax on 
account of indulgences, and would neglect the penances imposed in 
chapter. Therefore indulgences do not avail religious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Good brings harm to no man. But the religious life is a 
good thing. Therefore it does not take away from religious the profit to 
be derived from indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Indulgences avail both seculars and religious, provided 
they have charity and satisfy the conditions for gaining the indulgences: 
for religious can be helped by indulgences no less than persons living in 
the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although religious are in the state of perfection, yet they 
cannot live without sin: and so if at times they are liable to punishment 
on account of some sin, they can expiate this debt by means of 
indulgences. For it is not unreasonable that one who is well off 
absolutely speaking, should be in want at times and in some respect, and 
thus need to be supplied with what he lacks. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++6%3A2">Gal. 6:2</a>): "Bear  ye one another's burdens."
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no reason why indulgences should be detrimental to 
religious observance, because, as to the reward of eternal life, 
religious merit more by observing their rule than by gaining indulgences; 
although, as to the remission of punishment, which is a lesser good, they 
merit less. Nor again do indulgences remit the punishment enjoined in 
chapter, because the chapter is a judicial rather than a penitential 
tribunal. hence even those who are not priests hold chapter. Absolution 
from punishment enjoined or due for sin is given in the tribunal of 
Penance.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an indulgence can ever be granted to one who does not fulfill the conditions required?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an indulgence can sometimes be granted to one 
who does not fulfill the required conditions. Because when a person is 
unable to perform a certain action his will is taken for the deed. Now 
sometimes an indulgence is to be gained by giving an alms, which a poor 
man is unable to do, though he would do so willingly. Therefore he can 
gain the indulgence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one man can make satisfaction for another. Now an 
indulgence is directed to the remission of punishment, just as 
satisfaction is. Therefore one man can gain an indulgence for another; 
and so a man can gain an indulgence without doing that for which the 
indulgence is given.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> If the cause is removed, the effect is removed. If 
therefore a person fails to do that for which an indulgence is granted, 
and which is the cause of the indulgence, he does not gain the indulgence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Failing the condition of a grant, no grant ensues. Hence, 
as an indulgence is granted on the condition that a person does or gives 
a certain thing, if he fails in this, he does not gain the indulgence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This is true of the essential reward, but not of certain 
accidental rewards, such as the remission of punishment and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A person can by his intention apply his own action to 
whomever he lists, and so he can make satisfaction for whomever he 
chooses. On the other hand, an indulgence cannot be applied to someone, 
except in accordance with the intention of the grantor. Hence, since he 
applies it to the doer or giver of a particular action or thing, the doer 
cannot transfer this intention to another. If, however, the indulgence 
were expressed thus: "Whosoever does this, or for whomsoever this is 
done, shall gain so much indulgence," it would avail the person for whom 
it is done. Nor would the person who does this action, give the 
indulgence to another, but he who grants the indulgence in this form.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an indulgence does not avail him who grants 
it. For the granting of an indulgence belongs to jurisdiction. Now no one 
can exercise jurisdiction on himself. thus no one can excommunicate 
himself. Therefore no one can participate in an indulgence granted by 
himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if this were possible, he who grants an indulgence might 
gain the remission of the punishment of all his sins for some small deed, 
so that he would sin with impunity, which seems senseless.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to grant indulgences and to excommunicate belong to the 
same power. Now a man cannot excommunicate himself. Therefore he cannot 
share in the indulgence of which he is the grantor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> He would be worse off than others if he could not make 
use of the Church's treasury which he dispenses to others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> An indulgence should be given for some reason, in order 
for anyone to be enticed by the indulgence to perform some action that 
conduces to the good of the Church and to the honor of God. Now the 
prelate to whom is committed the care of the Church's good and of the 
furthering of God's honor, does not need to entice himself thereto. 
Therefore he cannot grant an indulgence to himself alone; but he can 
avail himself of an indulgence that he grants for others, since it is 
based on a cause for granting it to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man cannot exercise an act of jurisdiction on himself, 
but a prelate can avail himself of those things which are granted to 
others by the authority of his jurisdiction, both in temporal and in 
spiritual matters: thus also a priest gives himself the Eucharist which 
he gives to others. And so a bishop too can apply to himself the 
suffrages of the Church which he dispenses to others, the immediate 
effect of which suffrages, and not of his jurisdiction, is the remission 
of punishment by means of indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Second Objection is clear from what had been said.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[27] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Excommunication is pronounced by way of sentence, which no 
man can pronounce on himself, for the reason that in the tribunal of 
justice the same man cannot be both judge and accused. On the other hand 
an indulgence is not given under the form of a sentence, but by way of 
dispensation, which a man can apply to himself.<br>
