  <h3 align="center">OF THE RESURRECTION (THREE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider things connected with and accompanying
    the resurrection. Of these the first to be considered will be the
    resurrection itself; the second will be the cause of the resurrection; the
    third its time and manner. the fourth its term "wherefrom"; the fifth the
    condition of those who rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there will be three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP075.html#XPQ75A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is to be a
    resurrection of the body?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP075.html#XPQ75A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is universally of all
    bodies?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP075.html#XPQ75A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is natural or
    miraculous?

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is to be a resurrection of the body?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not to be a
    resurrection of the body: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+14%3A12"
      >Job 14:12</a
    >): "Man, when he is fallen asleep, shall not rise again till the heavens be
    broken." But the heavens shall never be broken, since the earth, to which
    seemingly this is still less applicable, "standeth for ever" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A4"
      >Eccles. 1:4</a
    >). Therefore the man that is dead shall never rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Our Lord proves the resurrection by
    quoting the words: "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
    God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A32;+Ex++3:6"
      >Mt. 22:32; Ex. 3:6</a
    >). But it is clear that when those words were uttered, Abraham, Isaac, and
    Jacob lived not in body, but only in the soul. Therefore there will be no
    resurrection of bodies but only of souls.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15"
      >1 Cor. 15</a
    >) seemingly proves the resurrection from the reward for labors endured by
    the saints in this life. For if they trusted in this life alone, they would
    be the most unhappy of all men. Now there can be sufficient reward for labor
    in the soul alone: since it is not necessary for the instrument to be repaid
    together with the worker, and the body is the soul's instrument. Wherefore
    even in purgatory, where souls will be punished for what they did in the
    body, the soul is punished without the body. Therefore there is no need to
    hold a resurrection of the body, but it is enough to hold a resurrection of
    souls, which consists in their being taken from the death of sin and
    unhappiness to the life of grace and glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the last state of a thing is the most
    perfect, since thereby it attains its end. Now the most perfect state of the
    soul is to be separated from the body, since in that state it is more
    conformed to God and the angels, and is more pure, as being separated from
    any extraneous nature. Therefore separation from the body is its final
    state, and consequently it returns not from this state to the body, as
    neither does a man end in becoming a boy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, bodily death is the punishment inflicted
    on man for his own transgression, as appears from Gn. 2, even as spiritual
    death, which is the separation of the soul from God, is inflicted on man for
    mortal sin. Now man never returns to life from spiritual death after
    receiving the sentence of his damnation. Therefore neither will there be any
    return from bodily death to bodily life, and so there will be no
    resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+19%3A25-26"
      >Job 19:25-26</a
    >): "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of
    the earth, and I shall be clothed again with my skin," etc. Therefore there
    will be a resurrection of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the gift of Christ is greater than the sin of Adam, as appears from
    Rm. 5:15. Now death was brought in by sin, for if sin had not been, there
    had been no death. Therefore by the gift of Christ man will be restored from
    death to life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the members should be conformed to the head. Now our Head lives and
    will live eternally in body and soul, since "Christ rising again from the
    dead dieth now no more" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A8"
      >Rm. 6:8</a
    >). Therefore men who are His members will live in body and soul; and
    consequently there must needs be a resurrection of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the various opinions about man's
    last end there have been various opinions holding or denying the
    resurrection. For man's last end which all men desire naturally is
    happiness. Some have held that man is able to attain this end in this life:
    wherefore they had no need to admit another life after this, wherein man
    would be able to attain to his perfection: and so they denied the
    resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This opinion is confuted with sufficient probability by the changeableness
    of fortune, the weakness of the human body, the imperfection and instability
    of knowledge and virtue, all of which are hindrances to the perfection of
    happiness, as Augustine argues at the end of De Civ. Dei (xxii, 22).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others maintained that after this there is another life wherein, after
    death, man lives according to the soul only, and they held that such a life
    sufficed to satisfy the natural desire to obtain happiness: wherefore
    Porphyrius said as Augustine states (De Civ. De. xxii, 26): "The soul, to be
    happy, must avoid all bodies": and consequently these did not hold the
    resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This opinion was based by various people on various false foundations. For
    certain heretics asserted that all bodily things are from the evil
    principle, but that spiritual things are from the good principle: and from
    this it follows that the soul cannot reach the height of its perfection
    unless it be separated from the body, since the latter withdraws it from its
    principle, the participation of which makes it happy. Hence all those
    heretical sects that hold corporeal things to have been created or fashioned
    by the devil deny the resurrection of the body. The falsehood of this
    principle has been shown at the beginning of the Second Book (Sent. ii, D,
    4, qu. 1, <a href="XP075.html#XPQ75A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; *[Cf.
    <a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP049.html#FPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP049.html#FPQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a> ]).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others said that the entire nature of man is seated in the soul, so that the
    soul makes use of the body as an instrument, or as a sailor uses his ship:
    wherefore according to this opinion, it follows that if happiness is
    attained by the soul alone, man would not be balked in his natural desire
    for happiness, and so there is no need to hold the resurrection. But the
    Philosopher sufficiently destroys this foundation (De Anima ii, 2), where he
    shows that the soul is united to the body as form to matter. Hence it is
    clear that if man cannot be happy in this life, we must of necessity hold
    the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The heavens will never be broken as to
    their substance, but as to the effect of their power whereby their movement
    is the cause of generation and corruption of lower things: for this reason
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A31"
      >1 Cor. 7:31</a
    >): "The fashion of this world passeth away."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Abraham's soul, properly speaking, is
    not Abraham himself, but a part of him (and the same as regards the others).
    Hence life in Abraham's soul does not suffice to make Abraham a living
    being, or to make the God of Abraham the God of a living man. But there
    needs to be life in the whole composite, i.e. the soul and body: and
    although this life were not actually when these words were uttered, it was
    in each part as ordained to the resurrection. Wherefore our Lord proves the
    resurrection with the greatest subtlety and efficacy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The soul is compared to the body, not
    only as a worker to the instrument with which he works, but also as form to
    matter: wherefore the work belongs to the composite and not to the soul
    alone, as the Philosopher shows (De Anima i, 4). And since to the worker is
    due the reward of the work, it behooves man himself, who is composed of soul
    and body, to receive the reward of his work. Now as venial offenses are
    called sins as being dispositions to sin, and not as having simply and
    perfectly the character of sin, so the punishment which is awarded to them
    in purgatory is not a retribution simply, but rather a cleansing, which is
    wrought separately in the body, by death and by its being reduced to ashes,
    and in the soul by the fire of purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Other things being equal, the state of
    the soul in the body is more perfect than outside the body, because it is a
    part of the whole composite; and every integral part is material in
    comparison to the whole: and though it were conformed to God in one respect,
    it is not simply. Because, strictly speaking, a thing is more conformed to
    God when it has all that the condition of its nature requires, since then
    most of all it imitates the Divine perfection. Hence the heart of an animal
    is more conformed to an immovable God when it is in movement than when it is
    at rest, because the perfection of the heart is in its movement, and its
    rest is its undoing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Bodily death was brought about by Adam's
    sin which was blotted out by Christ's death: hence its punishment lasts not
    for ever. But mortal sin which causes everlasting death through impenitence
    will not be expiated hereafter. Hence that death will be everlasting.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the resurrection will be for all without exception?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the resurrection will not be
    for all without exception. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++1%3A5"
      >Ps. 1:5</a
    >): "The wicked shall not rise again in judgment." Now men will not rise
    again except at the time of the general judgment. Therefore the wicked shall
    in no way rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++12%3A2"
      >Dan. 12:2</a
    >): "Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake." But
    these words imply a restriction. Therefore all will not rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by the resurrection men are conformed to
    Christ rising again; wherefore the Apostle argues (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A12,++seqq+"
      >1 Cor. 15:12, seqq.</a
    >) that if Christ rose again, we also shall rise again. Now those alone
    should be conformed to Christ rising again who have borne His image, and
    this belongs to the good alone. Therefore they alone shall rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, punishment is not remitted unless the
    fault be condoned. Now bodily death is the punishment of original sin.
    Therefore, as original sin is not forgiven to all, all will not rise
    again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as we are born again by the grace of
    Christ, even so shall we rise again by His grace. Now those who die in their
    mother's womb can never be born again: therefore neither can they rise
    again, and consequently all will not rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A28,25"
      >Jn. 5:28,25</a
    >): "All that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God...
    and they that hear shall live." Therefore the dead shall all rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A51"
      >1 Cor. 15:51</a
    >): "We shall all indeed rise again," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the resurrection is necessary in order that those who rise again
    may receive punishment or reward according to their merits. Now either
    punishment or reward is due to all, either for their own merits, as to
    adults, or for others' merits, as to children. Therefore all will rise
    again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Those things, the reason of which comes from
    the nature of a species, must needs be found likewise in all the members of
    that same species. Now such is the resurrection: because the reason thereof,
    as stated above (<a href="XP075.html#XPQ75A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is that
    the soul cannot have the final perfection of the human species, so long as
    it is separated from the body. Hence no soul will remain for ever separated
    from the body. Therefore it is necessary for all, as well as for one, to
    rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As a gloss expounds these words, they
    refer to the spiritual resurrection whereby the wicked shall not rise again
    in the particular judgment. or else they refer to the wicked who are
    altogether unbelievers, who will not rise again to be judged, since they are
    already judged [*Jn. 3:18].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx, 23) explains
    "many" as meaning "all": in fact, this way of speaking is often met with in
    Holy Writ. Or else the restriction may refer to the children consigned to
    limbo who, although they shall rise again, are not properly said to awake,
    since they will have no sense either of pain or of glory, and waking is the
    unchaining of the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All, both good and wicked, are conformed
    to Christ, while living in this life, as regards things pertaining to the
    nature of the species, but not as regards matters pertaining to grace. Hence
    all will be conformed to Him in the restoration of natural life, but not in
    the likeness of glory, except the good alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who have died in original sin
    have, by dying, discharged the obligation of death which is the punishment
    of original sin. Hence, notwithstanding original sin, they can rise again
    from death: for the punishment of original sin is to die, rather than to be
    detained by death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> We are born again by the grace of Christ
    that is given to us, but we rise again by the grace of Christ whereby it
    came about that He took our nature, since it is by this that we are
    conformed to Him in natural things. Hence those who die in their mother's
    womb, although they are not born again by receiving grace, will nevertheless
    rise again on account of the conformity of their nature with Him, which
    conformity they acquired by attaining to the perfection of the human
    species.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the resurrection is natural?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the resurrection is natural.
    For, as the Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14), "that which is commonly
    observed in all, marks the nature of the individuals contained under it."
    Now resurrection applies commonly to all. Therefore it is natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xiv, 55): "Those
    who do not hold the resurrection on the principle of obedience ought
    certainly to hold it on the principle of reason. For what does the world
    every day but imitate, in its elements, our resurrection?" And he offers as
    examples the light which "as it were dies... and is withdrawn from our
    sight... and again rises anew, as it were, and is recalled---the shrubs
    which lose their greenery, and again by a kind of resurrection are
    renewed---and the seeds which rot and die and then sprout and rise again as
    it were": which same example is adduced by the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A36"
      >1 Cor. 15:36</a
    >). Now from the works of nature nothing can be known save what is natural.
    Therefore the resurrection is natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are against nature abide not
    for long, because they are violent, so to speak. But the life that is
    restored by the resurrection will last for ever. Therefore the resurrection
    will be natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that to which the entire expectation of
    nature looks forward would seem to be natural. Now such a thing is the
    resurrection and the glorification of the saints according to Rm. 8:19.
    Therefore the resurrection will be natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the resurrection is a kind of movement
    towards the everlasting union of soul and body. Now movement is natural if
    it terminate in a natural rest (Phys. v, 6): and the everlasting union of
    soul and body will be natural, for since the soul is the body's proper
    mover, it has a body proportionate to it: so that the body is likewise for
    ever capable of being quickened by it, even as the soul lives for ever.
    Therefore the resurrection will be natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> There is no natural return from privation to
    habit. But death is privation of life. Therefore the resurrection whereby
    one returns from death to life is not natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, things of the one species have one fixed way of origin: wherefore
    animals begotten of putrefaction are never of the same species as those
    begotten of seed, as the Commentator says on Phys. viii. Now the natural way
    of man's origin is for him to be begotten of a like in species: and such is
    not the case in the resurrection. Therefore it will not be natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A movement or an action stands related to
    nature in three ways. For there is a movement or action whereof nature is
    neither the principle nor the term: and such a movement is sometimes from a
    principle above nature as in the case of a glorified body; and sometimes
    from any other principle whatever; for instance, the violent upward movement
    of a stone which terminates in a violent rest. Again, there is a movement
    whereof nature is both principle and term: for instance, the downward
    movement of a stone. And there is another movement whereof nature is the
    term, but not the principle, the latter being sometimes something above
    nature (as in giving sight to a blind man, for sight is natural, but the
    principle of the sight-giving is above nature), and sometimes something
    else, as in the forcing of flowers or fruit by artificial process. It is
    impossible for nature to be the principle and not the term, because natural
    principles are appointed to definite effects, beyond which they cannot
    extend.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the action or movement that is related to nature in the first
    way can nowise be natural, but is either miraculous if it come from a
    principle above nature, or violent if from any other principle. The action
    or movement that is related to nature in the second way is simply natural:
    but the action that is related to nature in the third way cannot be
    described as natural simply, but as natural in a restricted sense, in so
    far, to wit, as it leads to that which is according to nature: but it is
    called either miraculous or artificial or violent. For, properly speaking,
    natural is that which is according to nature, and a thing is according to
    nature if it has that nature and whatever results from that nature (Phys.
    ii, 1). Consequently, speaking simply, movement cannot be described as
    natural unless its principle be natural.<br />

    Now nature cannot be the principle of resurrection, although resurrection
    terminates in the life of nature. For nature is the principle of movement in
    the thing wherein nature is---either the active principle, as in the
    movement of heavy and light bodies and in the natural alterations of
    animals---or the passive principle, as in the generation of simple bodies.
    The passive principle of natural generation is the natural passive
    potentiality which always has an active principle corresponding to it in
    nature, according to Metaphysics viii, 1: nor as to this does it matter
    whether the active principle in nature correspond to the passive principle
    in respect of its ultimate perfection, namely the form; or in respect of a
    disposition in virtue of which it demands the ultimate form, as in the
    generation of a man according to the teaching of faith, or in all other
    generations according to the opinions of Plato and Avicenna. But in nature
    there is no active principle of the resurrection, neither as regards the
    union of the soul with the body, nor as regards the disposition which is the
    demand for that union: since such a disposition cannot be produced by
    nature, except in a definite way by the process of generation from seed.
    Wherefore even granted a passive potentiality on the part of the body, or
    any kind of inclination to its union with the soul, it is not such as to
    suffice for the conditions of natural movement. Therefore the resurrection,
    strictly speaking, is miraculous and not natural except in a restricted
    sense, as we have explained.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene is speaking of those things
    that are found in all individuals and are caused by the principles of
    nature. For supposing by a divine operation all men to be made white, or to
    be gathered together in one place, as happened at the time of the deluge, it
    would not follow that whiteness or existence in some particular place is a
    natural property of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From natural things one does not come by
    a demonstration of reason to know non-natural things, but by the induction
    of reason one may know something above nature, since the natural bears a
    certain resemblance to the supernatural. Thus the union of soul and body
    resembles the union of the soul with God by the glory of fruition, as the
    Master says (Sent. ii, D, 1): and in like manner the examples, quoted by the
    Apostle and Gregory, are confirmatory evidences of our faith in the
    resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument regards an operation which
    terminates in something that is not natural but contrary to nature. Such is
    not the resurrection, and hence the argument is not to the point.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The entire operation of nature is
    subordinate to the Divine operation, just as the working of a lower art is
    subordinate to the working of a higher art. Hence just as all the work of a
    lower art has in view an end unattainable save by the operation of the
    higher art that produces the form, or makes use of what has been made by
    art: so the last end which the whole expectation of nature has in view is
    unattainable by the operation of nature, and for which reason the attaining
    thereto is not natural.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although there can be no natural
    movement terminating in a violent rest, there can be a non-natural movement
    terminating in a natural rest, as explained above.<br />
