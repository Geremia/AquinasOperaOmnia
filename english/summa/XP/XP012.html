<H3 Align="Center">OF SATISFACTION, AS TO ITS NATURE (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider satisfaction; about which four things have to be 
considered: (1) Its nature; (2) Its possibility; (3) Its quality; (4) The 
means whereby man offers satisfaction to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether satisfaction is a virtue or an act of virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is an act of justice?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the definition of satisfaction contained in the text is 
suitable?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that satisfaction is neither a virtue nor an act of 
virtue. For every act of virtue is meritorious; whereas, seemingly, 
satisfaction is not, since merit is gratuitous, while satisfaction 
answers to a debt. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every act of virtue is voluntary. But sometimes a man 
has to make satisfaction for something against his will, as when anyone 
is punished by the judge for an offense against another. Therefore 
satisfaction is not an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 13): "Choice 
holds the chief place in moral virtue." But satisfaction is not an act of 
choice but regards chiefly external works. Therefore it is not an act of 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Satisfaction belongs to penance. Now penance is a 
virtue. Therefore satisfaction is also an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, none but an act of virtue has the effect of blotting out sin, 
for one contrary is destroyed by the other. Now  satisfaction destroys 
sin altogether. Therefore it is an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> An act is said to be the act of a virtue in two ways. 
First, materially; and thus any act which implies no malice, or defect of 
a due circumstance, may be called an act of virtue, because virtue can 
make use of any such act for its end, e.g. to walk, to speak, and so 
forth. Secondly, an act is said to belong to a virtue formally, because 
its very name implies the form and nature of virtue; thus to suffer 
courageously is an act of courage. Now the formal element in every moral 
virtue is the observance of a mean. wherefore every act that implies the 
observance of a mean is formally an act of virtue. And since equality is 
the mean implied in the name of satisfaction (for a thing is said to be 
satisfied by reason of an equal proportion to something), it is evident 
that satisfaction also is formally an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although to make satisfaction is due in itself, yet, in so 
far as the deed is done voluntarily by the one who offers satisfaction, 
it becomes something gratuitous on the part of the agent, so that he 
makes a virtue of necessity. For debt diminishes merit through being 
necessary and consequently against the will, so that if the will consent 
to the necessity, the element of merit is not forfeited.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An act of virtue demands voluntariness not in the patient 
but in the agent, for it is his act. Consequently since he on whom the 
judge wreaks vengeance is the patient and not the agent as regards 
satisfaction, it follows that satisfaction should be voluntary not in him 
but in the judge as agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The chief element of virtue can be understood in two ways. 
First, as being the chief element of virtue as virtue, and thus the chief 
element of virtue denotes whatever belongs to the nature of virtue or is 
most akin thereto; thus choice and other internal acts hold the chief 
place in virtue. Secondly, the chief element of virtue may be taken as 
denoting that which holds the first place in such and such a virtue; and 
then the first place belongs to that which gives its determination. Now 
the interior act, in certain virtues, is determined by some external act, 
since choice, which is common to all virtues, becomes proper to such and 
such a virtue through being directed to such and such an act. Thus it is 
that external acts hold the chief place in certain virtues; and this is 
the case with satisfaction.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that satisfaction is not an act of justice. Because 
the purpose of satisfaction is that one may be reconciled to the person 
offended. But reconciliation, being an act of love, belongs to charity. 
Therefore satisfaction is an act of charity and not of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the causes of sin in us are the passions of the soul, 
which incline us to evil. But justice, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. v, 2,3), is not about passions, but about operations. Since 
therefore satisfaction aims at removing the causes of sin, as stated in 
the text (Sent. iv, D, 15), it seems that it is not an act of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to be careful about the future is not an act of justice 
but of prudence of which caution is a part. But it belongs to 
satisfaction, "to give no opening to the suggestions of sin" [*Cf. 
XP/Question [12]/Article [3]/Objection [1]]. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No virtue but justice considers the notion of that 
which is due. But satisfaction gives due honor to God, as Anselm states 
(Cur Deus Homo i). Therefore satisfaction is an act of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, no virtue save justice establishes equality between external 
things. But this is done by satisfaction which establishes equality 
between amendment and the previous offense. Therefore satisfaction is an 
act of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 3,4), the mean of 
justice is considered with regard to an equation between thing and thing 
according to a certain proportion. Wherefore, since the very name of 
satisfaction implies an equation of the kind, because the adverb "satis" 
[enough] denotes an equality of proportion, it is evident that 
satisfaction is formally an act of justice. Now the act of justice, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 2,4), is either an act done by 
one man to another, as when a man pays another what he owes him, or an 
act done by one man between two others, as when a judge does justice 
between two men. When it is an act of justice of one man to another, the 
equality is set up in the agent, while when it is something done between 
two others, the equality is set up in the subject that has suffered an 
injustice. And since satisfaction expresses equality in the agent, it 
denotes, properly speaking, an act of justice of one man to another. Now 
a man may do justice to another either in actions and passions or in 
external things; even as one may do an injustice to another, either by 
taking something away, or by a hurtful action. And since to give is to 
use an external thing, the act of justice, in so far as it establishes 
equality between external things, signifies, properly speaking, a giving 
back: but to make satisfaction clearly points to equality between 
actions, although sometimes one is put for the other. Now equalization 
concerns only such things as are unequal, wherefore satisfaction 
presupposes inequality among actions, which inequality constitutes an 
offense; so that satisfaction regards a previous offense. But no part of 
justice regards a previous offense, except vindictive justice, which 
establishes equality indifferently, whether the patient be the same 
subject as the agent, as when anyone punishes himself, or whether they be 
distinct, as when a judge punishes another man, since vindictive justice 
deals with  both cases. The same applies to penance, which implies 
equality in the agent only, since it is the penitent who holds to the 
penance [poenam tenet], so that penance is in a way a species of 
vindictive justice. This proves that satisfaction, which implies equality 
in the agent with respect to a previous offense, is a work of justice, as 
to that part which is called penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Satisfaction, as appears from what has been said, is 
compensation for injury inflicted. Wherefore as the injury inflicted 
entailed of itself an inequality of justice, and consequently an 
inequality opposed to friendship, so satisfaction brings back directly 
equality of justice, and consequently equality of friendship. And since 
an act is elicited by the habit to whose end it is immediately directed, 
but is commanded by that habit to whose end it is directed ultimately, 
hence satisfaction is elicited by justice but is commanded by charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although justice is chiefly about operations, yet it is 
consequently about passions, in so far as they are the causes of 
operations. Wherefore as justice curbs anger, lest it inflict an unjust 
injury on another, and concupiscence from invading another's marriage 
right, so satisfaction removes the causes of other sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Each moral virtue shares in the act of prudence, because 
this virtue completes in it the conditions essential to virtue, since 
each moral virtue takes its mean according to the ruling of prudence, as 
is evident from the definition of virtue given in Ethic. ii, 6.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the definition of satisfaction given in the text is suitable?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the definition of satisfaction given in the 
text (Sent. iv, D, 15) and quoted from Augustine [*Gennadius 
Massiliensis, De Eccl. Dogm. liv] is unsuitable---viz. that "satisfaction 
is to uproot the causes of sins, and to give no opening to the 
suggestions thereof." For the cause of actual sin is the fomes. [*"Fomes" 
signifies literally "fuel," and metaphorically, "incentive." As used by 
the theologian, it denotes the quasi-material element and effect of 
original sin, and sometimes goes under the name of "concupiscence," Cf. 
FS, Question [82], Article [3].] But we cannot remove the "fomes" in this life. 
Therefore satisfaction does not consist in removing the causes of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the cause of sin is stronger than sin itself. But man by 
himself cannot remove sin. Much less therefore can he remove the cause of 
sin; and so the same conclusion follows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since satisfaction is a part of Penance, it regards the 
past and not the future. Now "to give no opening to the suggestions of 
sin" regards the future. Therefore it should not be put in the definition 
of satisfaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, satisfaction regards a past offense. Yet no mention is 
made of this. Therefore the definition of satisfaction is unsuitable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Anselm gives another definition (Cur Deus homo i): 
"Satisfaction consists in giving God due honor," wherein no reference is 
made to the things mentioned by Augustine [*Gennadius, Objection [1]] in this 
definition. Therefore one or the other is unsuitable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, an innocent man can give due honor to God: whereas 
satisfaction is not compatible with innocence. Therefore Anselm's 
definition is faulty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Justice aims not only at removing inequality already 
existing, by punishing the past fault, but also at safeguarding equality 
for the future, because according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 3) 
"punishments are medicinal." Wherefore satisfaction which is the act of 
justice inflicting punishment, is a medicine healing past sins and 
preserving from future sins: so that when one man makes satisfaction to 
another, he offers compensation for the past, and takes heed for the 
future. Accordingly satisfaction may be defined in two ways, first with 
regard to past sin, which it heals by making compensation, and thus it is 
defined as "compensation for an inflicted injury according to the 
equality of justice." The definition of Anselm amounts to the same, for 
he says that "satisfaction consists in giving God due honor"; where duty 
is considered in respect of the sin committed. Secondly, satisfaction may 
be defined, considered as preserving us from future sins; and as 
Augustine (Cf. Objection [1]) defines it. Now preservation from bodily sickness 
is assured by removing the causes from which the sickness may ensue, for 
if they be taken away the sickness cannot follow. But it is not thus in 
spiritual diseases, for the free-will cannot be forced, so that even in 
the presence of their causes, they can, though with difficulty, be 
avoided, while they can be incurred even when their causes are removed. 
Hence he puts two things in the definition of satisfaction, viz. removal 
of the causes, as to the first, and the free-will's refusal to sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By "causes" we must understand the proximate causes of 
actual sin, which are twofold: viz. the lust of sin through the habit or 
act of a sin that has been given up, and those things which are called 
the remnants of past sin; and external occasions of sin, such as place, 
bad company and so forth. Such causes are removed by satisfaction in this 
life, albeit the "fomes," which is the remote cause of actual sin, is not 
entirely removed by satisfaction in this life though it is weakened.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the cause of evil or of privation (according as it 
has a cause) is nothing else than a defective good, and since it is 
easier to destroy good than to set it up, it follows that it is easier to 
uproot the causes of privation and of evil than to remove the evil 
itself, which can only be removed by setting up good, as may be seen in 
the case of blindness and its causes. Yet the aforesaid are not 
sufficient causes of sin, for sin  does not, of necessity, ensue 
therefrom, but they are occasions of sin. Nor again can satisfaction be 
made without God's help, since it is not possible without charity, as we 
shall state further on (<A Href="XP014.html#XPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="XP014.html#XPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although Penance was primarily instituted and intended with 
a view to the past, yet, as a consequence, it regards the future, in so 
far as it is a safeguarding remedy; and the same applies to satisfaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Augustine [*Gennadius Massiliensis, De Eccl. Dogm. liv] 
defined satisfaction, as made to God, from Whom, in reality, nothing can 
be taken, though the sinner, for his own part, takes something away. 
Consequently in such like satisfaction, amendment for future time is of 
greater weight than compensation for the past. Hence Augustine defines 
satisfaction from this point of view. And yet it is possible to gauge the 
compensation for the past from the heed taken for the future, for the 
latter regards the same object as the former, but in the opposite way: 
since when looking at the past we detest the causes of sins on account of 
the sins themselves, which are the starting-point of the movement of 
detestation: whereas when taking heed of the future, we begin from the 
causes, that by their removal we may avoid sins the more easily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> There is no reason why the same thing should not be 
described in different ways according to the various things found in it: 
and such is the case here, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[12] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> By debt is meant the debt we owe to God by reason of the 
sins we have committed, because Penance regards a debt, as stated above 
(<A Href="XP012.html#XPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
