  <h3 align="center">
    OF SATISFACTION, AS TO ITS NATURE (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider satisfaction; about which four things have to be
    considered: (1) Its nature; (2) Its possibility; (3) Its quality; (4) The
    means whereby man offers satisfaction to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP012.html#XPQ12A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether satisfaction is a virtue
    or an act of virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP012.html#XPQ12A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is an act of justice?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP012.html#XPQ12A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the definition of
    satisfaction contained in the text is suitable?<br />

    Whether satisfaction is a virtue or an act of virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that satisfaction is neither a
    virtue nor an act of virtue. For every act of virtue is meritorious;
    whereas, seemingly, satisfaction is not, since merit is gratuitous, while
    satisfaction answers to a debt. Therefore satisfaction is not an act of
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every act of virtue is voluntary. But
    sometimes a man has to make satisfaction for something against his will, as
    when anyone is punished by the judge for an offense against another.
    Therefore satisfaction is not an act of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    viii, 13): "Choice holds the chief place in moral virtue." But satisfaction
    is not an act of choice but regards chiefly external works. Therefore it is
    not an act of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Satisfaction belongs to penance. Now penance
    is a virtue. Therefore satisfaction is also an act of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, none but an act of virtue has the effect of blotting out sin, for
    one contrary is destroyed by the other. Now satisfaction destroys sin
    altogether. Therefore it is an act of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An act is said to be the act of a virtue in two
    ways. First, materially; and thus any act which implies no malice, or defect
    of a due circumstance, may be called an act of virtue, because virtue can
    make use of any such act for its end, e.g. to walk, to speak, and so forth.
    Secondly, an act is said to belong to a virtue formally, because its very
    name implies the form and nature of virtue; thus to suffer courageously is
    an act of courage. Now the formal element in every moral virtue is the
    observance of a mean. wherefore every act that implies the observance of a
    mean is formally an act of virtue. And since equality is the mean implied in
    the name of satisfaction (for a thing is said to be satisfied by reason of
    an equal proportion to something), it is evident that satisfaction also is
    formally an act of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although to make satisfaction is due in
    itself, yet, in so far as the deed is done voluntarily by the one who offers
    satisfaction, it becomes something gratuitous on the part of the agent, so
    that he makes a virtue of necessity. For debt diminishes merit through being
    necessary and consequently against the will, so that if the will consent to
    the necessity, the element of merit is not forfeited.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An act of virtue demands voluntariness
    not in the patient but in the agent, for it is his act. Consequently since
    he on whom the judge wreaks vengeance is the patient and not the agent as
    regards satisfaction, it follows that satisfaction should be voluntary not
    in him but in the judge as agent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The chief element of virtue can be
    understood in two ways. First, as being the chief element of virtue as
    virtue, and thus the chief element of virtue denotes whatever belongs to the
    nature of virtue or is most akin thereto; thus choice and other internal
    acts hold the chief place in virtue. Secondly, the chief element of virtue
    may be taken as denoting that which holds the first place in such and such a
    virtue; and then the first place belongs to that which gives its
    determination. Now the interior act, in certain virtues, is determined by
    some external act, since choice, which is common to all virtues, becomes
    proper to such and such a virtue through being directed to such and such an
    act. Thus it is that external acts hold the chief place in certain virtues;
    and this is the case with satisfaction.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether satisfaction is an act of justice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that satisfaction is not an act of
    justice. Because the purpose of satisfaction is that one may be reconciled
    to the person offended. But reconciliation, being an act of love, belongs to
    charity. Therefore satisfaction is an act of charity and not of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the causes of sin in us are the passions
    of the soul, which incline us to evil. But justice, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 2,3), is not about passions, but about operations.
    Since therefore satisfaction aims at removing the causes of sin, as stated
    in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15), it seems that it is not an act of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to be careful about the future is not an
    act of justice but of prudence of which caution is a part. But it belongs to
    satisfaction, "to give no opening to the suggestions of sin" [*Cf.
    XP/Question [12]/Article [3]/Objection [1]]. Therefore satisfaction is not
    an act of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No virtue but justice considers the notion of
    that which is due. But satisfaction gives due honor to God, as Anselm states
    (Cur Deus Homo i). Therefore satisfaction is an act of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, no virtue save justice establishes equality between external
    things. But this is done by satisfaction which establishes equality between
    amendment and the previous offense. Therefore satisfaction is an act of
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 3,4),
    the mean of justice is considered with regard to an equation between thing
    and thing according to a certain proportion. Wherefore, since the very name
    of satisfaction implies an equation of the kind, because the adverb "satis"
    [enough] denotes an equality of proportion, it is evident that satisfaction
    is formally an act of justice. Now the act of justice, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 2,4), is either an act done by one man to another, as
    when a man pays another what he owes him, or an act done by one man between
    two others, as when a judge does justice between two men. When it is an act
    of justice of one man to another, the equality is set up in the agent, while
    when it is something done between two others, the equality is set up in the
    subject that has suffered an injustice. And since satisfaction expresses
    equality in the agent, it denotes, properly speaking, an act of justice of
    one man to another. Now a man may do justice to another either in actions
    and passions or in external things; even as one may do an injustice to
    another, either by taking something away, or by a hurtful action. And since
    to give is to use an external thing, the act of justice, in so far as it
    establishes equality between external things, signifies, properly speaking,
    a giving back: but to make satisfaction clearly points to equality between
    actions, although sometimes one is put for the other. Now equalization
    concerns only such things as are unequal, wherefore satisfaction presupposes
    inequality among actions, which inequality constitutes an offense; so that
    satisfaction regards a previous offense. But no part of justice regards a
    previous offense, except vindictive justice, which establishes equality
    indifferently, whether the patient be the same subject as the agent, as when
    anyone punishes himself, or whether they be distinct, as when a judge
    punishes another man, since vindictive justice deals with both cases. The
    same applies to penance, which implies equality in the agent only, since it
    is the penitent who holds to the penance [poenam tenet], so that penance is
    in a way a species of vindictive justice. This proves that satisfaction,
    which implies equality in the agent with respect to a previous offense, is a
    work of justice, as to that part which is called penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Satisfaction, as appears from what has
    been said, is compensation for injury inflicted. Wherefore as the injury
    inflicted entailed of itself an inequality of justice, and consequently an
    inequality opposed to friendship, so satisfaction brings back directly
    equality of justice, and consequently equality of friendship. And since an
    act is elicited by the habit to whose end it is immediately directed, but is
    commanded by that habit to whose end it is directed ultimately, hence
    satisfaction is elicited by justice but is commanded by charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although justice is chiefly about
    operations, yet it is consequently about passions, in so far as they are the
    causes of operations. Wherefore as justice curbs anger, lest it inflict an
    unjust injury on another, and concupiscence from invading another's marriage
    right, so satisfaction removes the causes of other sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Each moral virtue shares in the act of
    prudence, because this virtue completes in it the conditions essential to
    virtue, since each moral virtue takes its mean according to the ruling of
    prudence, as is evident from the definition of virtue given in Ethic. ii,
    6.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the definition of satisfaction given in the text is suitable?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the definition of satisfaction
    given in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15) and quoted from Augustine [*Gennadius
    Massiliensis, De Eccl. Dogm. liv] is unsuitable---viz. that "satisfaction is
    to uproot the causes of sins, and to give no opening to the suggestions
    thereof." For the cause of actual sin is the fomes. [*"Fomes" signifies
    literally "fuel," and metaphorically, "incentive." As used by the
    theologian, it denotes the quasi-material element and effect of original
    sin, and sometimes goes under the name of "concupiscence," Cf. FS, Question
    [82], Article [3].] But we cannot remove the "fomes" in this life. Therefore
    satisfaction does not consist in removing the causes of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the cause of sin is stronger than sin
    itself. But man by himself cannot remove sin. Much less therefore can he
    remove the cause of sin; and so the same conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since satisfaction is a part of Penance,
    it regards the past and not the future. Now "to give no opening to the
    suggestions of sin" regards the future. Therefore it should not be put in
    the definition of satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, satisfaction regards a past offense. Yet
    no mention is made of this. Therefore the definition of satisfaction is
    unsuitable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Anselm gives another definition (Cur
    Deus homo i): "Satisfaction consists in giving God due honor," wherein no
    reference is made to the things mentioned by Augustine [*Gennadius,
    Objection [1]] in this definition. Therefore one or the other is
    unsuitable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, an innocent man can give due honor to
    God: whereas satisfaction is not compatible with innocence. Therefore
    Anselm's definition is faulty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Justice aims not only at removing inequality
    already existing, by punishing the past fault, but also at safeguarding
    equality for the future, because according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 3)
    "punishments are medicinal." Wherefore satisfaction which is the act of
    justice inflicting punishment, is a medicine healing past sins and
    preserving from future sins: so that when one man makes satisfaction to
    another, he offers compensation for the past, and takes heed for the future.
    Accordingly satisfaction may be defined in two ways, first with regard to
    past sin, which it heals by making compensation, and thus it is defined as
    "compensation for an inflicted injury according to the equality of justice."
    The definition of Anselm amounts to the same, for he says that "satisfaction
    consists in giving God due honor"; where duty is considered in respect of
    the sin committed. Secondly, satisfaction may be defined, considered as
    preserving us from future sins; and as Augustine (Cf. Objection [1]) defines
    it. Now preservation from bodily sickness is assured by removing the causes
    from which the sickness may ensue, for if they be taken away the sickness
    cannot follow. But it is not thus in spiritual diseases, for the free-will
    cannot be forced, so that even in the presence of their causes, they can,
    though with difficulty, be avoided, while they can be incurred even when
    their causes are removed. Hence he puts two things in the definition of
    satisfaction, viz. removal of the causes, as to the first, and the
    free-will's refusal to sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By "causes" we must understand the
    proximate causes of actual sin, which are twofold: viz. the lust of sin
    through the habit or act of a sin that has been given up, and those things
    which are called the remnants of past sin; and external occasions of sin,
    such as place, bad company and so forth. Such causes are removed by
    satisfaction in this life, albeit the "fomes," which is the remote cause of
    actual sin, is not entirely removed by satisfaction in this life though it
    is weakened.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the cause of evil or of privation
    (according as it has a cause) is nothing else than a defective good, and
    since it is easier to destroy good than to set it up, it follows that it is
    easier to uproot the causes of privation and of evil than to remove the evil
    itself, which can only be removed by setting up good, as may be seen in the
    case of blindness and its causes. Yet the aforesaid are not sufficient
    causes of sin, for sin does not, of necessity, ensue therefrom, but they are
    occasions of sin. Nor again can satisfaction be made without God's help,
    since it is not possible without charity, as we shall state further on (<a
      href="XP014.html#XPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although Penance was primarily
    instituted and intended with a view to the past, yet, as a consequence, it
    regards the future, in so far as it is a safeguarding remedy; and the same
    applies to satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Augustine [*Gennadius Massiliensis, De
    Eccl. Dogm. liv] defined satisfaction, as made to God, from Whom, in
    reality, nothing can be taken, though the sinner, for his own part, takes
    something away. Consequently in such like satisfaction, amendment for future
    time is of greater weight than compensation for the past. Hence Augustine
    defines satisfaction from this point of view. And yet it is possible to
    gauge the compensation for the past from the heed taken for the future, for
    the latter regards the same object as the former, but in the opposite way:
    since when looking at the past we detest the causes of sins on account of
    the sins themselves, which are the starting-point of the movement of
    detestation: whereas when taking heed of the future, we begin from the
    causes, that by their removal we may avoid sins the more easily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> There is no reason why the same thing
    should not be described in different ways according to the various things
    found in it: and such is the case here, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> By debt is meant the debt we owe to God
    by reason of the sins we have committed, because Penance regards a debt, as
    stated above (<a href="XP012.html#XPQ12A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
