    OF THOSE WHO CONFER THIS SACRAMENT (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider those who confer this sacrament. Under this head there
    are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP038.html#XPQ38A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a bishop alone can confer
    this sacrament?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP038.html#XPQ38A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a heretic or any other
    person cut off from the Church can confer this sacrament?

    Whether a bishop alone confers the sacrament of Order?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not only a bishop confers the
    sacrament of Order. For the imposition of hands has something to do with the
    consecration. Now not only the bishop but also the assisting priests lay
    hands on the priests who are being ordained. Therefore not only a bishop
    confers the sacrament of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man receives the power of Order, when
    that which pertains to the act of his Order is handed to him. Now the cruet
    with water, bowl* and towel, are given to the subdeacon by the archdeacon;
    as also the candlestick with candle, and the empty cruet to the acolyte.
    [*"Bacili." The rubric has "aquamanili." Some texts of the Summa have
    "mantili" ("maniple"), but the archdeacon does not give the maniple to the
    subdeacon.] Therefore not only the bishop confers the sacrament of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which belongs to an Order cannot be
    entrusted to one who has not the Order. Now the conferring of minor Orders
    is entrusted to certain persons who are not bishops, for instance to
    Cardinal priests. Therefore the conferring of Orders does not belong to the
    episcopal Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever is entrusted with the principal
    is entrusted with the accessory also. Now the sacrament of Order is directed
    to the Eucharist, as accessory to principal. Since then a priest consecrates
    the Eucharist, he can also confer Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, there is a greater distinction between a
    priest and a deacon than between bishop and bishop. But a bishop can
    consecrate a bishop. Therefore a priest can ordain a deacon.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ministers are applied by their Orders to the
    Divine worship in a more noble way than the sacred vessels. But the
    consecration of the vessels belongs to a bishop only. Much more therefore
    does the consecration of ministers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the sacrament of Order ranks higher than the sacrament of
    Confirmation. Now a bishop alone confirms. Much more therefore does a bishop
    alone confer the sacrament of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, virgins are not placed in a degree of spiritual power by their
    consecration, as the ordained are. Yet a bishop alone can consecrate a
    virgin. Therefore much more can he alone ordain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The episcopal power stands in the same relation
    to the power of the lower Orders, as political science, which seeks the
    common good, to the lower acts and virtues which seek some special good, as
    appears from what was said above (<a href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1"
      >Question [37]</a
    >, <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now political
    science, as stated in Ethic. i, 2, lays down the law to lower sciences,
    namely what science each one ought to cultivate, and how far he should
    pursue it and in what way. Wherefore it belongs to a bishop to assign others
    to places in all the Divine services. Hence he alone confirms, because those
    who are confirmed receive the office, as it were, of confessing the faith;
    again he alone blesses virgins who are images of the Church, Christ's
    spouse, the care of which is entrusted chiefly to him; and he it is who
    consecrates the candidates for ordination to the ministry of Orders, and, by
    his consecration, appoints the vessels that they are to use; even as secular
    offices in various cities are allotted by him who holds the highest power,
    for instance by the king.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1"
      >Question [37]</a
    >, <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), at the imposition of
    hands there is given, not the character of the priestly Order, but grace
    which makes a man fit to exercise his Order. And since those who are raised
    to the priesthood need most copious grace, the priests together with the
    bishop lay hands on them, but the bishop alone lays hands on deacons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the archdeacon is as it were
    minister-in-chief, all things pertaining to the ministry are handed by him,
    for instance the candle with which the acolyte serves the deacon by carrying
    it before him at the Gospel, and the cruet with which he serves the
    subdeacon; and in like manner he gives the subdeacon the things with which
    the latter serves the higher Orders. And yet the principal act of the
    subdeacon does not consist in these things, but in his co-operation as
    regards the matter of the sacrament; wherefore he receives the character
    through the chalice being handed to him by the bishop. On the other hand,
    the acolyte receives the character by virtue of the words of the bishop when
    the aforesaid things---the cruet rather than the candlestick---are handed to
    him by the archdeacon. Hence it does not follow that the archdeacon
    ordains.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Pope, who has the fulness of
    episcopal power, can entrust one who is not a bishop with things pertaining
    to the episcopal dignity, provided they bear no immediate relation to the
    true body of Christ. Hence by virtue of his commission a simple priest can
    confer the minor Orders and confirm; but not one who is not a priest. Nor
    can a priest confer the higher Orders which bear an immediate relation to
    Christ's body, over the consecration of which the Pope's power is no greater
    than that of a simple priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although the Eucharist is in itself the
    greatest of the sacraments, it does not place a man in an office as does the
    sacrament of Order. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> In order to bestow what one has on
    another, it is necessary not only to be near him but also to have fulness of
    power. And since a priest has not fulness of power in the hierarchical
    offices, as a bishop has, it does not follow that he can raise others to the
    diaconate, although the latter Order is near to his.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether heretics and those who are cut off from the Church can confer
    Orders? [*Cf. TP, Question [64], Articles [5],9]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that heretics and those who are cut
    off from the Church cannot confer Orders. For to confer Orders is a greater
    thing than to loose or bind anyone. But a heretic cannot loose or bind.
    Neither therefore can he ordain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a priest that is separated from the
    Church can consecrate, because the character whence he derives this power
    remains in him indelibly. But a bishop receives no character when he is
    raised to the episcopate. Therefore he does not necessarily retain the
    episcopal power after his separation from the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in no community can one who is expelled
    therefrom dispose of the offices of the community. Now Orders are offices of
    the Church. Therefore one who is outside the Church cannot confer Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the sacraments derive their efficacy
    from Christ's passion. Now a heretic is not united to Christ's passion;
    neither by his own faith, since he is an unbeliever, nor by the faith of the
    Church, since he is severed from the Church. Therefore he cannot confer the
    sacrament of Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a blessing is necessary in the
    conferring of Orders. But a heretic cannot bless; in fact his blessing is
    turned into a curse, as appears from the authorities quoted in the text
    (Sent. iv, D, 25). Therefore he cannot ordain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> When a bishop who has fallen into heresy is
    reconciled he is not reconsecrated. Therefore he did not lose the power
    which he had of conferring Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the power to ordain is greater than the power of Orders. But the
    power of Orders is not forfeited on account of heresy and the like. Neither
    therefore is the power to ordain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, as the one who baptizes exercises a merely outward ministry, so
    does one who ordains, while God works inwardly. But one who is cut off from
    the Church by no means loses the power to baptize. Neither therefore does he
    lose the power to ordain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> on this question four opinions are mentioned in
    the text (Sent. iv, D, 25). For some said that heretics, so long as they are
    tolerated by the Church, retain the power to ordain, but not after they have
    been cut off from the Church; as neither do those who have been degraded and
    the like. This is the first opinion. Yet this is impossible, because, happen
    what may, no power that is given with a consecration can be taken away so
    long as the thing itself remains, any more than the consecration itself can
    be annulled, for even an altar or chrism once consecrated remains
    consecrated for ever. Wherefore, since the episcopal power is conferred by
    consecration, it must needs endure for ever, however much a man may sin or
    be cut off from the Church. For this reason others said that those who are
    cut off from the Church after having episcopal power in the Church, retain
    the power to ordain and raise others, but that those who are raised by them
    have not this power. This is the fourth opinion. But this again is
    impossible, for if those who were ordained in the Church retain the power
    they received, it is clear that by exercising their power they consecrate
    validly, and therefore they validly confer whatever power is given with that
    consecration, and thus those who receive ordination or promotion from them
    have the same power as they. Wherefore others said that even those who are
    cut off from the Church can confer Orders and the other sacraments, provided
    they observe the due form and intention, both as to the first effect, which
    is the conferring of the sacrament, and as to the ultimate effect which is
    the conferring of grace. This is the second opinion. But this again is
    inadmissible, since by the very fact that a person communicates in the
    sacraments with a heretic who is cut off from the Church, he sins, and thus
    approaches the sacrament insincerely and cannot obtain grace, except perhaps
    in Baptism in a case of necessity. Hence others say that they confer the
    sacraments validly, but do not confer grace with them, not that the
    sacraments are lacking in efficacy, but on account of the sins of those who
    receive the sacraments from such persons despite the prohibition of the
    Church. This is the third and the true opinion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The effect of absolution is nothing else
    but the forgiveness of sins which results from grace, and consequently a
    heretic cannot absolve, as neither can he confer grace in the sacraments.
    Moreover in order to give absolution it is necessary to have jurisdiction,
    which one who is cut off from the Church has not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man is raised to the episcopate
    he receives a power which he retains for ever. This, however, cannot be
    called a character, because a man is not thereby placed in direct relation
    to God, but to Christ's mystical body. Nevertheless it remains indelibly
    even as the character, because it is given by consecration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are ordained by heretics,
    although they receive an Order, do not receive the exercise thereof, so as
    to minister lawfully in their Orders, for the very reason indicated in the
    Objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> They are united to the passion of Christ
    by the faith of the Church, for although in themselves they are severed from
    it, they are united to it as regards the form of the Church which they
    observe.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> This refers to the ultimate effect of
    the sacraments, as the third opinion maintains.<br />
