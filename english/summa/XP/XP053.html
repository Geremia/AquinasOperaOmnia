    OF THE IMPEDIMENT OF VOWS AND ORDERS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the impediment of vows and orders. Under this head
    there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP053.html#XPQ53A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a simple vow is a diriment
    impediment to matrimony?
  </p>
  <p>

    impediment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP053.html#XPQ53A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether order is an impediment to
    matrimony?
  </p>
  <p>

    Whether marriage already contracted should be annulled by the obligation of
    a simple vow?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a marriage already contracted
    ought to be annulled by the obligation of a simple vow. For the stronger tie
    takes precedence of the weaker. Now a vow is a stronger tie than marriage,
    since the latter binds man to man, but the former binds man to God.
    Therefore the obligation of a vow takes precedence of the marriage tie.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God's commandment is no less binding
    than the commandment of the Church. Now the commandment of the Church is so
    binding that a marriage is void if contracted in despite thereof; as
    instanced in the case of those who marry within the degrees of kindred
    forbidden by the Church. Therefore, since it is a Divine commandment to keep
    a vow, it would seem that if a person marry in despite of a vow his marriage
    should be annulled for that reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in marriage a man may have carnal
    intercourse without sin. Yet he who has taken a simple vow of chastity can
    never have carnal intercourse with his wife without sin. Therefore a simple
    vow annuls marriage. The minor is proved as follows. It is clear that it is
    a mortal sin to marry after taking a simple vow of continence, since
    according to Jerome [*Cf. St. Augustine, De Bono Viduit, ix] "for those who
    vow virginity it is damnable not only to marry, but even to wish to marry."
    Now the marriage contract is not contrary to the vow of continence, except
    by reason of carnal intercourse: and therefore he sins mortally the first
    time he has intercourse with his wife, and for the same reason every other
    time, because a sin committed in the first instance cannot be an excuse for
    a subsequent sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, husband and wife should be equal in
    marriage, especially as regards carnal intercourse. But he who has taken a
    simple vow of continence can never ask for the debt without a sin, for this
    is clearly against his vow of continence, since he is bound to continence by
    vow. Therefore neither can he pay the debt without sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Clement [*Alexander III] says (cap.
    Consuluit, De his qui cler. vel vovent.) that a "simple vow is an impediment
    to the contract of marriage, but does not annul it after it is
    contracted."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing ceases to be in one man's power from
    the fact that it passes into the power of another. Now the promise of a
    thing does not transfer it into the power of the person to whom it is
    promised, wherefore a thing does not cease to be in a person's power for the
    reason that he has promised it. Since then a simple vow contains merely a
    simple promise of one's body to the effect of keeping continence for God's
    sake, a man still retains power over his own body after a simple vow, and
    consequently can surrender it to another, namely his wife; and in this
    surrender consists the sacrament of matrimony, which is indissoluble.
    Therefore although a simple vow is an impediment to the contracting of a
    marriage, since it is a sin to marry after taking a simple vow of
    continence, yet since the contract is valid, the marriage cannot be annulled
    on that account.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A vow is a stronger tie than matrimony,
    as regards that to which man is tied, and the obligation under which he
    lies. because by marriage a man is tied to his wife, with the obligation of
    paying the debt, whereas by a vow a man is tied to God, with the obligation
    of remaining continent. But as to the manner in which he is tied marriage is
    a stronger tie than a simple vow, since by marriage a man surrenders himself
    actually to the power of his wife, but not by a simple vow as explained
    above: and the possessor is always in the stronger position. In this respect
    a simple vow binds in the same way as a betrothal; wherefore a betrothal
    must be annulled on account of a simple vow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The contracting of a marriage between
    blood relations is annulled by the commandment forbidding such marriages,
    not precisely because it is a commandment of God or of the Church, but
    because it makes it impossible for the body of a kinswoman to be transferred
    into the power of her kinsman: whereas the commandment forbidding marriage
    after a simple vow has not this effect, as already stated. Hence the
    argument is void for it assigns as a cause that which is not cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If after taking a simple vow a man
    contract marriage by words of the present, he cannot know his wife without
    mortal sin, because until the marriage is consummated he is still in a
    position to fulfill the vow of continence. But after the marriage has been
    consummated, thenceforth through his fault it is unlawful for him not to pay
    the debt when his wife asks: wherefore this is not covered by his obligation
    to his vow, as explained above (ad 1). Nevertheless he should atone for not
    keeping continence, by his tears of repentance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> After contracting marriage he is still
    bound to keep his vow of continence in those matters wherein he is not
    rendered unable to do so. Hence if his wife die he is bound to continence
    altogether. And since the marriage tie does not bind him to ask for the
    debt, he cannot ask for it without sin, although he can pay the debt without
    sin on being asked, when once he has incurred this obligation through the
    carnal intercourse that has already occurred. And this holds whether the
    wife ask expressly or interpretively, as when she is ashamed and her husband
    feels that she desires him to pay the debt, for then he may pay it without
    sin. This is especially the case if he fears to endanger her chastity: nor
    does it matter that they are equal in the marriage act, since everyone may
    renounce what is his own. Some say, however, that he may both ask and pay
    lest the marriage become too burdensome to the wife who has always to ask;
    but if this be looked into aright, it is the same as asking
    interpretively.<br />

    Whether a solemn vow dissolves a marriage already contracted?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not even a solemn vow
    dissolves a marriage already contracted. For according to a Decretal (cap.
    Rursus, De his qui cler. vel vovent.) "in God's sight a simple vow is no
    less binding than a solemn one." Now marriage stands or falls by virtue of
    the Divine acceptance. Therefore since a simple vow does not dissolve
    marriage, neither will a solemn vow dissolve it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a solemn vow does not add the same force
    to a simple vow as an oath does. Now a simple vow, even though an oath be
    added thereto, does not dissolve a marriage already contracted. Neither
    therefore does a solemn vow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a solemn vow has nothing that a simple
    vow cannot have. For a simple vow may give rise to scandal since it may be
    public, even as a solemn vow. Again the Church could and should ordain that
    a simple vow dissolves a marriage already contracted, so that many sins may
    be avoided. Therefore for the same reason that a simple vow does not
    dissolve a marriage already contracted, neither should a solemn vow dissolve
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> He who takes a solemn vow contracts a
    spiritual marriage with God, which is much more excellent than a material
    marriage. Now a material marriage already contracted annuls a marriage
    contracted afterwards. Therefore a solemn vow does also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the same conclusion may be proved by many authorities quoted in the
    text (Sent. iv, D, 28).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All agree that as a solemn vow is an impediment
    to the contracting of marriage, so it invalidates the contract. Some assign
    scandal as the reason. But this is futile, because even a simple vow
    sometimes leads to scandal since it is at times somewhat public. Moreover
    the indissolubility of marriage belongs to the truth of life [*Cf. FP,
    Question [16], Article [4], ad 3; FP, Question [21], Article [2], ad 2; SS,
    Question [109], Article [3], ad 3], which truth is not to be set aside on
    account of scandal. Wherefore others say that it is on account of the
    ordinance of the Church. But this again is insufficient, since in that case
    the Church might decide the contrary, which is seemingly untrue. Wherefore
    we must say with others that a solemn vow of its very nature dissolves the
    marriage contract, inasmuch namely as thereby a man has lost the power over
    his own body, through surrendering it to God for the purpose of perpetual
    continence. Wherefore he is unable to surrender it to the power of a wife by
    contracting marriage. And since the marriage that follows such a vow is
    void, a vow of this kind is said to annul the marriage contracted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A simple vow is said to be no less
    binding in God's sight than a solemn vow, in matters pertaining to God, for
    instance the separation from God by mortal sin, because he who breaks a
    simple vow commits a mortal sin just as one who breaks a solemn vow,
    although it is more grievous to break a solemn vow, so that the comparison
    be understood as to the genus and not as to the definite degree of guilt.
    But as regards marriage, whereby one man is under an obligation to another,
    there is no need for it to be of equal obligation even in general, since a
    solemn vow binds to certain things to which a simple vow does not bind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An oath is more binding than a vow on
    the part of the cause of the obligation: but a solemn vow is more binding as
    to the manner in which it binds, in so far as it is an actual surrender of
    that which is promised; while an oath does not do this actually. Hence the
    conclusion does not follow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A solemn vow implies the actual
    surrender of one's body, whereas a simple vow does not, as stated above (<a
      href="XP053.html#XPQ53A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Hence the argument does not suffice to prove the conclusion.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether order is an impediment to matrimony?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that order is not an impediment to
    matrimony. For nothing is an impediment to a thing except its contrary. But
    order is not contrary to matrimony. Therefore it is not an impediment
    thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, orders are the same with us as with the
    Eastern Church. But they are not an impediment to matrimony in the Eastern
    Church. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matrimony signifies the union of Christ
    with the Church. Now this is most fittingly signified in those who are
    Christ's ministers, those namely who are ordained. Therefore order is not an
    impediment to matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all the orders are directed to spiritual
    things. Now order cannot be an impediment to matrimony except by reason of
    its spirituality. Therefore if order is an impediment to matrimony, every
    order will be an impediment, and this is untrue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every ordained person can have
    ecclesiastical benefices, and can enjoy equally the privilege of clergy. If,
    therefore, orders are an impediment to marriage, because married persons
    cannot have an ecclesiastical benefice, nor enjoy the privilege of clergy,
    as jurists assert (cap. Joannes et seqq., De cler. conjug.), then every
    order ought to be an impediment. Yet this is false, as shown by the Decretal
    of Alexander III (De cler. conjug., cap. Si Quis): and consequently it would
    seem that no order is an impediment to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> the Decretal says (De cler. conjug., cap. Si
    Quis): "any person whom you shall find to have taken a wife after receiving
    the subdiaconate or the higher orders, you shall compel to put his wife
    away." But this would not be so if the marriage were valid.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, no person who has vowed continence can contract marriage. Now some
    orders have a vow of continence connected with them, as appears from the
    text (Sent. iv, D, 37). Therefore in that case order is an impediment to
    matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By a certain fittingness the very nature of
    holy order requires that it should be an impediment to marriage: because
    those who are in holy orders handle the sacred vessels and the sacraments:
    wherefore it is becoming that they keep their bodies clean by continence
    [*Cf. Is. 52:11]. But it is owing to the Church's ordinance that it is
    actually an impediment to marriage. However it is not the same with the
    Latins as with the Greeks; since with the Greeks it is an impediment to the
    contracting of marriage, solely by virtue of order; whereas with the Latins
    it is an impediment by virtue of order, and besides by virtue of the vow of
    continence which is annexed to the sacred orders; for although this vow is
    not expressed in words, nevertheless a person is understood to have taken it
    by the very fact of his being ordained. Hence among the Greeks and other
    Eastern peoples a sacred order is an impediment to the contracting of
    matrimony but it does not forbid the use of marriage already contracted: for
    they can use marriage contracted previously, although they cannot be married
    again. But in the Western Church it is an impediment both to marriage and to
    the use of marriage, unless perhaps the husband should receive a sacred
    order without the knowledge or consent of his wife, because this cannot be
    prejudicial to her.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Of the distinction between sacred and non-sacred orders now and in the early
    Church we have spoken above (<a href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1"
      >Question [37]</a
    >, <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a sacred order is not contrary
    to matrimony as a sacrament, it has a certain incompatibility with marriage
    in respect of the latter's act which is an obstacle to spiritual acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The objection is based on a false
    statement: since order is everywhere an impediment to the contracting of
    marriage, although it has not everywhere a vow annexed to it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in sacred orders signify
    Christ by more sublime actions, as appears from what has been said in the
    treatise on orders (<a href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>,
    <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), than those who are
    married. Consequently the conclusion does not follow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who are in minor orders are not
    forbidden to marry by virtue of their order; for although those orders are
    entrusted with certain spiritualities, they are not admitted to the
    immediate handling of sacred things, as those are who are in sacred orders.
    But according to the laws of the Western Church, the use of marriage is an
    impediment to the exercise of a non-sacred order, for the sake of
    maintaining a greater honesty in the offices of the Church. And since the
    holding of an ecclesiastical benefice binds a man to the exercise of his
    order, and since for this very reason he enjoys the privilege of clergy, it
    follows that in the Latin Church this privilege is forfeit to a married
    cleric.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the last Objection.</p>

    Whether a sacred order cannot supervene to matrimony?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a sacred order cannot
    supervene to matrimony. For the stronger prejudices the weaker. Now a
    spiritual obligation is stronger than a bodily tie. Therefore if a married
    man be ordained, this will prejudice the wife, so that she will be unable to
    demand the debt, since order is a spiritual, and marriage a bodily bond.
    Hence it would seem that a man cannot receive a sacred order after
    consummating marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, after consummating the marriage, one of
    the parties cannot vow continence without the other's consent [*Cf. Question
    [61], Article [1]]. Now a sacred order has a vow of continence annexed to
    it. Therefore if the husband be ordained without his wife's consent, she
    will be bound to remain continent against her will, since she cannot marry
    another man during her husband's lifetime.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a husband may not even for a time devote
    himself to prayer without his wife's consent (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A5"
      >1 Cor. 7:5</a
    >). But in the Eastern Church those who are in sacred orders are bound to
    continence for the time when they exercise their office. Therefore neither
    may they be ordained without their wife's consent, and much less may the
    Latins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, husband and wife are on a par with one
    another. Now a Greek priest cannot marry again after his wife's death.
    Therefore neither can his wife after her husband's death. But she cannot be
    deprived by her husband's act of the right to marry after his death.
    Therefore her husband cannot receive orders after marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, order is as much opposed to marriage as
    marriage to order. Now a previous order is an impediment to a subsequent
    marriage. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Religious are bound to continence like those
    who are in sacred orders. But a man may enter religion after marriage, if
    his wife die, or if she consent. Therefore he can also receive orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, a man may become a man's bondsman after marriage. Therefore he can
    become a bondsman of God by receiving orders.<br />

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Marriage is not an impediment to the receiving
    of sacred orders, since if a married man receive sacred orders, even though
    his wife be unwilling, he receives the character of order: but he lacks the
    exercise of his order. If, however, his wife consent, or if she be dead, he
    receives both the order and the exercise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The bond of orders dissolves the bond of
    marriage as regards the payment of the debt, in respect of which it is
    incompatible with marriage, on the part of the person ordained, since he
    cannot demand the debt, nor is the wife bound to pay it. But it does not
    dissolve the bond in respect of the other party, since the husband is bound
    to pay the debt to the wife if he cannot persuade her to observe
    continence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the husband receive sacred orders
    with the knowledge and consent of his wife, she is bound to vow perpetual
    continence, but she is not bound to enter religion, if she has no fear of
    her chastity being endangered through her husband having taken a solemn vow:
    it would have been different, however, if he had taken a simple vow. On the
    other hand, if he be ordained without her consent, she is not bound in this
    way, because the result is not prejudicial to her in any way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It would seem more probable, although
    some say the contrary, that even a Greek ought not to receive sacred orders
    without his wife's consent, since at least at the time of his ministry she
    would be deprived of the payment of the debt, of which she cannot be
    deprived according to law if the husband should have been ordained without
    her consent or knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated, among the Greeks the wife, by
    the very fact of consenting to her husband's receiving a sacred order, binds
    herself never to marry another man, because the signification of marriage
    would not be safeguarded, and this is especially required in the marriage of
    a priest. If, however, he be ordained without her consent, seemingly she
    would not be under that obligation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Marriage has for its cause our consent:
    not so order, which has a sacramental cause appointed by God. Hence
    matrimony may be impeded by a previous order; so as not to be true marriage:
    whereas order cannot be impeded by marriage, so as not to be true order,
    because the power of the sacraments is unchangeable, whereas human acts can
    be impeded.<br />
