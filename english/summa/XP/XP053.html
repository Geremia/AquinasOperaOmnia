<H3 Align="Center">OF THE IMPEDIMENT OF VOWS AND ORDERS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the impediment of vows and orders. Under this head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP053.html#XPQ53A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a simple vow is a diriment impediment to matrimony?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP053.html#XPQ53A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a solemn vow is a diriment impediment?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP053.html#XPQ53A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether order is an impediment to matrimony?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP053.html#XPQ53A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a man can receive a sacred order after being married?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether marriage already contracted should be annulled by the obligation of a simple vow?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a marriage already contracted ought to be 
annulled by the obligation of a simple vow. For the stronger tie takes 
precedence of the weaker. Now a vow is a stronger tie than marriage, 
since the latter binds man to man, but the former binds man to God. 
Therefore the obligation of a vow takes precedence of the marriage tie.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God's commandment is no less binding than the 
commandment of the Church. Now the commandment of the Church is so 
binding that a marriage is void if contracted in despite thereof; as 
instanced in the case of those who marry within the degrees of kindred 
forbidden by the Church. Therefore, since it is a Divine commandment to 
keep a vow, it would seem that if a person marry in despite of a vow his 
marriage should be annulled for that reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in marriage a man may have carnal intercourse without 
sin. Yet he who has taken a simple vow of chastity can never have carnal 
intercourse with his wife without sin. Therefore a simple vow annuls 
marriage. The minor is proved as follows. It is  clear that it is a 
mortal sin to marry after taking a simple vow of continence, since 
according to Jerome [*Cf. St. Augustine, De Bono Viduit, ix] "for those 
who vow virginity it is damnable not only to marry, but even to wish to 
marry." Now the marriage contract is not contrary to the vow of 
continence, except by reason of carnal intercourse: and therefore he sins 
mortally the first time he has intercourse with his wife, and for the 
same reason every other time, because a sin committed in the first 
instance cannot be an excuse for a subsequent sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, husband and wife should be equal in marriage, especially 
as regards carnal intercourse. But he who has taken a simple vow of 
continence can never ask for the debt without a sin, for this is clearly 
against his vow of continence, since he is bound to continence by vow. 
Therefore neither can he pay the debt without sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Clement [*Alexander III] says (cap. Consuluit, De 
his qui cler. vel vovent.) that a "simple vow is an impediment to the 
contract of marriage, but does not annul it after it is contracted."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing ceases to be in one man's power from the fact 
that it passes into the power of another. Now the promise of a thing does 
not transfer it into the power of the person to whom it is promised, 
wherefore a thing does not cease to be in a person's power for the reason 
that he has promised it. Since then a simple vow contains merely a simple 
promise of one's body to the effect of keeping continence for God's sake, 
a man still retains power over his own body after a simple vow, and 
consequently can surrender it to another, namely his wife; and in this 
surrender consists the sacrament of matrimony, which is indissoluble. 
Therefore although a simple vow is an impediment to the contracting of a 
marriage, since it is a sin to marry after taking a simple vow of 
continence, yet since the contract is valid, the marriage cannot be 
annulled on that account.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A vow is a stronger tie than matrimony, as regards that to 
which man is tied, and the obligation under which he lies. because by 
marriage a man is tied to his wife, with the obligation of paying the 
debt, whereas by a vow a man is tied to God, with the obligation of 
remaining continent. But as to the manner in which he is tied marriage is 
a stronger tie than a simple vow, since by marriage a man surrenders 
himself actually to the power of his wife, but not by a simple vow as 
explained above: and the possessor is always in the stronger position. In 
this respect a simple vow binds in the same way as a betrothal; wherefore 
a betrothal must be annulled on account of a simple vow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The contracting of a marriage between blood relations is 
annulled by the commandment forbidding such marriages, not precisely 
because it is a commandment of God or of the Church, but because it makes 
it impossible for the body of a kinswoman to be transferred into the 
power of her kinsman: whereas the  commandment forbidding marriage after 
a simple vow has not this effect, as already stated. Hence the argument 
is void for it assigns as a cause that which is not cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If after taking a simple vow a man contract marriage by 
words of the present, he cannot know his wife without mortal sin, because 
until the marriage is consummated he is still in a position to fulfill 
the vow of continence. But after the marriage has been consummated, 
thenceforth through his fault it is unlawful for him not to pay the debt 
when his wife asks: wherefore this is not covered by his obligation to 
his vow, as explained above (ad 1). Nevertheless he should atone for not 
keeping continence, by his tears of repentance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> After contracting marriage he is still bound to keep his 
vow of continence in those matters wherein he is not rendered unable to 
do so. Hence if his wife die he is bound to continence altogether. And 
since the marriage tie does not bind him to ask for the debt, he cannot 
ask for it without sin, although he can pay the debt without sin on being 
asked, when once he has incurred this obligation through the carnal 
intercourse that has already occurred. And this holds whether the wife 
ask expressly or interpretively, as when she is ashamed and her husband 
feels that she desires him to pay the debt, for then he may pay it 
without sin. This is especially the case if he fears to endanger her 
chastity: nor does it matter that they are equal in the marriage act, 
since everyone may renounce what is his own. Some say, however, that he 
may both ask and pay lest the marriage become too burdensome to the wife 
who has always to ask; but if this be looked into aright, it is the same 
as asking interpretively.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a solemn vow dissolves a marriage already contracted?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not even a solemn vow dissolves a marriage 
already contracted. For according to a Decretal (cap. Rursus, De his qui 
cler. vel vovent.) "in God's sight a simple vow is no less binding than a 
solemn one." Now marriage stands or falls by virtue of the Divine 
acceptance. Therefore since a simple vow does not dissolve marriage, 
neither will a solemn vow dissolve it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a solemn vow does not add the same force to a simple vow 
as an oath does. Now a simple vow, even though an oath be added thereto, 
does not dissolve a marriage already contracted. Neither therefore does a 
solemn vow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a solemn vow has nothing that a simple vow cannot have. 
For a simple vow may give rise to scandal since it may be public, even as 
a solemn vow. Again the Church could and should ordain that a simple vow 
dissolves a marriage already contracted, so that many sins may be 
avoided. Therefore for the same reason that a simple vow does not 
dissolve a marriage already contracted, neither should a solemn vow 
dissolve it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> He who takes a solemn vow contracts a  spiritual 
marriage with God, which is much more excellent than a material marriage. 
Now a material marriage already contracted annuls a marriage contracted 
afterwards. Therefore a solemn vow does also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the same conclusion may be proved by many authorities quoted in 
the text (Sent. iv, D, 28).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All agree that as a solemn vow is an impediment to the 
contracting of marriage, so it invalidates the contract. Some assign 
scandal as the reason. But this is futile, because even a simple vow 
sometimes leads to scandal since it is at times somewhat public. Moreover 
the indissolubility of marriage belongs to the truth of life [*Cf. FP, 
Question [16], Article [4], ad 3; FP, Question [21], Article [2], ad 2; SS, Question [109], Article [3], ad 3], which 
truth is not to be set aside on account of scandal. Wherefore others say 
that it is on account of the ordinance of the Church. But this again is 
insufficient, since in that case the Church might decide the contrary, 
which is seemingly untrue. Wherefore we must say with others that a 
solemn vow of its very nature dissolves the marriage contract, inasmuch 
namely as thereby a man has lost the power over his own body, through 
surrendering it to God for the purpose of perpetual continence. Wherefore 
he is unable to surrender it to the power of a wife by contracting 
marriage. And since the marriage that follows such a vow is void, a vow 
of this kind is said to annul the marriage contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A simple vow is said to be no less binding in God's sight 
than a solemn vow, in matters pertaining to God, for instance the 
separation from God by mortal sin, because he who breaks a simple vow 
commits a mortal sin just as one who breaks a solemn vow, although it is 
more grievous to break a solemn vow, so that the comparison be understood 
as to the genus and not as to the definite degree of guilt. But as 
regards marriage, whereby one man is under an obligation to another, 
there is no need for it to be of equal obligation even in general, since 
a solemn vow binds to certain things to which a simple vow does not bind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An oath is more binding than a vow on the part of the cause 
of the obligation: but a solemn vow is more binding as to the manner in 
which it binds, in so far as it is an actual surrender of that which is 
promised; while an oath does not do this actually. Hence the conclusion 
does not follow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A solemn vow implies the actual surrender of one's body, 
whereas a simple vow does not, as stated above (<A Href="XP053.html#XPQ53A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence the argument 
does not suffice to prove the conclusion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether order is an impediment to matrimony?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that order is not an impediment to matrimony. For 
nothing is an impediment to a thing except its contrary. But order is not 
contrary to matrimony. Therefore it is  not an impediment thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, orders are the same with us as with the Eastern Church. 
But they are not an impediment to matrimony in the Eastern Church. 
Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matrimony signifies the union of Christ with the Church. 
Now this is most fittingly signified in those who are Christ's ministers, 
those namely who are ordained. Therefore order is not an impediment to 
matrimony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all the orders are directed to spiritual things. Now 
order cannot be an impediment to matrimony except by reason of its 
spirituality. Therefore if order is an impediment to matrimony, every 
order will be an impediment, and this is untrue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every ordained person can have ecclesiastical benefices, 
and can enjoy equally the privilege of clergy. If, therefore, orders are 
an impediment to marriage, because married persons cannot have an 
ecclesiastical benefice, nor enjoy the privilege of clergy, as jurists 
assert (cap. Joannes et seqq., De cler. conjug.), then every order ought 
to be an impediment. Yet this is false, as shown by the Decretal of 
Alexander III (De cler. conjug., cap. Si Quis): and consequently it would 
seem that no order is an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> the Decretal says (De cler. conjug., cap. Si Quis): 
"any person whom you shall find to have taken a wife after receiving the 
subdiaconate or the higher orders, you shall compel to put his wife 
away." But this would not be so if the marriage were valid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, no person who has vowed continence can contract marriage. Now 
some orders have a vow of continence connected with them, as appears from 
the text (Sent. iv, D, 37). Therefore in that case order is an impediment 
to matrimony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By a certain fittingness the very nature of holy order 
requires that it should be an impediment to marriage: because those who 
are in holy orders handle the sacred vessels and the sacraments: 
wherefore it is becoming that they keep their bodies clean by continence 
[*Cf. Is. 52:11]. But it is owing to the Church's ordinance that it is 
actually an impediment to marriage. However it is not the same with the 
Latins as with the Greeks; since with the Greeks it is an impediment to 
the contracting of marriage, solely by virtue of order; whereas with the 
Latins it is an impediment by virtue of order, and besides by virtue of 
the vow of continence which is annexed to the sacred orders; for although 
this vow is not expressed in words, nevertheless a person is understood 
to have taken it by the very fact of his being ordained. Hence among the 
Greeks and other Eastern peoples a sacred order is an impediment to the 
contracting of matrimony but it does not forbid the use of marriage 
already contracted: for they can use marriage contracted previously, 
although they cannot be married  again. But in the Western Church it is 
an impediment both to marriage and to the use of marriage, unless perhaps 
the husband should receive a sacred order without the knowledge or 
consent of his wife, because this cannot be prejudicial to her.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the distinction between sacred and non-sacred orders now and in the 
early Church we have spoken above (<A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a sacred order is not contrary to matrimony as a 
sacrament, it has a certain incompatibility with marriage in respect of 
the latter's act which is an obstacle to spiritual acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The objection is based on a false statement: since order is 
everywhere an impediment to the contracting of marriage, although it has 
not everywhere a vow annexed to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in sacred orders signify Christ by more 
sublime actions, as appears from what has been said in the treatise on 
orders (<A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), than those who are married. Consequently the 
conclusion does not follow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who are in minor orders are not forbidden to marry by 
virtue of their order; for although those orders are entrusted with 
certain spiritualities, they are not admitted to the immediate handling 
of sacred things, as those are who are in sacred orders. But according to 
the laws of the Western Church, the use of marriage is an impediment to 
the exercise of a non-sacred order, for the sake of maintaining a greater 
honesty in the offices of the Church. And since the holding of an 
ecclesiastical benefice binds a man to the exercise of his order, and 
since for this very reason he enjoys the privilege of clergy, it follows 
that in the Latin Church this privilege is forfeit to a married cleric.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the last Objection.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a sacred order cannot supervene to matrimony?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a sacred order cannot supervene to matrimony. 
For the stronger prejudices the weaker. Now a spiritual obligation is 
stronger than a bodily tie. Therefore if a married man be ordained, this 
will prejudice the wife, so that she will be unable to demand the debt, 
since order is a spiritual, and marriage a bodily bond. Hence it would 
seem that a man cannot receive a sacred order after consummating marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, after consummating the marriage, one of the parties 
cannot vow continence without the other's consent [*Cf. Question [61], Article [1]]. Now 
a sacred order has a vow of continence annexed to it. Therefore if the 
husband be ordained without his wife's consent, she will be bound to 
remain continent against her will, since she cannot marry another man 
during her husband's lifetime.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a husband may not even for a time devote himself to 
prayer without his wife's consent (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++7:5">1 Cor. 7:5</a>). But in the Eastern Church 
those who are in sacred orders are bound to continence for the time when 
they exercise their office. Therefore neither may they be ordained 
without their wife's consent, and much less may the Latins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, husband and wife are on a par with one another. Now a 
Greek priest cannot marry again after his wife's death. Therefore neither 
can his wife after her husband's death. But she cannot be deprived by her 
husband's act of the right to marry after his death. Therefore her 
husband cannot receive orders after marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, order is as much opposed to marriage as marriage to 
order. Now a previous order is an impediment to a subsequent marriage. 
Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Religious are bound to continence like those who are in 
sacred orders. But a man may enter religion after marriage, if his wife 
die, or if she consent. Therefore he can also receive orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, a man may become a man's bondsman after marriage. Therefore he 
can become a bondsman of God by receiving orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Marriage is not an impediment to the receiving of sacred 
orders, since if a married man receive sacred orders, even though his 
wife be unwilling, he receives the character of order: but he lacks the 
exercise of his order. If, however, his wife consent, or if she be dead, 
he receives both the order and the exercise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The bond of orders dissolves the bond of marriage as 
regards the payment of the debt, in respect of which it is incompatible 
with marriage, on the part of the person ordained, since he cannot demand 
the debt, nor is the wife bound to pay it. But it does not dissolve the 
bond in respect of the other party, since the husband is bound to pay the 
debt to the wife if he cannot persuade her to observe continence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the husband receive sacred orders with the knowledge and 
consent of his wife, she is bound to vow perpetual continence, but she is 
not bound to enter religion, if she has no fear of her chastity being 
endangered through her husband having taken a solemn vow: it would have 
been different, however, if he had taken a simple vow. On the other hand, 
if he be ordained without her consent, she is not bound in this way, 
because the result is not prejudicial to her in any way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It would seem more probable, although some say the 
contrary, that even a Greek ought not to receive sacred orders without 
his wife's consent, since at least at the time of his ministry she would 
be deprived of the payment of the debt, of which  she cannot be deprived 
according to law if the husband should have been ordained without her 
consent or knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated, among the Greeks the wife, by the very fact of 
consenting to her husband's receiving a sacred order, binds herself never 
to marry another man, because the signification of marriage would not be 
safeguarded, and this is especially required in the marriage of a priest. 
If, however, he be ordained without her consent, seemingly she would not 
be under that obligation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[53] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Marriage has for its cause our consent: not so order, which 
has a sacramental cause appointed by God. Hence matrimony may be impeded 
by a previous order; so as not to be true marriage: whereas order cannot 
be impeded by marriage, so as not to be true order, because the power of 
the sacraments is unchangeable, whereas human acts can be impeded.<br>
