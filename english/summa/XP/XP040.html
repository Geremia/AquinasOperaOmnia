</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the things that are annexed to the sacrament of 
Order. Under this head there are seven points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether those who are ordained ought to be shaven and tonsured in 
the form of a crown?<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether above the priestly Order there should be an episcopal power?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the episcopate is an Order?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether in the Church there can be any power above the  episcopate?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the vestments of the ministers are fittingly instituted by 
the Church?<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether those who are ordained ought to wear the tonsure?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those who are ordained ought not to wear the 
tonsure in the shape of a crown. For the Lord threatened captivity and 
dispersion to those who were shaven in this way: "Of the captivity of the 
bare head of the enemies" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++32%3A42">Dt. 32:42</a>), and: "I will scatter into every 
wind them that have their hair cut round" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++49%3A32">Jer. 49:32</a>). Now the ministers 
of Christ should not be captives, but free. Therefore shaving and tonsure 
in the shape of a crown does not become them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the truth should correspond to the figure. Now the crown 
was prefigured in the Old Law by the tonsure of the Nazarenes, as stated 
in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Therefore since the Nazarenes were not 
ordained to the Divine ministry, it would seem that the ministers of the 
Church should not receive the tonsure or shave the head in the form of a 
crown. The same would seem to follow from the fact that lay brothers, who 
are not ministers of the Church, receive a tonsure in the religious 
Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the hair signifies superabundance, because it grows from 
that which is superabundant. But the ministers of the Church should cast 
off all superabundance. Therefore they should shave the head completely 
and not in the shape of a crown.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Gregory, "to serve God is to reign" (Super 
Ps. 101:23). Now a crown is the sign of royalty. Therefore a crown is 
becoming to those who are devoted to the Divine ministry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, according to 1 Cor. 11:15, hair is given us "for a covering." 
But the ministers of the altar should have the mind uncovered. Therefore 
the tonsure is becoming to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is becoming for those who apply themselves to the 
Divine ministry to be shaven or tonsured in the form of a crown by reason 
of the shape. Because a crown is the sign of royalty; and of perfection, 
since it is circular; and those who are appointed to the Divine service 
acquire a royal dignity and ought to be perfect in virtue. It is also 
becoming to them as it involves the hair being taken both from the higher 
part of the head by shaving, lest their mind be hindered by temporal 
occupations from contemplating Divine things, and from the lower part by 
clipping, lest their senses be entangled in temporal things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Lord threatens those who did this for the worship of 
demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The things that were done in the Old Testament  represent 
imperfectly the things of the New Testament. Hence things pertaining to 
the ministers of the New Testament were signified not only by the offices 
of the Levites, but also by all those persons who professed some degree 
of perfection. Now the Nazarenes professed a certain perfection by having 
their hair cut off, thus signifying their contempt of temporal things, 
although they did not have it cut in the shape of a crown, but cut it off 
completely, for as yet it was not the time of the royal and perfect 
priesthood. In like manner lay brothers have their hair cut because they 
renounce temporalities. but they do not shave the head, because they are 
not occupied in the Divine ministry, so as to have to contemplate Divine 
things with the mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not only the renunciation of temporalities, but also the 
royal dignity has to be signified by the form of a crown; wherefore the 
hair should not be cut off entirely. Another reason is that this would be 
unbecoming.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the tonsure is an Order?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the tonsure is an Order. For in the acts of 
the Church the spiritual corresponds to the corporal. Now the tonsure is 
a corporal sign employed by the Church. Therefore seemingly there is some 
interior signification corresponding thereto; so that a person receives a 
character when he receives the tonsure, and consequently the latter is an 
Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as Confirmation and the other Orders are given by a 
bishop alone, so is the tonsure. Now a character is imprinted in 
Confirmation, and the other Orders. Therefore one is imprinted likewise 
in receiving the tonsure. Therefore the same conclusion follows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Order denotes a degree of dignity. Now a cleric by the 
very fact of being a cleric is placed on a degree above the people. 
Therefore the tonsure by which he is made a cleric is an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No Order is given except during the celebration of 
Mass. But the tonsure is given even outside the office of the Mass. 
Therefore it is not an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in the conferring of every Order mention is made of some power 
granted, but not in the conferring of the tonsure. Therefore it is not an 
Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The ministers of the Church are severed from the people 
in order that they may give themselves entirely to the Divine worship. 
Now in the Divine worship are certain actions that have to be exercised 
by virtue of certain definite powers, and for this purpose the spiritual 
power of order is given; while other actions are performed by the whole 
body of ministers in common, for instance the recital of the Divine 
praises. For such things it is  not necessary to have the power of Order, 
but only to be deputed to such an office; and this is done by the 
tonsure. Consequently it is not an Order but a preamble to Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The tonsure has some spiritual thing inwardly corresponding 
to it, as signate corresponds to sign; but this is not a spiritual power. 
Wherefore a character is not imprinted in the tonsure as in an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although a man does not receive a character in the tonsure, 
nevertheless he is appointed to the Divine worship. Hence this 
appointment should be made by the supreme minister, namely the bishop, 
who moreover blesses the vestments and vessels and whatsoever else is 
employed in the Divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man through being a cleric is in a higher state than a 
layman; but as regards power he has not the higher degree that is 
required for Orders.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether by receiving the tonsure a man renounces temporal goods?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men renounce temporal goods by receiving the 
tonsure, for when they are tonsured they say: "The Lord is the portion of 
my inheritance." But as Jerome says (Ep. ad Nepot.), "the Lord disdains 
to be made a portion together with these temporal things." Therefore he 
renounces temporalities.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the justice of the ministers of the New Testament ought 
to abound more than that of the ministers of the Old Testament (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A20">Mt. 5:20</a>). But the ministers of the Old Testament, namely the Levites, did 
not receive a portion of inheritance with their brethren (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++10;+Dt++18">Dt. 10; Dt. 18</a>). Therefore neither should the ministers of the New Testament.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Hugh says (De Sacram. ii) that "after a man is made a 
cleric, he must from thenceforward live on the pay of the Church." But 
this would not be so were he to retain his patrimony. Therefore he would 
seem to renounce it by becoming a cleric.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jeremias was of the priestly order (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++1%3A1">Jer. 1:1</a>). Yet he 
retained possession of his inheritance (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++32%3A8">Jer. 32:8</a>). Therefore clerics can 
retain their patrimony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, if this were not so there would seem to be no difference 
between religious and the secular clergy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Clerics by receiving the tonsure, do not renounce their 
patrimony or other temporalities; since the possession of earthly things 
is not contrary to the Divine worship to which clerics are appointed, 
although excessive care for such things is; for as Gregory says (Moral. 
x, 30), "it is not wealth but the love of wealth that is sinful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 11 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>: The Lord disdains to be a portion as being loved equally 
with other things, so that a man place his end in God and the things of 
the world. He does not, however, disdain to be the portion of those who 
so possess the things of the world as not to be withdrawn thereby from 
the Divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the Old Testament the Levites had a right to their 
paternal inheritance; and the reason why they did not receive a portion 
with the other tribes was because they were scattered throughout all the 
tribes, which would have been impossible if, like the other tribes, they 
had received one fixed portion of the soil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Clerics promoted to holy orders, if they be poor, must be 
provided for by the bishop who ordained them; otherwise he is not so 
bound. And they are bound to minister to the Church in the Order they 
have received. The words of Hugh refer to those who have no means of 
livelihood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether above the priestly Order there ought to be an episcopal power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there ought not to be an episcopal power above 
the priestly Order. For as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) "the 
priestly Order originated from Aaron." Now in the Old Law there was no 
one above Aaron. Therefore neither in the New Law ought there to be any 
power above that of the priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, powers rank according to acts. Now no sacred act can be 
greater than to consecrate the body of Christ, whereunto the priestly 
power is directed. Therefore there should not be an episcopal above the 
priestly power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priest, in offering, represents Christ in the 
Church, Who offered Himself for us to the Father. Now no one is above 
Christ in the Church, since He is the Head of the Church. Therefore there 
should not be an episcopal above the priestly power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A power is so much the higher according as it extends 
to more things. Now the priestly power, according to Dionysius (Eccl. 
Hier. v), extends only to cleansing and enlightening, whereas the 
episcopal power extends both to this and to perfecting. Therefore the 
episcopal should be above the priestly power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the Divine ministries should be more orderly than human 
ministries. Now the order of human ministries requires that in each 
office there should be one person to preside, just as a general is placed 
over soldiers. Therefore there should also be appointed over priests one 
who is the chief priest, and this is the bishop. Therefore the episcopal 
should be above the priestly power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A priest has two acts: one is the principal, namely to 
consecrate the body of Christ. the other is secondary, namely to prepare 
God's people for the reception of this sacrament, as stated above (<A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4). As regards the first act, the priest's power does not depend on 
a higher power save God's; but as to the second, it depends on a higher 
and that a human power. For every power that cannot exercise its act 
without certain ordinances, depends on the power that makes those 
ordinances. Now a priest cannot loose and bind, except we presuppose him 
to have the jurisdiction of authority, whereby those whom he absolves are 
subject to him. But he can consecrate any matter determined by Christ, 
nor is anything else required for the validity of the sacrament; 
although, on account of a certain congruousness, the act of the bishop is 
pre-required in the consecration of the altar, vestments, and so forth. 
Hence it is clear that it behooves the episcopal to be above the priestly 
power, as regards the priest's secondary act, but not as regards his 
primary act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Aaron was both priest and pontiff, that is chief priest. 
Accordingly the priestly power originated from him, in so far as he was a 
priest offering sacrifices, which was lawful even to the lesser priests; 
but it does not originate from him as pontiff, by which power he was able 
to do certain things; for instance, to enter once a year the Holy of 
Holies, which it was unlawful for the other priests to do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no higher power with regard to this act, but with 
regard to another, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the perfections of all natural things pre-exist in 
God as their exemplar, so was Christ the exemplar of all ecclesiastical 
offices. Wherefore each minister of the Church is, in some respect, a 
copy of Christ, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Yet he is the 
higher who represents Christ according to a greater perfection. Now a 
priest represents Christ in that He fulfilled a certain ministry by 
Himself, whereas a bishop represents Him in that He instituted other 
ministers and founded the Church. Hence it belongs to a bishop to 
dedicate a thing to the Divine offices, as establishing the Divine 
worship after the manner of Christ. For this reason also a bishop is 
especially called the bridegroom of the Church even as Christ is.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the episcopate is an Order?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the episcopate is an Order. First of all, 
because Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. v) assigns these three orders to the 
ecclesiastical hierarchy, the bishop, the priest, and the minister. In 
the text also (Sent. iv, D, 24) it is stated that the episcopal Order is 
fourfold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Order is nothing else but a degree of power in the 
dispensing of spiritual things. Now bishops can dispense certain 
sacraments which priests cannot dispense, namely  Confirmation and Order. 
Therefore the episcopate is an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the Church there is no spiritual power other than of 
Order or jurisdiction. But things pertaining to the episcopal power are 
not matters of jurisdiction, else they might be committed to one who is 
not a bishop, which is false. Therefore they belong to the power of 
Order. Therefore the bishop has an Order which a simple priest has not; 
and thus the episcopate is an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> One Order does not depend on a preceding order as 
regards the validity of the sacrament. But the episcopal power depends on 
the priestly power, since no one can receive the episcopal power unless 
he have previously the priestly power. Therefore the episcopate is not an 
Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the greater Orders are not conferred except on Saturdays [*The 
four Ember Saturdays]. But the episcopal power is bestowed on Sundays 
[*Dist. lxxv, can. Ordinationes]. Therefore it is not an Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Order may be understood in two ways. In one way as a 
sacrament, and thus, as already stated (<A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="XP037.html#XPQ37ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), every Order is 
directed to the sacrament of the Eucharist. Wherefore since the bishop 
has not a higher power than the priest, in this respect the episcopate is 
not an Order. In another way Order may be considered as an office in 
relation to certain sacred actions: and thus since in hierarchical 
actions a bishop has in relation to the mystical body a higher power than 
the priest, the episcopate is an Order. It is in this sense that the 
authorities quoted speak.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Order considered as a sacrament which imprints a character 
is specially directed to the sacrament of the Eucharist, in which Christ 
Himself is contained, because by a character we are made like to Christ 
Himself [*Cf. TP, Question [63], Article [3]]. Hence although at his promotion a bishop 
receives a spiritual power in respect of certain sacraments, this power 
nevertheless has not the nature of a character. For this reason the 
episcopate is not an Order, in the sense in which an Order is a sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The episcopal power is one not only of jurisdiction but 
also of Order, as stated above, taking Order in the sense in which it is 
generally understood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the Church there can be anyone above the bishops?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be anyone in the Church higher 
than the bishops. For all the bishops are the successors of the apostles. 
Now the power so given to one of the apostles, namely Peter (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++16%3A19">Mt. 16:19</a>), 
was given to all the apostles (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++20%3A23">Jn. 20:23</a>). Therefore all bishops are 
equal, and one is not above another. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the rite of the Church ought to be more conformed to the 
Jewish rite than to that of the Gentiles. Now the distinction of the 
episcopal dignity and the appointment of one over another, were 
introduced by the Gentiles. as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24); and 
there was no such thing in the Old Law. Therefore neither in the Church 
should one bishop be above another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a higher power cannot be conferred by a lower, nor equal 
by equal, because "without all contradiction that which is less is 
blessed by the greater [Vulg.: 'better']"; hence a priest does not 
consecrate a bishop or a priest, but a bishop consecrates a priest. But a 
bishop can consecrate any bishop, since even the bishop of Ostia 
consecrates the Pope. Therefore the episcopal dignity is equal in all 
matters, and consequently one bishop should not be subject to another, as 
stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We read in the council of Constantinople: "In 
accordance with the Scriptures and the statutes and definitions of the 
canons, we venerate the most holy bishop of ancient Rome the first and 
greatest of bishops, and after him the bishop of Constantinople." 
Therefore one bishop is above another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the blessed Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, says: "That we may 
remain members of our apostolic head, the throne of the Roman Pontiffs, 
of whom it is our duty to seek what we are to believe and what we are to 
hold, venerating him, beseeching him above others; for his it is to 
reprove, to correct, to appoint, to loose, and to bind in place of Him 
Who set up that very throne, and Who gave the fulness of His own to no 
other, but to him alone, to whom by divine right all bow the head, and 
the primates of the world are obedient as to our Lord Jesus Christ 
Himself." Therefore bishops are subject to someone even by divine right.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Wherever there are several authorities directed to one 
purpose, there must needs be one universal authority over the particular 
authorities, because in all virtues and acts the order is according to 
the order of their ends (Ethic. i, 1,2). Now the common good is more 
Godlike than the particular good. Wherefore above the governing power 
which aims at a particular good there must be a universal governing power 
in respect of the common good, otherwise there would be no cohesion 
towards the one object. Hence since the whole Church is one body, it 
behooves, if this oneness is to be preserved, that there be a governing 
power in respect of the whole Church, above the episcopal power whereby 
each particular Church is governed, and this is the power of the Pope. 
Consequently those who deny this power are called schismatics as causing 
a division in the unity of the Church. Again, between a simple bishop and 
the Pope there are other degrees of rank corresponding to the degrees of 
union, in respect of which one congregation or community includes 
another; thus the community of a province includes the community of a 
city, and the community of a kingdom includes the community of one 
province, and the community of the whole world  includes the community of 
one kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the power of binding and loosing was given to all 
the apostles in common, nevertheless in order to indicate some order in 
this power, it was given first of all to Peter alone, to show that this 
power must come down from him to the others. For this reason He said to 
him in the singular: "Confirm thy brethren" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++22%3A32">Lk. 22:32</a>), and: "Feed My 
sheep" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++21%3A17">Jn. 21:17</a>), i.e. according to Chrysostom: "Be thou the president 
and head of thy brethren in My stead, that they, putting thee in My 
place, may preach and confirm thee throughout the world whilst thou 
sittest on thy throne."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Jewish rite was not spread abroad in various kingdoms 
and provinces, but was confined to one nation; hence there was no need to 
distinguish various pontiffs under the one who had the chief power. But 
the rite of the Church, like that of the Gentiles, is spread abroad 
through various nations; and consequently in this respect it is necessary 
for the constitution of the Church to be like the rite of the Gentiles 
rather than that of the Jews.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The priestly power is surpassed by the episcopal power, as 
by a power of a different kind; but the episcopal is surpassed by the 
papal power as by a power of the same kind. Hence a bishop can perform 
every hierarchical act that the Pope can; whereas a priest cannot perform 
every act that a bishop can in conferring the sacraments. Wherefore as 
regards matters pertaining to the episcopal Order, all bishops are equal, 
and for this reason any bishop can consecrate another bishop.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the vestments of the ministers are fittingly instituted in the Church?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the vestments of the ministers are not 
fittingly instituted in the Church. For the ministers of the New 
Testament are more bound to chastity than were the ministers of the Old 
Testament. Now among the vestments of the Old Testament there were the 
breeches as a sign of chastity. Much more therefore should they have a 
place among the vestments of the Church's ministers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the priesthood of the New Testament is more worthy than 
the priesthood of the Old. But the priests of the Old Testament had 
mitres, which are a sign of dignity. Therefore the priests of the New 
Testament should also have them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priest is nearer than the episcopal Order to the 
Orders of ministers. Now the bishop uses the vestments of the ministers, 
namely the dalmatic, which is the deacon's vestment, and the tunic, which 
is the subdeacon's. Much more therefore should simple priests use them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in the Old Law the pontiff wore the ephod 
[*Superhumerale, i.e. over-the-shoulders], which signified the burden of 
the Gospel, as Bede observes (De Tabernac. iii). Now this is especially 
incumbent on our pontiffs. Therefore they ought to wear the ephod.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, "Doctrine and Truth" were inscribed on the "rational" 
which the pontiffs of the Old Testament wore. Now truth was made known 
especially in the New Law. Therefore it is becoming to the pontiffs of 
the New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the golden plate on which was written the most admirable 
name of God, was the most admirable of the adornments of the Old Law. 
Therefore it should especially have been transferred to the New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, the things which the ministers of the Church wear 
outwardly are signs of inward power. Now the archbishop has no other kind 
of power than a bishop, as stated above (<A Href="XP040.html#XPQ40A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore he should not 
have the pallium which other bishops have not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, the fulness of power resides in the Roman Pontiff. But 
he has not a crozier. Therefore other bishops should not have one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The vestments of the ministers denote the qualifications 
required of them for handling Divine things. And since certain things are 
required of all, and some are required of the higher, that are not so 
exacted of the lower ministers, therefore certain vestments are common to 
all the ministers, while some pertain to the higher ministers only. 
Accordingly it is becoming to all the ministers to wear the "amice" which 
covers the shoulders, thereby signifying courage in the exercise of the 
Divine offices to which they are deputed; and the "alb," which signifies 
a pure life, and the "girdle," which signifies restraint of the flesh. 
But the subdeacon wears in addition the "maniple" on the left arm; this 
signifies the wiping away of the least stains, since a maniple is a kind 
of handkerchief for wiping the face; for they are the first to be 
admitted to the handling of sacred things. They also have the "narrow 
tunic," signifying the doctrine of Christ; wherefore in the Old Law 
little bells hung therefrom, and subdeacons are the first admitted to 
announce the doctrine of the New Law. The deacon has in addition the 
"stole" over the left shoulder, as a sign that he is deputed to a 
ministry in the sacraments themselves, and the "dalmatic" (which is a 
full vestment, so called because it first came into use in Dalmatia), to 
signify that he is the first to be appointed to dispense the sacraments: 
for he dispenses the blood, and in dispensing one should be generous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the case of the priest the "stole" hangs from both shoulders, to 
show that he has received full power to dispense the sacraments, and not 
as the minister of another man, for which reason the stole reaches right 
down. He also wears the "chasuble,"  which signifies charity, because he 
it is who consecrates the sacrament of charity, namely the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishops have nine ornaments besides those which the priest has; these 
are the "stockings, sandals, succinctory, tunic, dalmatic, mitre, gloves, 
ring, and crozier," because there are nine things which they can, but 
priests cannot, do, namely ordain clerics, bless virgins, consecrate 
bishops, impose hands, dedicate churches, depose clerics, celebrate 
synods, consecrate chrism, bless vestments and vessels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also say that the "stockings" signify his upright walk; the 
"sandals" which cover the feet, his contempt of earthly things; the 
"succinctory" which girds the stole with the alb, his love of probity; 
the "tunic," perseverance, for Joseph is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++37%3A23">Gn. 37:23</a>) to have had a 
long tunic---"talaric," because it reached down to the ankles [talos], 
which denote the end of life; the "dalmatic," generosity in works of 
mercy; the "gloves," prudence in action; the "mitre," knowledge of both 
Testaments, for which reason it has two crests; the "crozier," his 
pastoral care, whereby he has to gather together the wayward (this is 
denoted by the curve at the head of the crozier), to uphold the weak 
(this is denoted by the stem of the crozier), and to spur on the laggards 
(this is denoted by the point at the foot of the crozier). Hence the line:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gather, uphold, spur on
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wayward, the weak, and the laggard."
The "ring" signifies the sacraments of that faith whereby the Church is 
espoused to Christ. For bishops are espoused to the Church in the place 
of Christ. Furthermore archbishops have the "pallium" in sign of their 
privileged power, for it signifies the golden chain which those who 
fought rightfully were wont to receive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The priests of the Old Law were enjoined continency only 
for the time of their attendance for the purpose of their ministry. 
Wherefore as a sign of the chastity which they had then to observe, they 
wore the breeches while offering sacrifices. But the ministers of the New 
Testament are enjoined perpetual continency; and so the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The mitre was not a sign of dignity, for it was a kind of 
hat, as Jerome says (Ep. ad Fabiol.). But the diadem which was a sign of 
dignity was given to the pontiffs alone, as the mitre is now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of the ministers resides in the bishop as their 
source, but not in the priest, for he does not confer those Orders. 
Wherefore the bishop, rather than the priest, wears those vestments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Instead of the ephod, they wear the stole, which is 
intended for the same signification as the ephod. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The pallium takes the place of the "rational."
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Instead of that plate our pontiff wears the cross, as 
Innocent III says (De Myst. Miss. i), just as the breeches are replaced 
by the sandals, the linen garment by the alb, the belt by the girdle, the 
long or talaric garment by the tunic, the ephod by the amice, the 
"rational" by the pallium, the diadem by the mitre.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> Although he has not another kind of power he has the same 
power more fully. and so in order to designate this perfection, he 
receives the pallium which surrounds him on all sides.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[40] A[7] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> The Roman Pontiff does not use a pastoral staff because 
Peter sent his to restore to life a certain disciple who afterwards 
became bishop of Treves. Hence in the diocese of Treves the Pope carries 
a crozier but not elsewhere; or else it is a sign of his not having a 
restricted power denoted by the curve of the staff.<br>
