    OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE BODIES IN THE RESURRECTION (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the integrity of the bodies in the resurrection. Under
    this head there are five points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether all the members of the
    human body will rise again therein?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the hair and nails will?
  </p>
  <p><a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the humors will?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether whatever the body
    contained belonging to the truth of human nature will rise again?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether whatever it contained
    materially will rise again?

    Whether all the members of the human body will rise again?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all the members of the
    human body will rise again. For if the end be done away it is useless to
    repair the means. Now the end of each member is its act. Since then nothing
    useless is done in the Divine works, and since the use of certain members is
    not fitting to man after the resurrection, especially the use of the genital
    members, for then they "shall neither marry, nor be married" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >), it would seem that not all the members shall rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the entrails are members: and yet they
    will not rise again. For they can neither rise full, since thus they contain
    impurities, nor empty, since nothing is empty in nature. Therefore the
    members shall not all rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the body shall rise again that it may be
    rewarded for the works which the soul did through it. Now the member of
    which a thief has been deprived for theft, and who has afterwards done
    penance and is saved, cannot be rewarded at the resurrection, neither for
    any good deed, since it has not co-operated in any, nor for evil deeds,
    since the punishment of the member would redound to the punishment of man.
    Therefore the members will not all rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The other members belong more to the truth of
    human nature than hair and nails. Yet these will be restored to man at the
    resurrection according to the text (Sent. iv, D, 4). Much more therefore
    does this apply to the other members.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, "The works of God are perfect" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++32%3A4"
      >Dt. 32:4</a
    >). But the resurrection will be the work of God. Therefore man will be
    remade perfect in all his members.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in De Anima ii, 4, "the soul stands
    in relation to the body not only as its form and end, but also as efficient
    cause." For the soul is compared to the body as art to the thing made by
    art, as the Philosopher says (De Anim. Gener. ii, 4), and whatever is shown
    forth explicitly in the product of art is all contained implicitly and
    originally in the art. In like manner whatever appears in the parts of the
    body is all contained originally and, in a way, implicitly in the soul. Thus
    just as the work of an art would not be perfect, if its product lacked any
    of the things contained in the art, so neither could man be perfect, unless
    the whole that is contained enfolded in the soul be outwardly unfolded in
    the body, nor would the body correspond in full proportion to the soul.
    Since then at the resurrection it behooves man's body to correspond entirely
    to the soul, for it will not rise again except according to the relation it
    bears to the rational soul, it follows that man also must rise again
    perfect, seeing that he is thereby repaired in order that he may obtain his
    ultimate perfection. Consequently all the members that are now in man's body
    must needs be restored at the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The members may be considered in two
    ways in relation to the soul: either according to the relation of matter to
    form, or according to the relation of instrument to agent, since "the whole
    body is compared to the whole soul in the same way as one part is to
    another" (De Anima ii, 1). If then the members be considered in the light of
    the first relationship, their end is not operation, but rather the perfect
    being of the species, and this is also required after the resurrection: but
    if they be considered in the light of the second relationship, then their
    end is operation. And yet it does not follow that when the operation fails
    the instrument is useless, because an instrument serves not only to
    accomplish the operation of the agent, but also to show its virtue. Hence it
    will be necessary for the virtue of the soul's powers to be shown in their
    bodily instruments, even though they never proceed to action, so that the
    wisdom of God be thereby glorified.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The entrails will rise again in the body
    even as the other members: and they will be filled not with vile
    superfluities but with goodly humors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The acts whereby we merit are not the
    acts, properly speaking, of hand or foot but of the whole man; even as the
    work of art is ascribed not to the instrument but to the craftsman.
    Therefore though the member which was cut off before a man's repentance did
    not co-operate with him in the state wherein he merits glory, yet man
    himself merits that the whole man may be rewarded, who with his whole being
    serves God.<br />

    Whether the hair and nails will rise again in the human body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the hair and nails will not
    rise again in the human body. For just as hair and nails result from the
    surplus of food, so do urine, sweat and other superfluities or dregs. But
    these will not rise again with the body. Neither therefore will hair and
    nails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, of all the superfluities that are
    produced from food, seed comes nearest to the truth of human nature, since
    though superfluous it is needed. Yet seed will not rise again in the human
    body. Much less therefore will hair and nails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is perfected by a rational soul
    that is not perfected by a sensitive soul. But hair and nails are not
    perfected by a sensitive soul, for "we do not feel with them" (De Anima i,
    5; iii, 13). Therefore since the human body rises not again except because
    it is perfected by a rational soul, it would seem that the hair and nails
    will not rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++21%3A18"
      >Lk. 21:18</a
    >): "A hair of your head shall not perish."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, hair and nails were given to man as an ornament. Now the bodies of
    men, especially of the elect, ought to rise again with all their adornment.
    Therefore they ought to rise again with the hair.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The soul is to the animated body, as art is to
    the work of art, and is to the parts of the body as art to its instruments:
    wherefore an animated body is called an organic body. Now art employs
    certain instruments for the accomplishment of the work intended, and these
    instruments belong to the primary intention of art: and it also uses other
    instruments for the safe-keeping of the principal instruments, and these
    belong to the secondary intention of art: thus the art of warfare employs a
    sword for fighting, and a sheath for the safe-keeping of the sword. And so
    among the parts of an animated body, some are directed to the accomplishment
    of the souls' operations, for instance the heart, liver, hand, foot; while
    others are directed to the safe-keeping of the other parts as leaves to
    cover fruit; and thus hair and nails are in man for the protection of other
    parts. Consequently, although they do not belong to the primary perfection
    of the human body, they belong to the secondary perfection: and since man
    will rise again with all the perfections of his nature, it follows that hair
    and nails will rise again in him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those superfluities are voided by
    nature, as being useful for nothing. Hence they do not belong to the
    perfection of the human body. It is not so with the superfluities which
    nature reserves for the production of hair and nails which she needs for the
    protection of the members.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Seed is not required for the perfection
    of the individual, as hair and nails are, but only for the protection of the
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hair and nails are nourished and grow,
    and so it is clear that they share in some operation, which would not be
    possible unless they were parts in some way perfected by the soul. And since
    in man there is but one soul, namely the rational soul, it is clear that
    they are perfected by the rational soul, although not so far as to share in
    the operation of sense, as neither do bones, and yet it is certain that
    these will rise again and that they belong to the integrity of the
    individual.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the humors will rise again in the body?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the humors will not rise again
    in the body. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A50"
      >1 Cor. 15:50</a
    >): "Flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God." Now blood is the
    chief humor. Therefore it will not rise again in the blessed, who will
    possess the kingdom of God, and much less in others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, humors are intended to make up for the
    waste. Now after the resurrection there will be no waste. Therefore the body
    will not rise again with humors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is in process of generation
    in the human body is not yet perfected by the rational soul. Now the humors
    are still in process of generation because they are potentially flesh and
    bone. Therefore they are not yet perfected by the rational soul. Now the
    human body is not directed to the resurrection except in so far as it is
    perfected by the rational soul. Therefore the humors will not rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever enters into the constitution of the
    human body will rise again with it. Now this applies to the humors, as
    appears from the statement of Augustine (De Spir. et Anima xv) that "the
    body consists of functional members; the functional members of homogeneous
    parts; and the homogeneous parts of humors." Therefore the humors will rise
    again in the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, our resurrection will be conformed to the resurrection of Christ.
    Now in Christ's resurrection His blood rose again, else the wine would not
    now be changed into His blood in the Sacrament of the altar. Therefore the
    blood will rise again in us also, and in like manner the other humors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever belongs to the integrity of human
    nature in those who take part in the resurrection will rise again, as stated
    above (<a href="XP080.html#XPQ80ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Hence whatever
    humidity of the body belongs to the integrity of human nature must needs
    rise again in man. Now there is a threefold humidity in man. There is one
    which occurs as receding from the perfection of the individual---either
    because it is on the way to corruption, and is voided by nature, for
    instance urine, sweat, matter, and so forth---or because it is directed by
    nature to the preservation of the species in some individual, either by the
    act of the generative power, as seed, or by the act of the nutritive power,
    as milk. None of these humidities will rise again, because they do not
    belong to the perfection of the person rising again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second kind of humidity is one that has not yet reached its ultimate
    perfection, which nature achieves in the individual, yet it is directed
    thereto by nature: and this is of two kinds. For there is one kind that has
    a definite form and is contained among the parts of the body, for instance
    the blood and the other humors which nature has directed to the members that
    are produced or nourished therefrom: and yet they have certain definite
    forms like the other parts of the body, and consequently will rise again
    with the other parts of the body: while another kind of humidity is in
    transition from form to form, namely from the form of humor to the form of
    member. Humidities of this kind will not rise again, because after the
    resurrection each part of the body will be established in its form, so that
    one will not pass into another. Wherefore this humidity that is actually in
    transition from one form to another will not rise again. Now this humidity
    may be considered in a twofold state---either as being at the beginning of
    its transformation, and thus it is called "ros," namely the humidity that is
    found in the cavities of the smaller veins---or as in the course of
    transformation and already beginning to undergo alteration, and thus it is
    called "cambium": but in neither state will it rise again. The third kind of
    humidity is that which has already reached its ultimate perfection that
    nature intends in the body of the individual, and has already undergone
    transformation and become incorporate with the members. This is called
    "gluten," and since it belongs to the members it will rise again just as the
    members will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In these words of the Apostle flesh and
    blood do not denote the substance of flesh and blood but deeds of flesh and
    blood, which are either deeds of sin or the operations of the animal life.
    Or we may say with Augustine in his letter to Consentius (Ep. cxlvi) that
    "flesh and blood here signify the corruption which is now predominant in
    flesh and blood"; wherefore the Apostle's words continue: "Neither shall
    corruption possess incorruption."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the members that serve for
    generation will be after the resurrection for the integrity of human nature,
    and not for the operation accomplished now by them, so will the humors be in
    the body not to make up for waste, but to restore the integrity of human
    nature and to show forth its natural power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the elements are in the course
    of generation in relation to mixed bodies, because they are their matter,
    yet not so as to be always in transition when in the mixed body, so too are
    the humors in relation to the members. And for this reason as the elements
    in the parts of the universe have definite forms, by reason of which they,
    like mixed bodies, belong to the perfection of the universe, so too the
    humors belong to the perfection of the human body, just as the other parts
    do, although they do not reach its entire perfection, as the other parts do,
    and although the elements have not perfect forms as mixed bodies have. But
    as all the parts of the universe receive their perfection from God, not
    equally, but each one according to its mode, so too the humors are in some
    way perfected by the rational soul, yet not in the same measure as the more
    perfect parts.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether whatever in the body belonged to the truth of human nature will rise
    again in it?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that what was in the body,
    belonging to the truth of human nature, will not all rise again in it. For
    food is changed into the truth of human nature. Now sometimes the flesh of
    the ox or of other animals is taken as food. Therefore if whatever belonged
    to the truth of human nature will rise again, the flesh of the ox or of
    other animals will also rise again: which is inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Adam's rib belonged to the truth of
    human nature in him, as ours does in us. But Adam's rib will rise again not
    in Adam but in Eve, else Eve would not rise again at all since she was made
    from that rib. Therefore whatever belonged in man to the truth of human
    nature will not all rise again in him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is impossible for the same thing from
    different men to rise again. Yet it is possible for something in different
    men to belong to the truth of human nature, for instance if a man were to
    partake of human flesh which would be changed into his substance. Therefore
    there will not rise again in man whatever belonged in him to the truth of
    human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if it be said that not all the flesh
    partaken of belongs to the truth of human nature and that consequently some
    of it may possibly rise again in the one man and some in the other---on the
    contrary: That which is derived from one's parents would especially seem to
    belong to the truth of human nature. But if one who partook of nothing but
    human flesh were to beget children that which his child derives from him
    must needs be of the flesh of other men partaken of by his father, since the
    seed is from the surplus of food, as the Philosopher proves (De Gen. Animal.
    i). Therefore what belongs to the truth of human nature in that child
    belonged also to the truth of human nature in other men of whose flesh his
    father had partaken.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if it be said that what was changed into
    seed was not that which belong to the truth of human nature in the flesh of
    the men eaten, but something not belonging to the truth of human nature---on
    the contrary: Let us suppose that some one is fed entirely on embryos in
    which seemingly there is nothing but what belongs to the truth of human
    nature since whatever is in them is derived from the parents. If then the
    surplus food be changed into seed, that which belonged to the truth of human
    nature in the embryos---and after these have received a rational soul, the
    resurrection applies to them---must needs belong to the truth of human
    nature in the child begotten of that seed. And thus, since the same cannot
    rise again in two subjects, it will be impossible for whatever belonged to
    the truth of human nature in both to rise again in both of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever belonged to the truth of human
    nature was perfected by the rational soul. Now it is through being perfected
    by the rational soul that the human body is directed to the resurrection.
    Therefore whatever belonged to the truth of human nature will rise again in
    each one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, if anything belonging to the truth of human nature in a man be
    taken from his body, this will not be the perfect body of a man. Now all
    imperfection of a man will be removed at the resurrection, especially in the
    elect, to whom it was promised (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++21%3A18"
      >Lk. 21:18</a
    >) that not a hair of their head should perish. Therefore whatever belonged
    to the truth of human nature in a man will rise again in him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "Everything is related to truth in the same way
    as to being" (Metaph. ii), because a thing is true when it is as it appears
    to him who actually knows it. For this reason Avicenna (Metaph. ii) says
    that "the truth of anything is a property of the being immutably attached
    thereto." Accordingly a thing is said to belong to the truth of human
    nature, because it belongs properly to the being of human nature, and this
    is what shares the form of human nature, just as true gold is what has the
    true form of gold whence gold derives its proper being. In order therefore
    to see what it is that belongs to the truth of human nature, we must observe
    that there have been three opinions on the question. For some have
    maintained that nothing begins anew to belong to the truth of human nature
    and that whatever belongs to the truth of human nature, all of it belonged
    to the truth of human nature when this was created; and that this multiplies
    by itself, so that it is possible for the seed whereof the child is begotten
    to be detached therefrom by the begetter, and that again the detached part
    multiplies in the child, so that he reaches perfect quantity by growth, and
    so on, and that thus was the whole human race multiplied. Wherefore
    according to this opinion, whatever is produced by nourishment. although it
    seem to have the appearance of flesh and blood, does not belong to the truth
    of human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Others held that something new is added to the truth of human nature by the
    natural transformation of the food into the human body, if we consider the
    truth of human nature in the species to the preservation of which the act of
    the generative power is directed: but that if we consider the truth of human
    nature in the individual, to the preservation and perfection of which the
    act of the nutritive power is directed, that which is added by food belongs
    to the truth of the human nature of the individual, not primarily but
    secondarily. For they assert that the truth of human nature, first and
    foremost, consists in the radical humor, that namely which is begotten of
    the seed of which the human race was originally fashioned: and that what is
    changed from food into true flesh and blood does not belong principally to
    the truth of human nature in this particular individual, but secondarily:
    and that nevertheless this can belong principally to the truth of human
    nature in another individual who is begotten of the seed of the former. For
    they assert that seed is the surplus from food, either mingled with
    something belonging principally to the truth of human nature in the
    begetter, according to some, or without any such admixture, as others
    maintain. And thus the nutrimental humor in one becomes the radical humor in
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The third opinion is that something new begins to belong principally to the
    truth of human nature even in this individual, because distinction in the
    human body does not require that any signate material part must needs remain
    throughout the whole lifetime; any signate part one may take is indifferent
    to this, whereas it remains always as regards what belongs to the species in
    it, albeit as regards what is material therein it may ebb and flow. And thus
    the nutrimental humor is not distinct from the radical on the part of its
    principle (so that it be called radical when begotten of the seed, and
    nutrimental when produced by the food), but rather on the part of the term,
    so that it be called radical when it reaches the term of generation by the
    act of the generative, or even nutritive power, but nutrimental, when it has
    not yet reached this term, but is still on the way to give nourishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    These three opinions have been more fully exposed and examined in the Second
    Book (Sent. ii, D, 30); wherefore there is no need for repetition here,
    except in so far as the question at issue is concerned. It must accordingly
    be observed that this question requires different answers according to these
    opinions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first opinion on account of its explanation of the process of
    multiplication is able to admit perfection of the truth of human nature,
    both as regards the number of individuals and as regards the due quantity of
    each individual, without taking into account that which is produced from
    food; for this is not added except for the purpose of resisting the
    destruction that might result from the action of natural heat, as lead is
    added to silver lest it be destroyed in melting. Wherefore since at the
    resurrection it behooves human nature to be restored to its perfection, nor
    does the natural heat tend to destroy the natural humor, there will be no
    need for anything resulting from food to rise again in man, but that alone
    will rise again which belonged to the truth of the human nature of the
    individual, and this reaches the aforesaid perfection in number and quantity
    by being detached and multiplied.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second opinion, since it maintains that what is produced from food is
    needed for the perfection of quantity in the individual and for the
    multiplication that results from generation, must needs admit that something
    of this product from food shall rise again: not all, however, but only so
    much as is required for the perfect restoration of human nature in all its
    individuals. Hence this opinion asserts that all that was in the substance
    of the seed will rise again in this man who was begotten of this seed;
    because this belongs chiefly to the truth of human nature in him: while of
    that which afterwards he derives from nourishment, only so much will rise
    again in him as is needed for the perfection of his quantity; and not all,
    because this does not belong to the perfection of human nature, except in so
    far as nature requires it for the perfection of quantity. Since however this
    nutrimental humor is subject to ebb and flow the restoration will be
    effected in this order, that what first belonged to the substance of a man's
    body, will all be restored, and of that which was added secondly, thirdly,
    and so on, as much as is required to restore quantity. This is proved by two
    reasons. First, because that which was added was intended to restore what
    was wasted at first, and thus it does not belong principally to the truth of
    human nature to the same extent as that which came first. Secondly, because
    the addition of extraneous humor to the first radical humors results in the
    whole mixture not sharing the truth of the specific nature as perfectly as
    the first did: and the Philosopher instances as an example (De Gener. i) the
    mixing of water with wine, which always weakens the strength of the wine, so
    that in the end the wine becomes watery: so that although the second water
    be drawn into the species of wine, it does not share the species of wine as
    perfectly as the first water added to the wine. Even so that which is
    secondly changed from food into flesh does not so perfectly attain to the
    species of flesh as that which was changed first, and consequently does not
    belong in the same degree to the truth of human nature nor to the
    resurrection. Accordingly it is clear that this opinion maintains that the
    whole of what belongs to the truth of human nature principally will rise
    again, but not the whole of what belongs to the truth of human nature
    secondarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The third opinion differs somewhat from the second and in some respects
    agrees with it. It differs in that it maintains that whatever is under the
    form of flesh and bone all belongs to the truth of human nature, because
    this opinion does not distinguish as remaining in man during his whole
    lifetime any signate matter that belongs essentially and primarily to the
    truth of human nature, besides something ebbing and flowing, that belongs.
    to the truth of human nature merely on account of the perfection of
    quantity, and not on account of the primary being of the species, as the
    second opinion asserted. But it states that all the parts that are not
    beside the intention of the nature generated belong to the truth of human
    nature, as regards what they have of the species, since thus they remain;
    but not as regards what they have of matter, since thus they are indifferent
    to ebb and flow: so that we are to understand that the same thing happens in
    the parts of one man as in the whole population of a city, for each
    individual is cut off from the population by death, while others take their
    place: wherefore the parts of the people flow back and forth materially, but
    remain formally, since these others occupy the very same offices and
    positions from which the former were withdrawn, so that the commonwealth is
    said to remain the selfsame. In like manner, while certain parts are on the
    ebb and others are being restored to the same shape and position, all the
    parts flow back and forth as to their matter, but remain as to their
    species; and nevertheless the selfsame man remains.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, The third opinion agrees with the second, because it
    holds that the parts which come secondly do not reach the perfection of the
    species so perfectly as those which come first: and consequently the third
    opinion asserts that the same thing rises again in man as the second opinion
    maintains, but not for quite the same reason. For it holds that the whole of
    what is produced from the seed will rise again, not because it belongs to
    the truth of human nature otherwise than that which comes after, but because
    it shares the truth of human nature more perfectly: which same order the
    second opinion applied to those things that are produced afterwards from
    food, in which point also these two opinions agree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A natural thing is what it is, not from
    its matter but from its form; wherefore, although that part of matter which
    at one time was under the form of bovine flesh rises again in man under the
    form of human flesh, it does not follow that the flesh of an ox rises again,
    but the flesh of a man: else one might conclude that the clay from which
    Adam's body was fashioned shall rise again. The second opinion, however,
    grants this argument.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That rib did not belong to the
    perfection of the individual in Adam, but was directed to the multiplication
    of the species. Hence it will rise again not in Adam but in Eve, just as the
    seed will rise again, not in the begetter, but in the begotten.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to the first opinion it is
    easy to reply to this argument, because the flesh that is eaten never
    belonged to the truth of human nature in the eater, but it did belong to the
    truth of human nature in him whose flesh was eaten: and thus it will rise
    again in the latter but not in the former. according to the second and third
    opinions, each one will rise again in that wherein he approached nearest to
    the perfect participation of the virtue of the species, and if he approached
    equally in both, he will rise again in that wherein he was first, because in
    that he first was directed to the resurrection by union with the rational
    soul of that man. Hence if there were any surplus in the flesh eaten, not
    belonging to the truth of human nature in the first man, it will be possible
    for it to rise again in the second: otherwise what belonged to the
    resurrection in the first will rise again in him and not in the second; but
    in the second its place is taken either by something of that which was the
    product from other food, or if he never partook of any other food than human
    flesh, the substitution is made by Divine power so far as the perfection of
    quantity requires, as it does in those who die before the perfect age. Nor
    does this derogate from numerical identity, as neither does the ebb and flow
    of parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to the first opinion this
    argument is easily answered. For that opinion asserts that the seed is not
    from the surplus food: so that the flesh eaten is not changed into the seed
    whereof the child is begotten. But according to the other two opinions we
    must reply that it is impossible for the whole of the flesh eaten to be
    changed into seed, because it is after much separation that the seed is
    distilled from the food, since seed is the ultimate surplus of food. That
    part of the eaten flesh which is changed into seed belongs to the truth of
    human nature in the one born of the seed more than in the one of whose flesh
    the seed was the product. Hence according to the rule already laid down (ad
    3), whatever was changed into the seed will rise again in the person born of
    the seed; while the remaining matter will rise again in him of whose flesh
    the seed was the product.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The embryo is not concerned with the
    resurrection before it is animated by a rational soul, in which state much
    has been added to the seminal substance from the substance of food, since
    the child is nourished in the mother's womb. Consequently on the supposition
    that a man partook of such food, and that some one were begotten of the
    surplus thereof, that which was in the seminal substance will indeed rise
    again in the one begotten of that seed; unless it contain something that
    would have belonged to the seminal substance in those from whose flesh being
    eaten the seed was produced, for this would rise again in the first but not
    in the second. The remainder of the eaten flesh, not being changed into
    seed, will clearly rise again in the first the Divine power supplying
    deficiencies in both. The first opinion is not troubled by this objection,
    since it does not hold the seed to be from the surplus food: but there are
    many other reasons against it as may be seen in the Second Book (Sent. ii,
    D, 30; FP,

    Whether whatever was materially in a man's members will all rise again?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that whatever was materially in a
    man's members will all rise again. For the hair, seemingly, is less
    concerned in the resurrection than the other members. Yet whatever was in
    the hair will all rise again, if not in the hair, at least in other parts of
    the body, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii) quoted in the text (Sent. iv,
    D, 44). Much more therefore whatever was materially in the other members
    will all rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the parts of the flesh are
    perfected as to species by the rational soul, so are the parts as to matter.
    But the human body is directed to the resurrection through being perfected
    by a rational soul. Therefore not only the parts of species but also the
    parts of matter will all rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the body derives its totality from the
    same cause as it derives its divisibility into parts. But division into
    parts belongs to a body in respect of matter the disposition of which is
    quantity in respect of which it is divided. Therefore totality is ascribed
    to the body in respect of its parts of matter. If then all the parts of
    matter rise not again, neither will the whole body rise again: which is
    inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The parts of matter are not permanent in the
    body but ebb and flow, as stated in De Gener. i. If, therefore, all the
    parts of matter, which remain not but ebb and flow, rise again, either the
    body of one who rises again will be very dense, or it will be immoderate in
    quantity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, whatever belongs to the truth of human nature in one man can all be
    a part of matter in another man, if the latter were to partake of his flesh.
    Therefore if all the parts of matter in one man were to rise again it
    follows that in one man there will rise again that which belongs to the
    truth of human nature in another: which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> What is in man materially, is not directed to
    the resurrection, except in so far as it belongs to the truth of human
    nature; because it is in this respect that it bears a relation to the human
    souls. Now all that is in man materially belongs indeed to the truth of
    human nature in so far as it has something of the species, but not all, if
    we consider the totality of matter; because all the matter that was in a man
    from the beginning of his life to the end would surpass the quantity due to
    his species, as the third opinion states, which opinion seems to me more
    probable than the others. Wherefore the whole of what is in man will rise
    again, if we speak of the totality of the species which is dependent on
    quantity, shape, position and order of parts, but the whole will not rise
    again if we speak of the totality of matter. The second and first opinions,
    however, do not make this distinction, but distinguish between parts both of
    which have the species and matter. But these two opinions agree in that they
    both state what is produced from the seed will all rise again even if we
    speak of totality of matter: while they differ in this that the first
    opinion maintains that nothing will rise again of that which was engendered
    from food, whereas the second holds that something but not all, thereof will
    rise again, as stated above (<a href="XP080.html#XPQ80A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as all that is in the other parts
    of the body will rise again, if we speak of the totality of the species, but
    not if we speak of material totality, so is it with the hair. In the other
    parts something accrues from nourishment which causes growth, and this is
    reckoned as another part, if we speak of totality of species, since it
    occupies another place and position in the body, and is under other parts of
    dimension: and there accrues something which does not cause growth, but
    serves to make up for waste by nourishing. and this is not reckoned as
    another part of the whole considered in relation to the species, since it
    does not occupy another place or position in the body than that which was
    occupied by the part that has passed away: although it may be reckoned
    another part if we consider the totality of matter. The same applies to the
    hair. Augustine, however, is speaking of the cutting of hair that was a part
    causing growth of the body; wherefore it must needs rise again, not however
    as regards the quantity of hair, lest it should be immoderate, but it will
    rise again in other parts as deemed expedient by Divine providence. Or else
    he refers to the case when something will be lacking to the other parts, for
    then it will be possible for this to be supplied from the surplus of
    hair.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the third opinion parts of
    species are the same as parts of matter: for the Philosopher does not make
    this distinction (De Gener. i) in order to distinguish different parts, but
    in order to show that the same parts may be considered both in respect of
    species, as to what belongs to the form and species in them, and in respect
    of matter, as to that which is under the form and species. Now it is clear
    that the matter of the flesh has no relation to the rational soul except in
    so far as it is under such a form, and consequently by reason thereof it is
    directed to the resurrection. But the first and second opinions which draw a
    distinction between parts of species and parts of matter say that although
    the rational soul perfects both parts, it does not perfect parts of matter
    except by means of the parts of species, wherefore they are not equally
    directed to the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the matter of things subject to
    generation and corruption it is necessary to presuppose indefinite
    dimensions before the reception of the substantial form. Consequently
    division which is made according to these dimensions belongs properly to
    matter. But complete and definite quantity comes to matter after the
    substantial form; wherefore division that is made in reference to definite
    quantity regards the species especially when definite position of parts
    belongs to the essence of the species, as in the human body.<br />
