    OF THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE WHO RISE AGAIN, AND FIRST OF THEIR IDENTITY
    (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider the conditions of those who rise again.
    Here we shall consider: (1) Those which concern the good and wicked in
    common; (2) those which concern the good only; (3) those which concern only
    the wicked. Three things concern the good and wicked in common, namely their
    identity, their integrity, and their quality: and we shall inquire (1) about
    their identity; (2) about their integrity; (3) about their quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP079.html#XPQ79A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the body will rise again
    identically the same?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP079.html#XPQ79A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it will be the self-same
    man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP079.html#XPQ79A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is necessary that the
    same ashes should return to the same parts in which they were before?<br />

    Whether in the resurrection the soul will be reunited to the same identical
    body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul will not be reunited
    to the same identical body at the resurrection, for "thou sowest not the
    body that shall be, but bare grain" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A37"
      >1 Cor. 15:37</a
    >). Now the Apostle is there comparing death to sowing and resurrection to
    fructifying. Therefore the same body that is laid aside in death is not
    resumed at the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to every form some matter is adapted
    according to its condition, and likewise to every agent some instrument. Now
    the body is compared to the soul as matter to form, and as instrument to
    agent. Since then at the resurrection the soul will not be of the same
    condition as now (for it will be either entirely borne away to the heavenly
    life to which it adhered while living in the world, or will be cast down
    into the life of the brutes if it lived as a brute in this world) it would
    seem that it will not resume the same body, but either a heavenly or a
    brutish body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, after death, as stated above (<a
      href="XP078.html#XPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="XP078.html#XPQ78A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the human body is
    dissolved into the elements. Now these elemental parts into which the human
    body has been dissolved do not agree with the human body dissolved into
    them, except in primary matter, even as any other elemental parts agree with
    that same body. But if the body were to be formed from those other elemental
    parts, it would not be described as identically the same. Therefore neither
    will it be the self-same body if it be restored from these parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there cannot be numerical identity where
    there is numerical distinction of essential parts. Now the form of the mixed
    body, which form is an essential part of the human body, as being its form,
    cannot be resumed in numerical identity. Therefore the body will not be
    identically the same. The minor is proved thus: That which passes away into
    complete nonentity cannot be resumed in identity. This is clear from the
    fact that there cannot be identity where there is distinction of existence:
    and existence, which is the act of a being, is differentiated by being
    interrupted, as is any interrupted act. Now the form of a mixed body passes
    away into complete nonentity by death, since it is a bodily form, and so
    also do the contrary qualities from which the mixture results. Therefore the
    form of a mixed body does not return in identity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+19%3A26"
      >Job 19:26</a
    >): "In my flesh I shall see God my Saviour [Vulg.: 'my God']," where he is
    speaking of the vision after the resurrection, as appears from the preceding
    words: "In the last day I shall rise out of the earth." Therefore the
    selfsame body will rise again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 27): "Resurrection is the
    second rising of that which has fallen." But the body which we have now fell
    by death. Therefore it will rise again the same identically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> on this point the philosophers erred and
    certain modern heretics err. For some of the philosophers allowed that souls
    separated from bodies are reunited to bodies, yet they erred in this in two
    ways. First, as to the mode of reunion, for some held the separated soul to
    be naturally reunited to a body by the way of generation. Secondly, as to
    the body to which it was reunited, for they held that this second union was
    not with the selfsame body that was laid aside in death, but with another,
    sometimes of the same, sometimes of a different species. Of a different
    species when the soul while existing in the body had led a life contrary to
    the ordering of reason: wherefore it passed after death from the body of a
    man into the body of some other animal to whose manner of living it had
    conformed in this life, for instance into the body of a dog on account of
    lust, into the body of a lion on account of robbery and violence, and so
    forth---and into a body of the same species when the soul has led a good
    life in the body, and having after death experienced some happiness, after
    some centuries began to wish to return to the body; and thus it was reunited
    to a human body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This opinion arises from two false sources. The first of these is that they
    said that the soul is not united to the body essentially as form to matter,
    but only accidentally, as mover to the thing moved, [*Cf. FP, Question [76],
    Article [1]] or as a man to his clothes. Hence it was possible for them to
    maintain that the soul pre-existed before being infused into the body
    begotten of natural generation, as also that it is united to various bodies.
    The second is that they held intellect not to differ from sense except
    accidentally, so that man would be said to surpass other animals in
    intelligence, because the sensitive power is more acute in him on account of
    the excellence of his bodily complexion; and hence it was possible for them
    to assert that man's soul passes into the soul of a brute animal, especially
    when the human soul has been habituated to brutish actions. But these two
    sources are refuted by the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 1), and in consequence
    of these being refuted, it is clear that the above opinion is false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner the errors of certain heretics are refuted. Some of them fell
    into the aforesaid opinions of the philosophers: while others held that
    souls are reunited to heavenly bodies, or again to bodies subtle as the
    wind, as Gregory relates of a certain Bishop of Constantinople, in his
    exposition of Job 19:26, "In my flesh I shall see my God," etc. Moreover
    these same errors of heretics may be refuted by the fact that they are
    prejudicial to the truth of resurrection as witnessed to by Holy Writ. For
    we cannot call it resurrection unless the soul return to the same body,
    since resurrection is a second rising, and the same thing rises that falls:
    wherefore resurrection regards the body which after death falls rather than
    the soul which after death lives. And consequently if it be not the same
    body which the soul resumes, it will not be a resurrection, but rather the
    assuming of a new body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A comparison does not apply to every
    particular, but to some. For in the sowing of grain, the grain sown and the
    grain that is born thereof are neither identical, nor of the same condition,
    since it was first sown without a husk, yet is born with one: and the body
    will rise again identically the same, but of a different condition, since it
    was mortal and will rise in immortality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The soul rising again and the soul
    living in this world differ, not in essence but in respect of glory and
    misery, which is an accidental difference. Hence it follows that the body in
    rising again differs, not in identity, but in condition, so that a
    difference of bodies corresponds proportionally to the difference of
    souls.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which is understood as though it
    were in matter before its form remains in matter after corruption, because
    when that which comes afterwards is removed that which came before may yet
    remain. Now, as the Commentator observes on the First Book of Physics and in
    De Substantia Orbis, in the matter of things subject to generation and
    corruption, we must presuppose undeterminate dimensions, by reason of which
    matter is divisible, so as to be able to receive various forms in its
    various parts. Wherefore after the separation of the substantial form from
    matter, these dimensions still remain the same: and consequently the matter
    existing under those dimensions, whatever form it receive, is more
    identified with that which was generated from it, than any other part of
    matter existing under any form whatever. Thus the matter that will be
    brought back to restore the human body will be the same as that body's
    previous matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Even as a simple quality is not the
    substantial form of an element, but its proper accident, and the disposition
    whereby its matter is rendered proper to such a form; so the form of a mixed
    body, which form is a quality resulting from simple qualities reduced to a
    mean, is not the substantial form of the mixed body, but its proper
    accident, and the disposition whereby the matter is in need of the form. Now
    the human body has no substantial form besides this form of the mixed body,
    except the rational soul, for if it had any previous substantial form, this
    would give it substantial being, and would establish it in the genus of
    substance: so that the soul would be united to a body already established in
    the genus of substance, and thus the soul would be compared to the body as
    artificial forms are to their matter, in respect of their being established
    in the genus of substance by their matter. Hence the union of the soul to
    the body would be accidental, which is the error of the ancient philosophers
    refuted by the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 2 [*Cf. FP, Question [76], Article
    [1]]). It would also follow that the human body and each of its parts would
    not retain their former names in the same sense, which is contrary to the
    teaching of the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 1). Therefore since the rational
    soul remains, no substantial form of the human body falls away into complete
    nonentity. And the variation of accidental forms does not make a difference
    of identity. Therefore the selfsame body will rise again, since the selfsame
    matter is resumed as stated in a previous reply (ad 2).<br />

    Whether it will be identically the same man that shall rise again?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it will not be identically the
    same man that shall rise again. For according to the Philosopher (De Gener.
    ii): "Whatsoever things are changed in their corruptible substance are not
    repeated identically." Now such is man's substance in his present state.
    Therefore after the change wrought by death the self-same man cannot be
    repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, where there is a distinction of human
    nature there is not the same identical man: wherefore Socrates and Plato are
    two men and not one man, since each has his own distinct human nature. Now
    the human nature of one who rises again is distinct from that which he has
    now. Therefore he is not the same identical man. The minor can be proved in
    two ways. First, because human nature which is the form of the whole is not
    both form and substance as the soul is, but is a form only. Now such like
    forms pass away into complete nonentity, and consequently they cannot be
    restored. Secondly, because human nature results from union of parts. Now
    the same identical union as that which was heretofore cannot be resumed,
    because repetition is opposed to identity, since repetition implies number,
    whereas identity implies unity, and these are incompatible with one another.
    But resurrection is a repeated union: therefore the union is not the same,
    and consequently there is not the same human nature nor the same man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one same man is not several animals:
    wherefore if it is not the same animal it is not the same identical man. Now
    where sense is not the same, there is not the same animal, since animal is
    defined from the primary sense, namely touch. But sense, as it does not
    remain in the separated soul (as some maintain), cannot be resumed in
    identity. Therefore the man who rises again will not be the same identical
    animal, and consequently he will not be the same man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the matter of a statue ranks higher in
    the statue than the matter of a man does in man: because artificial things
    belong to the genus of substance by reason of their matter, but natural
    things by reason of their form, as appears from the Philosopher (Phys. ii,
    1), and again from the Commentator (De Anima ii). But if a statue is remade
    from the same brass, it will not be the same identically. Therefore much
    less will it be identically the same man if he be reformed from the same
    ashes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+19%3A27"
      >Job 19:27</a
    >): "Whom I myself shall see... and not another," and he is speaking of the
    vision after the resurrection. Therefore the same identical man will rise
    again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Augustine says (De Trin. viii, 5) that "to rise again is naught
    else but to live again." Now unless the same identical man that died return
    to life, he would not be said to live again. Therefore he would not rise
    again, which is contrary to faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The necessity of holding the resurrection
    arises from this---that man may obtain the last end for which he was made;
    for this cannot be accomplished in this life, nor in the life of the
    separated soul, as stated above (<a href="XP075.html#XPQ75OUTP1"
      >Question [75]</a
    >, <a href="XP075.html#XPQ75ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2): otherwise man would
    have been made in vain, if he were unable to obtain the end for which he was
    made. And since it behooves the end to be obtained by the selfsame thing
    that was made for that end, lest it appear to be made without purpose, it is
    necessary for the selfsame man to rise again; and this is effected by the
    selfsame soul being united to the selfsame body. For otherwise there would
    be no resurrection properly speaking, if the same man were not reformed.
    Hence to maintain that he who rises again is not the selfsame man is
    heretical, since it is contrary to the truth of Scripture which proclaims
    the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of
    repetition by movement or natural change. For he shows the difference
    between the recurrence that occurs in generation and corruption and that
    which is observed in the movement of the heavens. Because the selfsame
    heaven by local movement returns to the beginning of its movement, since it
    has a moved incorruptible substance. On the other hand, things subject to
    generation and corruption return by generation to specific but not numerical
    identity, because from man blood is engendered, from blood seed, and so on
    until a man is begotten, not the selfsame man, but the man specifically. In
    like manner from fire comes air, from air water, from water earth, whence
    fire is produced, not the selfsame fire, but the same in species. Hence it
    is clear that the argument, so far as the meaning of the Philosopher is
    concerned, is not to the point.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that the form of other things subject to generation and
    corruption is not subsistent of itself, so as to be able to remain after the
    corruption of the composite, as it is with the rational soul. For the soul,
    even after separation from the body, retains the being which accrues to it
    when in the body, and the body is made to share that being by the
    resurrection, since the being of the body and the being of the soul in the
    body are not distinct from one another, otherwise the union of soul and body
    would be accidental. Consequently there has been no interruption in the
    substantial being of man, as would make it impossible for the self-same man
    to return on account of an interruption in his being, as is the case with
    other things that are corrupted, the being of which is interrupted
    altogether, since their form remains not, and their matter remains under
    another being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless neither does the self-same man recur by natural generation,
    because the body of the man begotten is not composed of the whole body of
    his begetter: hence his body is numerically distinct, and consequently his
    soul and the whole man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are two opinions about humanity
    and about any form of a whole. For some say that the form of the whole and
    the form of the part are really one and the same: but that it is called the
    form of the part inasmuch as it perfects the matter, and the form of the
    whole inasmuch as the whole specific nature results therefrom. According to
    this opinion humanity is really nothing else than the rational soul: and so,
    since the selfsame rational soul is resumed, there will be the same
    identical humanity, which will remain even after death, albeit not under the
    aspect of humanity, because the composite does not derive the specific
    nature from a separated humanity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other opinion, which seems nearer the truth, is Avicenna's, according to
    whom the form of the whole is not the form of a part only, nor some other
    form besides the form of the part, but is the whole resulting from the
    composition of form and matter, embracing both within itself. This form of
    the whole is called the essence or quiddity. Since then at the resurrection
    there will be the selfsame body, and the selfsame rational soul, there will
    be, of necessity, the same humanity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first argument proving that there will be a distinction of humanity was
    based on the supposition that humanity is some distinct form supervening
    form and matter; which is false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason does not disprove the identity of humanity, because union
    implies action or passion, and though there be a different union, this
    cannot prevent the identity of humanity, because the action and passion from
    which humanity resulted are not of the essence of humanity, wherefore a
    distinction on their part does not involve a distinction of humanity: for it
    is clear that generation and resurrection are not the self-same movement.
    Yet the identity of the rising man with the begotten man is not hindered for
    this reason: and in like manner neither is the identity of humanity
    prevented if we take union for the relation itself: because this relation is
    not essential to but concomitant with humanity, since humanity is not one of
    those forms that are composition or order (Phys. ii, 1), as are the forms of
    things produced by art, so that if there be another distinct composition
    there is another distinct form of a house.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument affords a very good proof
    against those who held a distinction between the sensitive and rational
    souls in man: because in that case the sensitive soul in man would not be
    incorruptible, as neither is it in other animals; and consequently in the
    resurrection there would not be the same sensitive soul, and consequently
    neither the same animal nor the same man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we assert that in man the same soul is by its substance both rational
    and sensitive, we shall encounter no difficulty in this question, because
    animal is defined from sense, i.e. the sensitive soul as from its essential
    form: whereas from sense, i.e. the sensitive power, we know its definition
    as from an accidental form "that contributes more than another to our
    knowledge of the quiddity" (De Anima i, 1). Accordingly after death there
    remains the sensitive soul, even as the rational soul, according to its
    substance: whereas the sensitive powers, according to some, do not remain.
    And since these powers are accidental properties, diversity on their part
    cannot prevent the identity of the whole animal, not even of the animal's
    parts: nor are powers to be called perfections or acts of organs unless as
    principles of action, as heat in fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A statue may be considered in two ways,
    either as a particular substance, or as something artificial. And since it
    is placed in the genus of substance by reason of its matter, it follows that
    if we consider it as a particular substance, it is the selfsame statue that
    is remade from the same matter. On the other hand, it is placed in the genus
    of artificial things inasmuch as it has an accidental form which, if the
    statue be destroyed, passes away also. Consequently it does not return
    identically the same, nor can the statue be identically the same. But man's
    form, namely the soul, remains after the body has perished: wherefore the
    comparison fails.<br />

    Whether the ashes of the human body must needs, by the resurrection, return
    to the same parts of the body that were dissolved into them?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem necessary for the ashes of the
    human body to return, by the resurrection, to the same parts that were
    dissolved into them. For, according to the Philosopher, "as the whole soul
    is to the whole body, so is a part of the soul to a part of the body, as
    sight to the pupil" (De Anima ii, 1). Now it is necessary that after the
    resurrection the body be resumed by the same soul. Therefore it is also
    necessary for the same parts of the body to return to the same limbs, in
    which they were perfected by the same parts of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, difference of matter causes difference
    of identity. But if the ashes return not to the same parts, each part will
    not be remade from the same matter of which it consisted before. Therefore
    they will not be the same identically. Now if the parts are different the
    whole will also be different, since parts are to the whole as matter is to
    form (Phys. ii, 3). Therefore it will not be the self-same man; which is
    contrary to the truth of the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the resurrection is directed to the end
    that man may receive the meed of his works. Now different parts of the body
    are employed in different works, whether of merit or of demerit. Therefore
    at the resurrection each part must needs return to its former state that it
    may be rewarded in due measure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Artificial things are more dependent on their
    matter than natural things. Now in artificial things, in order that the same
    artificial thing be remade, from the same matter, there is no need for the
    parts to be brought back to the same position. Neither therefore is it
    necessary in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, change of an accident does not cause a change of identity. Now the
    situation of parts is an accident. Therefore its change in a man does not
    cause a change of identity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In this question it makes a difference whether
    we ask what can be done without prejudice to identity, and what will be done
    for the sake of congruity. As regards the first it must be observed that in
    man we may speak of parts in two ways: first as of the various parts of a
    homogeneous whole, for instance the various parts of flesh, or the various
    parts of bone; secondly, as of various parts of various species of a
    heterogeneous whole, for instance bone and flesh. Accordingly if it be said
    that one part of matter will return to another part of the same species,
    this causes no change except in the position of the parts: and change of
    position of parts does not change the species in homogeneous wholes: and so
    if the matter of one part return to another part, this is nowise prejudicial
    to the identity of the whole. Thus is it in the example given in the text
    (Sent. iv, D, 44), because a statue, after being remade, is identically the
    same, not as to its form, but as to its matter, in respect of which it is a
    particular substance, and in this way a statue is homogeneous, although it
    is not according to its artificial form. But if it be said that the matter
    of one part returns to another part of another species, it follows of
    necessity that there is a change not only in the position of parts, but also
    in their identity: yet so that the whole matter, or something belonging to
    the truth of human nature in one is transferred to another. but not if what
    was superfluous in one part is transferred to another. Now the identity of
    parts being taken away, the identity of the whole is removed, if we speak of
    essential parts, but not if we speak of accidental parts, such as hair and
    nails, to which apparently Augustine refers (De Civ. Dei xxii). It is thus
    clear how the transference of matter from one part of another destroys the
    identity, and how it does not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But speaking of the congruity, it is more probable that even the parts will
    retain their position at the resurrection, especially as regards the
    essential and organic parts, although perhaps not as regards the accidental
    parts, such as nails and hair.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers organic or
    heterogeneous parts, but no homogeneous or like parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A change in the position of the parts of
    matter does not cause a change of identity, although difference of matter
    does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Operation, properly speaking, is not
    ascribed to the part but to the whole, wherefore the reward is due, not to
    the part but to the whole.<br />
