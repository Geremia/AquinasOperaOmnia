  <br />
  <p>
    After writing these few questions of the treatise on Penance, St. Thomas was
    called to the heavenly reward which he had merited by writing so well of his
    Divine Master. The remainder of the Summa Theologica, known as the
    Supplement, was compiled probably by Fra Rainaldo da Piperno, companion and
    friend of the Angelic Doctor, and was gathered from St. Thomas's commentary
    on the Fourth Book of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. This commentary was
    written in the years 1235-1253, while St. Thomas was under thirty years of
    age. Everywhere it reveals the influence of him whom St. Thomas always
    called the Master. But that influence was not to be always supreme. That the
    mind of the Angelic Doctor moved forward to positions which directly
    contradicted the Master may be seen by any student of the Summa Theologica.
    The compiler of the Supplement was evidently well acquainted with the
    commentary on the Sentences, which had been in circulation for some twenty
    years or more, but it is probable that he was badly acquainted with the
    Summa Theologica. This will be realized and must be borne in mind when we
    read the Supplement, notably TP, Question [62], Article [1]; also Question
    [43], Article [3], ad 2 of the Supplement.<br />
