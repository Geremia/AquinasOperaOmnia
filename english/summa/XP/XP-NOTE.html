<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing these few questions of the treatise on Penance, St. Thomas 
was called to the heavenly reward which he had merited by writing so well 
of his Divine Master. The remainder of the Summa Theologica, known as the 
Supplement, was compiled probably by Fra Rainaldo da Piperno, companion 
and friend of the Angelic Doctor, and was gathered from St. Thomas's 
commentary on the Fourth Book of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. This 
commentary was written in the years 1235-1253, while St. Thomas was under 
thirty years of age. Everywhere it reveals the influence of him whom St. 
Thomas always called the Master. But that influence was not to be always 
supreme. That the mind of the Angelic Doctor moved forward to positions 
which directly contradicted the Master may be seen by any student of the 
Summa Theologica. The compiler of the Supplement was evidently well 
acquainted with the commentary on the Sentences, which had been in 
circulation for some twenty years or more, but it is probable that he was 
badly acquainted with the Summa Theologica. This will be realized and 
must be borne in mind when we read the Supplement, notably TP, Question [62], 
Article [1]; also Question [43], Article [3], ad 2 of the Supplement.<br>
