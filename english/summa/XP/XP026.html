    OF THOSE WHO CAN GRANT INDULGENCES (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider those who can grant indulgences: under which head there
    are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP026.html#XPQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether every parish priest can
    grant indulgences?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP026.html#XPQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a deacon or another, who
    is not a priest, can grant indulgences?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP026.html#XPQ26A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a bishop can grant them?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP026.html#XPQ26A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether they can be granted by one
    who is in mortal sin?

  <h3 align="left">Whether every parish priest can grant indulgences?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every parish priest can grant
    indulgences. For an indulgence derives its efficacy from the superabundance
    of the Church's merits. Now there is no congregation without some
    superabundance of merits. Therefore every priest, who has charge of a
    congregation, can grant indulgences, and, in like manner, so can every
    prelate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every prelate stands for a multitude,
    just as an individual stands for himself. But any individual can assign his
    own goods to another and thus offer satisfaction for a third person.
    Therefore a prelate can assign the property of the multitude subject to him,
    and so it seems that he can grant indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> To excommunicate is less than to grant
    indulgences. But a parish priest cannot do the former. Therefore he cannot
    do the latter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Indulgences are effective, in as much as the
    works of satisfaction done by one person are applied to another, not only by
    virtue of charity, but also by the intention of the person who did them
    being directed in some way to the person to whom they are applied. Now a
    person's intention may be directed to another in three ways, specifically,
    generically and individually. Individually, as when one person offers
    satisfaction for another particular person; and thus anyone can apply his
    works to another. Specifically, as when a person prays for the congregation
    to which he belongs, for the members of his household, or for his
    benefactors, and directs his works of satisfaction to the same intention: in
    this way the superior of a congregation can apply those works to some other
    person, by applying the intention of those who belong to his congregation to
    some fixed individual. Generically, as when a person directs his works for
    the good of the Church in general; and thus he who presides over the whole
    Church can communicate those works, by applying his intention to this or
    that individual. And since a man is a member of a congregation, and a
    congregation is a part of the Church, hence the intention of private good
    includes the intention of the good of the congregation, and of the good of
    the whole Church. Therefore he who presides over the Church can communicate
    what belongs to an individual congregation or to an individual man: and he
    who presides over a congregation can communicate what belongs to an
    individual man, but not conversely. Yet neither the first nor the second
    communication is called an indulgence, but only the third; and this for two
    reasons. First, because, although those communications loose man from the
    debt of punishment in the sight of God, yet he is not freed from the
    obligation of fulfilling the satisfaction enjoined, to which he is bound by
    a commandment of the Church; whereas the third communication frees man even
    from this obligation. Secondly, because in one person or even in one
    congregation there is not such an unfailing supply of merits as to be
    sufficient both for the one person or congregation and for all others; and
    consequently the individual is not freed from the entire debt of punishment
    unless satisfaction is offered for him individually, to the very amount that
    he owes. On the other hand, in the whole Church there is an unfailing supply
    of merits, chiefly on account of the merit of Christ. Consequently he alone
    who is at the head of the Church can grant indulgences. Since, however, the
    Church is the congregation of the faithful, and since a congregation of men
    is of two kinds, the domestic, composed of members of the same family, and
    the civil, composed of members of the same nationality, the Church is like
    to a civil congregation, for the people themselves are called the Church;
    while the various assemblies, or parishes of one diocese are likened to a
    congregation in the various families and services. Hence a bishop alone is
    properly called a prelate of the Church, wherefore he alone, like a
    bridegroom, receives the ring of the Church. Consequently full power in the
    dispensation of the sacraments, and jurisdiction in the public tribunal,
    belong to him alone as the public person, but to others by delegation from
    him. Those priests who have charge of the people are not prelates strictly
    speaking, but assistants, hence, in consecrating priests the bishop says:
    "The more fragile we are, the more we need these assistants": and for this
    reason they do not dispense all the sacraments. Hence parish priests, or
    abbots or other like prelates cannot grant indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>

    Whether a deacon or another who is not a priest can grant an indulgence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a deacon, or one that is not a
    priest cannot grant an indulgence. Because remission of sins is an effect of
    the keys. Now none but a priest has the keys. Therefore a priest alone can
    grant indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a fuller remission of punishment is
    granted by indulgences than by the tribunal of Penance. But a priest alone
    has power in the latter, and, therefore, he alone has power in the
    former.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The distribution of the Church's treasury is
    entrusted to the same person as the government of the Church. Now this is
    entrusted sometimes to one who is not a priest. Therefore he can grant
    indulgences, since they derive their efficacy from the distribution of the
    Church's treasury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The power of granting indulgences follows
    jurisdiction, as stated above (<a href="XP025.html#XPQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="XP025.html#XPQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And since deacons and
    others, who are not priests, can have jurisdiction either delegated, as
    legates, or ordinary, as bishops-elect, it follows that even those who are
    not priests can grant indulgences, although they cannot absolve in the
    tribunal of Penance, since this follows the reception of orders. This
    suffices for the Replies to the Objections, because the granting of
    indulgences belongs to the key of jurisdiction and not to the key of
    orders.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether a bishop can grant indulgences?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that even a bishop cannot grant
    indulgences. Because the treasury of the Church is the common property of
    the whole Church. Now the common property of the whole Church cannot be
    distributed save by him who presides over the whole Church. Therefore the
    Pope alone can grant indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, none can remit punishments fixed by law,
    save the one who has the power to make the law. Now punishments in
    satisfaction for sins are fixed by law. Therefore the Pope alone can remit
    these punishments, since he is the maker of the law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the custom of the Church in accordance
    with which bishops grant indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Pope has the plenitude of pontifical power,
    being like a king in his kingdom: whereas the bishops are appointed to a
    share in his solicitude, like judges over each city. Hence them alone the
    Pope, in his letters, addresses as "brethren," whereas he calls all others
    his "sons." Therefore the plenitude of the power of granting indulgences
    resides in the Pope, because he can grant them, as he lists, provided the
    cause be a lawful one: while, in bishops, this power resides subject to the
    Pope's ordination, so that they can grant them within fixed limits and not
    beyond.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether indulgences can be granted by one who is in mortal sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that indulgences cannot be granted
    by one who is in mortal sin. For a stream can no longer flow if cut off from
    its source. Now the source of grace which is the Holy Ghost is cut off from
    one who is in mortal sin. Therefore such a one can convey nothing to others
    by granting indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a greater thing to grant an
    indulgence than to receive one. But one who is in mortal sin cannot receive
    an indulgence, as we shall show presently (<a href="XP027.html#XPQ27OUTP1"
      >Question [27]</a
    >, <a href="XP027.html#XPQ27A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Neither, therefore,
    can he grant one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Indulgences are granted in virtue of the
    power conferred on the prelates of the Church. Now mortal sin takes away,
    not power but goodness. Therefore one who is in mortal sin can grant
    indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The granting of indulgences belongs to
    jurisdiction. But a man does not, through sin, lose jurisdiction.
    Consequently indulgences are equally valid, whether they be granted by one
    who is in mortal sin, or by a most holy person; since he remits punishment,
    not by virtue of his own merits, but by virtue of the merits laid up in the
    Church's treasury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prelate who, while in a state of
    mortal sin, grants an indulgence, does not pour forth anything of his own,
    and so it is not necessary that he should receive an inflow from the source,
    in order that he may grant a valid indulgence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to grant an indulgence is more
    than to receive one, if we consider the power, but it is less, if we
    consider the personal profit.<br />
