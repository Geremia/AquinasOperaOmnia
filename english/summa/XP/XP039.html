there are six points of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP039.html#XPQ39A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the female sex is an impediment to receiving this sacrament?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the female sex is no impediment to receiving 
Orders. For the office of prophet is greater than the office of priest, 
since a prophet stands midway between God and priests, just as the priest 
does between God and people. Now the office of prophet was sometimes 
granted to women, as may be gathered from 4 Kgs. 22:14. Therefore the 
office of priest also may be competent to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as Order pertains to a kind of pre-eminence, so 
does a position of authority as well as martyrdom and the religious 
state. Now authority is entrusted to women in the New Testament, as in 
the case of abbesses, and in the Old Testament, as in the case of 
Debbora, who judged Israel (Judges 2). Moreover martyrdom and the 
religious life are also befitting to them. Therefore the Orders of the 
Church are also competent to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the power of orders is founded in the soul. But sex is 
not in the soul. Therefore difference in sex makes no difference to the 
reception of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++2:12">1 Tim. 2:12</a>): "I suffer not a woman to 
teach (in the Church),* nor to use authority over the man." [*The words 
in parenthesis are from 1 Cor. 14:34, "Let women keep silence in the 
churches."]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the crown is required previous to receiving Orders, albeit not 
for the validity of the sacrament. But the crown or tonsure is not 
befitting to women according to 1 Cor. 11. Neither therefore is the 
receiving of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Certain things are required in the recipient of a 
sacrament as being requisite for the validity of the sacrament, and if 
such things be lacking, one can receive neither the sacrament nor the 
reality of the sacrament. Other things, however, are required, not for 
the validity of the sacrament, but for its lawfulness, as being congruous 
to the sacrament; and without these one receives the sacrament, but not 
the reality of the sacrament. Accordingly we must say that the male sex 
is required for receiving Orders not only in the second, but also in the 
first way. Wherefore even though a woman were made the object of all that 
is done in conferring Orders, she would not receive Orders, for since a 
sacrament is a sign, not only the thing, but the signification of  the 
thing, is required in all sacramental actions; thus it was stated above 
(<A Href="XP032.html#XPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="XP032.html#XPQ32A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that in Extreme Unction it is necessary to have a sick man, 
in order to signify the need of healing. Accordingly, since it is not 
possible in the female sex to signify eminence of degree, for a woman is 
in the state of subjection, it follows that she cannot receive the 
sacrament of Order. Some, however, have asserted that the male sex is 
necessary for the lawfulness and not for the validity of the sacrament, 
because even in the Decretals (cap. Mulieres dist. 32; cap. Diaconissam, 
27, qu. i) mention is made of deaconesses and priestesses. But deaconess 
there denotes a woman who shares in some act of a deacon, namely who 
reads the homilies in the Church; and priestess [presbytera] means a 
widow, for the word "presbyter" means elder.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prophecy is not a sacrament but a gift of God. Wherefore 
there it is not the signification, but only the thing which is necessary. 
And since in matters pertaining to the soul woman does not differ from 
man as to the thing (for sometimes a woman is found to be better than 
many men as regards the soul), it follows that she can receive the gift 
of prophecy and the like, but not the sacrament of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thereby appears the Reply to the Second and Third Objections. 
However, as to abbesses, it is said that they have not ordinary 
authority, but delegated as it were, on account of the danger of men and 
women living together. But Debbora exercised authority in temporal, not 
in priestly matters, even as now woman may have temporal power.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether boys and those who lack the use of reason can receive Orders?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that boys and those who lack the use of reason 
cannot receive Orders. For, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 25), the 
sacred canons have appointed a certain fixed age in those who receive 
Orders. But this would not be if boys could receive the sacrament of 
Orders. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacrament of Orders ranks above the sacrament of 
matrimony. Now children and those who lack the use of reason cannot 
contract matrimony. Neither therefore can they receive Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, act and power are in the same subject, according to the 
Philosopher (De Somn. et Vigil. i). Now the act of Orders requires the 
use of reason. Therefore the power of Orders does also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> one who is raised to Orders before the age of 
discretion is sometimes allowed to exercise them without being 
reordained, as appears from Extra., De Cler. per salt. prom. But this 
would not be the case if he had not received Orders. Therefore a boy can 
receive Orders. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, boys can receive other sacraments in which a character is 
imprinted, namely Baptism and Confirmation. Therefore in like manner they 
can receive Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Boyhood and other defects which remove the use of reason 
occasion an impediment to act. Wherefore the like are unfit to receive 
all those sacraments which require an act on the part of the recipient of 
the sacrament, such as Penance, Matrimony, and so forth. But since 
infused powers like natural powers precede acts---although acquired 
powers follow acts---and the removal of that which comes after does not 
entail the removal of what comes first, it follows that children and 
those who lack the use of reason can receive all the sacraments in which 
an act on the part of the recipient is not required for the validity of 
the sacrament, but some spiritual power is conferred from above; with 
this difference, however, that in the minor orders the age of discretion 
is required out of respect for the dignity of the sacrament, but not for 
its lawfulness, nor for its validity. Hence some can without sin be 
raised to the minor orders before the years of discretion, if there be an 
urgent reason for it and hope of their proficiency. and they are validly 
ordained; for although at the time they are not qualified for the offices 
entrusted to them, they will become qualified by being habituated 
thereto. For the higher Orders, however, the use of reason is required 
both out of respect for, and for the lawfulness of the sacrament, not 
only on account of the vow of continency annexed thereto, but also 
because the handling of the sacraments is entrusted to them [*See Acts of 
the Council of Trent: De Reform., Sess. xxii, cap. 4,11,12]. But for the 
episcopate whereby a man receives power also over the mystical body, the 
act of accepting the pastoral care of souls is required; wherefore the 
use of reason is necessary for the validity of episcopal consecration. 
Some, however, maintain that the use of reason is necessary for the 
validity of the sacrament in all the Orders. but this statement is not 
confirmed either by authority or by reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated in the Article, not all that is necessary for the 
lawfulness of a sacrament is required for its validity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The cause of matrimony is consent, which cannot be without 
the use of reason. Whereas in the reception of Orders no act is required 
on the part of the recipients since no act on their part is expressed in 
their consecration. Hence there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Act and power are in the same subject; yet sometimes a 
power, such as the free-will, precedes its act; and thus it is in the 
case in point.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the state of slavery is an impediment to receiving Orders?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the state of slavery is not an impediment to 
receiving Orders. For corporal subjection is not incompatible with 
spiritual authority. But in a slave there is corporal subjection. 
Therefore he is not hindered from receiving the spiritual authority which 
is given in orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is an occasion for humility should not be an 
impediment to the reception of a sacrament. Now such is slavery, for the 
Apostle counsels a man, if possible, rather to remain in slavery (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:21">1 Cor. 7:21</a>). Therefore it should not hinder him from being raised to Orders.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is more disgraceful for a cleric to become a slave 
than for a slave to be made a cleric. Yet a cleric may lawfully be sold 
as a slave; for a bishop of Nola, Paulinus, to wit, sold himself as a 
slave as related by Gregory (Dial. iii). Much more therefore can a slave 
be made a cleric.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, It would seem that it is an impediment to the 
validity of the sacrament. For a woman, on account of her subjection, 
cannot receive the sacrament of Orders. But greater still is the 
subjection in a slave; since woman was not given to man as his handmaid 
(for which reason she was not made from his feet). Therefore neither can 
a slave receive this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a man, from the fact that he receives an Order, is bound 
to minister in that Order. But he cannot at the same time serve his 
carnal master and exercise his spiritual ministry. Therefore it would 
seem that he cannot receive Orders, since the master must be indemnified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By receiving Orders a man pledges himself to the Divine 
offices. And since no man can give what is not his, a slave who has not 
the disposal of himself, cannot be raised to Orders. If, however, he be 
raised, he receives the Order, because freedom is not required for the 
validity of the sacrament, although it is requisite for its lawfulness, 
since it hinders not the power, but the act only. The same reason applies 
to all who are under an obligation to others, such as those who are in 
debt and like persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The reception of spiritual power involves also an 
obligation to certain bodily actions, and consequently it is hindered by 
bodily subjection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man may take an occasion for humility from many other 
things which do not prove a hindrance to the exercise of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The blessed Paulinus did this out of the abundance of his 
charity, being led by the spirit of God; as was proved by the result of 
his action, since by his becoming a slave, many of his flock were freed 
from slavery. Hence we must not draw a conclusion from this particular 
instance, since "where the spirit  of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 
Cor. 3:17).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The sacramental signs signify by reason of their natural 
likeness. Now a woman is a subject by her nature, whereas a slave is not. 
Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> If he be ordained, his master knowing and not dissenting, 
by this very fact he becomes a freedman. But if his master be in 
ignorance, the bishop and he who presented him are bound to pay the 
master double the slave's value, if they knew him to be a slave. 
Otherwise if the slave has possessions of his own, he is bound to buy his 
freedom, else he would have to return to the bondage of his master, 
notwithstanding the impossibility of his exercising his Order.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man should be debarred from receiving Orders on account of homicide?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought not to be debarred from receiving 
Orders on account of homicide. Because our Orders originated with the 
office of the Levites, as stated in the previous Distinction (Sent. iv, 
D, 24). But the Levites consecrated their hands by shedding the blood of 
their brethren (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++32:29">Ex. 32:29</a>). Therefore neither should anyone in the New 
Testament be debarred from receiving Orders on account of the shedding of 
blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one should be debarred from a sacrament on account of 
an act of virtue. Now blood is sometimes shed for justice' sake, for 
instance by a judge; and he who has the office would sin if he did not 
shed it. Therefore he is not hindered on that account from receiving 
Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, punishment is not due save for a fault. Now sometimes a 
person commits homicide without fault, for instance by defending himself, 
or again by mishap. Therefore he ought not to incur the punishment of 
irregularity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Against this there are many canonical statutes [*Cap. 
Miror; cap. Clericum; cap. De his Cler., dist. 1; cap. Continebatur, De 
homic. volunt.], as also the custom of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All the Orders bear a relation to the sacrament of the 
Eucharist, which is the sacrament of the peace vouchsafed to us by the 
shedding of Christ's blood. And since homicide is most opposed to peace, 
and those who slay are conformed to Christ's slayers rather than to 
Christ slain, to whom all the ministers of the aforesaid sacrament ought 
to be conformed, it follows that it is unlawful, although not invalid, 
for homicides to be raised to Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Old Law inflicted the punishment of blood, whereas the 
New Law does not. Hence the comparison fails between  the ministers of 
the Old Testament and those of the New, which is a sweet yoke and a light 
burden (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:30">Mt. 11:30</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Irregularity is incurred not only on account of sin, but 
chiefly on account of a person being unfit to administer the sacrament of 
the Eucharist. Hence the judge and all who take part with him in a cause 
of blood, are irregular, because the shedding of blood is unbecoming to 
the ministers of that sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No one does a thing without being the cause thereof, and in 
man this is something voluntary. Hence he who by mishap slays a man 
without knowing that it is a man, is not called a homicide, nor does he 
incur irregularity (unless he was occupying himself in some unlawful 
manner, or failed to take sufficient care, since in this case the slaying 
becomes somewhat voluntary). But this is not because he is not in fault, 
since irregularity is incurred even without fault. Wherefore even he who 
in a particular case slays a man in self-defense without committing a 
sin, is none the less irregular [*St. Thomas is speaking according to the 
canon law of his time. This is no longer the case now.].<br>

be debarred from receiving Orders. For the son should not bear the 
iniquity of the father (Ezech. 18:20); and yet he would if this were an 
impediment to his receiving Orders. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one's own fault is a greater impediment than the fault 
of another. Now unlawful intercourse does not always debar a man from 
receiving Orders. Therefore neither should he be debarred by the unlawful 
intercourse of his father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++23:2">Dt. 23:2</a>): "A mamzer, that is to say, 
one born of a prostitute, shall not enter into the Church of the Lord 
until the tenth generation." Much less therefore should he be ordained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Those who are ordained are placed in a position of 
dignity over others. Hence by a kind of propriety it is requisite that 
they should be without reproach, not for the validity but for the 
lawfulness of the sacrament, namely that they should be of good repute, 
bedecked with a virtuous life, and not publicly penitent. And since a 
man's good name is bedimmed by a sinful origin, therefore those also who 
are born of an unlawful union are debarred from receiving orders, unless 
they receive a dispensation; and this is the more difficult to obtain, 
according as their origin is more discreditable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Irregularity is not a punishment due for sin. Hence it is 
clear that those who are of illegitimate birth do not  bear the iniquity 
of their father through being irregular.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What a man does by his own act can be removed by repentance 
and by a contrary act; not so the things which are from nature. Hence the 
comparison fails between sinful act and sinful origin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether lack of members should be an impediment?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought not to be debarred from receiving 
Orders on account of a lack of members. For one who is afflicted should 
not receive additional affliction. Therefore a man ought not to be 
deprived of the degree of Orders on account of his suffering a bodily 
defect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, integrity of discretion is more necessary for the act of 
orders than integrity of body. But some can be ordained before the years 
of discretion. Therefore they can also be ordained though deficient in 
body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[6] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The like were debarred from the ministry of the Old Law 
(Lev. 21:18, seqq.). Much more therefore should they be debarred in the 
New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[6] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall speak of bigamy in the treatise on Matrimony (<A Href="XP066.html#XPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[39] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what we have said above (<A Href="XP039.html#XPQ39ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4,5), a 
man is disqualified from receiving Orders, either on account of an 
impediment to the act, or on account of an impediment affecting his 
personal comeliness. Hence he who suffers from a lack of members is 
debarred from receiving Orders, if the defect be such as to cause a 
notable blemish, whereby a man's comeliness is bedimmed (for instance if 
his nose be cut off) or the exercise of his Order imperilled; otherwise 
he is not debarred. This integrity, however, is necessary for the 
lawfulness and not for the validity of the sacrament.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
