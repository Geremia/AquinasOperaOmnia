  <h3 align="center">OF THE SEAL OF CONFESSION (FIVE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now inquire about the seal of confession, about which there are five
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in every case a man is
    bound to hide what he knows under the seal of confession?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the seal of confession
    extends to other matters than those which have reference to confession?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the priest alone is bound
    by the seal of confession?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether, by permission of the
    penitent, the priest can make known to another, a sin of his which he knew
    under the seal of confession?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether he is bound to hide even
    what he knows through other sources besides?<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether in every case the priest is bound to hide the sins which he knows
    under the seal of confession?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the priest is not bound in
    every case to hide the sins which he knows under the seal of confession.
    For, as Bernard says (De Proecep. et Dispens. ii), "that which is instituted
    for the sake of charity does not militate against charity." Now the secret
    of confession would militate against charity in certain cases: for instance,
    if a man knew through confession that a certain man was a heretic, whom he
    cannot persuade to desist from misleading the people; or, in like manner, if
    a man knew, through confession, that certain people who wish to marry are
    related to one another. Therefore such ought to reveal what they know
    through confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is obligatory solely on
    account of a precept of the Church need not be observed, if the commandment
    be changed to the contrary. Now the secret of confession was introduced
    solely by a precept of the Church. If therefore the Church were to prescribe
    that anyone who knows anything about such and such a sin must make it known,
    a man that had such knowledge through confession would be bound to speak.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man is bound to safeguard his
    conscience rather than the good name of another, because there is order in
    charity. Now it happens sometimes that a man by hiding a sin injures his own
    conscience---for instance, if he be called upon to give witness of a sin of
    which he has knowledge through confession, and is forced to swear to tell
    the truth---or when an abbot knows through confession the sin of a prior who
    is subject to him, which sin would be an occasion of ruin to the latter, if
    he suffers him to retain his priorship, wherefore he is bound to deprive him
    of the dignity of his pastoral charge, and yet in depriving him he seem to
    divulge the secret of confession. Therefore it seems that in certain cases
    it is lawful to reveal a confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is possible for a priest through
    hearing a man's confession to be conscious that the latter is unworthy of
    ecclesiastical preferment. Now everyone is bound to prevent the promotion of
    the unworthy, if it is his business. Since then by raising an objection he
    seems to raise a suspicion of sin, and so to reveal the confession somewhat,
    it seems that it is necessary sometimes to divulge a confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Decretal says (De Poenit. et Remiss.,
    Cap. Omnis utriusque): "Let the priest beware lest he betray the sinner, by
    word, or sign, or in any other way whatever."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the priest should conform himself to God, Whose minister he is. But
    God does not reveal the sins which are made known to Him in confession, but
    hides them. Neither, therefore, should the priest reveal them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Those things which are done outwardly in the
    sacraments are the signs of what takes place inwardly: wherefore confession,
    whereby a man subjects himself to a priest, is a sign of the inward
    submission, whereby one submits to God. Now God hides the sins of those who
    submit to Him by Penance; wherefore this also should be signified in the
    sacrament of Penance, and consequently the sacrament demands that the
    confession should remain hidden, and he who divulges a confession sins by
    violating the sacrament. Besides this there are other advantages in this
    secrecy, because thereby men are more attracted to confession, and confess
    their sins with greater simplicity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some say that the priest is not bound by
    the seal of confession to hide other sins than those in respect of which the
    penitent promises amendment; otherwise he may reveal them to one who can be
    a help and not a hindrance. But this opinion seems erroneous, since it is
    contrary to the truth of the sacrament; for just as, though the person
    baptized be insincere, yet his Baptism is a sacrament, and there is no
    change in the essentials of the sacrament on that account, so confession
    does not cease to be sacramental although he that confesses, does not
    purpose amendment. Therefore, this notwithstanding, it must be held secret;
    nor does the seal of confession militate against charity on that account,
    because charity does not require a man to find a remedy for a sin which he
    knows not: and that which is known in confession, is, as it were, unknown,
    since a man knows it, not as man, but as God knows it. Nevertheless in the
    cases quoted one should apply some kind of remedy, so far as this can be
    done without divulging the confession, e.g. by admonishing the penitent, and
    by watching over the others lest they be corrupted by heresy. He can also
    tell the prelate to watch over his flock with great care, yet so as by
    neither word nor sign to betray the penitent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The precept concerning the secret of
    confession follows from the sacrament itself. Wherefore just as the
    obligation of making a sacramental confession is of Divine law, so that no
    human dispensation or command can absolve one therefrom, even so, no man can
    be forced or permitted by another man to divulge the secret of confession.
    Consequently if he be commanded under pain of excommunication to be incurred
    "ipso facto," to say whether he knows anything about such and such a sin, he
    ought not to say it, because he should assume that the intention of the
    person in commanding him thus, was that he should say what he knew as man.
    And even if he were expressly interrogated about a confession, he ought to
    say nothing, nor would he incur the excommunication, for he is not subject
    to his superior, save as a man, and he knows this not as a man, but as God
    knows it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man is not called upon to witness
    except as a man, wherefore without wronging his conscience he can swear that
    he knows not, what he knows only as God knows it. In like manner a superior
    can, without wronging his conscience, leave a sin unpunished which he knows
    only as God knows it, or he may forbear to apply a remedy, since he is not
    bound to apply a remedy, except according as it comes to his knowledge.
    Wherefore with regard to matters which come to his knowledge in the tribunal
    of Penance, he should apply the remedy, as far as he can, in the same court:
    thus as to the case in point, the abbot should advise the prior to resign
    his office, and if the latter refuse, he can absolve him from the priorship
    on some other occasion, yet so as to avoid all suspicion of divulging the
    confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A man is rendered unworthy of
    ecclesiastical preferment, by many other causes besides sin, for instance,
    by lack of knowledge, age, or the like: so that by raising an objection one
    does not raise a suspicion of crime or divulge the secret of confession.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the seal of confession extends to other matters than those which
    have reference to confession?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the seal of confession extends
    to other matters besides those which have reference to confession. For sins
    alone have reference to confession. Now sometimes besides sins other matters
    are told which have no reference to confession. Therefore, since such things
    are told to the priest, as to God, it seems that the seal of confession
    extends to them also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sometimes one person tells another a
    secret, which the latter receives under the seal of confession. Therefore
    the seal of confession extends to matters having no relation to
    confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The seal of confession is connected with
    sacramental confession. But those things which are connected with a
    sacrament, do not extend outside the bounds of the sacrament. Therefore the
    seal of confession does not extend to matters other than those which have
    reference to sacramental confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The seal of confession does not extend directly
    to other matters than those which have reference to sacramental confession,
    yet indirectly matters also which are not connected with sacramental
    confession are affected by the seal of confession, those, for instance,
    which might lead to the discovery of a sinner or of his sin. Nevertheless
    these matters also must be most carefully hidden, both on account of
    scandal, and to avoid leading others into sin through their becoming
    familiar with it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A confidence ought not easily to be
    accepted in this way: but if it be done the secret must be kept in the way
    promised, as though one had the secret through confession, though not
    through the seal of confession.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the priest alone is bound by the seal of confession?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not only the priest is bound
    by the seal of confession. For sometimes a priest hears a confession through
    an interpreter, if there be an urgent reason for so doing. But it seems that
    the interpreter is bound to keep the confession secret. Therefore one who is
    not a priest knows something under the seal of confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is possible sometimes in cases of
    urgency for a layman to hear a confession. But he is bound to secrecy with
    regard to those sins, since they are told to him as to God. Therefore not
    only the priest is bound by the seal of confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man pretends to be
    a priest, so that by this deceit he may know what is on another's
    conscience: and it would seem that he also sins if he divulges the
    confession. Therefore not only the priest is bound by the seal of
    confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A priest alone is the minister of this
    sacrament. But the seal of confession is connected with this sacrament.
    Therefore the priest alone is bound by the seal of confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the reason why a man is bound to keep secret what he hears in
    confession, is because he knows them, not as man but as God knows them. But
    the priest alone is God's minister. Therefore he alone is bound to
    secrecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The seal of confession affects the priest as
    minister of this sacrament: which seal is nothing else than the obligation
    of keeping the confession secret, even as the key is the power of absolving.
    Yet, as one who is not a priest, in a particular case has a kind of share in
    the act of the keys, when he hears a confession in a case of urgency, so
    also does he have a certain share in the act of the seal of confession, and
    is bound to secrecy, though, properly speaking, he is not bound by the seal
    of confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether by the penitent's permission, a priest may reveal to another a sin
    which he knows under the seal of confession?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a priest may not, by the
    penitent's permission, reveal to another a sin which he knows under the seal
    of confession. For an inferior may not do what his superior may not. Now the
    Pope cannot give permission for anyone to divulge a sin which he knows
    through confession. Neither therefore can the penitent give him such a
    permission.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is instituted for the common
    good of the Church cannot be changed at the will of an individual. Now the
    secrecy of confession was instituted for the good of the whole Church, in
    order that men might have greater confidence in approaching the
    confessional. Therefore the penitent cannot allow the priest to divulge his
    confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the priest could grant such a
    permission, this would seem to palliate the wickedness of bad priests, for
    they might pretend to have received the permission and so they might sin
    with impunity, which would be unbecoming. Therefore it seems that the
    penitent cannot grant this permission.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the one to whom this sin is divulged
    does not know that sin under the seal of confession, so that he may publish
    a sin which is already blotted out, which is unbecoming. Therefore this
    permission cannot be granted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> If the sinner consent, a superior may refer
    him by letter to an inferior priest. Therefore with the consent of the
    penitent, the priest may reveal a sin of his to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, whosoever can do a thing of his own authority, can do it through
    another. But the penitent can by his own authority reveal his sin to
    another. Therefore he can do it through the priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that There are two reasons for which the priest is bound to keep a
    sin secret: first and chiefly, because this very secrecy is essential to the
    sacrament, in so far as the priest knows that sin, as it is known to God,
    Whose place he holds in confession: secondly, in order to avoid scandal. Now
    the penitent can make the priest know, as a man, what he knew before only as
    God knows it, and he does this when he allows him to divulge it: so that if
    the priest does reveal it, he does not break the seal of confession.
    Nevertheless he should beware of giving scandal by revealing the sin, lest
    he be deemed to have broken the seal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Pope cannot permit a priest to
    divulge a sin, because he cannot make him to know it as a man, whereas he
    that has confessed it, can.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When that is told which was known
    through another source, that which is instituted for the common good is not
    done away with, because the seal of confession is not broken.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This does not bestow impunity on wicked
    priests, because they are in danger of having to prove that they had the
    penitent's permission to reveal the sin, if they should be accused of the
    contrary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> He that is informed of a sin through the
    priest with the penitent's consent, shares in an act of the priest's, so
    that the same applies to him as to an interpreter, unless perchance the
    penitent wish him to know it unconditionally and freely.<br />

    Whether a man may reveal that which he knows through confession and through
    some other source besides?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man may not reveal what he
    knows through confession and through some other source besides. For the seal
    of confession is not broken unless one reveals a sin known through
    confession. If therefore a man divulges a sin which he knows through
    confession, no matter how he knows it otherwise, he seems to break the
    seal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever hears someone's confession, is
    under obligation to him not to divulge his sins. Now if one were to promise
    someone to keep something secret, he would be bound to do so, even if he
    knew it through some other source. Therefore a man is bound to keep secret
    what he knows through the confession, no matter how he knows it
    otherwise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the stronger of two things draws the
    other to itself. Now the knowledge whereby a man knows a sin as God knows
    it, is stronger and more excellent than the knowledge whereby he knows a sin
    as man. Therefore it draws the latter to itself: and consequently a man
    cannot reveal that sin, because this is demanded by his knowing it as God
    knows it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the secrecy of confession was instituted
    in order to avoid scandal, and to prevent men being shy of going to
    confession. But if a man might say what he had heard in confession, though
    he knew it otherwise, scandal would result all the same. Therefore he can
    nowise say what he has heard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No one can put another under a new
    obligation, unless he be his superior, who can bind him by a precept. Now he
    who knew of a sin by witnessing it was not bound to keep it secret.
    Therefore he that confesses to him, not being his superior, cannot put him
    under an obligation of secrecy by confessing to him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the justice of the Church would be hindered if a man, in order to
    escape a sentence of excommunication, incurred on account of some sin, of
    which he has been convicted, were to confess to the person who has to
    sentence him. Now the execution of justice falls under a precept. Therefore
    a man is not bound to keep a sin secret, which he has heard in confession,
    but knows from some other source.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are three opinions about this question.
    For some say that a man can by no means tell another what he has heard in
    confession, even if he knew it from some other source either before or after
    the confession: while others assert that the confession debars him from
    speaking of what he knew already, but not from saying what he knew
    afterwards and in another way. Now both these opinions, by exaggerating the
    seal of confession, are prejudicial to the truth and to the safeguarding of
    justice. For a man might be more inclined to sin, if he had no fear of being
    accused by his confessor supposing that he repeated the sin in his presence:
    and furthermore it would be most prejudicial to justice if a man could not
    bear witness to a deed which he has seen committed again after being
    confessed to him. Nor does it matter that, as some say, he ought to declare
    that he cannot keep it secret, for he cannot make such a declaration until
    the sin has already been confessed to him, and then every priest could, if
    he wished, divulge a sin, by making such a declaration, if this made him
    free to divulge it. Consequently there is a third and truer opinion, viz.
    that what a man knows through another source either before or after
    confession, he is not bound to keep secret, in so far as he knows it as a
    man, for he can say: "I know so end so since I saw it." But he is bound to
    keep it secret in so far as he knows it as God knows it, for he cannot say:
    "I heard so and so in confession." Nevertheless, on account of the scandal
    he should refrain from speaking of it unless there is an urgent reason.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If a man says that he has seen what he
    has heard in the confessional, he does not reveal what he heard in
    confession, save indirectly: even as one who knows something through hearing
    and seeing it, does not, properly speaking, divulge what he saw, if he says
    he heard it, but only indirectly, because he says he has heard what he
    incidentally saw. Wherefore he does not break the seal of confession.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The confessor is not forbidden to reveal
    a sin simply, but to reveal it as heard in confession: for in no case is he
    allowed to say that he has heard it in the confessional.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This is true of things that are in
    opposition to one another: whereas to know a sin as God knows it, and to
    know it as man knows it, are not in opposition; so that the argument proves
    nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It would not be right to avoid scandal
    so as to desert justice: for the truth should not be gainsayed for fear of
    scandal. Wherefore when justice and truth are in the balance, a man should
    not be deterred by the fear of giving scandal, from divulging what he has
    heard in confession, provided he knows it from some other source: although
    he ought to avoid giving scandal, as far as he is able.<br />
