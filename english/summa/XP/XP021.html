    OF THE DEFINITION, CONGRUITY AND CAUSE OF EXCOMMUNICATION (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now treat of excommunication: we shall consider: (1) the definition,
    congruity and cause of excommunication; (2) who has the power to
    excommunicate; (3) communication with excommunicated persons; (4) absolution
    from excommunication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP021.html#XPQ21A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether excommunication is
    suitably defined?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP021.html#XPQ21A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the Church should
    excommunicate anyone?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP021.html#XPQ21A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether anyone should be
    excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP021.html#XPQ21A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether an excommunication
    unjustly pronounced has any effect?

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether excommunication is suitably defined as separation from the communion
    of the Church, etc?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that excommunication is unsuitably
    defined by some thus: "Excommunication is separation from the communion of
    the Church, as to fruit and general suffrages." For the suffrages of the
    Church avail for those for whom they are offered. But the Church prays for
    those who are outside the Church, as, for instance, for heretics and pagans.
    Therefore she prays also for the excommunicated, since they are outside the
    Church, and so the suffrages of the Church avail for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one loses the suffrages of the Church
    except by his own fault. Now excommunication is not a fault, but a
    punishment. Therefore excommunication does not deprive a man of the general
    suffrages of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruit of the Church seems to be the
    same as the Church's suffrages, for it cannot mean the fruit of temporal
    goods, since excommunication does not deprive a man of these. Therefore
    there is no reason for mentioning both.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there is a kind of excommunication
    called minor*, by which man is not deprived of the suffrages of the Church.
    [*Minor excommunication is no longer recognized by Canon Law.] Therefore
    this definition is unsuitable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> When a man enters the Church by Baptism, he is
    admitted to two things, viz. the body of the faithful and the participation
    of the sacraments: and this latter presupposes the former, since the
    faithful are united together in the participation of the sacraments.
    Consequently a person may be expelled from the Church in two ways. First, by
    being deprived merely of the participation of the sacraments, and this is
    the minor excommunication. Secondly, by being deprived of both, and this is
    the major excommunication, of which the above is the definition. Nor can
    there be a third, consisting in the privation of communion with the
    faithful, but not of the participation of the sacraments, for the reason
    already given, because, to wit, the faithful communicate together in the
    sacraments. Now communion with the faithful is twofold. One consists in
    spiritual things, such as their praying for one another, and meeting
    together for the reception of sacred things; while another consists in
    certain legitimate bodily actions. These different manners of communion are
    signified in the verse which declares that those who are excommunicate are
    deprived of---<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    "os, orare, vale, communio, mensa." "Os," i.e. we must not give them tokens
    of goodwill; "orare," i.e. we must not pray with them; "vale," we must not
    give them marks of respect; "communio," i.e. we must not communicate with
    them in the sacraments; "mensa," i.e. we must not take meals with them.
    Accordingly the above definition includes privation of the sacraments in the
    words "as to the fruit," and from partaking together with the faithful in
    spiritual things, in the words, "and the general prayers of the Church."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Another definition is given which expresses the privation of both kinds of
    acts, and is as follows: "Excommunication is the privation of all lawful
    communion with the faithful."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prayers are said for unbelievers, but
    they do not receive the fruit of those prayers unless they be converted to
    the faith. In like manner prayers may be offered up for those who are
    excommunicated, but not among the prayers that are said for the members of
    the Church. Yet they do not receive the fruit so long as they remain under
    the excommunication, but prayers are said for them that they may receive the
    spirit of repentance, so that they may be loosed from excommunication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One man's prayers profit another in so
    far as they can reach to him. Now the action of one man may reach to another
    in two ways. First, by virtue of charity which unites all the faithful,
    making them one in God, according to Ps. 118:63: "I am a partaker with all
    them that fear Thee." Now excommunication does not interrupt this union,
    since no man can be justly excommunicated except for a mortal sin, whereby a
    man is already separated from charity, even without being excommunicated. An
    unjust excommunication cannot deprive a man of charity, since this is one of
    the greatest of all goods, of which a man cannot be deprived against his
    will. Secondly, through the intention of the one who prays, which intention
    is directed to the person he prays for, and this union is interrupted by
    excommunication, because by passing sentence of excommunication, the Church
    severs a man from the whole body of the faithful, for whom she prays. Hence
    those prayers of the Church which are offered up for the whole Church, do
    not profit those who are excommunicated. Nor can prayers be said for them
    among the members of the Church as speaking in the Church's name, although a
    private individual may say a prayer with the intention of offering it for
    their conversion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The spiritual fruit of the Church is
    derived not only from her prayers, but also from the sacraments received and
    from the faithful dwelling together.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The minor excommunication does not
    fulfill all the conditions of excommunication but only a part of them, hence
    the definition of excommunication need not apply to it in every respect, but
    only in some.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the Church should excommunicate anyone?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Church ought not to
    excommunicate anyone, because excommunication is a kind of curse, and we are
    forbidden to curse (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A14"
      >Rm. 12:14</a
    >). Therefore the Church should not excommunicate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Church Militant should imitate the
    Church Triumphant. Now we read in the epistle of Jude (verse 9) that "when
    Michael the Archangel disputing with the devil contended about the body of
    Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, but
    said: The Lord command thee." Therefore the Church Militant ought not to
    judge any man by cursing or excommunicating him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man should be given into the hands of
    his enemies, unless there be no hope for him. Now by excommunication a man
    is given into the hands of Satan, as is clear from 1 Cor. 5:5. Since then we
    should never give up hope about anyone in this life, the Church should not
    excommunicate anyone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++5%3A5"
      >1 Cor. 5:5</a
    >) ordered a man to be excommunicated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++18%3A17"
      >Mt. 18:17</a
    >) about the man who refuses to hear the Church: "Let him be to thee as the
    heathen or publican." But heathens are outside the Church. Therefore they
    also who refuse to hear the Church, should be banished from the Church by
    excommunication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judgment of the Church should be conformed
    to the judgment of God. Now God punishes the sinner in many ways, in order
    to draw him to good, either by chastising him with stripes, or by leaving
    him to himself so that being deprived of those helps whereby he was kept out
    of evil, he may acknowledge his weakness, and humbly return to God Whom he
    had abandoned in his pride. In both these respects the Church by passing
    sentence of excommunication imitates the judgment of God. For by severing a
    man from the communion of the faithful that he may blush with shame, she
    imitates the judgment whereby God chastises man with stripes; and by
    depriving him of prayers and other spiritual things, she imitates the
    judgment of God in leaving man to himself, in order that by humility he may
    learn to know himself and return to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A curse may be pronounced in two ways:
    first, so that the intention of the one who curses is fixed on the evil
    which he invokes or pronounces, and cursing in this sense is altogether
    forbidden. Secondly, so that the evil which a man invokes in cursing is
    intended for the good of the one who is cursed, and thus cursing is
    sometimes lawful and salutary: thus a physician makes a sick man undergo
    pain, by cutting him, for instance, in order to deliver him from his
    sickness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The devil cannot be brought to
    repentance, wherefore the pain of excommunication cannot do him any good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the very fact that a man is
    deprived of the prayers of the Church, he incurs a triple loss,
    corresponding to the three things which a man acquires through the Church's
    prayers. For they bring an increase of grace to those who have it, or merit
    grace for those who have it not; and in this respect the Master of the
    Sentences says (Sent. iv, D, 18): "The grace of God is taken away by
    excommunication." They also prove a safeguard of virtue; and in this respect
    he says that "protection is taken away," not that the excommunicated person
    is withdrawn altogether from God's providence, but that he is excluded from
    that protection with which He watches over the children of the Church in a
    more special way. Moreover, they are useful as a defense against the enemy,
    and in this respect he says that "the devil receives greater power of
    assaulting the excommunicated person, both spiritually and corporally."
    Hence in the early Church, when men had to be enticed to the faith by means
    of outward signs (thus the gift of the Holy Ghost was shown openly by a
    visible sign), so too excommunication was evidenced by a person being
    troubled in his body by the devil. Nor is it unreasonable that one, for whom
    there is still hope, be given over to the enemy, for he is surrendered, not
    unto damnation, but unto correction, since the Church has the power to
    rescue him from the hands of the enemy, whenever he is willing.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether anyone should be excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no man should be
    excommunicated for inflicting a temporal harm. For the punishment should not
    exceed the fault. But the punishment of excommunication is the privation of
    a spiritual good, which surpasses all temporal goods. Therefore no man
    should be excommunicated for temporal injuries.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we should render to no man evil for
    evil, according to the precept of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A17"
      >Rm. 12:17</a
    >). But this would be rendering evil for evil, if a man were to be
    excommunicated for doing such an injury. Therefore this ought by no means to
    be done.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Peter sentenced Ananias and Saphira to death
    for keeping back the price of their piece of land (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+5%3A1-10"
      >Acts 5:1-10</a
    >). Therefore it is lawful for the Church to excommunicate for temporal
    injuries.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By excommunication the ecclesiastical judge
    excludes a man, in a sense, from the kingdom. Wherefore, since he ought not
    to exclude from the kingdom others than the unworthy, as was made clear from
    the definition of the keys (<a href="XP017.html#XPQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a
    >, <a href="XP017.html#XPQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and since no one
    becomes unworthy, unless, through committing a mortal sin, he lose charity
    which is the way leading to the kingdom, it follows that no man should be
    excommunicated except for a mortal sin. And since by injuring a man in his
    body or in his temporalities, one may sin mortally and act against charity,
    the Church can excommunicate a man for having inflicted temporal injury on
    anyone. Yet, as excommunication is the most severe punishment, and since
    punishments are intended as remedies, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    ii), and again since a prudent physician begins with lighter and less risky
    remedies, therefore excommunication should not be inflicted, even for a
    mortal sin, unless the sinner be obstinate, either by not coming up for
    judgment, or by going away before judgment is pronounced, or by failing to
    obey the decision of the court. For then, if, after due warning, he refuse
    to obey, he is reckoned to be obstinate, and the judge, not being able to
    proceed otherwise against him, must excommunicate him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A fault is not measured by the extent of
    the damage a man does, but by the will with which he does it, acting against
    charity. Wherefore, though the punishment of excommunication exceeds the
    harm done, it does not exceed the measure of the sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man is corrected by being
    punished, evil is not rendered to him, but good: since punishments are
    remedies, as stated above.<br />

    Whether an excommunication unjustly pronounced has any effect?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an excommunication which is
    pronounced unjustly has no effect at all. Because excommunication deprives a
    man of the protection and grace of God, which cannot be forfeited unjustly.
    Therefore excommunication has no effect if it be unjustly pronounced.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Jerome says (on Mt. 16:19: "I will give
    to thee the keys"): "It is a pharisaical severity to reckon as really bound
    or loosed, that which is bound or loosed unjustly." But that severity was
    proud and erroneous. Therefore an unjust excommunication has no effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Gregory (Hom. xxvi in Evang.),
    "the sentence of the pastor is to be feared whether it be just or unjust."
    Now there would be no reason to fear an unjust excommunication if it did not
    hurt. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An excommunication may be unjust for two
    reasons. First, on the part of its author, as when anyone excommunicates
    through hatred or anger, and then, nevertheless, the excommunication takes
    effect, though its author sins, because the one who is excommunicated
    suffers justly, even if the author act wrongly in excommunicating him.
    Secondly, on the part of the excommunication, through there being no proper
    cause, or through the sentence being passed without the forms of law being
    observed. In this case, if the error, on the part of the sentence, be such
    as to render the sentence void, this has no effect, for there is no
    excommunication; but if the error does not annul the sentence, this takes
    effect, and the person excommunicated should humbly submit (which will be
    credited to him as a merit), and either seek absolution from the person who
    has excommunicated him, or appeal to a higher judge. If, however, he were to
    contemn the sentence, he would "ipso facto" sin mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But sometimes it happens that there is sufficient cause on the part of the
    excommunicator, but not on the part of the excommunicated, as when a man is
    excommunicated for a crime which he has not committed, but which has been
    proved against him: in this case, if he submit humbly, the merit of his
    humility will compensate him for the harm of excommunication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a man cannot lose God's grace
    unjustly, yet he can unjustly lose those things which on our part dispose us
    to receive grace. for instance, a man may be deprived of the instruction
    which he ought to have. It is in this sense that excommunication is said to
    deprive a man of God's grace, as was explained above (<a
      href="XP021.html#XPQ21A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jerome is speaking of sin not of its
    punishments, which can be inflicted unjustly by ecclesiastical superiors.<br />
