<br>
OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH, AFTER RISING AGAIN, MEN WILL HAVE AT THE JUDGMENT CONCERNING MERITS AND DEMERITS (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next place we must treat of those things which follow the 
resurrection. The first of these to be considered will be the knowledge, 
which after rising again, men will have at the judgment, concerning 
merits and demerits; the second will be the general judgment itself, as 
also the time and place at which it will be; thirdly we shall consider 
who will judge and who will be judged; fourthly we shall treat of the 
form wherein the judge will come to judge; and fifthly we shall consider 
what will be after the judgment, the state of the world and of those who 
will have risen again.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP087.html#XPQ87A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether at the judgment every man will know all his sins?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP087.html#XPQ87A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether every one will be able to read all that is on another's 
conscience?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP087.html#XPQ87A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether one will be able at one glance to see all merits and 
demerits?<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether after the resurrection every one will know what sins he has committed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that after the resurrection everyone will not be able to 
know all the sins he has committed. For whatever we know, either we 
receive it anew through the senses, or we draw it from the treasure house 
of the memory. Now after the resurrection men will be unable to perceive 
their sins by means of sense, because they will be things of the past, 
while sense perceives only the present: and many sins will have escaped 
the sinner's memory, and he will be unable to recall them from the 
treasure house of his memory. Therefore after rising again one will not 
be cognizant of all the sins one has committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43), that "there 
are certain books of the conscience, wherein each one's merits are 
inscribed." Now one cannot read a thing in a book, unless it be marked 
down in the book: and sin leaves its mark upon the conscience according 
to a gloss of Origen on Rm. 2:15, "Their conscience bearing witness," 
etc. which mark, seemingly, is nothing else than the guilt or stain. 
Since then in many persons the guilt or stain of many sins is blotted out 
by grace, it would seem that one cannot read in one's conscience all the 
sins one has committed: and thus the same conclusion follows as before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater the cause the greater the effect. Now the 
cause which makes us grieve for the sins which we recall to memory is 
charity. Since then charity is perfect in the saints after the 
resurrection, they will grieve exceedingly for their sins, if they recall 
them to memory: yet this is impossible, seeing that according to Apoc. 
21:4, "Sorrow and mourning shall flee away from them." [*The quotation is 
from Is. 35:10. The text of the Apocalypse has: "Nor mourning, nor 
crying, nor sorrow shall be any more."] Therefore they will not recall 
their own sins to memory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, at the resurrection the damned will be to the good they 
once did as the blessed to the sins they once committed. Now seemingly 
the damned after rising again will have no knowledge of the good they 
once did, since this would alleviate their pain considerably. Neither 
therefore will the blessed have any knowledge of the sins they had 
committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx) that "a kind of Divine 
energy will come to our aid, so that we shall recall all of our sins to 
mind."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, as human judgment is to external evidence, so is the Divine 
judgment to the witness of the conscience, according to 1 Kgs. 16:7, "Man 
seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart." Now 
man cannot pass a perfect judgment on a matter unless evidence be taken 
on all the points that need to be judged. Therefore, since the Divine 
judgment is most perfect, it is necessary for the conscience to witness 
to everything that has to be judged. But all works, both good and evil, 
will have to be judged (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++5:10">2 Cor. 5:10</a>): "We must all be manifested before 
the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things 
of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil." 
Therefore each one's conscience must needs retain all the works he has 
done, whether good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to Rm. 2:15,16, "In the day when God shall 
judge" each one's conscience will bear witness to him and his thoughts 
will accuse and defend him. And since in every judicial hearing, the 
witness, the accuser, and the defendant need to be acquainted with the 
matter on which judgment has to be pronounced, and since at the general 
judgment all the works of men will be submitted to judgment, it will 
behoove every man to be cognizant then of all his works. Wherefore each 
man's conscience will be as a book containing his deeds on which judgment 
will be pronounced, even as in the human court of law we make use of 
records. Of these books it is written in the Apocalypse (20:12): "The 
books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of 
life; and the dead were judged by those things which were written in the 
books [Vulg.: 'book'], according to their works." According to 
Augustine's exposition (De Civ. Dei xx) the books which are here said to 
be opened "denote the saints of the New and Old Testaments in whom God's 
commandments are exemplified." Hence Richard of St. Victor (De judic. 
potest.) says: "Their hearts will be like the code of law." But the book 
of life, of which the text goes on to  speak, signifies each one's 
conscience, which is said to be one single book, because the one Divine 
power will cause all to recall their deeds, and this energy, in so far as 
it reminds a man of his deeds, is called the "book of life" [*Cf. FP, 
Question [24], Article [1], ad 1]. Or else we may refer the first books to the 
conscience, and by the second book we may understand the Judge's sentence 
as expressed in His providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although many merits and demerits will have escaped our 
memory, yet there will be none of them but will remain somewhat in its 
effect, because those merits which are not deadened will remain in the 
reward accorded to them, while those that are deadened remain in the 
guilt of ingratitude, which is increased through the fact that a man 
sinned after receiving grace. In like manner those demerits which are not 
blotted out by repentance remain in the debt of punishment due to them, 
while those which have been blotted out by repentance remain in the 
remembrance of repentance, which they will recall together with their 
other merits. Hence in each man there will be something whereby he will 
be able to recollect his deeds. Nevertheless, as Augustine says (De Civ. 
Dei xx), the Divine energy will especially conduce to this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Each one's conscience will bear certain marks of the deeds 
done by him; and it does not follow that these marks are the guilt alone, 
as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although charity is now the cause of sorrow for sin, yet 
the saints in heaven will be so full of joy, that they will have no room 
for sorrow; and so they will not grieve for their sins, but rather will 
they rejoice in the Divine mercy, whereby their sins are forgiven them. 
Even so do the angels rejoice now in the Divine justice whereby those 
whom they guard fall headlong into sin through being abandoned by grace. 
and whose salvation none the less they eagerly watch over.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The wicked will know all the good they have done, and this 
will not diminish their pain; indeed, it will increase it, because the 
greatest sorrow is to have lost many goods: for which reason Boethius 
says (De Consol. ii) that "the greatest misfortune is to have been happy."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether every one will be able to read all that is in another's conscience?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it will be impossible for every one to read all 
that is in another's conscience. For the knowledge of those who rise 
again will not be clearer than that of the angels, equality with whom is 
promised us after the resurrection (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++22:30">Mt. 22:30</a>). Now angels cannot read 
one another's thoughts in matters dependent on the free-will, wherefore 
they need to speak in order to notify such things to one another [*Cf. 
FP, Question [107]]. Therefore after rising again we shall be unable to read what 
is contained in another's conscience. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is known is known either in itself, or in its 
cause, or in its effect. Now the merits or demerits contained in a 
person's conscience cannot be known by another in themselves, because God 
alone enters the heart and reads its secrets. Neither will it be possible 
for them to be known in their cause, since all will not see God Who alone 
can act on the will, whence merits and demerits proceed. Nor again will 
it be possible to know them from their effect, since there will be many 
demerits, which through being wholly blotted out by repentance will leave 
no effect remaining. Therefore it will not be possible for every one to 
know all that is in another's conscience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom says (Hom. xxxi in Ep. ad Hebr.), as we have 
quoted before (Sent. iv, D, 17): "If thou remember thy sins now, and 
frequently confess them before Cod and beg pardon for them, thou wilt 
very soon blot them out; but if thou forget them, thou wilt then remember 
them unwillingly, when they will be made public, and declared before all 
thy friends and foes, and in the presence of the holy angels." Hence it 
follows that this publication will be the punishment of man's neglect in 
omitting to confess his sins. Therefore the sins which a man has 
confessed will not be made known to others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is a relief to know that one has had many associates 
in sin, so that one is less ashamed thereof. If therefore every one were 
to know the sin of another, each sinner's shame would be much diminished, 
which is unlikely. Therefore every one will not know the sins of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on 1 Cor. 4:5, "will . . . bring to light the 
hidden things of darkness," says: "Deeds and thoughts both good and evil 
will then be revealed and made known to all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the past sins of all the good will be equally blotted out. Yet 
we know the sins of some saints, for instance of Magdalen, Peter, and 
David. Therefore in like manner the sins of the other elect will be 
known, and much more those of the damned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> At the last and general judgment it behooves the Divine 
justice, which now is in many ways hidden, to appear evidently to all. 
Now the sentence of one who condemns or rewards cannot be just, unless it 
be delivered according to merits and demerits. Therefore just as it 
behooves both judge and jury to know the merits of a case, in order to 
deliver a just verdict, so is it necessary, in order that the sentence 
appear to be just, that all who know the sentence should be acquainted 
with the merits. Hence, since every one will know of his reward or 
condemnation, so will every one else know of it, and consequently as each 
one will recall his own merits or demerits, so will he be cognizant of 
those of others. This is the more probable and more common opinion, 
although the Master (Sent. iv, D, 43) says the contrary, namely that a 
man's sins blotted out by repentance will not be made known to others at 
the judgment. But it would follow from this that neither would his  
repentance for these sins be perfectly known, which would detract 
considerably from the glory of the saints and the praise due to God for 
having so mercifully delivered them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the preceding merits or demerits will come to a certain 
amount in the glory or unhappiness of each one rising again. Consequently 
through eternal things being seen, all things in their consciences will 
be visible, especially as the Divine power will conduce to this so that 
the Judge's sentence may appear just to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It will be possible for a man's merits or demerits to be 
made known by their effects as stated above (<A Href="XP087.html#XPQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), or by the power 
of God, although the power of the created intellect is not sufficient for 
this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The manifestation of his sins to the confusion of the 
sinner is a result of his neglect in omitting to confess them. But that 
the sins of the saints be revealed cannot be to their confusion or shame, 
as neither does it bring confusion to Mary Magdalen that her sins are 
publicly recalled in the Church, because shame is "fear of disgrace," as 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii), and this will be impossible in the 
blessed. But this manifestation will bring them great glory on account of 
the penance they did, even as the confessor hails a man who courageously 
confesses great crimes. Sins are said to be blotted out because God sees 
them not for the purpose of punishing them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The sinner's confusion will not be diminished, but on the 
contrary increased, through his seeing the sins of others, for in seeing 
that others are blameworthy he will all the more acknowledge himself to 
be blamed. For that confusion be diminished by a cause of this kind is 
owing to the fact that shame regards the esteem of men, who esteem more 
lightly that which is customary. But then confusion will regard the 
esteem of God, which weighs every sin according to the truth, whether it 
be the sin of one man or of many.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all merits and demerits, one's own as well as those of others, will be seen by anyone at a single glance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all merits and demerits, one's own as well 
as those of others, will be seen by anyone at a single glance. For things 
considered singly are not seen at one glance. Now the damned will 
consider their sins singly and will bewail them, wherefore they say (Wis. 
5:8): "What hath pride profited us?" Therefore they will not see them all 
at a glance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Topic. ii) that "we do not arrive 
at understanding several things at the same time." Now merits and 
demerits, both our own and those of others, will not be visible save to 
the intellect. Therefore it will be impossible for them all to be seen at 
the same time. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect of the damned after the resurrection will 
not be clearer than the intellect of the blessed and of the angels is 
now, as to the natural knowledge whereby they know things by innate 
species. Now by such knowledge the angels do not see several things at 
the same time. Therefore neither will the damned be able then to see all 
their deeds at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Job 8:22, "They . . . shall be clothed with 
confusion," says: "As soon as they shall see the Judge, all their evil 
deeds will stand before their eyes." Now they will see the Judge 
suddenly. Therefore in like manner will they see the evil they have done, 
and for the same reason all others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx) considers it unfitting that at the 
judgment a material book should be read containing the deeds of each 
individual written therein, for the reason that it would be impossible to 
measure the size of such a book, or the time it would take to read. But 
in like manner it would be impossible to estimate the length of time one 
would require in order to consider all one's merits and demerits and 
those of others, if one saw these various things one after the other. 
Therefore we must admit that each one sees them all at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[87] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two opinions on this question. For some say 
that one will see all merits and demerits, both one's own and those of 
others, at the same time in an instant. This is easily credible with 
regard to the blessed, since they will see all things in the Word: and 
consequently it is not unreasonable that they should see several things 
at the same time. But with regard to the damned, a difficulty presents 
itself, since their intellect is not raised so that they can see God and 
all else in Him. Wherefore others say that the wicked will see all their 
sins and those of others generically at the same time: and this suffices 
for the accusation or absolution necessary for the judgment; but that 
they will not see them all down to each single one at the same time. But 
neither does this seem consonant with the words of Augustine (De Civ. Dei 
xx), who says that they will count them all with one glance of the mind; 
and what is known generically is not counted. Hence we may choose a 
middle way, by holding that they will consider each sin not 
instantaneously, but in a very short time, the Divine power coming to 
their aid. This agrees with the saying of Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx) that 
"they will be discerned with wondrous rapidity." Nor is this impossible, 
since in a space of time, however short, is potentially an infinite 
number of instants. This suffices for the replies to the objections on 
either side of the question.<br>
