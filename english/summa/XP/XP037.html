    OF THE DISTINCTION OF ORDERS, OF THEIR ACTS, AND THE IMPRINTING OF THE
    CHARACTER (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider the distinction of the orders and their
    acts, and the imprinting of the character. Under this head there are five
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Order should be divided
    into several kinds?
  </p>
  <p><a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A2THEP1">(2)</a> How many are there?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they ought to be divided
    into those that are sacred and those that are not?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the acts of the Orders are
    rightly assigned in the text?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A5THEP1">(5)</a> When are the characters of the
    Orders imprinted?

  <h3 align="left">Whether we ought to distinguish several Orders?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to distinguish
    several Orders. For the greater a power is, the less is it multiplied. Now
    this sacrament ranks above the others in so far as it places its recipients
    in a degree above other persons. Since then the other sacraments are not
    divided into several of which the whole is predicated, neither ought this
    sacrament to be divided into several Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it be divided, the parts of the
    division are either integral or subjective. But they are not integral, for
    then the whole would not be predicated of them. Therefore it is a division
    into subjective parts. Now subjective parts can have the remote genus
    predicated of them in the plural in the same way as the proximate genus;
    thus man and ass are several animals, and are several animated bodies.
    Therefore also priesthood and diaconate, as they are several Orders, even so
    are several sacraments, since sacrament is the genus, so to speak, in
    respect of Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    viii, 10) the form of authority in which one alone governs is a better
    government of the common weal than aristocracy, where different persons
    occupy different offices. But the government of the Church should be the
    best of all. Therefore in the Church there should be no distinction of
    Orders for different acts, but the whole power should reside in one person;
    and consequently there ought to be only one Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Church is Christ's mystical body, like to
    our natural body, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A5;+1+Cor++12:12,27;+Eph++1:22,23;+Col++1:24"
      >Rm. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12,27; Eph. 1:22,23; Col. 1:24</a
    >). Now in the natural body there are various offices of the members.
    Therefore in the Church also there should be various Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the ministry of the New Testament is superior to that of the Old
    Testament (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3"
      >2 Cor. 3</a
    >). Now in the Old Testament not only the priests, but also their ministers,
    the Levites, were consecrated. Therefore likewise in the New Testament not
    only the priests but also their ministers should be consecrated by the
    sacrament of Order; and consequently there ought to be several Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Multiplicity of Orders was introduced into the
    Church for three reasons. First to show forth the wisdom of God, which is
    reflected in the orderly distinction of things both natural and spiritual.
    This is signified in the statement of 3 Kgs. 10:4,[5] that "when the queen
    of Saba saw... the order of" Solomon's "servants... she had no longer any
    spirit in her," for she was breathless from admiration of his wisdom.
    Secondly, in order to succor human weakness, because it would be impossible
    for one man, without his being heavily burdened, to fulfill all things
    pertaining to the Divine mysteries; and so various orders are severally
    appointed to the various offices; and this is shown by the Lord giving Moses
    seventy ancients to assist him. Thirdly, that men may be given a broader way
    for advancing (to perfection), seeing that the various duties are divided
    among many men, so that all become the co-operators of God; than which
    nothing is more God-like, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The other sacraments are given that
    certain effects may be received; but this sacrament is given chiefly that
    certain acts may be performed. Hence it behooves the sacrament of Order to
    be differentiated according to the diversity of acts, even as powers are
    differentiated by their acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The division of Order is not that of an
    integral whole into its parts, nor of a universal whole, but of a potential
    whole, the nature of which is that the notion of the whole is found to be
    complete in one part, but in the others by some participation thereof. Thus
    it is here: for the entire fulness of the sacrament is in one Order, namely
    the priesthood, while in the other sacraments there is a participation of
    Order. And this is signified by the Lord saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++11%3A17"
      >Num. 11:17</a
    >): "I will take of thy spirit and give to them, that they may bear with
    thee the burden of the people." Therefore all the Orders are one
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In a kingdom, although the entire
    fulness of power resides in the king, this does not exclude the ministers
    having a power which is a participation of the kingly power. It is the same
    in Order. In the aristocratic form of government, on the contrary, the
    fulness of power resides in no one, but in all.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there are seven Orders?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not seven Orders.
    For the Orders of the Church are directed to the hierarchical acts. But
    there are only three hierarchical acts, namely "to cleanse, to enlighten,
    and to perfect," for which reason Dionysius distinguishes three Orders
    (Eccl. Hier. v). Therefore there are not seven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the sacraments derive their efficacy
    and authenticity from their institution by Christ, or at least by His
    apostles. But no mention except of priests and deacons is made in the
    teaching of Christ and His apostles. Therefore seemingly there are no other
    Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by the sacrament of Order a man is
    appointed to dispense the other sacraments. But there are only six other
    sacraments. Therefore there should be only six Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the other hand, It would seem that there ought
    to be more. For the higher a power is, the less is it subject to
    multiplication. Now the hierarchical power is in the angels in a higher way
    than in us, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. i). Since then there are nine
    Orders in the angelic hierarchy, there should be as many, or more, in the
    Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the prophecy of the Psalms is the most
    noble of all the prophecies. Now there is one Order, namely of readers, for
    reading the other prophecies in the Church. Therefore there ought to be
    another Order for reading the Psalms, especially since (Decretals, Dist.
    xxi, cap. Cleros) the "psalmist" is reckoned as the second Order after the
    doorkeeper.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some show the sufficiency of the orders from
    their correspondence with the gratuitous graces which are indicated 1 Cor.
    12. For they say that the "word of wisdom" belongs to the bishop, because he
    is the ordainer of others, which pertains to wisdom; the "word of knowledge"
    to the priest, for he ought to have the key of knowledge; "faith" to the
    deacon, for he preaches the Gospel; the "working of miracles" to the
    subdeacon, who sets himself to do deeds of perfection by the vow of
    continency; "interpretation of speeches" to the acolyte, this being
    signified by the light which he bears; the "grace of healing" to the
    exorcist; "diverse kinds of tongues" to the psalmist; "prophecy" to the
    reader; and the "discerning of spirits" to the doorkeeper, for he excludes
    some and admits others. But this is of no account, for the gratuitous graces
    are not given, as the Orders are, to one same man. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 12:4</a
    >): "There are distributions [Douay: 'diversities'] of graces." Moreover the
    episcopate [*Cf. Question [40], Article [5]] and the office of psalmist are
    included, which are not Orders. Wherefore others account for the Orders by
    likening them to the heavenly hierarchy, where the Orders are distinguished
    in reference to cleansing, enlightening, and perfecting. Thus they say that
    the doorkeeper cleanses outwardly, by separating even in the body the good
    from the wicked; that the acolyte cleanses inwardly, because by the light
    which he bears, he signifies that he dispels inward darkness; and that the
    exorcist cleanses both ways, for he casts out the devil who disturbs a man
    both ways. But enlightening, which is effected by teaching, is done by
    readers as regards prophetic doctrine; by subdeacons as to apostolic
    doctrine; and by deacons as to the gospel doctrine; while ordinary
    perfection, such as the perfection of Penance, Baptism, and so forth is the
    work of the priest; excellent perfection, such as the consecration of
    priests and virgins, is the work of the bishop; while the most excellent
    perfection is the work of the Sovereign Pontiff in whom resides the fulness
    of authority. But this again is of no account; both because the orders of
    the heavenly hierarchy are not distinguished by the aforesaid hierarchical
    actions, since each of them is applicable to every Order; and because,
    according to Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. v), perfecting belongs to the bishops
    alone, enlightening to the priests, and cleansing to all the ministers.
    Wherefore others suit the orders to the seven gifts, so that the priesthood
    corresponds to the gift of wisdom, which feeds us with the bread of life and
    understanding, even as the priest refreshes us with the heavenly bread; fear
    to the doorkeeper, for he separates us from the wicked; and thus the
    intermediate Orders to the intermediate gifts. But this again is of no
    account, since the sevenfold grace is given in each one of the Orders.
    Consequently we must answer differently by saying that the sacrament of
    Order is directed to the sacrament of the Eucharist, which is the sacrament
    of sacraments, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii). For just as temple,
    altar, vessels, and vestments need to be consecrated, so do the ministers
    who are ordained for the Eucharist; and this consecration is the sacrament
    of Order. Hence the distinction of Orders is derived from their relation to
    the Eucharist. For the power of Order is directed either to the consecration
    of the Eucharist itself, or to some ministry in connection with this
    sacrament of the Eucharist. If in the former way, then it is the Order of
    priests; hence when they are ordained, they receive the chalice with wine,
    and the paten with the bread, because they are receiving the power to
    consecrate the body and blood of Christ. The co-operation of the ministers
    is directed either to the sacrament itself, or to the recipients. If the
    former, this happens in three ways. For in the first place, there is the
    ministry whereby the minister co-operates with the priest in the sacrament
    itself, by dispensing, but not by consecrating, for this is done by the
    priest alone; and this belongs to the deacon. Hence in the text (Sent. iv,
    D, 24) it is said that it belongs to the deacon to minister to the priests
    in whatever is done in Christ's sacraments, wherefore he dispenses Christ's
    blood. Secondly, there is the ministry directed to the disposal of the
    sacramental matter in the sacred vessels of the sacrament. and this belongs
    to subdeacons. Wherefore it is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) that
    they carry the vessels of our Lord's body and blood, and place the oblation
    on the altar; hence, when they are ordained, they receive the chalice, empty
    however, from the bishop's hands. Thirdly, there is the ministry directed to
    the proffering of the sacramental matter, and this belongs to the acolyte.
    For he, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24), prepares the cruet with
    wine and water; wherefore he receives an empty cruet. The ministry directed
    to the preparation of the recipients can be exercised only over the unclean,
    since those who are clean are already apt for receiving the sacraments. Now
    the unclean are of three kinds, according to Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. iii).
    For some are absolute unbelievers and unwilling to believe; and these must
    be altogether debarred from beholding Divine things and from the assembly of
    the faithful; this belongs to the doorkeepers. Some, however, are willing to
    believe, but are not as yet instructed, namely catechumens, and to the
    instruction of such persons the Order of readers is directed, who are
    therefore entrusted with the reading of the first rudiments of the doctrine
    of faith, namely the Old Testament. But some are believers and instructed,
    yet lie under an impediment through the power of the devil, namely those who
    are possessed: and to this ministry the order of exorcists is directed. Thus
    the reason and number of the degrees of Orders is made clear.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius is speaking of the orders not
    as sacraments, but as directed to hierarchical actions. Wherefore he
    distinguishes three Orders corresponding to those actions. The first of
    these Orders, namely the bishop, has all three actions; the second, namely
    the priest, has two; while the third has one, namely to cleanse; this is the
    deacon who is called a minister: and under this last all the lower Orders
    are comprised. But the Orders derive their sacramental nature from their
    relation to the greatest of the sacraments, and consequently the number of
    Orders depends on this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the early Church, on account of the
    fewness of ministers, all the lower ministries were entrusted to the
    deacons, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), where he says: "Some of the
    ministers stand at the closed door of the Church, others are otherwise
    occupied in the exercise of their own order; others place the sacred bread
    and the chalice of benediction on the altar and offer them to the priests."
    Nevertheless all the power to do all these things was included in the one
    power of the deacon, though implicitly. But afterwards the Divine worship
    developed, and the Church committed expressly to several persons that which
    had hitherto been committed implicitly in one Order. This is what the Master
    means, when He says in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24) that the Church instituted
    other Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The orders are directed to the sacrament
    of the Eucharist chiefly, and to the other sacraments consequently, for even
    the other sacraments flow from that which is contained in that sacrament.
    Hence it does not follow that the orders ought to be distinguished according
    to the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The angels differ specifically [*Cf. FP,
    Question [50], Article [4]]: for this reason it is possible for them to have
    various modes of receiving Divine things, and hence also they are divided
    into various hierarchies. But in men there is only one hierarchy, because
    they have only one mode of receiving Divine things, which results from the
    human species, namely through the images of sensible objects. Consequently
    the distinction of orders in the angels cannot bear any relation to a
    sacrament as it is with us, but only a relation to the hierarchical actions
    which among them each Order exercises on the Orders below. In this respect
    our Orders correspond to theirs; since in our hierarchy there are three
    Orders, distinguished according to the three hierarchical actions, even as
    in each angelic hierarchy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The office of psalmist is not an Order,
    but an office annexed to an Order. For the psalmist is also styled precentor
    because the psalms are recited with chant. Now precentor is not the name of
    a special Order, both because it belongs to the whole choir to sing, and
    because he has no special relation to the sacrament of the Eucharist. Since,
    however, it is a particular office, it is sometimes reckoned among the
    Orders, taking these in a broad sense.<br />

    Whether the Order should be divided into those that are sacred and those

  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Orders ought not to be
    divided into those that are sacred and those that are not. For all the
    Orders are sacraments, and all the sacraments are sacred. Therefore all the
    Orders are sacred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by the Orders of the Church a man is not
    appointed to any other than Divine offices. Now all these are sacred.
    Therefore all the Orders also are sacred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The sacred Orders are an impediment to the
    contracting of marriage and annul the marriage that is already contracted.
    But the four lower orders neither impede the contracting nor annul the
    contract. Therefore these are not sacred Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An Order is said to be sacred in two ways.
    First, in itself, and thus every order is sacred, since it is a sacrament.
    Secondly, by reason of the matter about which it exercises an act, and thus
    an Order is called sacred, if it exercises an act about some consecrated
    thing. In this sense there are only three sacred Orders, namely the
    priesthood and diaconate, which exercise an act about the consecrated body
    and blood of Christ, and the subdiaconate, which exercises an act about the
    consecrated vessels. Wherefore continency is enjoined them, that they who
    handle holy things may themselves be holy and clean.<br />

    Whether the acts of the Orders are rightly assigned in the text?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the acts of the Orders are not
    rightly assigned in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Because a person is prepared
    by absolution to receive Christ's body. Now the preparation of the
    recipients of a sacrament belongs to the lower Orders. Therefore absolution
    from sins is unfittingly reckoned among the acts of a priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man is made like to God immediately in
    Baptism, by receiving the character which causes this likeness. But prayer
    and the offering of oblations are acts directed immediately to God.
    Therefore every baptized person can perform these acts, and not priests
    alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different Orders have different acts.
    But it belongs to the subdeacon to place the oblations on the altar, and to
    read the epistle; and subdeacons carry the cross before the Pope. Therefore
    these acts should not be assigned to the deacon.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the same truth is contained in the Old
    and in the New Testament. But it belongs to the readers to read the Old
    Testament. Therefore it should belong to them likewise, and not to deacons,
    to read the New Testament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the apostles preached naught else but
    the gospel of Christ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A15"
      >Rm. 1:15</a
    >). But the teaching of the apostles is entrusted to subdeacons to be read
    by them. Therefore the Gospel teaching should be also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, according to Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. v)
    that which belongs to a higher Order should not be applicable to a lower
    Order. But it is an act of subdeacons to minister with the cruets. Therefore
    it should not be assigned to acolytes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, spiritual actions should rank above
    bodily actions. But the acolyte's act is merely corporeal. Therefore the
    exorcist has not the spiritual act of casting out devils, since he is of
    inferior rank.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, things that have most in common should
    be placed beside one another. Now the reading of the Old Testament must
    needs have most in common with the reading of the New Testament, which
    latter belongs to the higher ministers. Therefore the reading of the Old
    Testament should be reckoned the act, not of the reader, but rather of the
    acolyte; especially since the bodily light which the acolytes carry
    signifies the light of spiritual doctrine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, in every act of a special Order, there
    should be some special power, which the person ordained has to the exclusion
    of other persons. But in opening and shutting doors the doorkeeper has no
    special power that other men have not. Therefore this should not be reckoned
    their act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the consecration conferred in the
    sacrament of orders is directed to the sacrament of the Eucharist, as stated
    above (<a href="XP037.html#XPQ37A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the principal act
    of each order is that whereby it is most nearly directed to the sacrament of
    the Eucharist. In this respect, too, one order ranks above another, in so
    far as one act is more nearly directed to that same sacrament. But because
    many things are directed to the Eucharist, as being the most exalted of the
    sacraments, it follows not unfittingly that one Order has many acts besides
    its principal act, and all the more, as it ranks higher, since a power
    extends to the more things, the higher it is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The preparation of the recipients of a
    sacrament is twofold. One is remote and is effected by the ministers:
    another is proximate, whereby they are rendered apt at once for receiving
    the sacraments. This latter belongs to priests, since even in natural things
    matter receives from one and the same agent both the ultimate disposition to
    the form, and the form itself. And since a person acquires the proximate
    disposition to the Eucharist by being cleansed from sin, it follows that the
    priest is the proper minister of all those sacraments which are chiefly
    instituted for the cleansing of sins, namely Baptism, Penance, and Extreme
    Unction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Acts are directed immediately to God in
    two ways; in one way on the part of one person only, for instance the
    prayers of individuals, vows, and so forth: such acts befit any baptized
    person. In another way on the part of the whole Church, and thus the priest
    alone exercises acts immediately directed to God; because to impersonate the
    whole Church belongs to him alone who consecrates the Eucharist, which is
    the sacrament of the universal Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The offerings made by the people are
    offered through the priest. Hence a twofold ministry is necessary with
    regard to offerings. One on the part of the people: and this belongs to the
    subdeacon who receives the offerings from the people and places them on the
    altar or offers them to the deacon. the other is on the part of the priest,
    and belongs to the deacon, who hands the offerings to the priest. This is
    the principal act of both Orders, and for this reason the deacon's Order is
    the higher. But to read the epistle does not belong to a deacon, except as
    the acts of lower Orders are ascribed to the higher; and in like manner to
    carry the cross. Moreover, this depends on the customs of Churches, because
    in secondary acts it is not unfitting for customs to vary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Doctrine is a remote preparation for the
    reception of a sacrament; wherefore the announcement of doctrine is
    entrusted to the ministers. But the doctrine of the Old Testament is more
    remote than that of the New Testament, since it contains no instruction
    about this sacrament except in figures. Hence announcing of the New
    Testament is entrusted to the higher ministers, and that of the Old
    Testament to the lower ministers. Moreover the doctrine of the New Testament
    is more perfect as delivered by our Lord Himself, than as made known by His
    apostles. Wherefore the Gospel is committed to deacons and the Epistle to
    subdeacons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Fifth Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Acolytes exercise an act over the cruet
    alone, and not over the contents of the cruet; whereas the subdeacon
    exercises an act over the contents of the cruet, because he handles the
    water and wine to the end that they be put into the chalice,* and again he
    pours the water over the hands of the priest; and the deacon, like the
    subdeacon, exercises an act over the chalice only, not over its contents,
    whereas the priest exercises an act over the contents. [*The wording of St.
    Thomas is sufficiently vague to refer either to the Roman rite, where the
    priest pours the wine and water into the chalice, or to the Dominican rite,
    where this is done by the subdeacon.] Wherefore as the subdeacon at his
    ordination receives an empty chalice, while the priest receives a full
    chalice, so the acolyte receives an empty cruet, but the subdeacon a full
    one. Thus there is a certain connection among the Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The bodily acts of the acolyte are more
    intimately connected with the act of Holy orders than the act of the
    exorcist, although the latter is, in a fashion, spiritual. For the acolytes
    exercise a ministry over the vessels in which the sacramental matter is
    contained, as regards the wine, which needs a vessel to hold it on account
    of its humidity. Hence of all the minor orders the Order of acolytes is the
    highest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> The act of the acolyte is more closely
    connected with the principal acts of the higher ministers, than the acts of
    the other minor Orders, as is self-evident; and again as regards the
    secondary acts whereby they prepare the people by doctrine. For the acolyte
    by bearing a light represents the doctrine of the New Testament in a visible
    manner, while the reader by his recital represents it differently, wherefore
    the acolyte is of higher rank. It is the same with the exorcist, for as the
    act of the reader is compared with the secondary act of the deacon and
    subdeacon, so is the act of the exorcist compared with the secondary act of
    the priest, namely to bind and to loose, by which man is wholly freed from
    the slavery of the devil. This, too, shows the degrees of Order to be most
    orderly. since only the three higher Orders co-operate with the priest in
    his principal act which is to consecrate the body of Christ, while both the
    higher and lower Orders co-operate with him in his secondary act, which is
    to loose and bind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> Some say that in receiving the Order the
    doorkeeper is given a Divine power to debar others from entering the Church,
    even as Christ had, when He cast out the sellers from the Temple. But this
    belongs to a gratuitous grace rather than to a sacramental grace. Wherefore
    we should reply that he receives the power to do this by virtue of his
    office, although others may do so, but not officially. It is the case in all
    the acts of the minor Orders, that they can be lawfully exercised by others,
    even though these have no office to that effect: just as Mass may be said in
    an unconsecrated building, although the consecration of a church is directed
    to the purpose that Mass be said there.<br />

    Whether the character is imprinted on a priest when the chalice is handed to
    him?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the character is not imprinted
    on the priest at the moment when the chalice is handed to him. For the
    consecration of a priest is done by anointing as in Confirmation. Now in
    Confirmation the character is imprinted at the moment of anointing; and
    therefore in the priesthood also and not at the handing of the chalice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord gave His disciples the priestly
    power when He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A22,23"
      >Jn. 20:22,23</a
    >): "Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you shall forgive," etc. Now the
    Holy Ghost is given by the imposition of hands. Therefore the character of
    order is given at the moment of the imposition of hands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the ministers are consecrated, even
    so are the ministers' vestments. Now the blessing alone consecrates the
    vestments. Therefore the consecration of the priest also is effected by the
    mere blessing of the bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as a chalice is handed to the priest,
    even so is the priestly vestment. Therefore if a character is imprinted at
    the giving of the chalice, so likewise is there at the giving of the
    chasuble, and thus a priest would have two characters: but this is false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the deacon's order is more closely
    allied to the priest's Order than is the subdeacon's. But if a character is
    imprinted on the priest at the moment of the handing of the chalice, the
    subdeacon would be more closely allied to the priest than the deacon;
    because the subdeacon receives the character at the handing of the chalice
    and not the deacon. Therefore the priestly character is not imprinted at the
    handing of the chalice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the Order of acolytes approaches nearer
    to the priestly act by exercising an act over the cruet than by exercising
    an act over the torch. Yet the character is imprinted on the acolytes when
    they receive the torch rather than when they receive the cruet, because the
    name of acolyte signifies candle-bearer. Therefore the character is not
    imprinted on the priest when he receives the chalice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The principal act of the priest's Order is to
    consecrate Christ's body. Now he receives the power to this effect at the
    handing of the chalice. Therefore the character is imprinted on him then.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP037.html#XPQ37A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 1), to cause the form and to give the matter its proximate preparation
    for the form belong to the same agent. Wherefore the bishop in conferring
    orders does two things; for he prepares the candidates for the reception of
    orders, and delivers to them the power of order. He prepares them, both by
    instructing them in their respective offices and by doing something to them,
    so that they may be adapted to receive the power. This preparation consists
    of three things, namely blessing, imposition of hands, and anointing. By the
    blessing they are enlisted in the Divine service, wherefore the blessing is
    given to all. By the imposition of hands the fulness of grace is given,
    whereby they are qualified for exalted duties, wherefore only deacons and
    priests receive the imposition of hands, because they are competent to
    dispense the sacraments, although the latter as principal dispensers, the
    former as ministers. But by the anointing they are consecrated for the
    purpose of handling the sacrament, wherefore the anointing is done to the
    priests alone who touch the body of Christ with their own hands; even as a
    chalice is anointed because it holds the blood, and the paten because it
    holds the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The conferring of power is effected by giving them something pertaining to
    their proper act. And since the principal act of a priest is to consecrate
    the body and blood of Christ, the priestly character is imprinted at the
    very giving of the chalice under the prescribed form of words.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In Confirmation there is not given the
    office of exercising an act on an exterior matter, wherefore the character
    is not imprinted in that sacrament at the handing of some particular thing,
    but at the mere imposition of hands and anointing. But it is otherwise in
    the priestly Order, and consequently the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord gave His disciples the priestly
    power, as regards the principal act, before His passion at the supper when
    He said: "Take ye and eat" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A26"
      >Mt. 26:26</a
    >), wherefore He added: "Do this for a commemoration of Me" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A19"
      >Lk. 22:19</a
    >). After the resurrection, however, He gave them the priestly power, as to
    its secondary act, which is to bind and loose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Vestments require no other consecration
    except to be set aside for the Divine worship, wherefore the blessing
    suffices for their consecration. But it is different with those who are
    ordained, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The priestly vestment signifies, not the
    power given to the priest, but the aptitude required of him for exercising
    the act of that power. Wherefore a character is imprinted neither on the
    priest nor on anyone else at the giving of a vestment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The deacon's power is midway between the
    subdeacon's and the priest's. For the priest exercises a power directly on
    Christ's body, the subdeacon on the vessels only, and the deacon on Christ's
    body contained in a vessel. Hence it is not for him to touch Christ's body,
    but to carry the body on the paten, and to dispense the blood with the
    chalice. Consequently his power, as to the principal act, could not be
    expressed, either by the giving of the vessel only, or by the giving of the
    matter; and his power is expressed as to the secondary act alone, by his
    receiving the book of the Gospels, and this power is understood to contain
    the other; wherefore the character is impressed at the handing of the
    book.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The act of the acolyte whereby he serves
    with the cruet ranks before his act of carrying the torch; although he takes
    his name from the secondary act, because it is better known and more proper
    to him. Hence the acolyte receives the character when he is given the cruet,
    by virtue of the words uttered by the bishop.<br />
