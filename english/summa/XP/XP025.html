  <h3 align="center">OF INDULGENCES (THREE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider indulgence: (1) in itself; (2) those who grant
    indulgence; (3) those who receive it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP025.html#XPQ25A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether an indulgence remits any
    part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of sins?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP025.html#XPQ25A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether indulgences are as
    effective as they claim to be?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP025.html#XPQ25A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether an indulgence should be
    granted for temporal assistance?

    Whether an indulgence can remit any part of the punishment due for the
    satisfaction of sins?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an indulgence cannot remit any
    part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of sins. Because a gloss on
    2 Tim. 2:13, "He cannot deny Himself," says: "He would do this if He did not
    keep His word." Now He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++25%3A2"
      >Dt. 25:2</a
    >): "According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the
    stripes be." Therefore nothing can be remitted from the satisfactory
    punishment which is appointed according to the measure of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an inferior cannot absolve from an
    obligation imposed by his superior. But when God absolves us from sin He
    binds us to temporal punishment, as Hugh of St. Victor declares (Tract. vi
    Sum. Sent. [*Of doubtful authenticity]). Therefore no man can absolve from
    that punishment, by remitting any part of it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the granting of the sacramental effect
    without the sacraments belongs to the power of excellence. Now none but
    Christ has the power of excellence in the sacraments. Since then
    satisfaction is a part of the sacrament of Penance, conducing to the
    remission of the punishment due, it seems that no mere man can remit the
    debt of punishment without satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the power of the ministers of the Church
    was given them, not "unto destruction," but "unto edification" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++10%3A8"
      >2 Cor. 10:8</a
    >). But it would be conducive to destruction, if satisfaction, which was
    intended for our good, inasmuch as it serves for a remedy, were done away
    with. Therefore the power of the ministers of the Church does not extend to
    this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++2%3A10"
      >2 Cor. 2:10</a
    >): "For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes
    have I done it in the person of Christ," and a gloss adds: i.e. "as though
    Christ Himself had pardoned." But Christ could remit the punishment of a sin
    without any satisfaction, as evidenced in the case of the adulterous woman
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++8">Jn. 8</a>). Therefore
    Paul could do so likewise. Therefore the Pope can too, since his power in
    the Church is not less than Paul's.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the universal Church cannot err; since He Who "was heard for His
    reverence" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++5%3A7"
      >Heb. 5:7</a
    >) said to Peter, on whose profession of faith the Church was founded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A32"
      >Lk. 22:32</a
    >): "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not." Now the universal
    Church approves and grants indulgences. Therefore indulgences have some
    value.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All admit that indulgences have some value, for
    it would be blasphemy to say that the Church does anything in vain. But some
    say that they do not avail to free a man from the debt of punishment which
    he has deserved in Purgatory according to God's judgment, and that they
    merely serve to free him from the obligation imposed on him by the priest as
    a punishment for his sins, or from the canonical penalties he has incurred.
    But this opinion does not seem to be true. First, because it is expressly
    opposed to the privilege granted to Peter, to whom it was said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++16%3A19"
      >Mt. 16:19</a
    >) that whatsoever he should loose on earth should be loosed also in heaven.
    Wherefore whatever remission is granted in the court of the Church holds
    good in the court of God. Moreover the Church by granting such indulgences
    would do more harm than good, since, by remitting the punishment she had
    enjoined on a man, she would deliver him to be punished more severely in
    Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence we must say on the contrary that indulgences hold good both in the
    Church's court and in the judgment of God, for the remission of the
    punishment which remains after contrition, absolution, and confession,
    whether this punishment be enjoined or not. The reason why they so avail is
    the oneness of the mystical body in which many have performed works of
    satisfaction exceeding the requirements of their debts; in which, too, many
    have patiently borne unjust tribulations whereby a multitude of punishments
    would have been paid, had they been incurred. So great is the quantity of
    such merits that it exceeds the entire debt of punishment due to those who
    are living at this moment: and this is especially due to the merits of
    Christ: for though He acts through the sacraments, yet His efficacy is
    nowise restricted to them, but infinitely surpasses their efficacy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now one man can satisfy for another, as we have explained above (<a
      href="XP013.html#XPQ13OUTP1"
      >Question [13]</a
    >, <a href="XP013.html#XPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And the saints in
    whom this super-abundance of satisfactions is found, did not perform their
    good works for this or that particular person, who needs the remission of
    his punishment (else he would have received this remission without any
    indulgence at all), but they performed them for the whole Church in general,
    even as the Apostle declares that he fills up "those things that are wanting
    of the sufferings of Christ... for His body, which is the Church" to whom he
    wrote (Col. 1:24). These merits, then, are the common property of the whole
    Church. Now those things which are the common property of a number are
    distributed to the various individuals according to the judgment of him who
    rules them all. Hence, just as one man would obtain the remission of his
    punishment if another were to satisfy for him, so would he too if another's
    satisfactions be applied to him by one who has the power to do so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The remission which is granted by means
    of indulgences does not destroy the proportion between punishment and sin,
    since someone has spontaneously taken upon himself the punishment due for
    another's guilt, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He who gains an indulgence is not,
    strictly speaking, absolved from the debt of punishment, but is given the
    means whereby he may pay it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The effect of sacramental absolution is
    the removal of a man's guilt, an effect which is not produced by
    indulgences. But he who grants indulgences pays the debt of punishment which
    a man owes, out of the common stock of the Church's goods, as explained
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Grace affords a better remedy for the
    avoidance of sin than does habituation to (good) works. And since he who
    gains an indulgence is disposed to grace through the love which he conceives
    for the cause for which the indulgence is granted, it follows that
    indulgences provide a remedy against sin. Consequently it is not harmful to
    grant indulgences unless this be done without discretion. Nevertheless those
    who gain indulgences should be advised, not, on this account, to omit the
    penitential works imposed on them, so that they may derive a remedy from
    these also, even though they may be quit of the debt of punishment; and all
    the more, seeing that they are often more in debt than they think.<br />

    Whether indulgences are as effective as they claim to be?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that indulgences are not as
    effective as they claim to be. For indulgences have no effect save from the
    power of the keys. Now by the power of the keys, he who has that power can
    only remit some fixed part of the punishment due for sin, after taking into
    account the measure of the sin and of the penitent's sorrow. Since then
    indulgences depend on the mere will of the grantor, it seems that they are
    not as effective as they claim to be.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the debt of punishment keeps man back
    from the attainment of glory, which he ought to desire above all things.
    Now, if indulgences are as effective as they claim to be, a man by setting
    himself to gain indulgences might become immune from all debt of temporal
    punishment. Therefore it would seem that a man ought to put aside all other
    kinds of works, and devote himself to gain indulgences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sometimes an indulgence whereby a man is
    remitted a third part of the punishment due for his sins is granted if he
    contribute towards the erection of a certain building. If, therefore,
    indulgences produce the effect which is claimed for them, he who gives a
    penny, and then another, and then again another, would obtain a plenary
    absolution from all punishment due for his sins, which seems absurd.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, sometimes an indulgence is granted, so
    that for visiting a church a man obtains a seven years' remission. If, then,
    an indulgence avails as much as is claimed for it a man who lives near that
    church, or the clergy attached thereto who go there every day, obtain as
    much indulgence as one who comes from a distance (which would appear
    unjust); moreover, seemingly, they would gain the indulgence several times a
    day, since they go there repeatedly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, to remit a man's punishment beyond a
    just estimate seems to amount to the same as to remit it without reason;
    because in so far as he exceeds that estimate, he limits the compensation.
    Now he who grants an indulgence cannot without cause remit a man's
    punishment either wholly or partly, even though the Pope were to say to
    anyone: "I remit to all the punishment you owe for your sins." Therefore it
    seems that he cannot remit anything beyond the just estimate. Now
    indulgences are often published which exceed that just estimate. Therefore
    they do not avail as much as is claimed for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+13%3A7"
      >Job 13:7</a
    >): "Hath God any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for
    Him?" Therefore the Church, in publishing indulgences, does not lie; and so
    they avail as much as is claimed for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A14"
      >1 Cor. 15:14</a
    >): "If... our preaching is vain, your faith is also vain." Therefore
    whoever utters a falsehood in preaching, so far as he is concerned, makes
    faith void. and so sins mortally. If therefore indulgences are not as
    effective as they claim to be, all who publish indulgences would commit a
    mortal sin: which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> on this point there are many opinions. For some
    maintain that indulgences have not the efficacy claimed for them, but that
    they simply avail each individual in proportion to his faith and devotion.
    And consequently those who maintain this, say that the Church publishes her
    indulgences in such a way as, by a kind of pious fraud, to induce men to do
    well, just as a mother entices her child to walk by holding out an apple.
    But this seems a very dangerous assertion to make. For as Augustine states
    (Ep. ad Hieron. lxxviii), "if any error were discovered in Holy Writ, the
    authority of Holy Writ would perish." In like manner, if any error were to
    be found in the Church's preaching, her doctrine would have no authority in
    settling questions of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others have maintained that indulgences avail as much as is claimed
    for them, according to a just estimate, not of him who grants it---who
    perhaps puts too high a value on it---nor of the recipient---for he may
    prize too highly the gift he receives, but a just estimate according to the
    estimate of good men who consider the condition of the person affected, and
    the utility and needs of the Church, for the Church's needs are greater at
    one time than at another. Yet, neither, seemingly, can this opinion stand.
    First, because in that case indulgences would no longer be a remission, but
    rather a mere commutation. Moreover the preaching of the Church would not be
    excused from untruth, since, at times, indulgences are granted far in excess
    of the requirements of this just estimate, taking into consideration all the
    aforesaid conditions, as, for example, when the Pope granted to anyone who
    visited a certain church, an indulgence of seven years, which indulgence was
    granted by Blessed Gregory for the Roman Stations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others say that the quantity of remission accorded in an indulgence is
    not to be measured by the devotion of the recipient, as the first opinion
    suggested, nor according to the quantity of what is given, as the second
    opinion held; but according to the cause for which the indulgence is
    granted, and according to which a person is held deserving of obtaining such
    an indulgence. Thus according as a man approached near to that cause, so
    would he obtain remission in whole or in part. But neither will this explain
    the custom of the Church, who assigns, now a greater, now a lesser
    indulgence, for the same cause: thus, under the same circumstances, now a
    year's indulgence, now one of only forty days, according to the graciousness
    of the Pope, who grants the indulgence, is granted to those who visit a
    church. Wherefore the amount of the remission granted by the indulgence is
    not to be measured by the cause for which a person is worthy of an
    indulgence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore say otherwise that the quantity of an effect is
    proportionate to the quantity of the cause. Now the cause of the remission
    of punishment effected by indulgences is no other than the abundance of the
    Church's merits, and this abundance suffices for the remission of all
    punishment. The effective cause of the remission is not the devotion, or
    toil, or gift of the recipient; nor, again, is it the cause for which the
    indulgence was granted. We cannot, then, estimate the quantity of the
    remission by any of the foregoing, but solely by the merits of the
    Church---and these are always superabundant. Consequently, according as
    these merits are applied to a person so does he obtain remission. That they
    should be so applied demands, firstly, authority to dispense this treasure.
    secondly, union between the recipient and Him Who merited it---and this is
    brought about by charity; thirdly, there is required a reason for so
    dispensing this treasury, so that the intention, namely, of those who
    wrought these meritorious works is safeguarded, since they did them for the
    honor of God and for the good of the Church in general. Hence whenever the
    cause assigned tends to the good of the Church and the honor of God, there
    is sufficient reason for granting an indulgence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, according to others, indulgences have precisely the efficacy claimed
    for them, provided that he who grants them have the authority, that the
    recipient have charity, and that, as regards the cause, there be piety which
    includes the honor of God and the profit of our neighbor. Nor in this view
    have we "too great a market of the Divine mercy" [*St. Bonaventure, Sent.
    iv, D, 20], as some maintain, nor again does it derogate from Divine
    justice, for no punishment is remitted, but the punishment of one is imputed
    to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP019.html#XPQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="XP019.html#XPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) there are two keys,
    the key of orders and the key of jurisdiction. The key of orders is a
    sacramental: and as the effects of the sacraments are fixed, not by men but
    by God, the priest cannot decide in the tribunal of confession how much
    shall be remitted by means of the key of orders from the punishment due; it
    is God Who appoints the amount to be remitted. On the other hand the key of
    jurisdiction is not something sacramental, and its effect depends on a man's
    decision. The remission granted through indulgences is the effect of this
    key, since it does not belong to the dispensation of the sacraments, but to
    the distribution of the common property of the Church: hence it is that
    legates, even though they be not priests, can grant indulgences.
    Consequently the decision of how much punishment is to be remitted by an
    indulgence depends on the will of the one who grants that indulgence. If,
    however, he remits punishment without sufficient reason, so that men are
    enticed to substitute mere nothings, as it were, for works of penance, he
    sins by granting such indulgences, although the indulgence is gained
    fully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although indulgences avail much for the
    remission of punishment, yet works of satisfaction are more meritorious in
    respect of the essential reward, which infinitely transcends the remission
    of temporal punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When an indulgence is granted in a
    general way to anyone that helps towards the building of a church, we must
    understand this to mean a help proportionate to the giver: and in so far as
    he approaches to this, he will gain the indulgence more or less fully.
    Consequently a poor man by giving one penny would gain the full indulgence,
    not so a rich man, whom it would not become to give so little to so holy and
    profitable a work; Just as a king would not be said to help a man if he gave
    him an "obol."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A person who lives near the church, and
    the priest and clergy of the church, gain the indulgence as much as those
    who come perhaps a distance of a thousand days' journey: because the
    remission, as stated above, is proportionate, not to the toil, but to the
    merits which are applied. Yet he who toils most gains most merit. This,
    however, is to be understood of those cases in which an indulgence is given
    in an undeterminate manner. For sometimes a distinction is expressed: thus
    the Pope at the time of general absolution grants an indulgence of five
    years to those who come from across the seas, and one of three years to
    those who come from across the mountains, to others an indulgence of one
    year. Nor does a person gain the indulgence each time he visits the church
    during the term of indulgence, because sometimes it is granted for a fixed
    time; thus when it is said, "Whoever visits such and such a church until
    such and such a day, shall gain so much indulgence," we must understand that
    it can be gained only once. on the other hand if there be a continual
    indulgence in a certain church, as the indulgence of forty days to be gained
    in the church of the Blessed Peter, then a person gains the indulgence as
    often as he visits the church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> An indulgence requires a cause, not as a
    measure of the remission of punishment, but in order that the intention of
    those whose merits are applied, may reach to this particular individual. Now
    one person's good is applied to another in two ways: first, by charity; and
    in this way, even without indulgences, a person shares in all the good deeds
    done, provided he have charity: secondly, by the intention of the person who
    does the good action; and in this way, provided there be a lawful cause, the
    intention of a person who has done something for the profit of the Church,
    may reach to some individual through indulgences.<br />

    Whether an indulgence ought to be granted for temporal help?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an indulgence ought not to be
    granted for temporal help. Because the remission of sins is something
    spiritual. Now to exchange a spiritual for a temporal thing is simony.
    Therefore this ought not to be done.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, spiritual assistance is more necessary
    than temporal. But indulgences do not appear to be granted for spiritual
    assistance. Much less therefore ought they to be granted for temporal
    help.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the common custom of the Church in
    granting indulgences for pilgrimages and almsgiving.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Temporal things are subordinate to spiritual
    matters, since we must make use of temporal things on account of spiritual
    things. Consequently an indulgence must not be granted for the sake of
    temporal matters as such, but in so far as they are subordinate to spiritual
    things: such as the quelling of the Church's enemies, who disturb her peace;
    or such as the building of a church, of a bridge, and other forms of
    almsgiving. It is therefore evident that there is no simony in these
    transactions, since a spiritual thing is exchanged, not for a temporal but
    for a spiritual commodity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Indulgences can be, and sometimes are,
    granted even for purely spiritual matters. Thus Pope Innocent IV granted an
    indulgence of ten days to all who prayed for the king of France; and in like
    manner sometimes the same indulgence is granted to those who preach a
    crusade as to those who take part in it.<br />
