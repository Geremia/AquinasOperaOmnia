    Whether it is against the natural law to have several wives?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not against the natural
    law to have several wives. For custom does not prejudice the law of nature.
    But "it was not a sin" to have several wives "when this was the custom,"
    according to Augustine (De Bono Conjug. xv) as quoted in the text (Sent. iv,
    D, 33). Therefore it is not contrary to the natural law to have several
    wives.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever acts in opposition to the
    natural law, disobeys a commandment, for the law of nature has its
    commandments even as the written law has. Now Augustine says (De Bono
    Conjug. xv; De Civ. Dei xv, 38) that "it was not contrary to a commandment"
    to have several wives, "because by no law was it forbidden." Therefore it is
    not against the natural law to have several wives.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, marriage is chiefly directed to the
    begetting of offspring. But one man may get children of several women, by
    causing them to be pregnant. Therefore It is not against the natural law to
    have several wives.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "Natural right is that which nature has
    taught all animals," as stated at the beginning of the Digests (1, i, ff. De
    just. et jure). Now nature has not taught all animals that one male should
    be united to but one female, since with many animals the one male is united
    to several females. Therefore it is not against the natural law to have
    several wives.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (De Gener.
    Animal. i, 20), in the begetting of offspring the male is to the female as
    agent to patient, and as the craftsman is to his material. But it is not
    against the order of nature for one agent to act on several patients, or for
    one craftsman to work in several materials. Therefore neither is it contrary
    to the law of nature for one husband to have many wives.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> On the contrary, That which was instilled into
    man at the formation of human nature would seem especially to belong to the
    natural law. Now it was instilled into him at the very formation of human
    nature that one man should have one wife, according to Gn. 2:24, "They shall
    be two in one flesh." Therefore it is of natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, it is contrary to the law of nature that
    man should bind himself to the impossible, and that what is given to one
    should be given to another. Now when a man contracts with a wife, he gives
    her the power of his body, so that he is bound to pay her the debt when she
    asks. Therefore it is against the law of nature that he should afterwards
    give the power of his body to another, because it would be impossible for
    him to pay both were both to ask at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, "Do not to another what thou wouldst not
    were done to thyself" [*Cf. Tobias 4:16] is a precept of the natural law.
    But a husband would by no means be willing for his wife to have another
    husband. Therefore he would be acting against the law of nature, were he to
    have another wife in addition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, whatever is against the natural desire
    is contrary to the natural law. Now a husband's jealousy of his wife and the
    wife's jealousy of her husband are natural, for they are found in all.
    Therefore, since jealousy is "love impatient of sharing the beloved," it
    would seem to be contrary to the natural law that several wives should share
    one husband.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All natural things are imbued with certain
    principles whereby they are enabled not only to exercise their proper
    actions, but also to render those actions proportionate to their end,
    whether such actions belong to a thing by virtue of its generic nature, or
    by virtue of its specific nature: thus it belongs to a magnet to be borne
    downwards by virtue of its generic nature, and to attract iron by virtue of
    its specific nature. Now just as in those things which act from natural
    necessity the principle of action is the form itself, whence their proper
    actions proceed proportionately to their end, so in things which are endowed
    with knowledge the principles of action are knowledge and appetite. Hence in
    the cognitive power there needs to be a natural concept, and in the
    appetitive power a natural inclination, whereby the action befitting the
    genus or species is rendered proportionate to the end. Now since man, of all
    animals, knows the aspect of the end, and the proportion of the action to
    the end, it follows that he is imbued with a natural concept, whereby he is
    directed to act in a befitting manner, and this is called "the natural law"
    or "the natural right," but in other animals "the natural instinct." For
    brutes are rather impelled by the force of nature to do befitting actions,
    than guided to act on their own judgment. Therefore the natural law is
    nothing else than a concept naturally instilled into man, whereby he is
    guided to act in a befitting manner in his proper actions, whether they are
    competent to him by virtue of his generic nature, as, for instance, to
    beget, to eat, and so on, or belong to him by virtue of his specific nature,
    as, for instance, to reason and so forth. Now whatever renders an action
    improportionate to the end which nature intends to obtain by a certain work
    is said to be contrary to the natural law. But an action may be
    improportionate either to the principal or to the secondary end, and in
    either case this happens in two ways. First, on account of something which
    wholly hinders the end; for instance a very great excess or a very great
    deficiency in eating hinders both the health of the body, which is the
    principal end of food, and aptitude for conducting business, which is its
    secondary end. Secondly, on account of something that renders the attainment
    of the principal or secondary end difficult, or less satisfactory, for
    instance eating inordinately in respect of undue time. Accordingly if an
    action be improportionate to the end, through altogether hindering the
    principal end directly, it is forbidden by the first precepts of the natural
    law, which hold the same place in practical matters, as the general concepts
    of the mind in speculative matters. If, however, it be in any way
    improportionate to the secondary end, or again to the principal end, as
    rendering its attainment difficult or less satisfactory, it is forbidden,
    not indeed by the first precepts of the natural law, but by the second which
    are derived from the first even as conclusions in speculative matters
    receive our assent by virtue of self-known principles: and thus the act in
    question is said to be against the law of nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now marriage has for its principal end the begetting and rearing of
    children, and this end is competent to man according to his generic nature,
    wherefore it is common to other animals (Ethic. viii, 12), and thus it is
    that the "offspring" is assigned as a marriage good. But for its secondary
    end, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 12), it has, among men alone, the
    community of works that are a necessity of life, as stated above (<a
      href="XP041.html#XPQ41OUTP1"
      >Question [41]</a
    >, <a href="XP041.html#XPQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And in reference to
    this they owe one another "fidelity" which is one of the goods of marriage.
    Furthermore it has another end, as regards marriage between believers,
    namely the signification of Christ and the Church: and thus the "sacrament"
    is said to be a marriage good. Wherefore the first end corresponds to the
    marriage of man inasmuch as he is an animal: the second, inasmuch as he is a
    man; the third, inasmuch as he is a believer. Accordingly plurality of wives
    neither wholly destroys nor in any way hinders the first end of marriage,
    since one man is sufficient to get children of several wives, and to rear
    the children born of them. But though it does not wholly destroy the second
    end, it hinders it considerably for there cannot easily be peace in a family
    where several wives are joined to one husband, since one husband cannot
    suffice to satisfy the requisitions of several wives, and again because the
    sharing of several in one occupation is a cause of strife: thus "potters
    quarrel with one another" [*Aristotle, Rhet. ii, 4], and in like manner the
    several wives of one husband. The third end, it removes altogether, because
    as Christ is one, so also is the Church one. It is therefore evident from
    what has been said that plurality of wives is in a way against the law of
    nature, and in a way not against it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Custom does not prejudice the law of
    nature as regards the first precepts of the latter, which are like the
    general concepts of the mind in speculative matters. But those which are
    drawn like conclusions from these custom enforces, as Tully declares (De
    Inv. Rhet. ii), or weakens. Such is the precept of nature in the matter of
    having one wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Tully says (De Inv. Rhet. ii), "fear
    of the law and religion have sanctioned those things that come from nature
    and are approved by custom." Wherefore it is evident that those dictates of
    the natural law, which are derived from the first principles as it were of
    the natural law, have not the binding force of an absolute commandment,
    except when they have been sanctioned by Divine or human law. This is what
    Augustine means by saying that "they did not disobey the commandments of the
    law, since it was not forbidden by any law."<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Reply to the Third Objection follows from what has been said.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Natural right has several
    significations. First a right is said to be natural by its principle,
    because it is instilled by nature: and thus Tully defines it (De Inv. Rhet.
    ii) when he says: "Natural right is not the result of opinion but the
    product of an innate force." And since even in natural things certain
    movements are called natural, not that they be from an intrinsic principle,
    but because they are from a higher moving principle---thus the movements
    that are caused in the elements by the impress of heavenly bodies are said
    to be natural, as the Commentator states (De Coelo et Mundo iii, 28),
    therefore those things that are of Divine right are said to be of natural
    right, because they are caused by the impress and influence of a higher
    principle, namely God. Isidore takes it in this sense, when he says (Etym.
    v) that "the natural right is that which is contained in the Law and the
    Gospel." Thirdly, right is said to be natural not only from its principle
    but also from its matter, because it is about natural things. And since
    nature is contradistinguished with reason, whereby man is a man, it follows
    that if we take natural right in its strictest sense, those things which are
    dictated by natural reason and pertain to man alone are not said to be of
    natural right, but only those which are dictated by natural reason and are
    common to man and other animals. Thus we have the aforesaid definition,
    namely: "Natural right is what nature has taught all animals." Accordingly
    plurality of wives, though not contrary to natural right taken in the third
    sense, is nevertheless against natural right taken in the second sense,
    because it is forbidden by the Divine law. It is also against natural right
    taken in the first sense, as appears from what has been said, for such is
    nature's dictate to every animal according to the mode befitting its nature.
    Wherefore also certain animals, the rearing of whose offspring demands the
    care of both, namely the male and female, by natural instinct cling to the
    union of one with one, for instance the turtle-dove, the dove, and so
    forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Reply to the Fifth Objection is clear from what has been said.</p>
  <p>
    Since, however, the arguments adduced "on the contrary side" would seem to
    show that plurality of wives is against the first principles of the natural
    law, we must reply to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we reply to the Sixth Objection that human nature was founded
    without any defect, and consequently it is endowed not only with those
    things without which the principal end of marriage is impossible of
    attainment, but also with those without which the secondary end of marriage
    could not be obtained without difficulty: and in this way it sufficed man
    when he was first formed to have one wife, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> In marriage the husband gives his wife
    power of his body, not in all respects, but only in those things that are
    required by marriage. Now marriage does not require the husband to pay the
    debt every time his wife asks for it, if we consider the principal end for
    which marriage was instituted, namely the good of the offspring, but only as
    far as is necessary for impregnation. But in so far as it is instituted as a
    remedy (which is its secondary end), marriage does require the debt to be
    paid at all times on being asked for. Hence it is evident that by taking
    several wives a man does not bind himself to the impossible, considering the
    principal end of marriage; and therefore plurality of wives is not against
    the first principles of the natural law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> This precept of the natural law, "Do not
    to another what thou wouldst not were done to thyself," should be understood
    with the proviso that there be equal proportion. For if a superior is
    unwilling to be withstood by his subject, he is not therefore bound not to
    withstand his subject. Hence it does not follow in virtue of this precept
    that as a husband is unwilling for his wife to have another husband, he must
    not have another wife: because for one man to have several wives is not
    contrary to the first principles of the natural law, as stated above:
    whereas for one wife to have several husbands is contrary to the first
    principles of the natural law, since thereby the good of the offspring which
    is the principal end of marriage is, in one respect, entirely destroyed, and
    in another respect hindered. For the good of the offspring means not only
    begetting, but also rearing. Now the begetting of offspring, though not
    wholly voided (since a woman may be impregnated a second time after
    impregnation has already taken place, as stated in De Gener. Animal. vii.
    4), is nevertheless considerably hindered, because this can scarcely happen
    without injury either to both fetus or to one of them. But the rearing of
    the offspring is altogether done away, because as a result of one woman
    having several husbands there follows uncertainty of the offspring in
    relation to its father, whose care is necessary for its education. Wherefore
    the marriage of one wife with several husbands has not been sanctioned by
    any law or custom, whereas the converse has been.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> The natural inclination in the
    appetitive power follows the natural concept in the cognitive power. And
    since it is not so much opposed to the natural concept for a man to have
    several wives as for a wife to have several husbands, it follows that a
    wife's love is not so averse to another sharing the same husband with her,
    as a husband's love is to another sharing the same wife with him.
    Consequently both in man and in other animals the male is more jealous of
    the female than "vice versa."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it was ever lawful to have several wives?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it can never have been lawful
    to have several wives. For, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 7), "The
    natural law has the same power at all times and places." Now plurality of
    wives is forbidden by the natural law, as stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore as it is unlawful now, it was unlawful at all times.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it was ever lawful, this could only
    be because it was lawful either in itself, or by dispensation. If the
    former, it would also be lawful now; if the latter, this is impossible, for
    according to Augustine (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3), "as God is the founder of
    nature, He does nothing contrary to the principles which He has planted in
    nature." Since then God has planted in our nature the principle that one man
    should be united to one wife, it would seem that He has never dispensed man
    from this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a thing be lawful by dispensation, it
    is only lawful for those who receive the dispensation. Now we do not read in
    the Law of a general dispensation having been granted to all. Since then in
    the Old Testament all who wished to do so, without any distinction, took to
    themselves several wives, nor were reproached on that account, either by the
    law or by the prophets, it would seem that it was not made lawful by
    dispensation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, where there is the same reason for
    dispensation, the same dispensation should be given. Now we cannot assign
    any other reason for dispensation than the multiplying of the offspring for
    the worship of God, and this is necessary also now. Therefore this
    dispensation would be still in force, especially as we read nowhere of its
    having been recalled.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, in granting a dispensation the greater
    good should not be overlooked for the sake of a lesser good. Now fidelity
    and the sacrament, which it would seem impossible to safeguard in a marriage
    where one man is joined to several wives, are greater goods than the
    multiplication of the offspring. Therefore this dispensation ought not to
    have been granted with a view to this multiplication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A19"
      >Gal. 3:19</a
    >) that the Law "was set because of transgressors [Vulg.:
    'transgressions']," namely in order to prohibit them. Now the Old Law
    mentions plurality of wives without any prohibition thereof, as appears from
    Dt. 21:15, "If a man have two wives," etc. Therefore they were not
    transgressors through having two wives; and so it was lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, this is confirmed by the example of the holy patriarchs, who are
    stated to have had several wives, and yet were most pleasing to God, for
    instance Jacob, David, and several others. Therefore at one time it was
    lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 7,8), plurality of wives is said to be against the natural law, not as
    regards its first precepts, but as regards the secondary precepts, which
    like conclusions are drawn from its first precepts. Since, however, human
    acts must needs vary according to the various conditions of persons, times,
    and other circumstances, the aforesaid conclusions do not proceed from the
    first precepts of the natural law, so as to be binding in all cases, but
    only in the majority. for such is the entire matter of Ethics according to
    the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 3,7). Hence, when they cease to be binding, it is
    lawful to disregard them. But because it is not easy to determine the above
    variations, it belongs exclusively to him from whose authority he derives
    its binding force to permit the non-observance of the law in those cases to
    which the force of the law ought not to extend, and this permission is
    called a dispensation. Now the law prescribing the one wife was framed not
    by man but by God, nor was it ever given by word or in writing, but was
    imprinted on the heart, like other things belonging in any way to the
    natural law. Consequently a dispensation in this matter could be granted by
    God alone through an inward inspiration, vouchsafed originally to the holy
    patriarchs, and by their example continued to others, at a time when it
    behooved the aforesaid precept not to be observed, in order to ensure the
    multiplication of the offspring to be brought up in the worship of God. For
    the principal end is ever to be borne in mind before the secondary end.
    Wherefore, since the good of the offspring is the principal end of marriage,
    it behooved to disregard for a time the impediment that might arise to the
    secondary ends, when it was necessary for the offspring to be multiplied;
    because it was for the removal of this impediment that the precept
    forbidding a plurality of wives was framed, as stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural law, considered in itself,
    has the same force at all times and places; but accidentally on account of
    some impediment it may vary at certain times and places, as the Philosopher
    (Ethic. i, 3,7) instances in the case of other natural things. For at all
    times and places the right hand is better than the left according to nature,
    but it may happen accidentally that a person is ambidextrous, because our
    nature is variable; and the same applies to the natural, just as the
    Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 3,7).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In a Decretal (De divortiis, cap.
    Gaudemus) it is asserted that is was never lawful to have several wives
    without having a dispensation received through Divine inspiration. Nor is
    the dispensation thus granted a contradiction to the principles which God
    has implanted in nature, but an exception to them, because those principles
    are not intended to apply to all cases but to the majority, as stated. Even
    so it is not contrary to nature when certain occurrences take place in
    natural things miraculously, by way of exception to more frequent
    occurrences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Dispensation from a law should follow
    the quality of the law. Wherefore, since the law of nature is imprinted on
    the heart, it was not necessary for a dispensation from things pertaining to
    the natural law to be given under the form of a written law but by internal
    inspiration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When Christ came it was the time of the
    fulness of the grace of Christ, whereby the worship of God was spread abroad
    among all nations by a spiritual propagation. Hence there is not the same
    reason for a dispensation as before Christ's coming, when the worship of God
    was spread and safeguarded by a carnal propagation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The offspring, considered as one of the
    marriage goods, includes the keeping of faith with God, because the reason
    why it is reckoned a marriage good is because it is awaited with a view to
    its being brought up in the worship of God. Now the faith to be kept with
    God is of greater import than the faith to be kept with a wife, which is
    reckoned a marriage good, and than the signification which pertains to the
    sacrament, since the signification is subordinate to the knowledge of faith.
    Hence it is not unfitting if something is taken from the two other goods for
    the sake of the good of the offspring. Nor are they entirely done away,
    since there remains faith towards several wives; and the sacrament remains
    after a fashion, for though it did not signify the union of Christ with the
    Church as one, nevertheless the plurality of wives signified the distinction
    of degrees in the Church, which distinction is not only in the Church
    militant but also in the Church triumphant. Consequently their marriages
    signified somewhat the union of Christ not only with the Church militant, as
    some say, but also with the Church triumphant where there are "many
    mansions" [*Jn. 19:2].<br />

    Whether it is against the natural law to have a concubine?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to have a concubine is not
    against the natural law. For the ceremonies of the Law are not of the
    natural law. But fornication is forbidden (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+15%3A29"
      >Acts 15:29</a
    >) in conjunction with ceremonies of the law which for the time were being
    imposed on those who were brought to the faith from among the heathens.
    Therefore simple fornication which is intercourse with a concubine is not
    against the natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, positive law is an outcome of the
    natural law, as Tully says (De Invent. ii). Now fornication was not
    forbidden by positive law; indeed according to the ancient laws women used
    to be sentenced to be taken to brothels. Therefore it is not against the
    natural law to have a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the natural law does not forbid that
    which is given simply, to be given for a time or under certain restrictions.
    Now one unmarried woman may give the power of her body for ever to an
    unmarried man, so that he may use her when he will. Therefore it is not
    against the law of nature, if she give him power of her body for a time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever uses his own property as he
    will, injures no one. But a bondswoman is her master's property. Therefore
    if her master use her as he will, he injures no one: and consequently it is
    not against the natural law to have a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, everyone may give his own property to
    another. Now the wife has power of her husband's body (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 7:4</a
    >). Therefore if his wife be willing, the husband can have intercourse with
    another woman without sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to all laws the children born of a
    concubine are children of shame. But this would not be so unless the union
    of which they are born were naturally shameful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, as stated above (<a href="XP041.html#XPQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>,
    <a href="XP041.html#XPQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), marriage is natural. But
    this would not be so if without prejudice to the natural law a man could be
    united to a woman otherwise than by marriage. Therefore it is against the
    natural law to have a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), an action is said to be against the natural law, if it is not in keeping
    with the due end intended by nature, whether through not being directed
    thereto by the action of the agent, or through being directed thereto by the
    action of the agent, or through being in itself improportionate to that end.
    Now the end which nature intends in sexual union is the begetting and
    rearing of the offspring. and that this good might be sought after, it
    attached pleasure to the union; as Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i, 8).
    Accordingly to make use of sexual intercourse on account of its inherent
    pleasure, without reference to the end for which nature intended it, is to
    act against nature, as also is it if the intercourse be not such as may
    fittingly be directed to that end. And since, for the most part, things are
    denominated from their end, as being that which is of most consequence to
    them, just as the marriage union took its name from the good of the
    offspring [*Cf. Question [44], Article [2]], which is the end chiefly sought
    after in marriage, so the name of concubine is expressive of that union
    where sexual intercourse is sought after for its own sake. Moreover even
    though sometimes a man may seek to have offspring of such an intercourse,
    this is not befitting to the good of the offspring, which signifies not only
    the begetting of children from which they take their being, but also their
    rearing and instruction, by which means they receive nourishment and
    learning from their parents, in respect of which three things the parents
    are bound to their children, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii,
    11,12). Now since the rearing and teaching of the children remain a duty of
    the parents during a long period of time, the law of nature requires the
    father and mother to dwell together for a long time, in order that together
    they may be of assistance to their children. Hence birds that unite together
    in rearing their young do not sever their mutual fellowship from the time
    when they first come together until the young are fully fledged. Now this
    obligation which binds the female and her mate to remain together
    constitutes matrimony. Consequently it is evident that it is contrary to the
    natural law for a man to have intercourse with a woman who is not married to
    him, which is the signification of a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Among the Gentiles the natural law was
    obscured in many points: and consequently they did not think it wrong to
    have intercourse with a concubine, and in many cases practiced fornication
    as though it were lawful, as also other things contrary to the ceremonial
    laws of the Jews, though not contrary to the law of nature. Wherefore the
    apostles inserted the prohibition of fornication among that of other
    ceremonial observances, because in both cases there was a difference of
    opinion between Jews and Gentiles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This law was the result of the darkness
    just mentioned, into which the Gentiles had fallen, by not giving due honor
    to God as stated in Rm. 1:21, and did not proceed from the instinct of the
    natural law. Hence, when the Christian religion prevailed, this law was
    abolished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In certain cases no evil results ensue
    if a person surrenders his right to a thing whether absolutely or for a
    time, so that in neither case is the surrender against the natural law. But
    that does not apply to the case in point, wherefore the argument does not
    prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Injury is opposed to justice. Now the
    natural law forbids not only injustice, but also whatever is opposed to any
    of the virtues: for instance it is contrary to the natural law to eat
    immoderately, although by doing so a man uses his own property without
    injury to anyone. Moreover although a bondswoman is her master's property
    that she may serve him, she is not his that she may be his concubine. And
    again it depends how a person makes use of his property. For such a man does
    an injury to the offspring he begets, since such a union is not directed to
    its good, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The wife has power of her husband's
    body, not simply and in all respects, but only in relation to marriage, and
    consequently she cannot transfer her husband's body to another to the
    detriment of the good of marriage.<br />

    Whether it is a mortal sin to have intercourse with a concubine?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not a mortal sin to have
    intercourse with a concubine. For a lie is a greater sin than simple
    fornication: and a proof of this is that Juda, who did not abhor to commit
    fornication with Thamar, recoiled from telling a lie, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++38%3A23"
      >Gn. 38:23</a
    >): "Surely she cannot charge us with a lie." But a lie is not always a
    mortal sin. Neither therefore is simple fornication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a deadly sin should be punished with
    death. But the Old Law did not punish with death intercourse with a
    concubine, save in a certain case (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++22%3A25"
      >Dt. 22:25</a
    >). Therefore it is not a deadly sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxiii,
    12), the sins of the flesh are less blameworthy than spiritual sins. Now
    pride and covetousness, which are spiritual sins, are not always mortal
    sins. Therefore fornication, which is a sin of the flesh, is not always a
    mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, where the incentive is greater the sin
    is less grievous, because he sins more who is overcome by a lighter
    temptation. But concupiscence is the greatest incentive to lust. Therefore
    since lustful actions are not always mortal sins, neither is simple
    fornication a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing but mortal sin excludes from the
    kingdom of God. But fornicators are excluded from the kingdom of God (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++6%3A9,10"
      >1 Cor. 6:9,10</a
    >). Therefore simple fornication is a mortal sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, mortal sins alone are called crimes. Now all fornication is a crime
    according to Tobias 4:13, "Take heed to keep thyself... from all
    fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know crime." Therefore,
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have already stated (Sent. ii, D, 42,
    <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), those sins are mortal in
    their genus which violate the bond of friendship between man and God, and
    between man and man; for such sins are against the two precepts of charity
    which is the life of the soul. Wherefore since the intercourse of
    fornication destroys the due relations of the parent with the offspring that
    is nature's aim in sexual intercourse, there can be no doubt that simple
    fornication by its very nature is a mortal sin even though there were no
    written law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It often happens that a man who does not
    avoid a mortal sin, avoids a venial sin to which he has not so great an
    incentive. Thus, too, Juda avoided a lie while he avoided not fornication.
    Nevertheless that would have been a pernicious lie, for it would have
    involved an injury if he had not kept his promise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A sin is called deadly, not because it
    is punished with temporal, but because it is punished with eternal death.
    Hence also theft, which is a mortal sin, and many other sins are sometimes
    not punished with temporal death by the law. The same applies to
    fornication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as not every movement of pride is a
    mortal sin, so neither is every movement of lust, because the first
    movements of lust and the like are venial sins, even sometimes marriage
    intercourse. Nevertheless some acts of lust are mortal sins, while some
    movements of pride are venial: since the words quoted from Gregory are to be
    understood as comparing vices in their genus and not in their particular
    acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A circumstance is the more effective in
    aggravating a sin according as it comes nearer to the nature of sin. Hence
    although fornication is less grave on account of the greatness of its
    incentive, yet on account of the matter about which it is, it has a greater
    gravity than immoderate eating, because it is about those things which
    tighten the bond of human fellowship, as stated above. Hence the argument
    does not prove.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it was ever lawful to have a concubine?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it has been sometimes lawful
    to have a concubine. For just as the natural law requires a man to have but
    one wife, so does it forbid him to have a concubine. Yet at times it has
    been lawful to have several wives. Therefore it has also been lawful to have
    a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a woman cannot be at the same time a
    slave and a wife; wherefore according to the Law (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++21%3A11,+seqq+"
      >Dt. 21:11, seqq.</a
    >) a bondswoman gained her freedom by the very fact of being taken in
    marriage. Now we read that certain men who were most beloved of God, for
    instance Abraham and Jacob, had intercourse with their bondswomen. Therefore
    these were not wives, and consequently it was sometime lawful to have a
    concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a woman who is taken in marriage cannot
    be cast out, and her son should have a share in the inheritance. Yet Abraham
    sent Agar away, and her son was not his heir (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++21%3A14"
      >Gn. 21:14</a
    >). Therefore she was not Abraham's wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Things opposed to the precepts of the
    decalogue were never lawful. Now to have a concubine is against a precept of
    the decalogue, namely, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Therefore it was
    never lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Ambrose says in his book on the patriarchs (De Abraham i, 4): "What
    is unlawful to a wife is unlawful to a husband." But it is never lawful for
    a wife to put aside her own husband and have intercourse with another man.
    Therefore it was never lawful for a husband to have a concubine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Rabbi Moses says (Doc. Perp. iii, 49) that
    before the time of the Law fornication was not a sin; and he proved his
    assertion from the fact that Juda had intercourse with Thamar. But this
    argument is not conclusive. For there is no need to excuse Jacob's sons from
    mortal sin, since they were accused to their father of a most wicked crime
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++37%3A2">Gn. 37:2</a>),
    and consented kill Joseph and to sell him. Wherefore we must say that since
    it is against the natural law to have a concubine outside wedlock, as stated
    above (<a href="XP065.html#XPQ65A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it was never
    lawful either in itself or by dispensation. For as we have shown (Doc. Perp.
    iii, 49) intercourse with a woman outside wedlock is an action
    improportionate to the good of the offspring which is the principal end of
    marriage: and consequently it is against the first precepts of the natural
    law which admit of no dispensation. Hence wherever in the Old Testament we
    read of concubines being taken by such men as we ought to excuse from mortal
    sin, we must needs understand them to have been taken in marriage, and yet
    to have been called concubines, because they had something of the character
    of a wife and something of the character of a concubine. In so far as
    marriage is directed to its principal end, which is the good of the
    offspring, the union of wife and husband is indissoluble or at least of a
    lasting nature, as shown above (<a href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), and in regard to this there is no dispensation. But in regard to the
    secondary end, which is the management of the household and community of
    works, the wife is united to the husband as his mate: and this was lacking
    in those who were known as concubines. For in this respect a dispensation
    was possible, since it is the secondary end of marriage. And from this point
    of view they bore some resemblance to concubines, and for this reason they
    were known as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 7,8) to have several wives is not against the first precepts of the
    natural law, as it is to have a concubine; wherefore the argument does not
    prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The patriarchs of old by virtue of the
    dispensation which allowed them several wives, approached their bondswomen
    with the disposition of a husband towards his wife. For these women were
    wives as to the principal and first end of marriage, but not as to the other
    union which regards the secondary end, to which bondage is opposed since a
    woman cannot be at once mate and slave.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As in the Mosaic law it was allowable by
    dispensation to grant a bill of divorce in order to avoid wife-murder (as we
    shall state further on, Question [67], Article [6]), so by the same
    dispensation Abraham was allowed to send Agar away, in order to signify the
    mystery which the Apostle explains (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A22,+seqq+"
      >Gal. 4:22, seqq.</a
    >). Again, that this son did not inherit belongs to the mystery, as
    explained in the same place. Even so Esau, the son of a free woman, did not
    inherit (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++9%3A13,+seqq+"
      >Rm. 9:13, seqq.</a
    >). In like manner on account of the mystery it came about that the sons of
    Jacob born of bond and free women inherited, as Augustine says (Tract. xi in
    Joan.) because "sons and heirs are born to Christ both of good ministers
    denoted by the free woman and of evil ministers denoted by the bondswoman."
