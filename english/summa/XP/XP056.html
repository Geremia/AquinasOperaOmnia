<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the impediment of spiritual relationship: under 
which head there are five points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP056.html#XPQ56A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether spiritual relationship is an impediment to marriage? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP056.html#XPQ56A2THEP1">(2)</a> From what cause is it contracted?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that spiritual relationship is not an impediment to 
marriage. For nothing is an impediment to marriage save what is contrary 
to a marriage good. Now spiritual relationship is not contrary to a 
marriage good. Therefore it is not an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a perpetual impediment to marriage cannot stand together 
with marriage. But spiritual relationship sometimes stands together with 
marriage, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 42), as when a man in a 
case of necessity baptizes his own child, for then he contracts a 
spiritual relationship with his wife, and yet the marriage is not 
dissolved. Therefore spiritual relationship is not an impediment to 
marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, union of the spirit does not pass to the flesh. But 
marriage is a union of the flesh. Therefore since spiritual relationship 
is a union of the spirit, it cannot become an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, contraries have not the same effects. Now spiritual 
relationship is apparently contrary to disparity of worship, since 
spiritual relationship is a kinship resulting from the giving of a 
sacrament or the intention of so doing [*See next Article, ad 3]: whereas 
disparity of worship consists in the lack of a sacrament, as stated above 
(<A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Since then disparity of worship is an impediment to 
matrimony, it would seem that spiritual relationship has not this effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The holier the bond, the more is it to be safeguarded. 
Now a spiritual bond is holier than a bodily tie: and since the tie of 
bodily kinship is an impediment to marriage, it follows that spiritual 
relationship should also be an impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in marriage the union of souls ranks higher than union of 
bodies, for it precedes it. Therefore with much more reason can a 
spiritual relationship hinder marriage than bodily relationship does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as by carnal procreation man receives natural being, 
so by the sacraments he receives the spiritual being of grace. Wherefore 
just as the tie that is contracted by carnal procreation is natural to 
man, inasmuch as he is a natural being, so the tie that is contracted 
from the reception of the sacraments is after a fashion natural to man, 
inasmuch as he is a member of the Church. Therefore as carnal 
relationship hinders marriage, even so does spiritual relationship by 
command of the Church. We must  however draw a distinction in reference 
to spiritual relationship, since either it precedes or follows marriage. 
If it precedes, it hinders the contracting of marriage and voids the 
contract. If it follows, it does not dissolve the marriage bond: but we 
must draw a further distinction in reference to the marriage act. For 
either the spiritual relationship is contracted in a case of necessity, 
as when a father baptizes his child who is at the point of death---and 
then it is not an obstacle to the marriage act on either side---or it is 
contracted without any necessity and through ignorance, in which case if 
the person whose action has occasioned the relationship acted with due 
caution, it is the same with him as in the former case---or it is 
contracted purposely and without any necessity, and then the person whose 
action has occasioned the relationship, loses the right to ask for the 
debt; but is bound to pay if asked, because the fault of the one party 
should not be prejudicial to the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although spiritual relationship does not hinder any of the 
chief marriage goods, it hinders one of the secondary goods, namely the 
extension of friendship, because spiritual relationship is by itself a 
sufficient reason for friendship: wherefore intimacy and friendship with 
other persons need to be sought by means of marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Marriage is a lasting bond, wherefore no supervening 
impediment can sever it. Hence it happens sometimes that marriage and an 
impediment to marriage stand together, but not if the impediment precedes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In marriage there is not only a bodily but also a spiritual 
union: and consequently kinship of spirit proves an impediment thereto, 
without spiritual kinship having to pass into a bodily relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There is nothing unreasonable in two things that are 
contrary to one another being contrary to the same thing, as great and 
small are contrary to equal. Thus disparity of worship and spiritual 
relationship are opposed to marriage, because in one the distance is 
greater, and in the other less, than required by marriage. Hence there is 
an impediment to marriage in either case.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether spiritual relationship is contracted by baptism only?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that spiritual relationship is contracted by 
Baptism only. For as bodily kinship is to bodily birth, so is spiritual 
kinship to spiritual birth. Now Baptism alone is called spiritual birth. 
Therefore spiritual kinship is contracted by Baptism only, even as only 
by carnal birth is carnal kinship contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a character is imprinted in order as in Confirmation. 
But spiritual relationship does not result from receiving orders. 
Therefore it does not result from Confirmation  but only from Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sacraments are more excellent than sacramentals. Now 
spiritual relationship does not result from certain sacraments, for 
instance from Extreme Unction. Much less therefore does it result from 
catechizing, as some maintain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, many other sacramentals are attached to Baptism besides 
catechizing. Therefore spiritual relationship is not contracted from 
catechism any more than from the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, prayer is no less efficacious than instruction of 
catechism for advancement in good. But spiritual relationship does not 
result from prayer. Therefore it does not result from catechism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the instruction given to the baptized by preaching to 
them avails no less than preaching to those who are not yet baptized. But 
no spiritual relationship results from preaching. Neither therefore does 
it result from catechism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> On the other hand, It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++4%3A15">1 Cor. 4:15</a>): "In Christ Jesus 
by the gospel I have begotten you." Now spiritual birth causes spiritual 
relationship. Therefore spiritual relationship results from the preaching 
of the gospel and instruction, and not only from Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, as original sin is taken away by Baptism, so is actual 
sin taken away by Penance. Therefore just as Baptism causes spiritual 
relationship, so also does Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Obj. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, "father" denotes relationship. Now a man is called 
another's spiritual father in respect of Penance, teaching, pastoral care 
and many other like things. Therefore spiritual relationship is 
contracted from many other sources besides Baptism and Confirmation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are three opinions on this question. Some say that 
as spiritual regeneration is bestowed by the sevenfold grace of the Holy 
Ghost, it is caused by means of seven things, beginning with the first 
taste of blessed salt and ending with Confirmation given by the bishop: 
and they say that spiritual relationship is contracted by each of these 
seven things. But this does not seem reasonable, for carnal relationship 
is not contracted except by a perfect act of generation. Wherefore 
affinity is not contracted except there be mingling of seeds, from which 
it is possible for carnal generation to follow. Now spiritual generation 
is not perfected except by a sacrament: wherefore it does not seem 
fitting for spiritual relationship to be contracted otherwise than 
through a sacrament. Hence others say that spiritual relationship is only 
contracted through three sacraments, namely catechism, Baptism and 
Confirmation, but these do not apparently know the meaning of what they 
say, since catechism is not a sacrament but a sacramental. Wherefore 
others say that it is contracted through two  sacraments only, namely 
Confirmation and Baptism, and this is the more common opinion. Some 
however of these say that catechism is a weak impediment, since it 
hinders the contracting of marriage but does not void the contract.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Carnal birth is twofold. The first is in the womb, wherein 
that which is born is a weakling and cannot come forth without danger: 
and to this birth regeneration by Baptism is likened; wherein a man is 
regenerated as though yet needing to be fostered in the womb of the 
Church. The second is birth from out of the womb, when that which was 
born in the womb is so far strengthened that it can without danger face 
the outer world which has a natural corruptive tendency. To this is 
likened Confirmation, whereby man being strengthened goes forth abroad to 
confess the name of Christ. Hence spiritual relationship is fittingly 
contracted through both these sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The effect of the sacrament of order is not regeneration 
but the bestowal of power, for which reason it is not conferred on women, 
and consequently no impediment to marriage can arise therefrom. Hence 
this kind of relationship does not count.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In catechism one makes a profession of future Baptism, just 
as in betrothal one enters an engagement of future marriage. Wherefore 
just as in betrothal a certain kind of propinquity is contracted, so is 
there in catechism, whereby marriage is rendered at least unlawful, as 
some say; but not in the other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There is not made a profession of faith in the other 
sacramentals of Baptism, as in catechism: wherefore the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same answer applies to the Fifth and Sixth Objections.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The Apostle had instructed them in the faith by a kind of 
catechism; and consequently his instruction was directed to their 
spiritual birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> Properly speaking a spiritual relationship is not 
contracted through the sacrament of Penance. Wherefore a priest's son can 
marry a woman whose confession the priest has heard, else in the whole 
parish he could not find a woman whom he could marry. Nor does it matter 
that by Penance actual sin is taken away, for this is not a kind of 
birth, but a kind of healing. Nevertheless Penance occasions a kind of 
bond between the woman penitent and the priest, that has a resemblance to 
spiritual relationship, so that if he have carnal intercourse with her, 
he sins as grievously as if she were his spiritual daughter. The reason 
of this is that the relations between priest and penitent are most 
intimate, and consequently in order to remove the occasion of sin this 
prohibition [*Can. Omnes quos, and seqq., Caus. xxx] was made.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[2] R.O. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> A spiritual father is so called from his likeness  to a 
carnal father. Now as the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 2) a carnal 
father gives his child three things, being nourishment and instruction: 
and consequently a person's spiritual father is so called from one of 
these three things. Nevertheless he has not, through being his spiritual 
father, a spiritual relationship with him, unless he is like a (carnal) 
father as to generation which is the way to being. This solution may also 
be applied to the foregoing Eighth Objection.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether spiritual relationship is contracted between the person baptized and the person who raises him from the sacred font?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that spiritual relationship is not contracted 
between the person baptized and the person who raises him from the sacred 
font. For in carnal generation carnal relationship is contracted only on 
the part of the person of whose seed the child is born; and not on the 
part of the person who receives the child after birth. Therefore neither 
is spiritual relationship contracted between the receiver and the 
received at the sacred font.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who raises a person from the sacred font is called 
{anadochos} by Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. ii): and it is part of his office 
to instruct the child. But instruction is not a sufficient cause of 
spiritual relationship, as stated above (<A Href="XP056.html#XPQ56A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore no relationship 
is contracted between him and the person whom he raises from the sacred 
font.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that someone raises a person from the 
sacred font before he himself is baptized. Now spiritual relationship is 
not contracted in such a case, since one who is not baptized is not 
capable of spirituality. Therefore raising a person from the sacred font 
is not sufficient to contract a spiritual relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> There is the definition of spiritual relationship 
quoted above (<A Href="XP056.html#XPQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), as also the authorities mentioned in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 42).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as in carnal generation a person is born of a father 
and mother, so in spiritual generation a person is born again a son of 
God as Father, and of the Church as Mother. Now while he who confers the 
sacrament stands in the place of God, whose instrument and minister he 
is, he who raises a baptized person from the sacred font, or holds the 
candidate for Confirmation, stands in the place of the Church. Therefore 
spiritual relationship is contracted with both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not only the father, of whose seed the child is born, is 
related carnally to the child, but also the mother who provides the 
matter, and in whose womb the child is begotten. So too the godparent who 
in place of the Church offers and raises the candidate for Baptism and 
holds the candidate for Confirmation  contracts spiritual relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He contracts spiritual relationship not by reason of the 
instruction it is his duty to give, but on account of the spiritual birth 
in which he co-operates.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A person who is not baptized cannot raise anyone from the 
sacred font, since he is not a member of the Church whom the godparent in 
Baptism represents: although he can baptize, because he is a creature of 
God Whom the baptizer represents. And yet he cannot contract a spiritual 
relationship, since he is void of spiritual life to which man is first 
born by receiving Baptism.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether spiritual relationship passes from husband to wife?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that spiritual relationship does not pass from 
husband to wife. For spiritual and bodily union are disparate and differ 
generically. Therefore carnal union which is between husband and wife 
cannot be the means of contracting a spiritual relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the godfather and godmother have more in common in the 
spiritual birth that is the cause of spiritual relationship, than a 
husband, who is godfather, has with his wife. Now godfather and godmother 
do not hereby contract spiritual relationship. Therefore neither does a 
wife contract a spiritual relationship through her husband being 
godfather to someone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that the husband is baptized, and his wife 
not, for instance when he is converted from unbelief without his wife 
being converted. Now spiritual relationship cannot be contracted by one 
who is not baptized. Therefore it does not always pass from husband to 
wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, husband and wife together can raise a person from the 
sacred font, since no law forbids it. If therefore spiritual relationship 
passed from husband to wife, it would follow that each of them is twice 
godfather or godmother of the same individual: which is absurd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Spiritual goods are more communicable than bodily 
goods. But the bodily consanguinity of the husband passes to his wife by 
affinity. Much more therefore does spiritual relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A may become co-parent with B in two ways. First, by the 
act of another (B), who baptizes A's child, or raises him in Baptism. In 
this way spiritual relationship does not pass from husband to wife, 
unless perchance it be his wife's child, for then she contracts spiritual 
relationship directly, even as her husband. Secondly, by his own act, for 
instance when he raises B's child from the sacred font, and thus 
spiritual relationship passes to the wife if he has already had carnal 
knowledge of her, but not  if the marriage be not yet consummated, since 
they are not as yet made one flesh: and this is by way of a kind of 
affinity; wherefore it would seem on the same grounds to pass to a woman 
of whom he has carnal knowledge, though she be not his wife. Hence the 
verse: "I may not marry my own child's godmother, nor the mother of my 
godchild: but I may marry the godmother of my wife's child."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> From the fact that corporal and spiritual union differ 
generically we may conclude that the one is not the other, but not that 
the one cannot cause the other, since things of different genera 
sometimes cause one another either directly or indirectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The godfather and godmother of the same person are not 
united in that person's spiritual birth save accidentally, since one of 
them would be self-sufficient for the purpose. Hence it does not follow 
from this that any spiritual relationship results between them whereby 
they are hindered from marrying one another. Hence the verse:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of two co-parents one is always spiritual, the other carnal: this rule 
is infallible."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, marriage by itself makes husband and wife one flesh: 
wherefore the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the wife be not baptized, the spiritual relationship 
will not reach her, because she is not a fit subject, and not because 
spiritual relationship cannot pass from husband to wife through marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since no spiritual relationship results between godfather 
and godmother, nothing prevents husband and wife from raising together 
someone from the sacred font. Nor is it absurd that the wife become twice 
godmother of the same person from different causes, just as it is 
possible for her to be connected in carnal relationship both by affinity 
and consanguinity to the same person.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that spiritual relationship does not pass to the 
godfather's carnal children. For no degrees are assigned to spiritual 
relationship. Yet there would be degrees if it passed from father to son, 
since the person begotten involves a change of degree, as stated above 
(<A Href="XP055.html#XPQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="XP055.html#XPQ55A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore it does not pass to the godfather's carnal sons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, father and son are related in the same degree as brother 
and brother. If therefore spiritual relationship passes from father to 
son, it will equally pass from brother to brother:  and this is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> This is proved by authority quoted in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 42).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A son is something of his father and not conversely 
(Ethic. viii, 12): wherefore spiritual relationship passes from father to 
his carnal son and not conversely. Thus it is clear that there are three 
spiritual relationships: one called spiritual fatherhood between 
godfather and godchild; another called co-paternity between the godparent 
and carnal parent of the same person; and the third is called spiritual 
brotherhood, between godchild and the carnal children of the same parent. 
Each of these hinders the contracting of marriage and voids the contract.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The addition of a person by carnal generation entails a 
degree with regard to a person connected by the same kind of 
relationship, but not with regard to one connected by another kind of 
relationship. Thus a son is connected with his father's wife in the same 
degree as his father, but by another kind of relationship. Now spiritual 
relationship differs in kind from carnal. Wherefore a godson is not 
related to his godfather's carnal son in the same degree as the latter's 
father is related to him, through whom the spiritual relationship is 
contracted. Consequently it does not follow that spiritual relationship 
admits of degrees.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[56] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man is not part of his brother as a son is of his father. 
But a wife is part of her husband, since she is made one with him in 
body. Consequently the relationship does not pass from brother to 
brother, whether the brother be born before or after spiritual 
brotherhood.<br>
