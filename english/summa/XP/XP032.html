    ON WHOM SHOULD THIS SACRAMENT BE CONFERRED AND ON WHAT PART OF THE BODY?
    (SEVEN ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider on whom this sacrament should be conferred and on what
    part of the body: under which head there are seven points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether this sacrament should be
    conferred on those who are in good health?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it should be conferred in
    any kind of sickness?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it should be conferred on
    madmen and imbeciles?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it should be given to
    children?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether, in this sacrament, the
    whole body should be anointed?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether certain parts are suitably
    assigned to be anointed?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP032.html#XPQ32A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether those who are deformed in
    the above parts ought to be anointed thereon?<br />

    Whether this sacrament ought to be conferred on those who are in good
    health?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament should be
    conferred even on those who are in good health. For the healing of the mind
    is a more important effect of this sacrament than the healing of the body,
    as stated above (<a href="XP030.html#XPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>,
    <a href="XP030.html#XPQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now even those who are
    healthy in body need to be healed in mind. Therefore this sacrament should
    be conferred on them also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this is the sacrament of those who are
    departing this life, just as Baptism is the sacrament of those who are
    entering this life. Now Baptism is given to all who enter. Therefore this
    sacrament should be given to all who are departing. But sometimes those who
    are near departure are in good health, for instance those who are to be
    beheaded. Therefore this sacrament should be conferred on them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+5%3A14"
      >James 5:14</a
    >): "Is any man sick among you," etc. Therefore none but the sick are
    competent to receive this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament is a spiritual healing, as
    stated above (<a href="XP030.html#XPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>,
    <a href="XP030.html#XPQ30ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), and is signified by
    way of a healing of the body. Hence this sacrament should not be conferred
    on those who are not subjects for bodily healing, those namely, who are in
    good health.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although spiritual health is the
    principal effect of this sacrament, yet this same spiritual healing needs to
    be signified by a healing of the body, although bodily health may not
    actually ensue. Consequently spiritual health can be conferred by this
    sacrament on those alone who are competent to receive bodily healing, viz.
    the sick; even as he alone can receive Baptism who is capable of a bodily
    washing, and not a child yet in its mother's womb.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even those who are entering into life
    cannot receive Baptism unless they are capable of a bodily washing. And so
    those who are departing this life cannot receive this sacrament, unless they
    be subjects for a bodily healing.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether this sacrament ought to be given in any kind of sickness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament should be given
    in any kind of sickness. For no kind of sickness is determined in the fifth
    chapter of James where this sacrament is delivered to us. Therefore this
    sacrament should be given in all kinds of sickness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more excellent a remedy is, the more
    generally should it be available. Now this sacrament is more excellent than
    bodily medicine. Since then bodily medicine is given to all manner of sick
    persons, it seems that this sacrament should be given in like manner to
    all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> This sacrament is called by all Extreme
    Unction. Now it is not every sickness that brings man to the extremity of
    his life, since some ailments prolong life, according to the Philosopher (De
    Long. et Brev. Vitae i). Therefore this sacrament should not be given in
    every case of sickness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament is the last remedy that the
    Church can give, since it is an immediate preparation for glory. Therefore
    it ought to be given to those only, who are so sick as to be in a state of
    departure from this life, through their sickness being of such a nature as
    to cause death, the danger of which is to be feared.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Any sickness can cause death, if it be
    aggravated. Hence if we consider the different kinds of disease, there is
    none in which this sacrament cannot be given; and for this reason the
    apostle does not determine any particular one. But if we consider the degree
    and the stage of the complaint, this sacrament should not be given to every
    sick person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The principal effect of bodily medicine
    is bodily health, which all sick people lack, whatever be the stage of their
    sickness. But the principal effect of this sacrament is that immunity from
    disorder which is needed by those who are taking their departure from this
    life and setting out for the life of glory. Hence the comparison fails.<br />

    Whether this sacrament ought to be given to madmen and imbeciles?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament should be given
    to madmen and imbeciles. For these diseases are full of danger and cause
    death quickly. Now when there is danger it is the time to apply the remedy.
    Therefore this sacrament, which was intended as a remedy to human weakness,
    should be given to such people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism is a greater sacrament than
    this. Now Baptism is conferred on mad people as stated above (<a
      href="../TP.html"
      >TP</a
    >, <a href="../TP/TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP068.html#TPQ68A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). Therefore this
    sacrament also should be given to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> This sacrament should be given to none but
    such as acknowledge it. Now this does not apply to madmen and imbeciles.
    Therefore it should not be given to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The devotion of the recipient, the personal
    merit of the minister, and the general merits of the whole Church, are of
    great account towards the reception of the effect of this sacrament. This is
    evident from the fact that the form of this sacrament is pronounced by way
    of a prayer. Hence it should not be given those who cannot acknowledge it,
    and especially to madmen and imbeciles, who might dishonor the sacrament by
    their offensive conduct, unless they have lucid intervals, when they would
    be capable of acknowledging the sacrament, for then the sacrament should be
    given to children the same in that state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although such people are sometimes in
    danger of death; yet the remedy cannot be applied to them, on account of
    their lack of devotion. Hence it should not be given to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism does not require a movement of
    the free-will, because it is given chiefly as a remedy for original sin,
    which, in us, is not taken away by a movement of the free-will. On the other
    hand this sacrament requires a movement of the free-will; wherefore the
    comparison fails. Moreover Baptism is a necessary sacrament, while Extreme
    Unction is not.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether this sacrament should be given to children?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament ought to be
    given to children. Because children suffer from the same ailments sometimes
    as adults. Now the same disease requires the same remedy. Therefore this
    sacrament should be given to children the same as to adults.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is given in order to
    remove the remnants of sin, whether original or actual, as stated above (<a
      href="XP030.html#XPQ30OUTP1"
      >Question [30]</a
    >, <a href="XP030.html#XPQ30A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the remnants of
    original sin are in children. Therefore this sacrament should be given to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> This sacrament should be given to none but
    those to whom the form applies. But the form of this sacrament does not
    apply to children, since they have not sinned by sight and hearing; as
    expressed in the form. Therefore this sacrament should not be given to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament, like the Eucharist, requires
    actual devotion in the recipient. Therefore, just as the Eucharist ought not
    to be given to children, so neither ought this sacrament to be given to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Children's infirmities are not caused by
    actual sin, as in adults, and this sacrament is given chiefly as a remedy
    for infirmities that result from sins, being the remnants of sin, as it
    were.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This sacrament is not given as a remedy
    for the remnants of original sin, except in so far as they gather strength,
    so to speak, from actual sins. Hence from the very form it appears that it
    is given chiefly as a remedy for actual sins, which are not in children.<br />

    Whether the whole body should be anointed in this sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the whole body should be
    anointed in this sacrament. For, according to Augustine (De Trin. vi, 6),
    "the whole soul is in every part of the body." Now this sacrament is given
    chiefly in order to heal the soul. Therefore the whole body ought to be
    anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the remedy should be applied to the part
    affected by the disease. But sometimes the disease is general, and affects
    the whole body, as a fever does. Therefore the whole body should be
    anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in Baptism the whole body is dipped
    under the water. Therefore in this sacrament the whole body should be
    anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the rite observed throughout the
    Church, according to which in this sacrament the sick man is anointed, only
    in certain fixed parts of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament is shown to us under the form of
    a healing. Now bodily healing has to be effected, by applying the remedy,
    not to the whole body, but to those parts where the root of the disease is
    seated. Consequently the sacramental unction also ought to be applied to
    those parts only in which the spiritual sickness is rooted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the whole soul is, as to its
    essence, in each part of the body, it is not as to its powers which are the
    roots of sinful acts. Hence certain fixed parts have to be anointed, those,
    namely, in which powers have their being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The remedy is not always applied to the
    part affected by the disease, but, with greater reason, to the part where
    the root of the disease is seated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism is given under the form of
    washing: and a bodily washing cleanses only the part to which it is applied;
    for this reason Baptism is applied to the whole body. It is different with
    Extreme Unction for the reason given above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the parts to be anointed are suitably assigned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these parts are unsuitably
    assigned, namely, that the eyes, nose, ears, lips, hands, and feet should be
    anointed. For a wise physician heals the disease in its root. Now "from the
    heart come forth thoughts... that defile a man" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A19,20"
      >Mt. 15:19,20</a
    >). Therefore the breast ought to be anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, purity of mind is not less necessary to
    those who are departing this life than to those who are entering therein.
    Now those who are entering are anointed with chrism on the head by the
    priest, to signify purity of mind. Therefore in this sacrament those who are
    departing should be anointed on the head.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the remedy should be applied where the
    disease is most virulent. Now spiritual sickness is most virulent in the
    loins in men, and in the navel in women, according to Job 40:11: "His
    strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly," as
    Gregory expounds the passage (Moral. xxxii, 11). Therefore these parts
    should be anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, sins are committed with other parts of
    the body, no less than with the feet. Therefore, as the feet are anointed,
    so ought other members of the body to be anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The principles of sinning are the same in us as
    the principles of action, for a sin is an act. Now there are in us three
    principles of action; the first is the directing principle, namely, the
    cognitive power; the second is the commanding principle, namely, the
    appetitive power; the third is the executive principle, namely, the motive
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now all our knowledge has its origin in the senses. And, since the remedy
    for sin should be applied where sin originates in us first, for that reason
    the places of the five senses are anointed. the eyes, to wit, on account of
    the sight, the ears on account of hearing, the nostrils on account of the
    smell, the mouth on account of the taste, the hands on account of the touch
    which is keenest in the finger tips, (in some places too the loins are
    anointed on account of the appetite), and the feet are anointed on account
    of the motive power of which they are the chief instrument. And since the
    cognitive power is the first principle of human activity, the anointing of
    the five senses is observed by all, as being essential to the sacrament. But
    some do not observe the other unctions---some also anoint the feet but not
    the loins---because the appetitive and motive powers are secondary
    principles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> No thought arises in the heart without
    an act of the imagination which is a movement proceeding from sensation (De
    Anima ii). Hence the primary root of thought is not the heart, but the
    sensory organs, except in so far as the heart is a principle of the whole
    body, albeit a remote principle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who enter have to receive purity
    of the mind, whereas those who are departing have to cleanse the mind. Hence
    the latter need to be anointed in those parts in respect of which the mind's
    purity may be sullied.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some are wont to anoint the loins,
    because they are the chief seat of the concupiscible appetite: however, as
    stated above, the appetitive power is not the primary root.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The bodily organs which are the
    instruments of sin, are the feet, hands, and tongue, all of which are
    anointed, and the organs of generation which it would be unbecoming to
    anoint, on account of their uncleanliness, and out of respect for the
    sacrament.<br />

    Whether those who are deformed in those parts should be anointed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those who are deformed should
    not be anointed in those parts. For just as this sacrament demands a certain
    disposition on the part of the recipient, viz. that he should be sick, so it
    demands that he should be anointed in a certain part of the body. Now he
    that is not sick cannot be anointed. Therefore neither can he be anointed
    who lacks the part to be anointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man born blind does not sin by his
    sight. Yet in the anointing of the eyes mention is made of sins by sight.
    Therefore this anointing ought not to be applied to one born blind, and in
    like manner as regards the other senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Bodily deformity is not an impediment to any
    other sacrament. Therefore it should not be an impediment to this one. Now
    each of the anointings is essential to the sacrament. Therefore all should
    be applied to those who are deformed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Even those who are deformed should be anointed,
    and that as near as possible to the part which ought to have been anointed.
    For though they have not the members, nevertheless, they have, at least
    radically, the powers of the soul, corresponding to those members, and they
    may commit inwardly the sins that pertain to those members, though they
    cannot outwardly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>
