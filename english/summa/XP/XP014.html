  <h3 align="center">OF THE QUALITY OF SATISFACTION (FIVE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the quality of satisfaction, under which head there are
    five points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a man can satisfy for one
    sin without satisfying for another?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether if a man fall into sin
    after being contrite for all his sins, he can, now that he has lost charity,
    satisfy for his other sins which were pardoned him through his
    contrition?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a man's previous
    satisfaction begins to avail when he recovers charity?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether works done without charity
    merit any good?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP014.html#XPQ14A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether such works avail for the
    mitigation of the pains of hell?

    Whether a man can satisfy for one sin without satisfying for another?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man can satisfy for one sin
    without satisfying for another. Because when several things are not
    connected together one can be taken away without another. Now sins are not
    connected together, else whoever had one would have them all. Therefore one
    sin can be expiated by satisfaction, without another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God is more merciful than man. But man
    accepts the payment of one debt without the payment of another. Therefore
    God accepts satisfaction for one sin without the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 15),
    "satisfaction is to uproot the causes of sin, and give no opening to the
    suggestions thereof." Now this can be done with regard to one sin and not
    another, as when a mall curbs his lust and perseveres in covetousness.
    Therefore we can make satisfaction for one sin without satisfying for
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The fast of those who fasted "for debates and
    strifes" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++58%3A4,5"
      >Is. 58:4,5</a
    >) was not acceptable to God, though fasting be a work of satisfaction. Now
    satisfaction cannot be made save by works that are acceptable to God.
    Therefore he that has a sin on his conscience cannot make satisfaction to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, satisfaction is a remedy for the healing of past sins, and for
    preserving from future sins, as stated above (<a
      href="XP012.html#XPQ12OUTP1"
      >Question [12]</a
    >, <a href="XP012.html#XPQ12A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But without grace it
    is impossible to avoid sins. Therefore, since each sin excludes grace, it is
    not possible to make satisfaction for one sin and not for another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that it is possible to make
    satisfaction for one sin and not for another, as the Master states (Sent.
    iv, D, 15). But this cannot be. For since the previous offense has to be
    removed by satisfaction, the mode of satisfaction must needs be consistent
    with the removal of the offense. Now removal of offense is renewal of
    friendship: wherefore if there be anything to hinder the renewal of
    friendship there can be no satisfaction. Since, therefore, every sin is a
    hindrance to the friendship of charity, which is the friendship of man for
    God, it is impossible for man to make satisfaction for one sin while holding
    to another: even as neither would a man make satisfaction to another for a
    blow, if while throwing himself at his feet he were to give him another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As sins are not connected together in
    some single one, a man can incur one without incurring another; whereas all
    sins are remitted by reason of one same thing, so that the remissions of
    various sins are connected together. Consequently satisfaction cannot be
    made for one and not for another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man is under obligation to
    another by reason of a debt, the only inequality between them is that which
    is opposed to justice, so that for restitution nothing further is required
    than that the equality of justice should be reinstated, and this can be done
    in respect of one debt without another. But when the obligation is based on
    an offense, there is inequality not only of justice but also of friendship,
    so that for the offense to be removed by satisfaction, not only must the
    equality of justice be restored by the payment of a punishment equal to the
    offense, but also the equality of friendship must be reinstated, which is
    impossible so long as an obstacle to friendship remains.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By its weight, one sin drags us down to
    another, as Gregory says (Moral. xxv): so that when a man holds to one sin,
    he does not sufficiently cut himself off from the causes of further sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether, when deprived of charity, a man can make satisfaction for sins for
    which he was previously contrite?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that if a man fall into sin after
    being contrite for all his sins, he can, now that he has lost charity,
    satisfy for his other sins which were already pardoned him through his
    contrition. For Daniel said to Nabuchodonosor (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++4%3A24"
      >Dan. 4:24</a
    >): "Redeem thou thy sins with alms." Yet he was still a sinner, as is shown
    by his subsequent punishment. Therefore a man can make satisfaction while in
    a state of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of
    love or hatred" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++9%3A1"
      >Eccles. 9:1</a
    >). If therefore one cannot make satisfaction unless one be in a state of
    charity, it would be impossible to know whether one had made satisfaction,
    which would be unseemly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man's entire action takes its form
    from the intention which he had at the beginning. But a penitent is in a
    state of charity when he begins to repent. Therefore his whole subsequent
    satisfaction will derive its efficacy from the charity which quickens his
    intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, satisfaction consists in a certain
    equalization of guilt to punishment. But these things can be equalized even
    in one who is devoid of charity. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "Charity covereth all sins" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++10%3A12"
      >Prov. 10:12</a
    >). But satisfaction has the power of blotting out sins. Therefore it is
    powerless without charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the chief work of satisfaction is almsdeeds. But alms given by one
    who is devoid of charity avail nothing, as is clearly stated 1 Cor. 13:3,
    "If I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor... and have not
    charity, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore there can be no satisfaction
    with mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that if, when all a man's sins
    have been pardoned through contrition, and before he has made satisfaction
    for them, he falls into sin, and then makes satisfaction, such satisfaction
    will be valid, so that if he die in that sin, he will not be punished in
    hell for the other sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this cannot be, because satisfaction requires the reinstatement of
    friendship and the restoration of the equality of justice, the contrary of
    which destroys friendship, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ix, 1,3). Now
    in satisfaction made to God, the equality is based, not on equivalence but
    rather on God's acceptation: so that, although the offense be already
    removed by previous contrition, the works of satisfaction must be acceptable
    to God, and for this they are dependent on charity. Consequently works done
    without charity are not satisfactory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Daniel's advice meant that he should
    give up sin and repent, and so make satisfaction by giving alms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as man knows not for certain
    whether he had charity when making satisfaction, or whether he has it now,
    so too he knows not for certain whether he made full satisfaction: wherefore
    it is written (Ecclus. 5:5): "Be not without fear about sin forgiven." And
    yet man need not, on account of that fear, repeat the satisfaction made, if
    he is not conscious of a mortal sin. For although he may not have expiated
    his punishment by that satisfaction, he does not incur the guilt of omission
    through neglecting to make satisfaction; even as he who receives the
    Eucharist without being conscious of a mortal sin of which he is guilty,
    does not incur the guilt of receiving unworthily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> His intention was interrupted by his
    subsequent sin, so that it gives no virtue to the works done after that
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Sufficient equalization is impossible
    both as to the Divine acceptation and as to equivalence: so that the
    argument proves nothing.<br />

    Whether previous satisfaction begins to avail after man is restored to
    charity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that when a man has recovered
    charity his previous satisfaction begins to avail, because a gloss on Lev.
    25:25, "If thy brother being impoverished," etc., says that "the fruit of a
    man's good works should be counted from the time when he sinned." But they
    would not be counted, unless they derived some efficacy from his subsequent
    charity. Therefore they begin to avail after he recovers charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the efficacy of satisfaction is
    hindered by sin, so the efficacy of Baptism is hindered by insincerity. Now
    Baptism begins to avail when insincerity ceases. Therefore satisfaction
    begins to avail when sin is taken away.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a man is given as a penance for the
    sins he has committed, to fast for several days, and then, after falling
    again into sin, he completes his penance, he is not told, when he goes to
    confession a second time, to fast once again. But he would be told to do so,
    if he did not fulfill his duty of satisfaction by them. Therefore his
    previous works become valid unto satisfaction, through his subsequent
    repentance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Works done without charity were not
    satisfactory, through being dead works. But they are not quickened by
    penance. Therefore they do not begin to be satisfactory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, charity does not quicken a work, unless in some way that work
    proceeds therefrom. But works cannot be acceptable to God, and therefore
    cannot be satisfactory, unless they be quickened by charity. Since then the
    works done without charity, in no way proceeded from charity, nor ever can
    proceed therefrom, they can by no means count towards satisfaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that works done while in a state
    of charity, which are called living works, are meritorious in respect of
    eternal life, and satisfactory in respect of paying off the debt of
    punishment; and that by subsequent charity, works done without charity are
    quickened so as to be satisfactory, but not so as to be meritorious of
    eternal life. But this is impossible, because works done in charity produce
    both these effects for the same reason, viz. because they are pleasing to
    God: wherefore just as charity by its advent cannot make works done without
    charity to be pleasing in one respect, so neither can it make them pleasing
    in the other respect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This means that the fruits are reckoned,
    not from the time when he was first in sin, but from the time when he ceased
    to sin, when, to wit, he was last in sin; unless he was contrite as soon as
    he had sinned, and did many good actions before he confessed. Or we may say
    that the greater the contrition the more it alleviates the punishment, and
    the more good actions a man does while in sin, the more he disposes himself
    to the grace of contrition, so that it is probable that he owes a smaller
    debt of punishment. For this reason the priest should use discretion in
    taking them into account, so as to give him a lighter penance, according as
    he finds him better disposed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism imprints a character on the
    soul, whereas satisfaction does not. Hence on the advent of charity, which
    removes both insincerity and sin, it causes Baptism to have its effect,
    whereas it does not do this for satisfaction. Moreover Baptism confers
    justification in virtue of the deed [ex opere operato] which is not man's
    deed but God's, wherefore it does not become a lifeless deed as satisfaction
    does, which is a deed of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes satisfaction is such as to
    leave an effect in the person who makes satisfaction, even after the act of
    satisfaction has been done; thus fasting leaves the body weak, and almsdeeds
    result in a diminution of a person's substance, and so on. In such cases
    there is no need to repeat the works of satisfaction if they have been done
    while in a state of sin, because through penance they are acceptable to God
    in the result they leave behind. But when a work of satisfaction leaves
    behind no effect in the person that does satisfaction, it needs to be
    repeated, as in the case of prayer and so forth. Interior works, since they
    pass away altogether, are nowise quickened, and must be repeated.<br />

    Whether works done without charity merit any, at least temporal, good?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that works done without charity
    merit some, at least a temporal, good. For as punishment is to the evil act,
    so is reward to a good act. Now no evil deed is unpunished by God the just
    judge. Therefore no good deed is unrewarded, and so every good deed merits
    some good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, reward is not given except for merit.
    Now some reward is given for works done without charity, wherefore it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A2,5,16"
      >Mt. 6:2,5,16</a
    >) of those who do good actions for the sake of human glory, that "they have
    received their reward." Therefore those works merit some good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there be two men both in sin, one of
    whom does many deeds that are good in themselves and in their circumstances,
    while the other does none, they are not equally near to the reception of
    good things from Gods else the latter need not be advised to do any good
    deeds. Now he that is nearer to God receives more of His good things.
    Therefore the former, on account of his good works, merits some good from
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says that "the sinner is not worthy
    of the bread he eats." Therefore he cannot merit anything from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, he that is nothing, can merit nothing. But a sinner, through not
    having charity, is nothing in respect of spiritual being, according to 1
    Cor. 13:2. Therefore he can merit nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking a merit is an action on
    account of which it is just that the agent should be given something. Now
    justice is twofold: first, there is justice properly so called, which
    regards something due on the part of the recipient. Secondly, there is
    metaphorical justice, so to speak, which regards something due on the part
    of the giver, for it may be right for the giver to give something to which
    the receiver has no claim. In this sense the "fitness of the Divine
    goodness" is justice; thus Anselm says (Proslog. x) that "God is just when
    He spares the sinner, because this is befitting." And in this way merit is
    also twofold. The first is an act in respect of which the agent himself has
    a claim to receive something, and this is called merit of "condignity." The
    second is an act the result of which is that there is a duty of giving in
    the giver by reason of fittingness, wherefore it is called merit of
    "congruity." Now since in all gratuitous givings, the primary reason of the
    giving is love, it is impossible for anyone, properly speaking, to lay claim
    to a gift, if he lack friendship. Wherefore, as all things, whether temporal
    or eternal, are bestowed on us by the bounty of God, no one can acquire a
    claim to any of them, save through charity towards God: so that works done
    without charity are not condignly meritorious of any good from God either
    eternal or temporal. But since it is befitting the goodness of God, that
    wherever He finds a disposition He should grant the perfection, a man is
    said to merit congruously some good by means of good works done without
    charity. Accordingly suchlike works avail for a threefold good, acquisition
    of temporal goods, disposition to grace, habituation to good works. Since,
    however, this is not merit properly so called, we should grant that such
    works are not meritorious of any good, rather than that they are.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Philosopher states (Ethic. viii,
    14), since no matter what a son may do, he can never give back to his father
    the equal of what he has received from him a father can never become his
    son's debtor: and much less can man make God his debtor on account of
    equivalence of work. Consequently no work of ours can merit a reward by
    reason of its measure of goodness, but it can by reason of charity, which
    makes friends hold their possessions in common. Therefore, no matter how
    good a work may be, if it be done without charity, it does not give man a
    claim to receive anything from God. On the other hand, an evil deed deserves
    an equivalent punishment according to the measure of its malice, because no
    evil has been done to us on the part of God, like the good which He has
    done. Therefore, although an evil deed deserves condign punishment,
    nevertheless a good deed without charity does not merit condign reward.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> and 3: These arguments consider merit of
    congruity; while the other arguments consider merit of condignity.<br />

    Whether the aforesaid works avail for the mitigation of the pains of
    hell?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the aforesaid works do not
    avail for the mitigation of the pains of hell. For the measure of punishment
    in hell will answer to the measure of guilt. But works done without charity
    do not diminish the measure of guilt. Neither, therefore, do they lessen the
    pains of hell.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the pain of hell, though infinite in
    duration, is nevertheless finite in intensity. Now anything finite is done
    away with by finite subtraction. If therefore works done without charity
    canceled any of the punishment due for sins, those works might be so
    numerous, that the pain of hell would be done away with altogether: which is
    false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the suffrages of the Church are more
    efficacious than works done without charity. But, according to Augustine
    (Enchiridion cx), "the suffrages of the Church do not profit the damned in
    hell." Much less therefore are those pains mitigated by works done without
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine also says (Enchiridion cx):
    "Whomsoever they profit, either receive a full pardon, or at least find
    damnation itself more tolerable."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is a greater thing to do a good deed than to omit an evil deed.
    But the omission of an evil deed always avoids a punishment, even in one who
    lacks charity. Much more, therefore, do good deeds void punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Mitigation of the pains of hell can be
    understood in two ways: first, as though one were delivered from the
    punishment which he already deserved, and thus, since no one is delivered
    from punishment unless he be absolved from guilt, (for an effect is not
    diminished or taken away unless its cause be diminished or taken away), the
    pain of hell cannot be mitigated by works done without charity, since they
    are unable to remove or diminish guilt. Secondly, so that the demerit of
    punishment is hindered; and thus the aforesaid works diminish the pain of
    hell---first because he who does such works escapes being guilty of omitting
    them---secondly, because such works dispose one somewhat to good, so that a
    man sins from less contempt, and indeed is drawn away from many sins
    thereby.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    These works do, however merit a diminution or postponement of temporal
    punishment, as in the case of Achab (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++21%3A27,+seqq+"
      >3 Kgs. 21:27, seqq.</a
    >), as also the acquisition of temporal goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, say that they mitigate the pains of hell, not by subtracting
    any of their substance, but by strengthening the subject, so that he is more
    able to bear them. But this is impossible, because there is no strengthening
    without a diminution of passibility. Now passibility is according to the
    measure of guilt, wherefore if guilt is not removed, neither can the subject
    be strengthened.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some again say that the punishment is mitigated as to the remorse of
    conscience, though not as to the pain of fire. But neither will this stand,
    because as the pain of fire is equal to the guilt, so also is the pain of
    the remorse of conscience: so that what applies to one applies to the
    other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>
