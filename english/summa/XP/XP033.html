<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the repetition of this sacrament: under which head 
there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP033.html#XPQ33A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether this sacrament ought to be repeated?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP033.html#XPQ33A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it ought to be repeated during the same sickness?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament ought not to be repeated. For 
the anointing of a man is of greater import than the anointing of a 
stone. But the anointing of an altar is not repeated, unless the altar be 
shattered. Neither, therefore, should Extreme Unction, whereby a man is 
anointed, be repeated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing comes after what is extreme. But this unction is 
called extreme. Therefore it should not be repeated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> This sacrament is a spiritual healing applied  under 
the form of a bodily cure. But a bodily cure is repeated. Therefore this 
sacrament also can be repeated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> No sacramental or sacrament, having an effect that lasts 
for ever, can be repeated, because this would imply that the sacrament 
had failed to produce that effect; and this would be derogatory to the 
sacrament. On the other hand a sacrament whose effect does not last for 
ever, can be repeated without disparaging that sacrament, in order that 
the lost effect may be recovered. And since health of body and soul, 
which is the effect of this sacrament, can be lost after it has been 
effected, it follows that this sacrament can, without disparagement 
thereto, be repeated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The stone is anointed in order that the altar may be 
consecrated, and the stone remains consecrated, as long as the altar 
remains, hence it cannot be anointed again. But a man is not consecrated 
by being anointed, since it does not imprint a character on him. Hence 
there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What men think to be extreme is not always extreme in 
reality. It is thus that this sacrament is called Extreme Unction, 
because it ought not to be given save to those whose death men think to 
be nigh.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this sacrament ought to be repeated during the same sickness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament ought not to be repeated during 
the same sickness. For one disease demands one remedy. Now this sacrament 
is a spiritual remedy. Therefore it ought not to be repeated for one 
sickness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a sick man could be anointed more than once during 
one disease, this might be done for a whole day: which is absurd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Sometimes a disease lasts long after the sacrament has 
been received, so that the remnants of sin, against which chiefly this 
sacrament is given, would be contracted. Therefore it ought to be given 
again.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[33] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament regards not only the sickness, but also 
the state of the sick man, because it ought not to be given except to 
those sick people who seem, in man's estimation, to be nigh to death. Now 
some diseases do not last long; so that if this sacrament is given at the 
time that the sick man is in a state of danger of death, he does not 
leave that state except the disease be cured, and thus he needs not to be 
anointed again. But if he has a relapse, it will be a second sickness, 
and he can be anointed again. on the other hand some diseases are of long 
duration, as hectic fever, dropsy and the like, and those who lie sick of 
them should not be anointed until they seem to be in danger of death. And 
if the sick man escape that danger while the disease continues,  and be 
brought again thereby to the same state of danger, he can be anointed 
again, because it is, as it were, another state of sickness, although 
strictly speaking, it is not another sickness. This suffices for the 
Replies to the Objections.<br>
