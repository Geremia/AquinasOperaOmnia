  <h3 align="left">
    Whether subtlety is a property of the glorified body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that subtlety is not a property of
    the glorified body. For the properties of glory surpass the properties of
    nature, even as the clarity of glory surpasses the clarity of the sun, which
    is the greatest in nature. Accordingly if subtlety be a property of the
    glorified body, it would seem that the glorified body will be more subtle
    than anything which is subtle in nature, and thus it will be "more subtle
    than the wind and the air," which was condemned by Gregory in the city of
    Constantinople, as he relates (Moral. xiv, 56).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as heat and cold are simple qualities of
    bodies, i.e. of the elements, so is subtlety. But heat and other qualities
    of the elements will not be intensified in the glorified bodies any more
    than they are now, in fact, they will be more reduced to the mean. Neither,
    therefore, will subtlety be in them more than it is now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, subtlety is in bodies as a result of
    scarcity of matter, wherefore bodies that have less matter within equal
    dimensions are said to be more subtle; as fire in comparison with air, and
    air as compared with water, and water as compared with earth. But there will
    be as much matter in the glorified bodies as there is now, nor will their
    dimensions be greater. Therefore they will not be more subtle then than
    now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A44"
      >1 Cor. 15:44</a
    >): "It is sown a corruptible body, it shall rise a spiritual," i.e. a
    spirit-like, "body." But the subtlety of a spirit surpasses all bodily
    subtlety. Therefore the glorified bodies will be most subtle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the more subtle a body is the more exalted it is. But the glorified
    bodies will be most exalted. Therefore they will be most subtle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Subtlety takes its name from the power to
    penetrate. Hence it is said in De Gener. ii that "a subtle thing fills all
    the parts and the parts of parts." Now that a body has the power of
    penetrating may happen through two causes. First, through smallness of
    quantity, especially in respect of depth and breadth, but not of length,
    because penetration regards depth, wherefore length is not an obstacle to
    penetration. Secondly, through paucity of matter, wherefore rarity is
    synonymous with subtlety: and since in rare bodies the form is more
    predominant over the matter, the term "subtlety" has been transferred to
    those bodies which are most perfectly subject to their form, and are most
    fully perfected thereby: thus we speak of subtlety in the sun and moon and
    like bodies, just as gold and similar things may be called subtle, when they
    are most perfectly complete in their specific being and power. And since
    incorporeal things lack quantity and matter, the term "subtlety" is applied
    to them, not only by reason of their substance, but also on account of their
    power. For just as a subtle thing is said to be penetrative, for the reason
    that it reaches to the inmost part of a thing, so is an intellect said to be
    subtle because it reaches to the insight of the intrinsic principles and the
    hidden natural properties of a thing. In like manner a person is said to
    have subtle sight, because he is able to perceive by sight things of the
    smallest size: and the same applies to the other senses. Accordingly people
    have differed by ascribing subtlety to the glorified bodies in different
    ways.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For certain heretics, as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei xiii, 22), ascribed
    to them the subtlety whereby spiritual substances are said to be subtle: and
    they said that at the resurrection the body will be transformed into a
    spirit, and that for this reason the Apostle describes as being "spiritual"
    the bodies of those who rise again (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A44"
      >1 Cor. 15:44</a
    >). But this cannot be maintained. First, because a body cannot be changed
    into a spirit, since there is no community of matter between them: and
    Boethius proves this (De Duab. Nat.). Secondly, because, if this were
    possible, and one's body were changed into a spirit, one would not rise
    again a man, for a man naturally consists of a soul and body. Thirdly,
    because if this were the Apostle's meaning, just as he speaks of spiritual
    bodies, so would he speak of natural [animale] bodies, as being changed into
    souls [animam]: and this is clearly false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence certain heretics said that the body will remain at the resurrection,
    but that it will be endowed with subtlety by means of rarefaction, so that
    human bodies in rising again will be like the air or the wind, as Gregory
    relates (Moral. xiv, 56). But this again cannot be maintained, because our
    Lord had a palpable body after the Resurrection, as appears from the last
    chapter of Luke, and we must believe that His body was supremely subtle.
    Moreover the human body will rise again with flesh and bones, as did the
    body of our Lord, according to Lk. 24:39, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones
    as you see Me to have," and Job 19:26, "In my flesh I shall see God," my
    Saviour: and the nature of flesh and bone is incompatible with the aforesaid
    rarity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently another kind of subtlety must be assigned to glorified bodies,
    by saying that they are subtle on account of the most complete perfection of
    the body. But this completeness is explained by some in relation to the
    fifth, or heavenly, essence, which will be then predominant in them. This,
    however, is impossible, since first of all the fifth essence can nowise
    enter into the composition of a body, as we have shown above (Sent. D, 12,
    qu. 1). Secondly, because granted that it entered into the composition of
    the human body, it would be impossible to account for its having a greater
    predominance over the elemental nature then than now, unless---either the
    amount of the heavenly nature in human bodies were increased (thus human
    bodies would not be of the same stature, unless perhaps elemental matter in
    man were decreased, which is inconsistent with the integrity of those who
    rise again)---or unless elemental nature were endowed with the properties of
    the heavenly nature through the latter's dominion over the body, and in that
    case a natural power would be the cause of a property of glory, which seems
    absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others say that the aforesaid completeness by reason of which human
    bodies are said to be subtle will result from the dominion of the glorified
    soul (which is the form of the body) over the body, by reason of which
    dominion the glorified body is said to be "spiritual," as being wholly
    subject to the spirit. The first subjection whereby the body is subject to
    the soul is to the effect of its participating in its specific being, in so
    far as it is subject to the soul as matter to form; and secondly it is
    subject to the soul in respect of the other operations of the soul, in so
    far as the soul is a principle of movement. Consequently the first reason
    for spirituality in the body is subtlety, and, after that, agility and the
    other properties of a glorified body. Hence the Apostle, as the masters
    expound, in speaking of spirituality indicates subtlety: wherefore Gregory
    says (Moral. xiv, 56) that "the glorified body is said to be subtle as a
    result of a spiritual power."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections which refer to the subtlety
    of rarefaction.<br />

    Whether by reason of this subtlety a glorified body is able to be in the
    same place with another body not glorified?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that by reason of this subtlety a
    body is able to be in the same place with another body not glorified. For
    according to Phil. 3:21, "He will reform the body of our lowness made like
    to the body of His glory." Now the body of Christ was able to be in the same
    place with another body, as appears from the fact that after His
    Resurrection He went in to His disciples, the doors being shut (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A19,26"
      >Jn. 20:19,26</a
    >). Therefore also the glorified bodies by reason of their subtlety will be
    able to be in the same place with other bodies not glorified.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, glorified bodies will be superior to all
    other bodies. Yet by reason of their superiority certain bodies, to wit the
    solar rays, are able now to occupy the same place together with other
    bodies. Much more therefore is this befitting glorified bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a heavenly body cannot be severed, at
    least as regards the substance of the spheres: hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+37%3A18"
      >Job 37:18</a
    >) that "the heavens... are most strong, as if they were of molten brass."
    If then the subtlety of a glorified body will not enable it to be in the
    same place together with another body, it will never be able to ascend to
    the empyrean,* and this is erroneous. [*The empyrean was the highest of the
    concentric spheres or heavens, and was identified by Christian writers with
    the abode of God. Cf. FP, Question [56], Article [3]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a body which is unable to be in the same
    place with another body can be hindered in its movement or even surrounded
    by others standing in its way. But this cannot happen to glorified bodies.
    Therefore they will be able to be together in the same place with other
    bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as point is to point, so is line to
    line, surface to surface, and body to body. Now two points can be
    coincident, as in the case of two lines touching one another, and two lines
    when two surfaces are in contact with one another, and two surfaces when two
    bodies touch one another, because "contiguous things are those whose
    boundaries coincide" (Phys. vi, 6). Therefore it is not against the nature
    of a body to be in the same place together with another body. Now whatever
    excellence is competent to the nature of a body will all be bestowed on the
    glorified body. Therefore a glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, will
    be able to be in the same place together with another body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Trin. i): "Difference of
    accidents makes distinction in number. For three men differ not in genus,
    nor in species, but in their accidents. If we were to remove absolutely
    every accident from them, still each one has a different place; and it is
    quite conceivable that they should all occupy the same place." Therefore if
    we suppose two bodies to occupy the same place, there will be but one body
    numerically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It cannot be maintained that a glorified body,
    by reason of its subtlety, is able to be in the same place with another
    body, unless the obstacle to its being now in the same place with another
    body be removed by that subtlety. Some say that in the present state this
    obstacle is its grossness by virtue of which it is able to occupy a place;
    and that this grossness is removed by the gift of subtlety. But there are
    two reasons why this cannot be maintained. First, because the grossness
    which the gift of subtlety removes is a kind of defect, for instance an
    inordinateness of matter in not being perfectly subject to its form. For all
    that pertains to the integrity of the body will rise again in the body, both
    as regards the matter and as regards the form. And the fact that a body is
    able to fill a place belongs to it by reason of that which pertains to its
    integrity, and not on account of any defect of nature. For since fulness is
    opposed to vacancy, that alone does not fill a place, which being put in a
    place, nevertheless leaves a place vacant. Now a vacuum is defined by the
    Philosopher (Phys. iv, 6,7) as being "a place not filled by a sensible
    body." And a body is said to be sensible by reason of its matter, form, and
    natural accidents, all of which pertain to the integrity of nature. It is
    also plain that the glorified body will be sensible even to touch, as
    evidenced by the body of our Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A39"
      >Lk. 24:39</a
    >): nor will it lack matter, or form, or natural accidents, namely heat,
    cold, and so forth. Hence it is evident that the glorified body, the gift of
    subtlety notwithstanding, will fill a place: for it would seem madness to
    say that the place in which there will be a glorified body will be empty.
    Secondly their aforesaid argument does not avail, because to hinder the
    co-existence of a body in the same place is more than to fill a place. For
    if we suppose dimensions separate from matter, those dimensions do not fill
    a place. Hence some who held the possibility of a vacuum, said that a vacuum
    is a place wherein such like dimensions exist apart from a sensible body;
    and yet those dimensions hinder another body from being together with them
    in the same place. This is made clear by the Philosopher (Phys. iv, 1,8;
    Metaph. ii, 2), where he considers it impossible for a mathematical body,
    which is nothing but separate dimensions, to be together with another
    natural sensible body. Consequently, granted that the subtlety of a
    glorified body hindered it from filling a place, nevertheless it would not
    follow that for this reason it is able to be in the same place with another
    body, since the removal of the lesser does not involve the removal of the
    greater.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must say that the obstacle to our body's being now in the
    same place with another body can nowise be removed by the gift of subtlety.
    For nothing can prevent a body from occupying the same place together with
    another body, except something in it that requires a different place: since
    nothing is an obstacle to identity, save that which is a cause of
    distinction. Now this distinction of place is not required by any quality of
    the body, because a body demands a place, not by reason of its quality:
    wherefore if we remove from a body the fact of its being hot or cold, heavy
    or light, it still retains the necessity of the aforesaid distinction, as
    the Philosopher proves (Phys. iv), and as is self-evident. In like manner
    neither can matter cause the necessity of the aforesaid distinction, because
    matter does not occupy a place except through its dimensive quantity. Again
    neither does form occupy a place, unless it have a place through its matter.
    It remains therefore that the necessity for two bodies occupying each a
    distinct place results from the nature of dimensive quantity, to which a
    place is essentially befitting. For this forms part of its definition, since
    dimensive quantity is quantity occupying a place. Hence it is that if we
    remove all else in a thing from it, the necessity of this distinction is
    found in its dimensive quantity alone. Thus take the example of a separate
    line, supposing there to be two such lines, or two parts of one line, they
    must needs occupy distinct places, else one line added to another would not
    make something greater, and this is against common sense. The same applies
    to surfaces and mathematical bodies. And since matter demands place, through
    being the subject of dimension, the aforesaid necessity results in placed
    matter, so that just as it is impossible for there to be two lines, or two
    parts of a line, unless they occupy distinct places, so is it impossible for
    there to be two matters, or two parts of matter, without there be
    distinction of place. And since distinction of matter is the principle of
    the distinction between individuals, it follows that, as Boethius says (De
    Trin.), "we cannot possibly conceive two bodies occupying one place," so
    that this distinction of individuals requires this difference of accidents.
    Now subtlety does not deprive the glorified body of its dimension; wherefore
    it nowise removes from it the aforesaid necessity of occupying a distinct
    place from another body. Therefore the subtlety of a glorified body will not
    enable it to be in the same place together with another body, but it will be
    possible for it to be together with another body by the operation of the
    Divine power: even as the body of Peter had the power whereby the sick were
    healed at the passing of Peter's shadow (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+5%3A15"
      >Acts 5:15</a
    >) not through any inherent property, but by the power of God for the
    upbuilding of the faith. Thus will the Divine power make it possible for a
    glorified body to be in the same place together with another body for the
    perfection of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That Christ's body was able to be
    together with another body in the same place was not due to its subtlety,
    but resulted from the power of His Godhead after His resurrection, even as
    in His birth [*Cf. TP, Question [28], Article [2], ad 3]. Hence Gregory says
    (Hom. xxvi in Evang.): "The same body went into His disciples the doors
    being shut, which to human eyes came from the closed womb of the Virgin at
    His birth." Therefore there is no reason why this should be befitting to
    glorified bodies on account of their subtlety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Light is not a body as we have said
    above (Sent. ii, <a href="XP013.html#XPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="XP013.html#XPQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP067.html#FPQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP067.html#FPQ67A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): hence the
    objection proceeds on a false supposition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The glorified body will pass through the
    heavenly spheres without severing them, not by virtue of its subtlety, but
    by the Divine power, which will assist them in all things at will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> From the fact that God will come to the
    aid of the blessed at will in whatever they desire, it follows that they
    cannot be surrounded or imprisoned.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As stated in Phys. iv, 5, "a point is
    not in a place": hence if it be said to be in a place, this is only
    accidental, because the body of which it is a term is in a place. And just
    as the whole place corresponds to the whole body, so the term of the place
    corresponds to the term of the body. But it happens that two places have one
    term, even as two lines terminate in one point. And consequently though two
    bodies must needs be in distinct places, yet the same term of two places
    corresponds to the two terms of the two bodies. It is in this sense that the
    bounds of contiguous bodies are said to coincide.<br />

    Whether it is possible, by a miracle, for two bodies to be in the same

  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not even by a miracle is it
    possible for two bodies to be in the same place. For it is not possible
    that, by a miracle, two bodies be at once two and one, since this would
    imply that contradictions are true at the same time. But if we suppose two
    bodies to be in the same place, it would follow that those two bodies are
    one. Therefore this cannot be done by a miracle. The minor is proved thus.
    Suppose two bodies A and B to be in the same place. The dimensions of A will
    either be the same as the dimensions of the place, or they will differ from
    them. If they differ, then some of the dimensions will be separate: which is
    impossible, since the dimensions that are within the bounds of a place are
    not in a subject unless they be in a placed body. If they be the same, then
    for the same reason the dimensions of B will be the same as the dimensions
    of the place. "Now things that are the same with one and the same thing are
    the same with one another." Therefore the dimensions of A and B are the
    same. But two bodies cannot have identical dimensions just as they cannot
    have the same whiteness. Therefore A and B are one body and yet they were
    two. Therefore they are at the same time one and two.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing cannot be done miraculously
    either against the common principles---for instance that the part be not
    less than the whole; since what is contrary to common principles implies a
    direct contradiction---or contrary to the conclusions of geometry which are
    infallible deductions from common principles---for instance that the three
    angles of a triangle should not be equal to two right angles. In like manner
    nothing can be done to a line that is contrary to the definition of a line,
    because to sever the definition from the defined is to make two
    contradictories true at the same time. Now it is contrary to common
    principles, both to the conclusions of geometry and to the definition of a
    line, for two bodies to be in the same place. Therefore this cannot be done
    by a miracle. The minor is proved as follows: It is a conclusion of geometry
    that two circles touch one another only at a point. Now if two circular
    bodies were in the same place, the two circles described in them would touch
    one another as a whole. Again it is contrary to the definition of a line
    that there be more than one straight line between two points: yet this would
    be the case were two bodies in the same place, since between two given
    points in the various surfaces of the place, there would be two straight
    lines corresponding to the two bodies in that place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it would seem impossible that by a
    miracle a body which is enclosed within another should not be in a place,
    for then it would have a common and not a proper place, and this is
    impossible. Yet this would follow if two bodies were in the same place.
    Therefore this cannot be done by a miracle. The minor is proved thus.
    Supposing two bodies to be in the same place, the one being greater than the
    other as to every dimension, the lesser body will be enclosed in the
    greater, and the place occupied by the greater body will be its common
    place; while it will have no proper place, because no given surface of the
    body will contain it, and this is essential to place. Therefore it will not
    have a proper place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, place corresponds in proportion to the
    thing placed. Now it can never happen by a miracle that the same body is at
    the same time in different places, except by some kind of transformation, as
    in the Sacrament of the Altar. Therefore it can nowise happen by a miracle
    that two bodies be together in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Blessed Virgin gave birth to her Son by a
    miracle. Now in this hallowed birth it was necessary for two bodies to be
    together in the same place, because the body of her child when coming forth
    did not break through the enclosure of her virginal purity. Therefore it is
    possible for two bodies to be miraculously together in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, this may again be proved from the fact that our Lord went in to His
    disciples, the doors being shut (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A19,+26"
      >Jn. 20:19, 26</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As shown above (<a
      href="XP083.html#XPQ83A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) the reason why two bodies must needs be in two places is that distinction
    in matter requires distinction in place. Wherefore we observe that when two
    bodies merge into one, each loses its distinct being, and one indistinct
    being accrues to the two combined, as in the case of mixtures. Hence it is
    impossible for two bodies to remain two and yet be together unless each
    retain its distinct being which it had hitherto, in so much as each of them
    was a being undivided in itself and distinct from others. Now this distinct
    being depends on the essential principles of a thing as on its proximate
    causes, but on God as on the first cause. And since the first cause can
    preserve a thing in being, though the second causes be done away, as appears
    from the first proposition of De Causis, therefore by God's power and by
    that alone it is possible for an accident to be without substance as in the
    Sacrament of the Altar. Likewise by the power of God, and by that alone, it
    is possible for a body to retain its distinct being from that of another
    body, although its matter be not distinct as to place from the matter of the
    other body: and thus it is possible by a miracle for two bodies to be
    together in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is sophistical because it
    is based on a false supposition, or begs the question. For it supposes the
    existence, between two opposite superficies of a place, of a dimension
    proper to the place, with which dimension a dimension of the body put in
    occupation of the place would have to be identified: because it would then
    follow that the dimensions of two bodies occupying a place would become one
    dimension, if each of them were identified with the dimension of the place.
    But this supposition is false, because if it were true whenever a body
    acquires a new place, it would follow that a change takes place in the
    dimensions of the place or of thing placed: since it is impossible for two
    things to become one anew, except one of them be changed. Whereas if, as is
    the case in truth, no other dimensions belong to a place than those of the
    thing occupying the place, it is clear that the argument proves nothing, but
    begs the question, because according to this nothing else has been said, but
    that the dimensions of a thing placed are the same as the dimensions of the
    place; excepting that the dimensions of the thing placed are contained
    within the bounds of the place, and that the distance between the bounds of
    a place is commensurate with the distance between the bounds of the thing
    placed, just as the former would be distant by their own dimensions if they
    had them. Thus that the dimensions of two bodies be the dimensions of one
    place is nothing else than that two bodies be in the same place, which is
    the chief question at issue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Granted that by a miracle two bodies be
    together in the same place, nothing follows either against common
    principles, or against the definition of a line, or against any conclusions
    of geometry. For, as stated above (<a href="XP083.html#XPQ83A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), dimensive quantity differs from all other accidents in that it has a
    special reason of individuality and distinction, namely on account of the
    placing of the parts, besides the reason of individuality and distinction
    which is common to it and all other accidents, arising namely from the
    matter which is its subject. Thus then one line may be understood as being
    distinct from another, either because it is in another subject (in which
    case we are considering a material line), or because it is placed at a
    distance from another (in which case we are considering a mathematical line,
    which is understood apart from matter). Accordingly if we remove matter,
    there can be no distinction between lines save in respect of a different
    placing: and in like manner neither can there be a distinction of points,
    nor of superficies, nor of any dimensions whatever. Consequently geometry
    cannot suppose one line to be added to another, as being distinct therefrom
    unless it be distinct as to place. But supposing by a Divine miracle a
    distinction of subject without a distinction of place, we can understand a
    distinction of lines; and these are not distant from one another in place,
    on account of the distinction of subjects. Again we can understand a
    difference of points, and thus different lines described on two bodies that
    are in the same place are drawn from different points to different points;
    for the point that we take is not a point fixed in the place, but in the
    placed body, because a line is not said to be drawn otherwise than from a
    point which is its term. In like manner the two circles described in two
    spherical bodies that occupy the same place are two, not on account of the
    difference of place, else they could not touch one another as a whole, but
    on account of the distinction of subjects, and thus while wholly touching
    one another they still remain two. Even so a circle described by a placed
    spherical body touches, as a whole, the other circle described by the
    locating body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God could make a body not to be in a
    place; and yet supposing this, it would not follow that a certain body is
    not in a place, because the greater body is the place of the lesser body, by
    reason of its superficies which is described by contact with the terms of
    the lesser body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is impossible for one body to be
    miraculously in two places locally (for Christ's body is not locally on the
    altar), although it is possible by a miracle for two bodies to be in the
    same place. Because to be in several places at once is incompatible with the
    individual, by reason of its having being undivided in itself, for it would
    follow that it is divided as to place. on the other hand, to be in the same
    place with another body is incompatible with the individual as distinct from
    aught else. Now the nature of unity is perfected in indivision (Metaph. v),
    whereas distinction from others is a result of the nature of unity.
    Wherefore that one same body be locally in several places at once implies a
    contradiction, even as for a man to lack reason, while for two bodies to be
    in the same place does not imply a contradiction, as explained above. Hence
    the comparison fails.<br />

    Whether one glorified body can be in the same place together with another
    glorified body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a glorified body can be in the
    same place together with another glorified body. Because where there is
    greater subtlety there is less resistance. If then a glorified body is more
    subtle than a non-glorified body, it will offer less resistance to a
    glorified body: and so if a glorified body can be in the same place with a
    non-glorified body, much more can it with a glorified body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, even as a glorified body will be more
    subtle than a non-glorified body, so will one glorified body be more subtle
    than another. Therefore if a glorified body can be in the same place with a
    non-glorified body, a more subtle glorified body can be in the same place
    with a less subtle glorified body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the body of heaven is subtle, and will
    then be glorified. Now the glorified body of a saint will be able to be in
    the same place with the body of heaven, since the saints will be able at
    will to travel to and from earth. Therefore two glorified bodies will be
    able to occupy the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The glorified bodies will be spiritual, that
    is like spirits in a certain respect. Now two spirits cannot be in the same
    place, although a body and a spirit can be in the same place, as stated
    above (Sent. i, D, 37, <a href="XP003.html#XPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="XP003.html#XPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,

    <a href="../FP/FP052.html#FPQ52A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore neither
    will two glorified bodies be able to be in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, if two bodies occupy the same place, one is penetrated by the
    other. But to be penetrated is a mark of imperfection which will be
    altogether absent from the glorified bodies. Therefore it will be impossible
    for two glorified bodies to be in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The property of a glorified body does not make
    it able to be in the same place with another glorified body, nor again to be
    in the same place with a non-glorified body. But it would be possible by the
    Divine power for two glorified bodies or two non-glorified bodies to be in
    the same place, even as a glorified body with a non-glorified body.
    Nevertheless it is not befitting for a glorified body to be in the same
    place with another glorified body, both because a becoming order will be
    observed in them, which demands distinction, and because one glorified body
    will not be in the way of another. Consequently two glorified bodies will
    never be in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument supposes that a glorified
    body is able by reason of its subtlety to be in the same place with another
    body: and this is not true.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The same answer applies to the Second Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The body of heaven and the other bodies
    will be said equivocally to be glorified, in so far as they will have a
    certain share in glory, and not as though it were becoming for them to have
    the gifts of glorified human bodies.<br />

    Whether by virtue of its subtlety a glorified body will no longer need to be
    in an equal place?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that by virtue of its subtlety, a
    glorified body will no longer need to be in an equal place. For the
    glorified bodies will be made like to the body of Christ according to Phil.
    3:21. Now Christ's body is not bound by this necessity of being in an equal
    place: wherefore it is contained whole under the small or great dimensions
    of a consecrated host. Therefore the same will be true of the glorified
    bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. iv, 6),
    that two bodies are not in the same place, because it would follow that the
    greatest body would occupy the smallest place, since its various parts could
    be in the same part of the place: for it makes no difference whether two
    bodies or however many be in the same place. Now a glorified body will be in
    the same place with another body, as is commonly admitted. Therefore it will
    be possible for it to be in any place however small.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, even as a body is seen by reason of its
    color, so is it measured by reason of its quantity. Now the glorified body
    will be so subject to the spirit that it will be able at will to be seen,
    and not seen, especially by a non-glorified eye, as evidenced in the case of
    Christ. Therefore its quantity will be so subject to the spirit's will that
    it will be able to be in a little or great place, and to have a little or
    great quantity at will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Phys. iv, text. 30)
    that "whatever is in a place occupies a place equal to itself." Now the
    glorified body will be in a place. Therefore it will occupy a place equal to
    itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the dimensions of a place and of that which is in that place are
    the same, as shown in Phys. iv, text. 30,76,77. Therefore if the place were
    larger than that which is in the place the same thing would be greater and
    smaller than itself, which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A body is not related to place save through the
    medium of its proper dimensions, in respect of which a located body is
    confined through contact with the locating body. Hence it is not possible
    for a body to occupy a place smaller than its quantity, unless its proper
    quantity be made in some way less than itself: and this can only be
    understood in two ways. First, by a variation in quantity in respect of the
    same matter, so that in fact the matter which at first is subject to a
    greater quantity is afterwards subject to a lesser. Some have held this to
    be the case with the glorified bodies, saying that quantity is subject to
    them at will, so that when they list, they are able to have a great
    quantity, and when they list a small quantity. But this is impossible,
    because no movement affecting that which is intrinsic to a thing is possible
    without passion to the detriment [*Cf. FS, Question [22], Article [1]; FS,
    Question [41], Article [1]] of its substance. Hence in incorruptible, i.e.
    heavenly, bodies, there is only local movement, which is not according to
    something intrinsic. Thus it is clear that change of quantity in respect of
    matter would be incompatible with the impassibility and incorruptibility of
    a glorified body. Moreover, it would follow that a glorified body would be
    sometimes rarer and sometimes denser, because since it cannot be deprived of
    any of its matter, sometimes the same matter would be under great dimensions
    and sometimes under small dimensions, and thus it would be rarefied and
    densified, which is impossible. Secondly, that the quantity of a glorified
    body become smaller than itself may be understood by a variation of place;
    so, to wit, that the parts of a glorified body insinuate themselves into one
    another, so that it is reduced in quantity however small it may become. And
    some have held this to be the case, saying that by reason of its subtlety a
    glorified body will be able to be in the same place with a non-glorified
    body: and that in like manner its parts can be one within the other, so much
    so that a whole glorified body will be able to pass through the minutest
    opening in another body: and thus they explain how Christ's body came out of
    the Virgin's womb; and how it went into His disciples, the doors being shut.
    But this is impossible; both because the glorified body will not be able, by
    reason of its subtlety, to be in the same place with another body, and
    because, even if it were able to be in the same place with another body,
    this would not be possible if the other were a glorified body, as many say;
    and again because this would be inconsistent with the right disposition of
    the human body, which requires the parts to be in a certain fixed place and
    at a certain fixed distance from one another. Wherefore this will never
    happen, not even by a miracle. Consequently we must say that the glorified
    body will always be in a place equal to itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's body is not locally in the
    Sacrament of the Altar, as stated above (Sent. iv, D, 10,

  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher's argument is that for
    the same reason one part might permeate another. But this permeation of the
    parts of a glorified body into one another is impossible, as stated above.
    Therefore the objection does not prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A body is seen because it acts on the
    sight: but that it does or does not act on the sight causes no change in the
    body. Hence it is not unfitting, if it can be seen when it will, and not
    seen when it will [*Cf. TP, Question [55], Article [4]]. On the other hand,
    being in a place is not an action proceeding from a body by reason of its
    quantity, as being seen is by reason of its color. Consequently the
    comparison fails.<br />

    Whether the glorified body, by reason of its subtlety, will be
    impalpable?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the glorified body, by reason
    of its subtlety, is impalpable. For Gregory says (Hom. xxv in Evang.): "What
    is palpable must needs be corruptible." But the glorified body is
    incorruptible. Therefore it is impalpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is palpable resists one who
    handles it. But that which can be in the same place with another does not
    resist it. Since then a glorified body can be in the same place with another
    body, it will not be palpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every palpable body is tangible. Now
    every tangible body has tangible qualities in excess of the qualities of the
    one touching it. Since then in the glorified bodies the tangible qualities
    are not in excess but are reduced to a supreme degree of equality, it would
    seem that they are impalpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord rose again with a glorified body;
    and yet His body was palpable, as appears from Lk. 24:39: "Handle, and see;
    for a spirit hath not flesh and bones." Therefore the glorified bodies also
    will be palpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, this is the heresy of Eutychius, Bishop of Constantinople, as
    Gregory states (Moral. xxiv): for he said that in the glory of the
    resurrection our bodies will be impalpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Every palpable body is tangible, but not
    conversely. For every body is tangible that has qualities whereby the sense
    of touch has a natural aptitude to be affected: wherefore air, fire, and the
    like are tangible bodies: but a palpable body, in addition to this, resists
    the touch; wherefore the air which never resists that which passes through
    it, and is most easily pierced, is tangible indeed but not palpable.
    Accordingly it is clear that a body is said to be palpable for two reasons,
    namely on account of its tangible qualities, and on account of its resisting
    that which touches it, so as to hinder it from piercing it. And since the
    tangible qualities are hot and cold and so forth, which are not found save
    in heavy and light bodies, which through being contrary to one another are
    therefore corruptible, it follows that the heavenly bodies, which by their
    nature are incorruptible, are sensible to the sight but not tangible, and
    therefore neither are they palpable. This is what Gregory means when he says
    (Hom. xxv in Evang.) that "whatever is palpable must needs be corruptible."
    Accordingly the glorified body has by its nature those qualities which have
    a natural aptitude to affect the touch, and yet since the body is altogether
    subject to the spirit, it is in its power thereby to affect or not to affect
    the touch. In like manner it is competent by its nature to resist any other
    passing body, so that the latter cannot be in the same place together with
    it: although, according to its pleasure, it may happen by the Divine power
    that it occupy the same place with another body, and thus offer no
    resistance to a passing body. Wherefore according to its nature the
    glorified body is palpable, but it is competent for it to be impalpable to a
    non-glorified body by a supernatural power. Hence Gregory says (Hom. xxv in
    Evang.) that "our Lord offered His flesh to be handled, which He had brought
    in through the closed doors, so as to afford a complete proof that after His
    resurrection His body was unchanged in nature though changed in glory."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The incorruptibility of a glorified body
    does not result from the nature of its component parts; and it is on account
    of that nature that whatever is palpable is corruptible, as stated above.
    Hence the argument does not prove.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although in a way it is possible for a
    glorified body to be in the same place with another body: nevertheless the
    glorified body has it in its power to resist at will any one touching it,
    and thus it is palpable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the glorified bodies the tangible
    qualities are not reduced to the real mean that is measured according to
    equal distance from the extremes, but to the proportionate mean, according
    as is most becoming to the human complexion in each part. Wherefore the
    touch of those bodies will be most delightful, because a power always
    delights in a becoming object, and is grieved by excess.
