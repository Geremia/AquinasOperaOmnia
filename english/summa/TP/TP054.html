<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not have a true body after His 
Resurrection. For a true body cannot be in the same place at the same 
time with another body. But after the Resurrection Christ's body was with 
another at the same time in the same place: since He entered among the 
disciples "the doors being shut," as is related in Jn. 20:26. Therefore 
it seems that Christ did not have a true body after His Resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a true body does not vanish from the beholder's sight 
unless perchance it be corrupted. But Christ's body "vanished out of the 
sight" of the disciples as they gazed upon Him, as is related in Lk. 
24:31. Therefore, it seems that Christ did not have a true body after His 
Resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every true body has its determinate shape. But Christ's 
body appeared before the disciples "in another shape," as is evident from 
Mk. 15:12. Therefore it seems that Christ did not possess a true body 
after His Resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++24%3A37">Lk. 24:37</a>) that when Christ appeared to 
His disciples "they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw 
a spirit," as if He had not a true but an imaginary body: but to remove 
their fears He presently added: "Handle and see, for a spirit hath not 
flesh and bones, as you see Me to have." Consequently, He had not an 
imaginary but a true body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv): that is said to 
rise, which fell. But Christ's body fell by death; namely, inasmuch as 
the soul which was its formal perfection was separated from it. Hence, in 
order for it to be a true resurrection, it was necessary for the same 
body of Christ to be once more united with the same soul. And since the 
truth of the body's nature is from its form it follows that Christ's body 
after His Resurrection was a true body, and of the same nature as it was 
before. But had His been an imaginary body, then His Resurrection would 
not have been true, but apparent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's body after His Resurrection, not by miracle but 
from its glorified condition, as some say, entered in among the disciples 
while the doors were shut, thus existing with another body in the same 
place. But whether a glorified body can have this from some hidden 
property, so as to be with another body at the same time in the same 
place, will be discussed later (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP083.html#XPQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP083.html#XPQ83A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) when the common 
resurrection will be dealt with. For the present let it suffice to say 
that it was not from any property within the body, but by virtue of the 
Godhead united to it, that this body, although a true one, entered in 
among the disciples while the doors were shut. Accordingly Augustine says 
in a sermon for Easter (ccxlvii) that some men argue in this fashion: "If 
it were a body; if what rose from the sepulchre were what hung upon the 
tree, how could it enter through closed doors?" And he answers: "If you 
understand how, it is no miracle: where reason fails, faith  abounds." 
And (Tract. cxxi super Joan.) he says: "Closed doors were no obstacle to 
the substance of a Body wherein was the Godhead; for truly He could enter 
in by doors not open, in whose Birth His Mother's virginity remained 
inviolate." And Gregory says the same in a homily for the octave of 
Easter (xxvi in Evang.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP053.html#TPQ53OUTP1">Question [53]</a>, <A Href="TP053.html#TPQ53A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), Christ rose to the immortal 
life of glory. But such is the disposition of a glorified body that it is 
spiritual, i.e. subject to the spirit, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A44">1 Cor. 15:44</a>). Now in order for the body to be entirely subject to the spirit, 
it is necessary for the body's every action to be subject to the will of 
the spirit. Again, that an object be seen is due to the action of the 
visible object upon the sight, as the Philosopher shows (De Anima ii). 
Consequently, whoever has a glorified body has it in his power to be seen 
when he so wishes, and not to be seen when he does not wish it. Moreover 
Christ had this not only from the condition of His glorified body, but 
also from the power of His Godhead, by which power it may happen that 
even bodies not glorified are miraculously unseen: as was by a miracle 
bestowed on the blessed Bartholomew, that "if he wished he could be seen, 
and not be seen if he did not wish it" [*Apocryphal Historia Apost. viii, 
2]. Christ, then, is said to have vanished from the eyes of the 
disciples, not as though He were corrupted or dissolved into invisible 
elements; but because He ceased, of His own will, to be seen by them, 
either while He was present or while He was departing by the gift of 
agility.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Severianus [*Peter Chrysologus: Serm. lxxxii] says in a 
sermon for Easter: "Let no one suppose that Christ changed His features 
at the Resurrection." This is to be understood of the outline of His 
members; since there was nothing out of keeping or deformed in the body 
of Christ which was conceived of the Holy Ghost, that had to be righted 
at the Resurrection. Nevertheless He received the glory of clarity in the 
Resurrection: accordingly the same writer adds: "but the semblance is 
changed, when, ceasing to be mortal, it becomes immortal; so that it 
acquired the glory of countenance, without losing the substance of the 
countenance." Yet He did not come to those disciples in glorified 
appearance; but, as it lay in His power for His body to be seen or not, 
so it was within His power to present to the eyes of the beholders His 
form either glorified or not glorified, or partly glorified and partly 
not, or in any fashion whatsoever. Still it requires but a slight 
difference for anyone to seem to appear another shape.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ's body did not rise glorified. For glorified 
bodies shine, according to Mt. 13:43: "Then shall the  just shine as the 
sun in the kingdom of their Father." But shining bodies are seen under 
the aspect of light, but not of color. Therefore, since Christ's body was 
beheld under the aspect of color, as it had been hitherto, it seems that 
it was not a glorified one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a glorified body is incorruptible. But Christ's body 
seems not to have been incorruptible; because it was palpable, as He 
Himself says in Lk. 24:39: "Handle, and see." Now Gregory says (Hom. in 
Evang. xxvi) that "what is handled must be corruptible, and that which is 
incorruptible cannot be handled." Consequently, Christ's body was not 
glorified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a glorified body is not animal, but spiritual, as is 
clear from 1 Cor. 15. But after the Resurrection Christ's body seems to 
have been animal, since He ate and drank with His disciples, as we read 
in the closing chapters of Luke and John. Therefore, it seems that 
Christ's body was not glorified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++3%3A21">Phil. 3:21</a>): "He will reform the body 
of our lowness, made like to the body of His glory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's was a glorified body in His Resurrection, and 
this is evident from three reasons. First of all, because His 
Resurrection was the exemplar and the cause of ours, as is stated in 1 
Cor. 15:43. But in the resurrection the saints will have glorified 
bodies, as is written in the same place: "It is sown in dishonor, it 
shall rise in glory." Hence, since the cause is mightier than the effect, 
and the exemplar than the exemplate; much more glorious, then, was the 
body of Christ in His Resurrection. Secondly, because He merited the 
glory of His Resurrection by the lowliness of His Passion. Hence He said 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++12%3A27">Jn. 12:27</a>): "Now is My soul troubled," which refers to the Passion; and 
later He adds: "Father, glorify Thy name," whereby He asks for the glory 
of the Resurrection. Thirdly, because as stated above (<A Href="TP034.html#TPQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>, <A Href="TP034.html#TPQ34A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), 
Christ's soul was glorified from the instant of His conception by perfect 
fruition of the Godhead. But, as stated above (<A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), it was 
owing to the Divine economy that the glory did not pass from His soul to 
His body, in order that by the Passion He might accomplish the mystery of 
our redemption. Consequently, when this mystery of Christ's Passion and 
death was finished, straightway the soul communicated its glory to the 
risen body in the Resurrection; and so that body was made glorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Whatever is received within a subject is received according 
to the subject's capacity. Therefore, since glory flows from the soul 
into the body, it follows that, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor. 
cxviii), the brightness or splendor of a glorified body is after the 
manner of natural color in the human body; just as variously colored 
glass derives its splendor from the sun's radiance, according to the mode 
of the color. But as it lies within the power of a glorified man whether 
his body be seen or not, as stated above (<A Href="TP054.html#TPQ54A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), so is it in his 
power whether its splendor  be seen or not. Accordingly it can be seen in 
its color without its brightness. And it was in this way that Christ's 
body appeared to the disciples after the Resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We say that a body can be handled not only because of its 
resistance, but also on account of its density. But from rarity and 
density follow weight and lightness, heat and cold, and similar 
contraries, which are the principles of corruption in elementary bodies. 
Consequently, a body that can be handled by human touch is naturally 
corruptible. But if there be a body that resists touch, and yet is not 
disposed according to the qualities mentioned, which are the proper 
objects of human touch, such as a heavenly body, then such body cannot be 
said to be handled. But Christ's body after the Resurrection was truly 
made up of elements, and had tangible qualities such as the nature of a 
human body requires, and therefore it could naturally be handled; and if 
it had nothing beyond the nature of a human body, it would likewise be 
corruptible. But it had something else which made it incorruptible, and 
this was not the nature of a heavenly body, as some maintain, and into 
which we shall make fuller inquiry later (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP082.html#XPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP082.html#XPQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), but it was 
glory flowing from a beatified soul: because, as Augustine says (Ep. ad 
Dioscor. cxviii): "God made the soul of such powerful nature, that from 
its fullest beatitude the fulness of health overflows into the body, that 
is, the vigor of incorruption." And therefore Gregory says (Hom. in 
Evang. xxvi): "Christ's body is shown to be of the same nature, but of 
different glory, after the Resurrection."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiii): "After the 
Resurrection, our Saviour in spiritual but true flesh partook of meat 
with the disciples, not from need of food, but because it lay in His 
power." For as Bede says on Lk. 24:41: "The thirsty earth sucks in the 
water, and the sun's burning ray absorbs it; the former from need, the 
latter by its power." Hence after the Resurrection He ate, "not as 
needing food, but in order thus to show the nature of His risen body." 
Nor does it follow that His was an animal body that stands in need of 
food.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body did not rise entire. For flesh 
and blood belong to the integrity of the body: whereas Christ seems not 
to have had both, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A50">1 Cor. 15:50</a>): "Flesh and blood can 
not possess the kingdom of God." But Christ rose in the glory of the 
kingdom of God. Therefore it seems that He did not have flesh and blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, blood is one of the four humors. Consequently, if Christ 
had blood, with equal reason He also had the other humors, from which 
corruption is caused in animal bodies. It would follow, then, that 
Christ's body was corruptible, which is unseemly. Therefore Christ did 
not have flesh and blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the body of Christ which rose, ascended to heaven. But 
some of His blood is kept as relics in various churches. Therefore 
Christ's body did not rise with the integrity of all its parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++24%3A39">Lk. 24:39</a>) while addressing His 
disciples after the Resurrection: "A spirit hath not flesh and bones as 
you see Me to have."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP054.html#TPQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), Christ's body in the Resurrection 
was "of the same nature, but differed in glory." Accordingly, whatever 
goes with the nature of a human body, was entirely in the body of Christ 
when He rose again. Now it is clear that flesh, bones, blood, and other 
such things, are of the very nature of the human body. Consequently, all 
these things were in Christ's body when He rose again; and this also 
integrally, without any diminution; otherwise it would not have been a 
complete resurrection, if whatever was lost by death had not been 
restored. Hence our Lord assured His faithful ones by saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10%3A30">Mt. 10:30</a>): 
"The very hairs of your head are all numbered": and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++21%3A18">Lk. 21:18</a>): "A hair 
of your head shall not perish."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to say that Christ's body had neither flesh, nor bones, nor the 
other natural parts of a human body, belongs to the error of Eutyches, 
Bishop of Constantinople, who maintained that "our body in that glory of 
the resurrection will be impalpable, and more subtle than wind and air: 
and that our Lord, after the hearts of the disciples who handled Him were 
confirmed, brought back to subtlety whatever could be handled in Him" 
[*St. Gregory, Moral. in Job 14:56]. Now Gregory condemns this in the 
same book, because Christ's body was not changed after the Resurrection, 
according to Rm. 6:9: "Christ rising from the dead, dieth now no more." 
Accordingly, the very man who had said these things, himself retracted 
them at his death. For, if it be unbecoming for Christ to take a body of 
another nature in His conception, a heavenly one for instance, as 
Valentine asserted, it is much more unbecoming for Him at His 
Resurrection to resume a body of another nature, because in His 
Resurrection He resumed unto an everlasting life, the body which in His 
conception He had assumed to a mortal life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Flesh and blood are not to be taken there for the nature of 
flesh and blood, but, either for the guilt of flesh and blood, as Gregory 
says [*St. Gregory, Moral. in Job 14:56], or else for the corruption of 
flesh and blood: because, as Augustine says (Ad Consent., De Resur. 
Carn.), "there will be neither corruption there, nor mortality of flesh 
and blood." Therefore flesh according to its substance possesses the 
kingdom of God, according to Lk. 24:39: "A spirit hath not flesh and 
bones, as you see Me to have." But flesh, if understood as to its 
corruption, will not possess it; hence it is straightway added in the 
words of the Apostle: "Neither shall corruption possess incorruption."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in the same book: "Perchance by reason of 
the blood some keener critic will press us and say; If  the blood was" in 
the body of Christ when He rose, "why not the rheum?" that is, the 
phlegm; "why not also the yellow gall?" that is, the gall proper; "and 
why not the black gall?" that is, the bile, "with which four humors the 
body is tempered, as medical science bears witness. But whatever anyone 
may add, let him take heed not to add corruption, lest he corrupt the 
health and purity of his own faith; because Divine power is equal to 
taking away such qualities as it wills from the visible and tractable 
body, while allowing others to remain, so that there be no defilement," 
i.e. of corruption, "though the features be there; motion without 
weariness, the power to eat, without need of food."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All the blood which flowed from Christ's body, belonging as 
it does to the integrity of human nature, rose again with His body: and 
the same reason holds good for all the particles which belong to the 
truth and integrity of human nature. But the blood preserved as relics in 
some churches did not flow from Christ's side, but is said to have flowed 
from some maltreated image of Christ.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body ought not to have risen with its 
scars. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A52">1 Cor. 15:52</a>): "The dead shall rise incorrupt." 
But scars and wounds imply corruption and defect. Therefore it was not 
fitting for Christ, the author of the resurrection, to rise again with 
scars.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's body rose entire, as stated above (<A Href="TP054.html#TPQ54A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But 
open scars are opposed to bodily integrity, since they interfere with the 
continuity of the tissue. It does not therefore seem fitting for the open 
wounds to remain in Christ's body; although the traces of the wounds 
might remain, which would satisfy the beholder; thus it was that Thomas 
believed, to whom it was said: "Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou 
hast believed" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++20%3A29">Jn. 20:29</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) that "some things are 
truly said of Christ after the Resurrection, which He did not have from 
nature but from special dispensation, such as the scars, in order to make 
it sure that it was the body which had suffered that rose again." Now 
when the cause ceases, the effect ceases. Therefore it seems that when 
the disciples were assured of the Resurrection, He bore the scars no 
longer. But it ill became the unchangeableness of His glory that He 
should assume anything which was not to remain in Him for ever. 
Consequently, it seems that He ought not at His Resurrection to have 
resumed a body with scars.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said to Thomas (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++20%3A27">Jn. 20:27</a>): "Put in thy finger 
hither, and see My hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into My 
side, and be not faithless but believing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for Christ's soul at His Resurrection to 
resume the body with its scars. In the first place, for Christ's own 
glory. For Bede says on Lk. 24:40 that He kept His scars not from 
inability to heal them, "but to wear them as an everlasting trophy of His 
victory." Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii): "Perhaps in that 
kingdom we shall see on the bodies of the Martyrs the traces of the 
wounds which they bore for Christ's name: because it will not be a 
deformity, but a dignity in them; and a certain kind of beauty will shine 
in them, in the body, though not of the body." Secondly, to confirm the 
hearts of the disciples as to "the faith in His Resurrection" (Bede, on 
Lk. 24:40). Thirdly, "that when He pleads for us with the Father, He may 
always show the manner of death He endured for us" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). 
Fourthly, "that He may convince those redeemed in His blood, how 
mercifully they have been helped, as He exposes before them the traces of 
the same death" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). Lastly, "that in the Judgment-day 
He may upbraid them with their just condemnation" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). 
Hence, as Augustine says (De Symb. ii): "Christ knew why He kept the 
scars in His body. For, as He showed them to Thomas who would not believe 
except he handled and saw them, so will He show His wounds to His 
enemies, so that He who is the Truth may convict them, saying: 'Behold 
the man whom you crucified; see the wounds you inflicted; recognize the 
side you pierced, since it was opened by you and for you, yet you would 
not enter.'"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The scars that remained in Christ's body belong neither to 
corruption nor defect, but to the greater increase of glory, inasmuch as 
they are the trophies of His power; and a special comeliness will appear 
in the places scarred by the wounds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although those openings of the wounds break the continuity 
of the tissue, still the greater beauty of glory compensates for all 
this, so that the body is not less entire, but more perfected. Thomas, 
however, not only saw, but handled the wounds, because as Pope Leo [*Cf. 
Append. Opp. August., Serm. clxii] says: "It sufficed for his personal 
faith for him to have seen what he saw; but it was on our behalf that he 
touched what he beheld."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[54] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ willed the scars of His wounds to remain on His 
body, not only to confirm the faith of His disciples, but for other 
reasons also. From these it seems that those scars will always remain on 
His body; because, as Augustine says (Ad Consent., De Resurr. Carn.): "I 
believe our Lord's body to be in heaven, such as it was when He ascended 
into heaven." And Gregory (Moral. xiv) says that "if aught could be 
changed in Christ's body after His Resurrection, contrary to Paul's 
truthful teaching, then the Lord after His Resurrection returned to 
death; and what fool would dare to say this, save he that denies the true 
resurrection of the flesh?" Accordingly, it is evident that the scars 
which Christ showed on His body after His Resurrection, have never since 
been removed from His body.<br>
