  <h3 align="center">OF THE BAPTISM OF JOHN (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now proceed to consider the baptism wherewith Christ was baptized. And
    since Christ was baptized with the baptism of John, we shall consider (1)
    the baptism of John in general; (2) the baptizing of Christ. In regard to
    the former there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it was fitting that John
    should baptize?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether that baptism was from God?
  </p>
  <p><a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it conferred grace?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether others besides Christ
    should have received that baptism?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether that baptism should have
    ceased when Christ was baptized?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether those who received John's
    baptism had afterwards to receive Christ's baptism?

  <h3 align="left">Whether it was fitting that John should baptize?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that John
    should baptize. For every sacramental rite belongs to some law. But John did
    not introduce a new law. Therefore it was not fitting that he should
    introduce the new rite of baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, John "was sent by God... for a witness"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A6,7">Jn. 1:6,7</a>)
    as a prophet; according to Lk. 1:76: "Thou, child, shalt be called the
    prophet of the Highest." But the prophets who lived before Christ did not
    introduce any new rite, but persuaded men to observe the rites of the Law.
    as is clearly stated Malachi 4:4: "Remember the law of Moses My servant."
    Therefore neither should John have introduced a new rite of baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when there is too much of anything,
    nothing should be added to it. But the Jews observed a superfluity of
    baptisms; for it is written (Mk. 7:3,4) that "the Pharisees and all the Jews
    eat not without often washing their hands... and when they come from the
    market, unless they be washed, they eat not; and many other things there are
    that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of
    pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds." Therefore it was unfitting that
    John should baptize.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the contrary is the authority of Scripture (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A5,6"
      >Mt. 3:5,6</a
    >), which, after stating the holiness of John, adds many went out to him,
    "and were baptized in the Jordan."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for John to baptize, for four
    reasons: first, it was necessary for Christ to be baptized by John, in order
    that He might sanctify baptism; as Augustine observes, super Joan. (Tract.
    xiii in Joan.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, that Christ might be manifested. Whence John himself says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A31"
      >Jn. 1:31</a
    >): "That He," i.e. Christ, "may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I
    come baptizing with water." For he announced Christ to the crowds that
    gathered around him; which was thus done much more easily than if he had
    gone in search of each individual, as Chrysostom observes, commenting on St.
    John (Hom. x in Matth.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, that by his baptism he might accustom men to the baptism of Christ;
    wherefore Gregory says in a homily (Hom. vii in Evang.) that therefore did
    John baptize, "that, being consistent with his office of precursor, as he
    had preceded our Lord in birth, so he might also by baptizing precede Him
    who was about to baptize."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourthly, that by persuading men to do penance, he might prepare men to
    receive worthily the baptism of Christ. Wherefore Bede [*Cf. Scot. Erig. in
    Joan. iii, 24] says that "the baptism of John was as profitable before the
    baptism of Christ, as instruction in the faith profits the catechumens not
    yet baptized. For just as he preached penance, and foretold the baptism of
    Christ, and drew men to the knowledge of the Truth that hath appeared to the
    world, so do the ministers of the Church, after instructing men, chide them
    for their sins, and lastly promise them forgiveness in the baptism of
    Christ."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The baptism of John was not a sacrament
    properly so called [per se], but a kind of sacramental, preparatory to the
    baptism of Christ. Consequently, in a way, it belonged to the law of Christ,
    but not to the law of Moses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> John was not only a prophet, but "more
    than a prophet," as stated Mt. 11:9: for he was the term of the Law and the
    beginning of the Gospel. Therefore it was in his province to lead men, both
    by word and deed, to the law of Christ rather than to the observance of the
    Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those baptisms of the Pharisees were
    vain, being ordered merely unto carnal cleanliness. But the baptism of John
    was ordered unto spiritual cleanliness, since it led men to do penance, as
    stated above.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the baptism of John was from God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the baptism of John was not
    from God. For nothing sacramental that is from God is named after a mere
    man: thus the baptism of the New Law is not named after Peter or Paul, but
    after Christ. But that baptism is named after John, according to Mt. 21:25:
    "The baptism of John... was it from heaven or from men?" Therefore the
    baptism of John was not from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every doctrine that proceeds from God
    anew is confirmed by some signs: thus the Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++4"
      >Ex. 4</a
    >) gave Moses the power of working signs; and it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A3,4"
      >Heb. 2:3,4</a
    >) that our faith "having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed
    unto us by them that heard Him, God also bearing them witness by signs and
    wonders." But it is written of John the Baptist (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++10%3A41"
      >Jn. 10:41</a
    >) that "John did no sign." Therefore it seems that the baptism wherewith he
    baptized was not from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those sacraments which are instituted by
    God are contained in certain precepts of Holy Scripture. But there is no
    precept of Holy Writ commanding the baptism of John. Therefore it seems that
    it was not from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A33"
      >Jn. 1:33</a
    >): "He who sent me to baptize with water said to me: 'He upon whom thou
    shalt see the Spirit,'" etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered in the baptism of
    John---namely, the rite of baptism and the effect of baptism. The rite of
    baptism was not from men, but from God, who by an interior revelation of the
    Holy Ghost sent John to baptize. But the effect of that baptism was from
    man, because it effected nothing that man could not accomplish. Wherefore it
    was not from God alone, except in as far as God works in man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By the baptism of the New Law men are
    baptized inwardly by the Holy Ghost, and this is accomplished by God alone.
    But by the baptism of John the body alone was cleansed by the water.
    Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A11"
      >Mt. 3:11</a
    >): "I baptize you in water; but... He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost."
    For this reason the baptism of John was named after him, because it effected
    nothing that he did not accomplish. But the baptism of the New Law is not
    named after the minister thereof, because he does not accomplish its
    principal effect, which is the inward cleansing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The whole teaching and work of John was
    ordered unto Christ, who, by many miracles confirmed both His own teaching
    and that of John. But if John had worked signs, men would have paid equal
    attention to John and to Christ. Wherefore, in order that men might pay
    greater attention to Christ, it was not given to John to work a sign. Yet
    when the Jews asked him why he baptized, he confirmed his office by the
    authority of Scripture, saying: "I am the voice of one crying in the
    wilderness," etc. as related, Jn. 1:23 (cf. Is. 40:3). Moreover, the very
    austerity of his life was a commendation of his office, because, as
    Chrysostom says, commenting on Matthew (Hom. x in Matth.), "it was wonderful
    to witness such endurance in a human body."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The baptism of John was intended by God
    to last only for a short time, for the reasons given above (<a
      href="TP038.html#TPQ38A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore it was not the subject of a general commandment set down in
    Sacred Writ, but of a certain interior revelation of the Holy Ghost, as
    stated above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether grace was given in the baptism of John?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that grace was given in the baptism
    of John. For it is written (Mk. 1:4): "John was in the desert baptizing and
    preaching the baptism of penance unto remission of sins." But penance and
    remission of sins are the effect of grace. Therefore the baptism of John
    conferred grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who were about to be baptized by
    John "confessed their sins," as related Mt. 3:6 and Mk. 1:5. But the
    confession of sins is ordered to their remission, which is effected by
    grace. Therefore grace was conferred in the baptism of John.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the baptism of John was more akin than
    circumcision to the baptism of Christ. But original sin was remitted through
    circumcision: because, as Bede says (Hom. x in Circumcis.), "under the Law,
    circumcision brought the same saving aid to heal the wound of original sin
    as baptism is wont to bring now that grace is revealed." Much more,
    therefore, did the baptism of John effect the remission of sins, which
    cannot be accomplished without grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A11"
      >Mt. 3:11</a
    >): "I indeed baptize you in water unto penance." Which words Gregory thus
    expounds in a certain homily (Hom. vii in Evang.): "John baptized, not in
    the Spirit, but in water: because he could not forgive sins." But grace is
    given by the Holy Ghost, and by means thereof sins are taken away. Therefore
    the baptism of John did not confer grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP038.html#TPQ38A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 2), the whole teaching and work of John was in preparation for Christ:
    just as it is the duty of the servant and of the under-craftsman to prepare
    the matter for the form which is accomplished by the head-craftsman. Now
    grace was to be conferred on men through Christ, according to Jn. 1:17:
    "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." Therefore the baptism of John
    did not confer grace, but only prepared the way for grace; and this in three
    ways: first, by John's teaching, which led men to faith in Christ; secondly,
    by accustoming men to the rite of Christ's baptism; thirdly, by penance,
    preparing men to receive the effect of Christ's baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In these words, as Bede says (on Mk.
    1:4), a twofold baptism of penance may be understood. one is that which John
    conferred by baptizing, which is called "a baptism of penance," etc., by
    reason of its inducing men to do penance, and of its being a kind of
    protestation by which men avowed their purpose of doing penance. The other
    is the baptism of Christ, by which sins are remitted, and which John could
    not give, but only preach, saying: "He will baptize you in the Holy
    Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Or it may be said that he preached the "baptism of penance," i.e. which
    induced men to do penance, which penance leads men on to "the remission of
    sins."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Or again, it may be said with Jerome [*Another author on Mk. 1 (inter op.
    Hier.)] that "by the baptism of Christ grace is given, by which sins are
    remitted gratis; and that what is accomplished by the bridegroom is begun by
    the bridesman," i.e. by John. Consequently it is said that "he baptized and
    preached the baptism of penance unto remission of sins," not as though he
    accomplished this himself, but because he began it by preparing the way for
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That confession of sins was not made
    unto the remission of sins, to be realized immediately through the baptism
    of John, but to be obtained through subsequent penance and through the
    baptism of Christ, for which that penance was a preparation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Circumcision was instituted as a remedy
    for original sin. Whereas the baptism of John was not instituted for this
    purpose, but was merely in preparation for the baptism of Christ, as stated
    above; whereas the sacraments attain their effect through the force of their
    institution.<br />

    Whether Christ alone should have been baptized with the baptism of John?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ alone should have been
    baptized with the baptism of John. For, as stated above (<a
      href="TP038.html#TPQ38A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), "the reason why John baptized was that Christ might receive baptism," as
    Augustine says (Super Joan., Tract. xiii). But what is proper to Christ
    should not be applicable to others. Therefore no others should have received
    that baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever is baptized either receives
    something from the baptism or confers something on the baptism. But no one
    could receive anything from the baptism of John, because thereby grace was
    not conferred, as stated above (<a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). On the other hand, no one could confer anything on baptism save Christ,
    who "sanctified the waters by the touch of His most pure flesh" [*Mag. Sent.
    iv, 3]. Therefore it seems that Christ alone should have been baptized with
    the baptism of John.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if others were baptized with that
    baptism, this was only in order that they might be prepared for the baptism
    of Christ: and thus it would seem fitting that the baptism of John should be
    conferred on all, old and young, Gentile and Jew, just as the baptism of
    Christ. But we do not read that either children or Gentiles were baptized by
    the latter; for it is written (Mk. 1:5) that "there went out to him... all
    they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him." Therefore it seems that Christ
    alone should have been baptized by John.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++3%3A21"
      >Lk. 3:21</a
    >): "It came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also
    being baptized and praying, heaven was opened."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> For two reasons it behooved others besides
    Christ to be baptized with the baptism of John. First, as Augustine says
    (Super Joan., Tract. iv, v), "if Christ alone had been baptized with the
    baptism of John, some would have said that John's baptism, with which Christ
    was baptized, was more excellent than that of Christ, with which others are
    baptized."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, because, as above stated, it behooved others to be prepared by
    John's baptism for the baptism of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The baptism of John was instituted not
    only that Christ might be baptized, but also for other reasons, as stated
    above (<a href="TP038.html#TPQ38A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And yet, even if
    it were instituted merely in order that Christ might be baptized therewith,
    it was still necessary for others to receive this baptism, in order to avoid
    the objection mentioned above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Others who approached to be baptized by
    John could not, indeed, confer anything on his baptism: yet neither did they
    receive anything therefrom, save only the sign of penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This was the baptism of "penance," for
    which children were not suited; wherefore they were not baptized therewith.
    But to bring the nations into the way of salvation was reserved to Christ
    alone, who is the "expectation of the nations," as we read Gn. 49:10.
    Indeed, Christ forbade the apostles to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles
    before His Passion and Resurrection. Much less fitting, therefore, was it
    for the Gentiles to be baptized by John.<br />

    Whether John's baptism should have ceased after Christ was baptized?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that John's baptism should have
    ceased after Christ was baptized. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A31"
      >Jn. 1:31</a
    >): "That He may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing
    in water." But when Christ had been baptized, He was made sufficiently
    manifest, both by the testimony of John and by the dove coming down upon
    Him, and again by the voice of the Father bearing witness to Him. Therefore
    it seems that John's baptism should not have endured thereafter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Super Joan., Tract. iv):
    "Christ was baptized, and John's baptism ceased to avail." Therefore it
    seems that, after Christ's baptism, John should not have continued to
    baptize.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, John's baptism prepared the way for
    Christ's. But Christ's baptism began as soon as He had been baptized;
    because "by the touch of His most pure flesh He endowed the waters with a
    regenerating virtue," as Bede asserts (Mag. Sent. iv, 3). Therefore it seems
    that John's baptism ceased when Christ had been baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A22,23"
      >Jn. 3:22,23</a
    >): "Jesus... came into the land of Judea... and baptized: and John also was
    baptizing." But Christ did not baptize before being baptized. Therefore it
    seems that John continued to baptize after Christ had been baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was not fitting for the baptism of John to
    cease when Christ had been baptized. First, because, as Chrysostom says
    (Hom. xxix in Joan.), "if John had ceased to baptize" when Christ had been
    baptized, "men would think that he was moved by jealousy or anger."
    Secondly, if he had ceased to baptize when Christ baptized, "he would have
    given His disciples a motive for yet greater envy." Thirdly, because, by
    continuing to baptize, "he sent his hearers to Christ" (Hom. xxix in Joan.).
    Fourthly, because, as Bede [*Scot. Erig. Comment. in Joan.] says, "there
    still remained a shadow of the Old Law: nor should the forerunner withdraw
    until the truth be made manifest."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When Christ was baptized, He was not as
    yet fully manifested: consequently there was still need for John to continue
    baptizing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The baptism of John ceased after Christ
    had been baptized, not immediately, but when the former was cast into
    prison. Thus Chrysostom says (Hom. xxix in Joan.): "I consider that John's
    death was allowed to take place, and that Christ's preaching began in a
    great measure after John had died, so that the undivided allegiance of the
    multitude was transferred to Christ, and there was no further motive for the
    divergence of opinions concerning both of them."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> John's baptism prepared the way not only
    for Christ to be baptized, but also for others to approach to Christ's
    baptism: and this did not take place as soon as Christ was baptized.<br />

    Whether those who had been baptized with John's baptism had to be baptized
    with the baptism of Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those who had been baptized
    with John's baptism had not to be baptized with the baptism of Christ. For
    John was not less than the apostles, since of him is it written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A11"
      >Mt. 11:11</a
    >): "There hath not risen among them that are born of women a greater than
    John the Baptist." But those who were baptized by the apostles were not
    baptized again, but only received the imposition of hands; for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+8%3A16,17"
      >Acts 8:16,17</a
    >) that some were "only baptized" by Philip "in the name of the Lord Jesus":
    then the apostles---namely, Peter and John---"laid their hands upon them,
    and they received the Holy Ghost." Therefore it seems that those who had
    been baptized by John had not to be baptized with the baptism of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the apostles were baptized with John's
    baptism, since some of them were his disciples, as is clear from Jn. 1:37.
    But the apostles do not seem to have been baptized with the baptism of
    Christ: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A2"
      >Jn. 4:2</a
    >) that "Jesus did not baptize, but His disciples." Therefore it seems that
    those who had been baptized with John's baptism had not to be baptized with
    the baptism of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he who is baptized is less than he who
    baptizes. But we are not told that John himself was baptized with the
    baptism of Christ. Therefore much less did those who had been baptized by
    John need to receive the baptism of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+19%3A1-5"
      >Acts 19:1-5</a
    >) that "Paul... found certain disciples; and he said to them: Have you
    received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not
    so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost. And he said: In what then
    were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism." Wherefore "they were" again
    "baptized in the name of our [Vulg.: 'the'] Lord Jesus Christ." Hence it
    seems that they needed to be baptized again, because they did not know of
    the Holy Ghost: as Jerome says on Joel 2:28 and in an epistle (lxix De Viro
    unius uxoris), and likewise Ambrose (De Spiritu Sancto). But some were
    baptized with John's baptism who had full knowledge of the Trinity.
    Therefore these had no need to be baptized again with Christ's baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, on Rm. 10:8, "This is the word of faith,
    which we preach," the gloss of Augustine says: "Whence this virtue in the
    water, that it touches the body and cleanses the heart, save by the efficacy
    of the word, not because it is uttered, but because it is believed?" Whence
    it is clear that the virtue of baptism depends on faith. But the form of
    John's baptism signified the faith in which we are baptized; for Paul says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+19%3A4">Acts 19:4</a>):
    "John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they
    should believe in Him who was to come after him---that is to say, in Jesus."
    Therefore it seems that those who had been baptized with John's baptism had
    no need to be baptized again with the baptism of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Super Joan., Tract. v):
    "Those who were baptized with John's baptism needed to be baptized with the
    baptism of our Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the opinion of the Master (Sent.
    iv, D, 2), "those who had been baptized by John without knowing of the
    existence of the Holy Ghost, and who based their hopes on his baptism, were
    afterwards baptized with the baptism of Christ: but those who did not base
    their hope on John's baptism, and who believed in the Father, Son, and Holy
    Ghost, were not baptized afterwards, but received the Holy Ghost by the
    imposition of hands made over them by the apostles."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And this, indeed, is true as to the first part, and is confirmed by many
    authorities. But as to the second part, the assertion is altogether
    unreasonable. First, because John's baptism neither conferred grace nor
    imprinted a character, but was merely "in water," as he says himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A11"
      >Mt. 3:11</a
    >). Wherefore the faith or hope which the person baptized had in Christ
    could not supply this defect. Secondly, because, when in a sacrament, that
    is omitted which belongs of necessity to the sacrament, not only must the
    omission be supplied, but the whole must be entirely renewed. Now, it
    belongs of necessity to Christ's baptism that it be given not only in water,
    but also in the Holy Ghost, according to Jn. 3:5: "Unless a man be born of
    water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
    Wherefore in the case of those who had been baptized with John's baptism in
    water only, not merely had the omission to be supplied by giving them the
    Holy Ghost by the imposition of hands, but they had to be baptized wholly
    anew "in water and the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Super Joan., Tract.
    v): "After John, baptism was administered, and the reason why was because he
    gave not Christ's baptism, but his own... That which Peter gave... and if
    any were given by Judas, that was Christ's. And therefore if Judas baptized
    anyone, yet were they not rebaptized... For the baptism corresponds with him
    by whose authority it is given, not with him by whose ministry it is given."
    For the same reason those who were baptized by the deacon Philip, who gave
    the baptism of Christ, were not baptized again, but received the imposition
    of hands by the apostles, just as those who are baptized by priests are
    confirmed by bishops.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says to Seleucianus (Ep.
    cclxv), "we deem that Christ's disciples were baptized either with John's
    baptism, as some maintain, or with Christ's baptism, which is more probable.
    For He would not fail to administer baptism so as to have baptized servants
    through whom He baptized others, since He did not fail in His humble service
    to wash their feet."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. iv in Matth.
    [*From the supposititious Opus Imperfectum]): "Since, when John said, 'I
    ought to be baptized by Thee,' Christ answered, 'Suffer it to be so now': it
    follows that afterwards Christ did baptize John." Moreover, he asserts that
    "this is distinctly set down in some of the apocryphal books." At any rate,
    it is certain, as Jerome says on Mt. 3:13, that, "as Christ was baptized in
    water by John, so had John to be baptized in the Spirit by Christ."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The reason why these persons were
    baptized after being baptized by John was not only because they knew not of
    the Holy Ghost, but also because they had not received the baptism of
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix),
    our sacraments are signs of present grace, whereas the sacraments of the Old
    Law were signs of future grace. Wherefore the very fact that John baptized
    in the name of one who was to come, shows that he did not give the baptism
    of Christ, which is a sacrament of the New Law.<br />
