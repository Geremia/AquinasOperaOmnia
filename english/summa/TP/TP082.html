<H3 Align="Center">OF THE MINISTER OF THIS SACRAMENT (TEN ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We now proceed to consider the minister of this sacrament: under which 
head there are ten points for our inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it belongs to a priest alone to consecrate this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether several priests can at the same time consecrate the same 
host?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it belongs to the priest alone to dispense this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is lawful for the priest consecrating to refrain from 
communicating?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether a priest in sin can perform this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the Mass of a wicked priest is of less value than that of a 
good one?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether those who are heretics, schismatics, or excommunicated, can 
perform this sacrament?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether degraded priests can do so?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether communicants receiving at their hands are guilty of sinning?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether a priest may lawfully refrain altogether from celebrating?
[*This is the order observed by St. Thomas in writing the Articles; but 
in writing this prologue, he placed Article 10 immediately after Article 
4 (Cf. Leonine edition).]<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the consecration of this sacrament does not belong 
exclusively to a priest. Because it was said above (<A Href="TP078.html#TPQ78OUTP1">Question [78]</a>, <A Href="TP078.html#TPQ78A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that 
this sacrament is consecrated in virtue of the words, which are the form 
of this sacrament. But those words are not changed, whether spoken by a 
priest or by anyone else. Therefore, it seems that not only a priest, but 
anyone else, can consecrate this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the priest performs this sacrament in the person of 
Christ. But a devout layman is united with Christ through charity. 
Therefore, it seems that even a layman can perform this sacrament. Hence 
Chrysostom (Opus imperfectum in Matth., Hom. xliii) says that "every holy 
man is a priest."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Baptism is ordained for the salvation of mankind, so 
also is this sacrament, as is clear from what was said above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But a layman can also baptize, as was stated above (<A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>, <A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Consequently, the consecration of this sacrament is not proper 
to a priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is completed in the consecration of the 
matter. But the consecration of other matters such as the chrism, the 
holy oil, and blessed oil, belongs exclusively to a bishop; yet their 
consecration does not equal the  dignity of the consecration of the 
Eucharist, in which the entire Christ is contained. Therefore it belongs, 
not to a priest, but only to a bishop, to perform this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says in an Epistle to Ludifred (Decretals, 
dist. 25): "It belongs to a priest to consecrate this sacrament of the 
Lord's body and blood upon God's altar."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP078.html#TPQ78OUTP1">Question [78]</a>, <A Href="TP078.html#TPQ78ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4), such is the dignity of 
this sacrament that it is performed only as in the person of Christ. Now 
whoever performs any act in another's stead, must do so by the power 
bestowed by such a one. But as the power of receiving this sacrament is 
conceded by Christ to the baptized person, so likewise the power of 
consecrating this sacrament on Christ's behalf is bestowed upon the 
priest at his ordination: for thereby he is put upon a level with them to 
whom the Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++22%3A19">Lk. 22:19</a>): "Do this for a commemoration of Me." 
Therefore, it must be said that it belongs to priests to accomplish this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sacramental power is in several things, and not merely 
in one: thus the power of Baptism lies both in the words and in the 
water. Accordingly the consecrating power is not merely in the words, but 
likewise in the power delivered to the priest in his consecration and 
ordination, when the bishop says to him: "Receive the power of offering 
up the Sacrifice in the Church for the living as well as for the dead." 
For instrumental power lies in several instruments through which the 
chief agent acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A devout layman is united with Christ by spiritual union 
through faith and charity, but not by sacramental power: consequently he 
has a spiritual priesthood for offering spiritual sacrifices, of which it 
is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++1%3A19">Ps. 1:19</a>): "A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit"; and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A1">Rm. 12:1</a>): "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." Hence, too, it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++2%3A5">1 Pt. 2:5</a>): "A holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual 
sacrifices."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The receiving of this sacrament is not of such necessity as 
the receiving of Baptism, as is evident from what was said above (<A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4; <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>, ad 2). And therefore, although a layman can 
baptize in case of necessity, he cannot perform this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The bishop receives power to act on Christ's behalf upon 
His mystical body, that is, upon the Church; but the priest receives no 
such power in his consecration, although he may have it by commission 
from the bishop. Consequently all such things as do not belong to the 
mystical body are not reserved to the bishop, such as the consecration of 
this sacrament. But it belongs to the bishop to deliver, not only to the 
people, but likewise to priests, such things as serve them in the 
fulfillment of their respective duties. And because the blessing of the 
chrism, and of the holy oil, and of the oil of the sick, and other 
consecrated things, such as altars, churches, vestments, and sacred 
vessels, makes such things fit for use in performing the sacraments which 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; belong to the priestly duty, therefore such consecrations are reserved 
to the bishop as the head of the whole ecclesiastical order.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether several priests can consecrate one and the same host?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that several priests cannot consecrate one and the same 
host. For it was said above (<A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>, <A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), that several cannot at the 
same time baptize one individual. But the power of a priest consecrating 
is not less than that of a man baptizing. Therefore, several priests 
cannot consecrate one host at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what can be done by one, is superfluously done by 
several. But there ought to be nothing superfluous in the sacraments. 
Since, then, one is sufficient for consecrating, it seems that several 
cannot consecrate one host.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), this is "the 
sacrament of unity." But multitude seems to be opposed to unity. 
Therefore it seems inconsistent with the sacrament for several priests to 
consecrate the same host.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is the custom of some Churches for priests newly 
ordained to co-celebrate with the bishop ordaining them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), when a priest is ordained he is 
placed on a level with those who received consecrating power from our 
Lord at the Supper. And therefore, according to the custom of some 
Churches, as the apostles supped when Christ supped, so the newly 
ordained co-celebrate with the ordaining bishop. Nor is the consecration, 
on that account, repeated over the same host, because as Innocent III 
says (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), the intention of all should be directed to 
the same instant of the consecration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We do not read of Christ baptizing with the apostles when 
He committed to them the duty of baptizing; consequently there is no 
parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If each individual priest were acting in his own power, 
then other celebrants would be superfluous, since one would be 
sufficient. But whereas the priest does not consecrate except as in 
Christ's stead; and since many are "one in Christ" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A28">Gal. 3:28</a>); 
consequently it does not matter whether this sacrament be consecrated by 
one or by many, except that the rite of the Church must be observed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Eucharist is the sacrament of ecclesiastical unity, 
which is brought about by many being "one in Christ."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether dispensing of this sacrament belongs to a priest alone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the dispensing of this sacrament does not  belong 
to a priest alone. For Christ's blood belongs to this sacrament no less 
than His body. But Christ's blood is dispensed by deacons: hence the 
blessed Lawrence said to the blessed Sixtus (Office of St. Lawrence, 
Resp. at Matins): "Try whether you have chosen a fit minister, to whom 
you have entrusted the dispensing of the Lord's blood." Therefore, with 
equal reason the dispensing of Christ's body does not belong to priests 
only.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, priests are the appointed ministers of the sacraments. 
But this sacrament is completed in the consecration of the matter, and 
not in the use, to which the dispensing belongs. Therefore it seems that 
it does not belong to a priest to dispense the Lord's body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii, iv) that this 
sacrament, like chrism, has the power of perfecting. But it belongs, not 
to priests, but to bishops, to sign with the chrism. Therefore likewise, 
to dispense this sacrament belongs to the bishop and not to the priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (De Consecr., dist. 12): "It has come to 
our knowledge that some priests deliver the Lord's body to a layman or to 
a woman to carry it to the sick: The synod therefore forbids such 
presumption to continue; and let the priest himself communicate the sick."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The dispensing of Christ's body belongs to the priest for 
three reasons. First, because, as was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), he consecrates 
as in the person of Christ. But as Christ consecrated His body at the 
supper, so also He gave it to others to be partaken of by them. 
Accordingly, as the consecration of Christ's body belongs to the priest, 
so likewise does the dispensing belong to him. Secondly, because the 
priest is the appointed intermediary between God and the people; hence as 
it belongs to him to offer the people's gifts to God, so it belongs to 
him to deliver consecrated gifts to the people. Thirdly, because out of 
reverence towards this sacrament, nothing touches it, but what is 
consecrated; hence the corporal and the chalice are consecrated, and 
likewise the priest's hands, for touching this sacrament. Hence it is not 
lawful for anyone else to touch it except from necessity, for instance, 
if it were to fall upon the ground, or else in some other case of urgency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The deacon, as being nigh to the priestly order, has a 
certain share in the latter's duties, so that he may dispense the blood; 
but not the body, except in case of necessity, at the bidding of a bishop 
or of a priest. First of all, because Christ's blood is contained in a 
vessel, hence there is no need for it to be touched by the dispenser, as 
Christ's body is touched. Secondly, because the blood denotes the 
redemption derived by the people from Christ; hence it is that water is 
mixed with the blood, which water denotes the people. And because deacons 
are between priest and people, the dispensing of the blood is in the 
competency of deacons, rather than the dispensing of the body. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> For the reason given above, it belongs to the same person 
to dispense and to consecrate this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the deacon, in a measure, shares in the priest's "power 
of enlightening" (Eccl. Hier. v), inasmuch as he dispenses the blood. so 
the priest shares in the "perfective dispensing" (Eccl. Hier. v) of the 
bishop, inasmuch as he dispenses this sacrament whereby man is perfected 
in himself by union with Christ. But other perfections whereby a man is 
perfected in relation to others, are reserved to the bishop.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the priest who consecrates is bound to receive this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the priest who consecrates is not bound to receive 
this sacrament. Because, in the other consecrations, he who consecrates 
the matter does not use it, just as the bishop consecrating the chrism is 
not anointed therewith. But this sacrament consists in the consecration 
of the matter. Therefore, the priest performing this sacrament need not 
use the same, but may lawfully refrain from receiving it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the other sacraments the minister does not give the 
sacrament to himself: for no one can baptize himself, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4). But as Baptism is dispensed in due order, so also is 
this sacrament. Therefore the priest who consecrates this sacrament ought 
not to receive it at his own hands.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it sometimes happens that Christ's body appears upon the 
altar under the guise of flesh, and the blood under the guise of blood; 
which are unsuited for food and drink: hence, as was said above (<A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), it is on that account that they are given under another species, 
lest they beget revulsion in the communicants. Therefore the priest who 
consecrates is not always bound to receive this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We read in the acts of the (Twelfth) Council of Toledo 
(Can. v), and again (De Consecr., dist. 2): "It must be strictly observed 
that as often as the priest sacrifices the body and blood of our Lord 
Jesus Christ upon the altar, he must himself be a partaker of Christ's 
body and blood."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,7), the Eucharist is not 
only a sacrament, but also a sacrifice. Now whoever offers sacrifice must 
be a sharer in the sacrifice, because the outward sacrifice he offers is 
a sign of the inner sacrifice whereby he offers himself to God, as 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x). Hence by partaking of the sacrifice he 
shows that the inner one is likewise his. In the same way also, by 
dispensing the sacrifice to the people he shows that he is the dispenser 
of Divine gifts, of which he ought himself to be the first to partake, as 
Dionysius says  (Eccl. Hier. iii). Consequently, he ought to receive 
before dispensing it to the people. Accordingly we read in the chapter 
mentioned above (Twelfth Council of Toledo, Can. v): "What kind of 
sacrifice is that wherein not even the sacrificer is known to have a 
share?" But it is by partaking of the sacrifice that he has a share in 
it, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++10%3A18">1 Cor. 10:18</a>): "Are not they that eat of the 
sacrifices, partakers of the altar?" Therefore it is necessary for the 
priest, as often as he consecrates, to receive this sacrament in its 
integrity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The consecration of chrism or of anything else is not a 
sacrifice, as the consecration of the Eucharist is: consequently there is 
no parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is accomplished in the use of the 
matter, and consequently no one can baptize himself, because the same 
person cannot be active and passive in a sacrament. Hence neither in this 
sacrament does the priest consecrate himself, but he consecrates the 
bread and wine, in which consecration the sacrament is completed. But the 
use thereof follows the sacrament, and therefore there is no parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If Christ's body appears miraculously upon the altar under 
the guise of flesh, or the blood under the guise of blood, it is not to 
be received. For Jerome says upon Leviticus (cf. De Consecr., dist. 2): 
"It is lawful to eat of this sacrifice which is wonderfully performed in 
memory of Christ: but it is not lawful for anyone to eat of that one 
which Christ offered on the altar of the cross." Nor does the priest 
transgress on that account, because miraculous events are not subject to 
human laws. Nevertheless the priest would be well advised to consecrate 
again and receive the Lord's body and blood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a wicked priest can consecrate the Eucharist?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a wicked priest cannot consecrate the Eucharist. 
For Jerome, commenting on Sophon. iii, 4, says: "The priests who perform 
the Eucharist, and who distribute our Lord's blood to the people, act 
wickedly against Christ's law, in deeming that the Eucharist is 
consecrated by a prayer rather than by a good life; and that only the 
solemn prayer is requisite, and not the priest's merits: of whom it is 
said: 'Let not the priest, in whatever defilement he may be, approach to 
offer oblations to the Lord'" (Lev. 21:21, Septuagint). But the sinful 
priest, being defiled, has neither the life nor the merits befitting this 
sacrament. Therefore a sinful priest cannot consecrate the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) that "the bread and 
wine are changed supernaturally into the body and blood of our Lord, by 
the coming of the Holy Ghost." But Pope Gelasius I says (Ep. ad Elphid., 
cf. Decret. i, q. 1): "How shall the Holy Spirit, when invoked, come for 
the consecration of the Divine  Mystery, if the priest invoking him be 
proved full of guilty deeds?" Consequently, the Eucharist cannot be 
consecrated by a wicked priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is consecrated by the priest's blessing. 
But a sinful priest's blessing is not efficacious for consecrating this 
sacrament, since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Malachi+2%3A2">Malachi 2:2</a>): "I will curse your 
blessings." Again, Dionysius says in his Epistle (viii) to the monk 
Demophilus: "He who is not enlightened has completely fallen away from 
the priestly order; and I wonder that such a man dare to employ his hands 
in priestly actions, and in the person of Christ to utter, over the 
Divine symbols, his unclean infamies, for I will not call them prayers."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Paschasius) says (De Corp. Dom. xii): 
"Within the Catholic Church, in the mystery of the Lord's body and blood, 
nothing greater is done by a good priest, nothing less by an evil priest, 
because it is not by the merits of the consecrator that the sacrament is 
accomplished, but by the Creator's word, and by the power of the Holy 
Spirit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), the priest consecrates this 
sacrament not by his own power, but as the minister of Christ, in Whose 
person he consecrates this sacrament. But from the fact of being wicked 
he does not cease to be Christ's minister; because our Lord has good and 
wicked ministers or servants. Hence (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++24%3A45">Mt. 24:45</a>) our Lord says: "Who, 
thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant?" and afterwards He adds: 
"But if that evil servant shall say in his heart," etc. And the Apostle 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++4%3A1">1 Cor. 4:1</a>) says: "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of 
Christ"; and afterwards he adds: "I am not conscious to myself of 
anything; yet am I not hereby justified." He was therefore certain that 
he was Christ's minister; yet he was not certain that he was a just man. 
Consequently, a man can be Christ's minister even though he be not one of 
the just. And this belongs to Christ's excellence, Whom, as the true God, 
things both good and evil serve, since they are ordained by His 
providence for His glory. Hence it is evident that priests, even though 
they be not godly, but sinners, can consecrate the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In those words Jerome is condemning the error of priests 
who believed they could consecrate the Eucharist worthily, from the mere 
fact of being priests, even though they were sinners; and Jerome condemns 
this from the fact that persons defiled are forbidden to approach the 
altar; but this does not prevent the sacrifice, which they offer, from 
being a true sacrifice, if they do approach.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Previous to the words quoted, Pope Gelasius expresses 
himself as follows: "That most holy rite, which contains the Catholic 
discipline, claims for itself such reverence that no one may dare to 
approach it except with clean conscience." From this it is evident that 
his meaning is that the priest who is a sinner ought not to approach this 
sacrament. Hence when he resumes,  "How shall the Holy Spirit come when 
summoned," it must be understood that He comes, not through the priest's 
merits, but through the power of Christ, Whose words the priest utters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the same action can be evil, inasmuch as it is done with 
a bad intention of the servant; and good from the good intention of the 
master; so the blessing of a sinful priest, inasmuch as he acts 
unworthily is deserving of a curse, and is reputed an infamy and a 
blasphemy, and not a prayer; whereas, inasmuch as it is pronounced in the 
person of Christ, it is holy and efficacious. Hence it is said with 
significance: "I will curse your blessings."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the mass of a sinful priest is of less worth than the mass of a good priest?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the mass of a sinful priest is not of less worth 
than that of a good priest. For Pope Gregory says in the Register: "Alas, 
into what a great snare they fall who believe that the Divine and hidden 
mysteries can be sanctified more by some than by others; since it is the 
one and the same Holy Ghost Who hallows those mysteries in a hidden and 
invisible manner." But these hidden mysteries are celebrated in the mass. 
Therefore the mass of a sinful priest is not of less value than the mass 
of a good priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Baptism is conferred by a minister through the power 
of Christ Who baptizes, so likewise this sacrament is consecrated in the 
person of Christ. But Baptism is no better when conferred by a better 
priest, as was said above (<A Href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="TP064.html#TPQ64A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Therefore neither is a 
mass the better, which is celebrated by a better priest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the merits of priests differ in the point of being 
good and better, so they likewise differ in the point of being good and 
bad. Consequently, if the mass of a better priest be itself better, it 
follows that the mass of a bad priest must be bad. Now this is 
unreasonable, because the malice of the ministers cannot affect Christ's 
mysteries, as Augustine says in his work on Baptism (Contra Donat. xii). 
Therefore neither is the mass of a better priest the better.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in Decretal i, q. 1: "The worthier the 
priest, the sooner is he heard in the needs for which he prays."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two things to be considered in the mass. 
namely, the sacrament itself, which is the chief thing; and the prayers 
which are offered up in the mass for the quick and the dead. So far as 
the mass itself is concerned, the mass of a wicked priest is not of less 
value than that of a good priest, because the same sacrifice is offered 
by both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the prayer put up in the mass can be considered in two  respects: 
first of all, in so far as it has its efficacy from the devotion of the 
priest interceding, and in this respect there is no doubt but that the 
mass of the better priest is the more fruitful. In another respect, 
inasmuch as the prayer is said by the priest in the mass in the place of 
the entire Church, of which the priest is the minister; and this ministry 
remains even in sinful men, as was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) in regard to 
Christ's ministry. Hence, in this respect the prayer even of the sinful 
priest is fruitful, not only that which he utters in the mass, but 
likewise all those he recites in the ecclesiastical offices, wherein he 
takes the place of the Church. on the other hand, his private prayers are 
not fruitful, according to Prov. 28:9: "He that turneth away his ears 
from hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is speaking there of the holiness of the Divine 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the sacrament of Baptism solemn prayers are not made for 
all the faithful, as in the mass; therefore there is no parallel in this 
respect. There is, however, a resemblance as to the effect of the 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By reason of the power of the Holy Ghost, Who communicates 
to each one the blessings of Christ's members on account of their being 
united in charity, the private blessing in the mass of a good priest is 
fruitful to others. But the private evil of one man cannot hurt another, 
except the latter, in some way, consent, as Augustine says (Contra 
Parmen. ii).<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that heretics, schismatics, and excommunicated persons 
are not able to consecrate the Eucharist. For Augustine says (Liber 
sentent. Prosperi xv) that "there is no such thing as a true sacrifice 
outside the Catholic Church": and Pope Leo I says (Ep. lxxx; cf. Decretal 
i, q. 1): Elsewhere "(i.e. than in the Church which is Christ's body) 
there is neither valid priesthood nor true sacrifice." But heretics, 
schismatics, and excommunicated persons are severed from the Church. 
Therefore they are unable to offer a true sacrifice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further (Decretal, caus. i, q. 1), Innocent I is quoted as 
saying: "Because we receive the laity of the Arians and other 
pestilential persons, if they seem to repent, it does not follow that 
their clergy have the dignity of the priesthood or of any other 
ministerial office, for we allow them to confer nothing save Baptism." 
But none can consecrate the Eucharist, unless he have the dignity of the 
priesthood. Therefore heretics and the like cannot consecrate the 
Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it does not seem feasible for one outside the Church to 
act on behalf of the Church. But when the priest  consecrates the 
Eucharist, he does so in the person of the entire Church, as is evident 
from the fact of his putting up all prayers in the person of the Church. 
Therefore, it seems that those who are outside the Church, such as those 
who are heretics, schismatics, and excommunicate, are not able to 
consecrate the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii): "Just as Baptism 
remains in them," i.e. in heretics, schismatics, and those who are 
excommunicate, "so do their orders remain intact." Now, by the power of 
his ordination, a priest can consecrate the Eucharist. Therefore, it 
seems that heretics, schismatics, and those who are excommunicate, can 
consecrate the Eucharist, since their orders remain entire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have contended that heretics, schismatics, and the 
excommunicate, who are outside the pale of the Church, cannot perform 
this sacrament. But herein they are deceived, because, as Augustine says 
(Contra Parmen. ii), "it is one thing to lack something utterly, and 
another to have it improperly"; and in like fashion, "it is one thing not 
to bestow, and quite another to bestow, but not rightly." Accordingly, 
such as, being within the Church, received the power of consecrating the 
Eucharist through being ordained to the priesthood, have such power 
rightly indeed; but they use it improperly if afterwards they be 
separated from the Church by heresy, schism, or excommunication. But such 
as are ordained while separated from the Church, have neither the power 
rightly, nor do they use it rightly. But that in both cases they have the 
power, is clear from what Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii), that when 
they return to the unity of the Church, they are not re-ordained, but are 
received in their orders. And since the consecration of the Eucharist is 
an act which follows the power of order, such persons as are separated 
from the Church by heresy, schism, or excommunication, can indeed 
consecrate the Eucharist, which on being consecrated by them contains 
Christ's true body and blood; but they act wrongly, and sin by doing so; 
and in consequence they do not receive the fruit of the sacrifice, which 
is a spiritual sacrifice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such and similar authorities are to be understood in this 
sense, that the sacrifice is offered wrongly outside the Church. Hence 
outside the Church there can be no spiritual sacrifice that is a true 
sacrifice with the truth of its fruit, although it be a true sacrifice 
with the truth of the sacrament; thus it was stated above (<A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), 
that the sinner receives Christ's body sacramentally, but not spiritually.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism alone is allowed to be conferred by heretics, and 
schismatics, because they can lawfully baptize in case of necessity; but 
in no case can they lawfully consecrate the Eucharist, or confer the 
other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The priest, in reciting the prayers of the mass, speaks 
instead of the Church, in whose unity he remains; but in consecrating the 
sacrament he speaks as in the person of Christ,  Whose place he holds by 
the power of his orders. Consequently, if a priest severed from the unity 
of the Church celebrates mass, not having lost the power of order, he 
consecrates Christ's true body and blood; but because he is severed from 
the unity of the Church, his prayers have no efficacy.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a degraded priest can consecrate this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a degraded priest cannot consecrate this sacrament. 
For no one can perform this sacrament except he have the power of 
consecrating. But the priest "who has been degraded has no power of 
consecrating, although he has the power of baptizing" (App. Gratiani). 
Therefore it seems that a degraded priest cannot consecrate the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who gives can take away. But the bishop in ordaining 
gives to the priest the power of consecrating. Therefore he can take it 
away by degrading him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priest, by degradation, loses either the power of 
consecrating, or the use of such power. But he does not lose merely the 
use, for thus the degraded one would lose no more than one 
excommunicated, who also lacks the use. Therefore it seems that he loses 
the power to consecrate, and in consequence that he cannot perform this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Contra Parmen. ii) proves that "apostates" 
from the faith "are not deprived of their Baptism," from the fact that 
"it is not restored to them when they return repentant; and therefore it 
is deemed that it cannot be lost." But in like fashion, if the degraded 
man be restored, he has not to be ordained over again. Consequently, he 
has not lost the power of consecrating, and so the degraded priest can 
perform this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The power of consecrating the Eucharist belongs to the 
character of the priestly order. But every character is indelible, 
because it is given with a kind of consecration, as was said above (<A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), just as the consecrations of all other things are perpetual, and 
cannot be lost or repeated. Hence it is clear that the power of 
consecrating is not lost by degradation. For, again, Augustine says 
(Contra Parmen. ii): "Both are sacraments," namely Baptism and order, 
"and both are given to a man with a kind of consecration; the former, 
when he is baptized; the latter when he is ordained; and therefore it is 
not lawful for Catholics to repeat either of them." And thus it is 
evident that the degraded priest can perform this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That Canon is speaking, not as by way of assertion, but by 
way of inquiry, as can be gleaned from the context.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The bishop gives the priestly power of order, not  as 
though coming from himself, but instrumentally, as God's minister, and 
its effect cannot be taken away by man, according to Mt. 19:6: "What God 
hath joined together, let no man put asunder." And therefore the bishop 
cannot take this power away, just as neither can he who baptizes take 
away the baptismal character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Excommunication is medicinal. And therefore the ministry of 
the priestly power is not taken away from the excommunicate, as it were, 
perpetually, but only for a time, that they may mend; but the exercise is 
withdrawn from the degraded, as though condemned perpetually.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is permissible to receive communion from heretical, excommunicate, or sinful priests, and to hear mass said by them?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that one may lawfully receive Communion from heretical, 
excommunicate, or even sinful priests, and to hear mass said by them. 
Because, as Augustine says (Contra Petilian. iii), "we should not avoid 
God's sacraments, whether they be given by a good man or by a wicked 
one." But priests, even if they be sinful, or heretics, or excommunicate, 
perform a valid sacrament. Therefore it seems that one ought not to 
refrain from receiving Communion at their hands, or from hearing their 
mass.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's true body is figurative of His mystical body, 
as was said above (<A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>, <A Href="TP067.html#TPQ67A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But Christ's true body is consecrated by 
the priests mentioned above. Therefore it seems that whoever belongs to 
His mystical body can communicate in their sacrifices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there are many sins graver than fornication. But it is 
not forbidden to hear the masses of priests who sin otherwise. Therefore, 
it ought not to be forbidden to hear the masses of priests guilty of this 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Canon says (Dist. 32): "Let no one hear the mass of 
a priest whom he knows without doubt to have a concubine." Moreover, 
Gregory says (Dial. iii) that "the faithless father sent an Arian bishop 
to his son, for him to receive sacrilegiously the consecrated Communion 
at his hands. But, when the Arian bishop arrived, God's devoted servant 
rebuked him, as was right for him to do."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,7), heretical, schismatical, 
excommunicate, or even sinful priests, although they have the power to 
consecrate the Eucharist, yet they do not make a proper use of it; on the 
contrary, they sin by using it. But whoever communicates with another who 
is in sin, becomes a sharer in his sin. Hence we read in John's Second 
Canonical Epistle (11) that "He that saith unto him, God speed you, 
communicateth with his wicked works." Consequently, it is not lawful to 
receive Communion from them, or to assist at their mass.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Still there is a difference among the above, because heretics, 
schismatics, and excommunicates, have been forbidden, by the Church's 
sentence, to perform the Eucharistic rite. And therefore whoever hears 
their mass or receives the sacraments from them, commits sin. But not all 
who are sinners are debarred by the Church's sentence from using this 
power: and so, although suspended by the Divine sentence, yet they are 
not suspended in regard to others by any ecclesiastical sentence: 
consequently, until the Church's sentence is pronounced, it is lawful to 
receive Communion at their hands, and to hear their mass. Hence on 1 Cor. 
5:11, "with such a one not so much as to eat," Augustine's gloss runs 
thus: "In saying this he was unwilling for a man to be judged by his 
fellow man on arbitrary suspicion, or even by usurped extraordinary 
judgment, but rather by God's law, according to the Church's ordering, 
whether he confess of his own accord, or whether he be accused and 
convicted."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By refusing to hear the masses of such priests, or to 
receive Communion from them, we are not shunning God's sacraments; on the 
contrary, by so doing we are giving them honor (hence a host consecrated 
by such priests is to be adored, and if it be reserved, it can be 
consumed by a lawful priest): but what we shun is the sin of the unworthy 
ministers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The unity of the mystical body is the fruit of the true 
body received. But those who receive or minister unworthily, are deprived 
of the fruit, as was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). And therefore, those 
who belong to the unity of the Faith are not to receive the sacrament 
from their dispensing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although fornication is not graver than other sins, yet men 
are more prone to it, owing to fleshly concupiscence. Consequently, this 
sin is specially inhibited to priests by the Church, lest anyone hear the 
mass of one living in concubinage. However, this is to be understood of 
one who is notorious, either from being convicted and sentenced, or from 
having acknowledged his guilt in legal form, or from it being impossible 
to conceal his guilt by any subterfuge.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems to be lawful for a priest to refrain entirely from 
consecrating the Eucharist. Because, as it is the priest's office to 
consecrate the Eucharist, so it is likewise to baptize and administer the 
other sacraments. But the priest is not bound to act as a minister of the 
other sacraments, unless he has undertaken the care of souls. Therefore, 
it seems that likewise he is not bound to consecrate the Eucharist except 
he be charged with the care of souls.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to do what is unlawful for him to do; 
otherwise he would be in two minds. But it is not lawful for  the priest 
who is in a state of sin, or excommunicate, to consecrate the Eucharist, 
as was said above (<A Href="TP082.html#TPQ82A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore it seems that such men are not bound 
to celebrate, and so neither are the others; otherwise they would be 
gainers by their fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priestly dignity is not lost by subsequent weakness: 
because Pope Gelasius I says (cf. Decretal, Dist. 55): "As the canonical 
precepts do not permit them who are feeble in body to approach the 
priesthood, so if anyone be disabled when once in that state, he cannot 
lose that he received at the time he was well." But it sometimes happens 
that those who are already ordained as priests incur defects whereby they 
are hindered from celebrating, such as leprosy or epilepsy, or the like. 
Consequently, it does not appear that priests are bound to celebrate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says in one of his Orations (xxxiii): "It is a 
grave matter if we do not approach Thy altar with clean heart and pure 
hands; but it is graver still if while shunning sins we also fail to 
offer our sacrifice."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that a priest may lawfully refrain 
altogether from consecrating, except he be bound to do so, and to give 
the sacraments to the people, by reason of his being entrusted with the 
care of souls.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is said quite unreasonably, because everyone is bound to use 
the grace entrusted to him, when opportunity serves, according to 2 Cor. 
6:1: "We exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain." But 
the opportunity of offering sacrifice is considered not merely in 
relation to the faithful of Christ to whom the sacraments must be 
administered, but chiefly with regard to God to Whom the sacrifice of 
this sacrament is offered by consecrating. Hence, it is not lawful for 
the priest, even though he has not the care of souls, to refrain 
altogether from celebrating; and he seems to be bound to celebrate at 
least on the chief festivals, and especially on those days on which the 
faithful usually communicate. And hence it is that (2 Macc. 4:14) it is 
said against some priests that they "were not now occupied about the 
offices of the altar . . . despising the temple and neglecting the 
sacrifices."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The other sacraments are accomplished in being used by the 
faithful, and therefore he alone is bound to administer them who has 
undertaken the care of souls. But this sacrament is performed in the 
consecration of the Eucharist, whereby a sacrifice is offered to God, to 
which the priest is bound from the order he has received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sinful priest, if deprived by the Church's sentence 
from exercising his order, simply or for a time, is rendered incapable of 
offering sacrifice; consequently, the obligation lapses. But if not 
deprived of the power of celebrating, the obligation is not removed; nor 
is he in two minds, because he can repent of his sin and then celebrate. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[82] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Weakness or sickness contracted by a priest after his 
ordination does not deprive him of his orders; but hinders him from 
exercising them, as to the consecration of the Eucharist: sometimes by 
making it impossible to exercise them, as, for example, if he lose his 
sight, or his fingers, or the use of speech; and sometimes on account of 
danger, as in the case of one suffering from epilepsy, or indeed any 
disease of the mind; and sometimes, on account of loathsomeness, as is 
evident in the case of a leper, who ought not to celebrate in public: he 
can, however, say mass privately, unless the leprosy has gone so far that 
it has rendered him incapable owing to the wasting away of his limbs.<br>
