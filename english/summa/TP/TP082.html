  <h3 align="center">OF THE MINISTER OF THIS SACRAMENT (TEN ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now proceed to consider the minister of this sacrament: under which head
    there are ten points for our inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it belongs to a priest
    alone to consecrate this sacrament?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether several priests can at the
    same time consecrate the same host?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it belongs to the priest
    alone to dispense this sacrament?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is lawful for the
    priest consecrating to refrain from communicating?<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    priest is of less value than that of a good one?<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    schismatics, or excommunicated, can perform this sacrament?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether degraded priests can do
    so?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether communicants receiving at
    their hands are guilty of sinning?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether a priest may lawfully
    refrain altogether from celebrating? [*This is the order observed by St.
    Thomas in writing the Articles; but in writing this prologue, he placed
    Article 10 immediately after Article 4 (Cf. Leonine edition).]<br />

    Whether the consecration of this sacrament belongs to a priest alone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the consecration of this sacrament
    does not belong exclusively to a priest. Because it was said above (<a
      href="TP078.html#TPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="TP078.html#TPQ78A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that this sacrament is
    consecrated in virtue of the words, which are the form of this sacrament.
    But those words are not changed, whether spoken by a priest or by anyone
    else. Therefore, it seems that not only a priest, but anyone else, can
    consecrate this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the priest performs this sacrament in
    the person of Christ. But a devout layman is united with Christ through
    charity. Therefore, it seems that even a layman can perform this sacrament.
    Hence Chrysostom (Opus imperfectum in Matth., Hom. xliii) says that "every
    holy man is a priest."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Baptism is ordained for the salvation
    of mankind, so also is this sacrament, as is clear from what was said above
    (<a href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>,
    <a href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>,
    <a href="TP079.html#TPQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But a layman can also
    baptize, as was stated above (<a href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1"
      >Question [67]</a
    >, <a href="TP067.html#TPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Consequently, the
    consecration of this sacrament is not proper to a priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is completed in the
    consecration of the matter. But the consecration of other matters such as
    the chrism, the holy oil, and blessed oil, belongs exclusively to a bishop;
    yet their consecration does not equal the dignity of the consecration of the
    Eucharist, in which the entire Christ is contained. Therefore it belongs,
    not to a priest, but only to a bishop, to perform this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says in an Epistle to Ludifred
    (Decretals, dist. 25): "It belongs to a priest to consecrate this sacrament
    of the Lord's body and blood upon God's altar."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP078.html#TPQ78OUTP1"
      >Question [78]</a
    >, <a href="TP078.html#TPQ78ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4), such is the dignity
    of this sacrament that it is performed only as in the person of Christ. Now
    whoever performs any act in another's stead, must do so by the power
    bestowed by such a one. But as the power of receiving this sacrament is
    conceded by Christ to the baptized person, so likewise the power of
    consecrating this sacrament on Christ's behalf is bestowed upon the priest
    at his ordination: for thereby he is put upon a level with them to whom the
    Lord said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A19"
      >Lk. 22:19</a
    >): "Do this for a commemoration of Me." Therefore, it must be said that it
    belongs to priests to accomplish this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sacramental power is in several
    things, and not merely in one: thus the power of Baptism lies both in the
    words and in the water. Accordingly the consecrating power is not merely in
    the words, but likewise in the power delivered to the priest in his
    consecration and ordination, when the bishop says to him: "Receive the power
    of offering up the Sacrifice in the Church for the living as well as for the
    dead." For instrumental power lies in several instruments through which the
    chief agent acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A devout layman is united with Christ by
    spiritual union through faith and charity, but not by sacramental power:
    consequently he has a spiritual priesthood for offering spiritual
    sacrifices, of which it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++1%3A19"
      >Ps. 1:19</a
    >): "A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A1"
      >Rm. 12:1</a
    >): "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." Hence, too, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++2%3A5"
      >1 Pt. 2:5</a
    >): "A holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The receiving of this sacrament is not
    of such necessity as the receiving of Baptism, as is evident from what was
    said above (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4;
    <a href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>,
    <a href="TP080.html#TPQ80A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>, ad 2). And therefore,
    although a layman can baptize in case of necessity, he cannot perform this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The bishop receives power to act on
    Christ's behalf upon His mystical body, that is, upon the Church; but the
    priest receives no such power in his consecration, although he may have it
    by commission from the bishop. Consequently all such things as do not belong
    to the mystical body are not reserved to the bishop, such as the
    consecration of this sacrament. But it belongs to the bishop to deliver, not
    only to the people, but likewise to priests, such things as serve them in
    the fulfillment of their respective duties. And because the blessing of the
    chrism, and of the holy oil, and of the oil of the sick, and other
    consecrated things, such as altars, churches, vestments, and sacred vessels,
    makes such things fit for use in performing the sacraments which
  </p>
  <p>
    belong to the priestly duty, therefore such consecrations are reserved to
    the bishop as the head of the whole ecclesiastical order.<br />

    Whether several priests can consecrate one and the same host?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that several priests cannot consecrate
    one and the same host. For it was said above (<a
      href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1"
      >Question [67]</a
    >, <a href="TP067.html#TPQ67A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), that several cannot
    at the same time baptize one individual. But the power of a priest
    consecrating is not less than that of a man baptizing. Therefore, several
    priests cannot consecrate one host at the same time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what can be done by one, is
    superfluously done by several. But there ought to be nothing superfluous in
    the sacraments. Since, then, one is sufficient for consecrating, it seems
    that several cannot consecrate one host.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in
    Joan.), this is "the sacrament of unity." But multitude seems to be opposed
    to unity. Therefore it seems inconsistent with the sacrament for several
    priests to consecrate the same host.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is the custom of some Churches for priests
    newly ordained to co-celebrate with the bishop ordaining them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), when a priest is ordained he is placed on a level with those who
    received consecrating power from our Lord at the Supper. And therefore,
    according to the custom of some Churches, as the apostles supped when Christ
    supped, so the newly ordained co-celebrate with the ordaining bishop. Nor is
    the consecration, on that account, repeated over the same host, because as
    Innocent III says (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), the intention of all should be
    directed to the same instant of the consecration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We do not read of Christ baptizing with
    the apostles when He committed to them the duty of baptizing; consequently
    there is no parallel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If each individual priest were acting in
    his own power, then other celebrants would be superfluous, since one would
    be sufficient. But whereas the priest does not consecrate except as in
    Christ's stead; and since many are "one in Christ" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A28"
      >Gal. 3:28</a
    >); consequently it does not matter whether this sacrament be consecrated by
    one or by many, except that the rite of the Church must be observed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Eucharist is the sacrament of
    ecclesiastical unity, which is brought about by many being "one in
    Christ."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether dispensing of this sacrament belongs to a priest alone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the dispensing of this sacrament
    does not belong to a priest alone. For Christ's blood belongs to this
    sacrament no less than His body. But Christ's blood is dispensed by deacons:
    hence the blessed Lawrence said to the blessed Sixtus (Office of St.
    Lawrence, Resp. at Matins): "Try whether you have chosen a fit minister, to
    whom you have entrusted the dispensing of the Lord's blood." Therefore, with
    equal reason the dispensing of Christ's body does not belong to priests
    only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, priests are the appointed ministers of
    the sacraments. But this sacrament is completed in the consecration of the
    matter, and not in the use, to which the dispensing belongs. Therefore it
    seems that it does not belong to a priest to dispense the Lord's body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii, iv)
    that this sacrament, like chrism, has the power of perfecting. But it
    belongs, not to priests, but to bishops, to sign with the chrism. Therefore
    likewise, to dispense this sacrament belongs to the bishop and not to the
    priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (De Consecr., dist. 12): "It
    has come to our knowledge that some priests deliver the Lord's body to a
    layman or to a woman to carry it to the sick: The synod therefore forbids
    such presumption to continue; and let the priest himself communicate the
    sick."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The dispensing of Christ's body belongs to the
    priest for three reasons. First, because, as was said above (<a
      href="TP082.html#TPQ82A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), he consecrates as in the person of Christ. But as Christ consecrated His
    body at the supper, so also He gave it to others to be partaken of by them.
    Accordingly, as the consecration of Christ's body belongs to the priest, so
    likewise does the dispensing belong to him. Secondly, because the priest is
    the appointed intermediary between God and the people; hence as it belongs
    to him to offer the people's gifts to God, so it belongs to him to deliver
    consecrated gifts to the people. Thirdly, because out of reverence towards
    this sacrament, nothing touches it, but what is consecrated; hence the
    corporal and the chalice are consecrated, and likewise the priest's hands,
    for touching this sacrament. Hence it is not lawful for anyone else to touch
    it except from necessity, for instance, if it were to fall upon the ground,
    or else in some other case of urgency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The deacon, as being nigh to the
    priestly order, has a certain share in the latter's duties, so that he may
    dispense the blood; but not the body, except in case of necessity, at the
    bidding of a bishop or of a priest. First of all, because Christ's blood is
    contained in a vessel, hence there is no need for it to be touched by the
    dispenser, as Christ's body is touched. Secondly, because the blood denotes
    the redemption derived by the people from Christ; hence it is that water is
    mixed with the blood, which water denotes the people. And because deacons
    are between priest and people, the dispensing of the blood is in the
    competency of deacons, rather than the dispensing of the body.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> For the reason given above, it belongs
    to the same person to dispense and to consecrate this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the deacon, in a measure, shares in
    the priest's "power of enlightening" (Eccl. Hier. v), inasmuch as he
    dispenses the blood. so the priest shares in the "perfective dispensing"
    (Eccl. Hier. v) of the bishop, inasmuch as he dispenses this sacrament
    whereby man is perfected in himself by union with Christ. But other
    perfections whereby a man is perfected in relation to others, are reserved
    to the bishop.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the priest who consecrates is bound to receive this sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the priest who consecrates is not
    bound to receive this sacrament. Because, in the other consecrations, he who
    consecrates the matter does not use it, just as the bishop consecrating the
    chrism is not anointed therewith. But this sacrament consists in the
    consecration of the matter. Therefore, the priest performing this sacrament
    need not use the same, but may lawfully refrain from receiving it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the other sacraments the minister
    does not give the sacrament to himself: for no one can baptize himself, as
    stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>,
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 4). But as Baptism is
    dispensed in due order, so also is this sacrament. Therefore the priest who
    consecrates this sacrament ought not to receive it at his own hands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it sometimes happens that Christ's body
    appears upon the altar under the guise of flesh, and the blood under the
    guise of blood; which are unsuited for food and drink: hence, as was said
    above (<a href="TP075.html#TPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>,
    <a href="TP075.html#TPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), it is on that account
    that they are given under another species, lest they beget revulsion in the
    communicants. Therefore the priest who consecrates is not always bound to
    receive this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> We read in the acts of the (Twelfth) Council
    of Toledo (Can. v), and again (De Consecr., dist. 2): "It must be strictly
    observed that as often as the priest sacrifices the body and blood of our
    Lord Jesus Christ upon the altar, he must himself be a partaker of Christ's
    body and blood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1"
      >Question [79]</a
    >, <a href="TP079.html#TPQ79ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,7), the Eucharist is
    not only a sacrament, but also a sacrifice. Now whoever offers sacrifice
    must be a sharer in the sacrifice, because the outward sacrifice he offers
    is a sign of the inner sacrifice whereby he offers himself to God, as
    Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x). Hence by partaking of the sacrifice he shows
    that the inner one is likewise his. In the same way also, by dispensing the
    sacrifice to the people he shows that he is the dispenser of Divine gifts,
    of which he ought himself to be the first to partake, as Dionysius says
    (Eccl. Hier. iii). Consequently, he ought to receive before dispensing it to
    the people. Accordingly we read in the chapter mentioned above (Twelfth
    Council of Toledo, Can. v): "What kind of sacrifice is that wherein not even
    the sacrificer is known to have a share?" But it is by partaking of the
    sacrifice that he has a share in it, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A18"
      >1 Cor. 10:18</a
    >): "Are not they that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?"
    Therefore it is necessary for the priest, as often as he consecrates, to
    receive this sacrament in its integrity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The consecration of chrism or of
    anything else is not a sacrifice, as the consecration of the Eucharist is:
    consequently there is no parallel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is accomplished
    in the use of the matter, and consequently no one can baptize himself,
    because the same person cannot be active and passive in a sacrament. Hence
    neither in this sacrament does the priest consecrate himself, but he
    consecrates the bread and wine, in which consecration the sacrament is
    completed. But the use thereof follows the sacrament, and therefore there is
    no parallel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If Christ's body appears miraculously
    upon the altar under the guise of flesh, or the blood under the guise of
    blood, it is not to be received. For Jerome says upon Leviticus (cf. De
    Consecr., dist. 2): "It is lawful to eat of this sacrifice which is
    wonderfully performed in memory of Christ: but it is not lawful for anyone
    to eat of that one which Christ offered on the altar of the cross." Nor does
    the priest transgress on that account, because miraculous events are not
    subject to human laws. Nevertheless the priest would be well advised to
    consecrate again and receive the Lord's body and blood.<br />

    Whether a wicked priest can consecrate the Eucharist?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a wicked priest cannot consecrate
    the Eucharist. For Jerome, commenting on Sophon. iii, 4, says: "The priests
    who perform the Eucharist, and who distribute our Lord's blood to the
    people, act wickedly against Christ's law, in deeming that the Eucharist is
    consecrated by a prayer rather than by a good life; and that only the solemn
    prayer is requisite, and not the priest's merits: of whom it is said: 'Let
    not the priest, in whatever defilement he may be, approach to offer
    oblations to the Lord'" (Lev. 21:21, Septuagint). But the sinful priest,
    being defiled, has neither the life nor the merits befitting this sacrament.
    Therefore a sinful priest cannot consecrate the Eucharist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) that
    "the bread and wine are changed supernaturally into the body and blood of
    our Lord, by the coming of the Holy Ghost." But Pope Gelasius I says (Ep. ad
    Elphid., cf. Decret. i, q. 1): "How shall the Holy Spirit, when invoked,
    come for the consecration of the Divine Mystery, if the priest invoking him
    be proved full of guilty deeds?" Consequently, the Eucharist cannot be
    consecrated by a wicked priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is consecrated by the
    priest's blessing. But a sinful priest's blessing is not efficacious for
    consecrating this sacrament, since it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Malachi+2%3A2"
      >Malachi 2:2</a
    >): "I will curse your blessings." Again, Dionysius says in his Epistle
    (viii) to the monk Demophilus: "He who is not enlightened has completely
    fallen away from the priestly order; and I wonder that such a man dare to
    employ his hands in priestly actions, and in the person of Christ to utter,
    over the Divine symbols, his unclean infamies, for I will not call them
    prayers."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Paschasius) says (De Corp. Dom.
    xii): "Within the Catholic Church, in the mystery of the Lord's body and
    blood, nothing greater is done by a good priest, nothing less by an evil
    priest, because it is not by the merits of the consecrator that the
    sacrament is accomplished, but by the Creator's word, and by the power of
    the Holy Spirit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP082.html#TPQ82ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,3), the priest consecrates this sacrament not by his own power, but as the
    minister of Christ, in Whose person he consecrates this sacrament. But from
    the fact of being wicked he does not cease to be Christ's minister; because
    our Lord has good and wicked ministers or servants. Hence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++24%3A45"
      >Mt. 24:45</a
    >) our Lord says: "Who, thinkest thou, is a faithful and wise servant?" and
    afterwards He adds: "But if that evil servant shall say in his heart," etc.
    And the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++4%3A1"
      >1 Cor. 4:1</a
    >) says: "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ"; and
    afterwards he adds: "I am not conscious to myself of anything; yet am I not
    hereby justified." He was therefore certain that he was Christ's minister;
    yet he was not certain that he was a just man. Consequently, a man can be
    Christ's minister even though he be not one of the just. And this belongs to
    Christ's excellence, Whom, as the true God, things both good and evil serve,
    since they are ordained by His providence for His glory. Hence it is evident
    that priests, even though they be not godly, but sinners, can consecrate the
    Eucharist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In those words Jerome is condemning the
    error of priests who believed they could consecrate the Eucharist worthily,
    from the mere fact of being priests, even though they were sinners; and
    Jerome condemns this from the fact that persons defiled are forbidden to
    approach the altar; but this does not prevent the sacrifice, which they
    offer, from being a true sacrifice, if they do approach.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Previous to the words quoted, Pope
    Gelasius expresses himself as follows: "That most holy rite, which contains
    the Catholic discipline, claims for itself such reverence that no one may
    dare to approach it except with clean conscience." From this it is evident
    that his meaning is that the priest who is a sinner ought not to approach
    this sacrament. Hence when he resumes, "How shall the Holy Spirit come when
    summoned," it must be understood that He comes, not through the priest's
    merits, but through the power of Christ, Whose words the priest utters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the same action can be evil, inasmuch
    as it is done with a bad intention of the servant; and good from the good
    intention of the master; so the blessing of a sinful priest, inasmuch as he
    acts unworthily is deserving of a curse, and is reputed an infamy and a
    blasphemy, and not a prayer; whereas, inasmuch as it is pronounced in the
    person of Christ, it is holy and efficacious. Hence it is said with
    significance: "I will curse your blessings."<br />

    Whether the mass of a sinful priest is of less worth than the mass of a good
    priest?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the mass of a sinful priest is not
    of less worth than that of a good priest. For Pope Gregory says in the
    Register: "Alas, into what a great snare they fall who believe that the
    Divine and hidden mysteries can be sanctified more by some than by others;
    since it is the one and the same Holy Ghost Who hallows those mysteries in a
    hidden and invisible manner." But these hidden mysteries are celebrated in
    the mass. Therefore the mass of a sinful priest is not of less value than
    the mass of a good priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Baptism is conferred by a minister
    through the power of Christ Who baptizes, so likewise this sacrament is
    consecrated in the person of Christ. But Baptism is no better when conferred
    by a better priest, as was said above (<a href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1"
      >Question [64]</a
    >, <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Therefore
    neither is a mass the better, which is celebrated by a better priest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the merits of priests differ in the
    point of being good and better, so they likewise differ in the point of
    being good and bad. Consequently, if the mass of a better priest be itself
    better, it follows that the mass of a bad priest must be bad. Now this is
    unreasonable, because the malice of the ministers cannot affect Christ's
    mysteries, as Augustine says in his work on Baptism (Contra Donat. xii).
    Therefore neither is the mass of a better priest the better.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in Decretal i, q. 1: "The
    worthier the priest, the sooner is he heard in the needs for which he
    prays."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are two things to be considered in the
    mass. namely, the sacrament itself, which is the chief thing; and the
    prayers which are offered up in the mass for the quick and the dead. So far
    as the mass itself is concerned, the mass of a wicked priest is not of less
    value than that of a good priest, because the same sacrifice is offered by
    both.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, the prayer put up in the mass can be considered in two respects:
    first of all, in so far as it has its efficacy from the devotion of the
    priest interceding, and in this respect there is no doubt but that the mass
    of the better priest is the more fruitful. In another respect, inasmuch as
    the prayer is said by the priest in the mass in the place of the entire
    Church, of which the priest is the minister; and this ministry remains even
    in sinful men, as was said above (<a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >) in regard to Christ's ministry. Hence, in this respect the prayer even of
    the sinful priest is fruitful, not only that which he utters in the mass,
    but likewise all those he recites in the ecclesiastical offices, wherein he
    takes the place of the Church. on the other hand, his private prayers are
    not fruitful, according to Prov. 28:9: "He that turneth away his ears from
    hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is speaking there of the
    holiness of the Divine sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the sacrament of Baptism solemn
    prayers are not made for all the faithful, as in the mass; therefore there
    is no parallel in this respect. There is, however, a resemblance as to the
    effect of the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By reason of the power of the Holy
    Ghost, Who communicates to each one the blessings of Christ's members on
    account of their being united in charity, the private blessing in the mass
    of a good priest is fruitful to others. But the private evil of one man
    cannot hurt another, except the latter, in some way, consent, as Augustine
    says (Contra Parmen. ii).<br />

    Whether heretics, schismatics, and excommunicated persons can consecrate?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that heretics, schismatics, and
    excommunicated persons are not able to consecrate the Eucharist. For
    Augustine says (Liber sentent. Prosperi xv) that "there is no such thing as
    a true sacrifice outside the Catholic Church": and Pope Leo I says (Ep.
    lxxx; cf. Decretal i, q. 1): Elsewhere "(i.e. than in the Church which is
    Christ's body) there is neither valid priesthood nor true sacrifice." But
    heretics, schismatics, and excommunicated persons are severed from the
    Church. Therefore they are unable to offer a true sacrifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further (Decretal, caus. i, q. 1), Innocent I is
    quoted as saying: "Because we receive the laity of the Arians and other
    pestilential persons, if they seem to repent, it does not follow that their
    clergy have the dignity of the priesthood or of any other ministerial
    office, for we allow them to confer nothing save Baptism." But none can
    consecrate the Eucharist, unless he have the dignity of the priesthood.
    Therefore heretics and the like cannot consecrate the Eucharist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it does not seem feasible for one
    outside the Church to act on behalf of the Church. But when the priest
    consecrates the Eucharist, he does so in the person of the entire Church, as
    is evident from the fact of his putting up all prayers in the person of the
    Church. Therefore, it seems that those who are outside the Church, such as
    those who are heretics, schismatics, and excommunicate, are not able to
    consecrate the Eucharist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii): "Just as
    Baptism remains in them," i.e. in heretics, schismatics, and those who are
    excommunicate, "so do their orders remain intact." Now, by the power of his
    ordination, a priest can consecrate the Eucharist. Therefore, it seems that
    heretics, schismatics, and those who are excommunicate, can consecrate the
    Eucharist, since their orders remain entire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have contended that heretics, schismatics,
    and the excommunicate, who are outside the pale of the Church, cannot
    perform this sacrament. But herein they are deceived, because, as Augustine
    says (Contra Parmen. ii), "it is one thing to lack something utterly, and
    another to have it improperly"; and in like fashion, "it is one thing not to
    bestow, and quite another to bestow, but not rightly." Accordingly, such as,
    being within the Church, received the power of consecrating the Eucharist
    through being ordained to the priesthood, have such power rightly indeed;
    but they use it improperly if afterwards they be separated from the Church
    by heresy, schism, or excommunication. But such as are ordained while
    separated from the Church, have neither the power rightly, nor do they use
    it rightly. But that in both cases they have the power, is clear from what
    Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii), that when they return to the unity of
    the Church, they are not re-ordained, but are received in their orders. And
    since the consecration of the Eucharist is an act which follows the power of
    order, such persons as are separated from the Church by heresy, schism, or
    excommunication, can indeed consecrate the Eucharist, which on being
    consecrated by them contains Christ's true body and blood; but they act
    wrongly, and sin by doing so; and in consequence they do not receive the
    fruit of the sacrifice, which is a spiritual sacrifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such and similar authorities are to be
    understood in this sense, that the sacrifice is offered wrongly outside the
    Church. Hence outside the Church there can be no spiritual sacrifice that is
    a true sacrifice with the truth of its fruit, although it be a true
    sacrifice with the truth of the sacrament; thus it was stated above (<a
      href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1"
      >Question [80]</a
    >, <a href="TP080.html#TPQ80A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), that the sinner
    receives Christ's body sacramentally, but not spiritually.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism alone is allowed to be conferred
    by heretics, and schismatics, because they can lawfully baptize in case of
    necessity; but in no case can they lawfully consecrate the Eucharist, or
    confer the other sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The priest, in reciting the prayers of
    the mass, speaks instead of the Church, in whose unity he remains; but in
    consecrating the sacrament he speaks as in the person of Christ, Whose place
    he holds by the power of his orders. Consequently, if a priest severed from
    the unity of the Church celebrates mass, not having lost the power of order,
    he consecrates Christ's true body and blood; but because he is severed from
    the unity of the Church, his prayers have no efficacy.<br />

    Whether a degraded priest can consecrate this sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a degraded priest cannot consecrate
    this sacrament. For no one can perform this sacrament except he have the
    power of consecrating. But the priest "who has been degraded has no power of
    consecrating, although he has the power of baptizing" (App. Gratiani).
    Therefore it seems that a degraded priest cannot consecrate the
    Eucharist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who gives can take away. But the
    bishop in ordaining gives to the priest the power of consecrating. Therefore
    he can take it away by degrading him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priest, by degradation, loses either
    the power of consecrating, or the use of such power. But he does not lose
    merely the use, for thus the degraded one would lose no more than one
    excommunicated, who also lacks the use. Therefore it seems that he loses the
    power to consecrate, and in consequence that he cannot perform this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Contra Parmen. ii) proves that
    "apostates" from the faith "are not deprived of their Baptism," from the
    fact that "it is not restored to them when they return repentant; and
    therefore it is deemed that it cannot be lost." But in like fashion, if the
    degraded man be restored, he has not to be ordained over again.
    Consequently, he has not lost the power of consecrating, and so the degraded
    priest can perform this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The power of consecrating the Eucharist belongs
    to the character of the priestly order. But every character is indelible,
    because it is given with a kind of consecration, as was said above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1"
      >Question [63]</a
    >, <a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), just as the
    consecrations of all other things are perpetual, and cannot be lost or
    repeated. Hence it is clear that the power of consecrating is not lost by
    degradation. For, again, Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii): "Both are
    sacraments," namely Baptism and order, "and both are given to a man with a
    kind of consecration; the former, when he is baptized; the latter when he is
    ordained; and therefore it is not lawful for Catholics to repeat either of
    them." And thus it is evident that the degraded priest can perform this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That Canon is speaking, not as by way of
    assertion, but by way of inquiry, as can be gleaned from the context.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The bishop gives the priestly power of
    order, not as though coming from himself, but instrumentally, as God's
    minister, and its effect cannot be taken away by man, according to Mt. 19:6:
    "What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder." And therefore the
    bishop cannot take this power away, just as neither can he who baptizes take
    away the baptismal character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Excommunication is medicinal. And
    therefore the ministry of the priestly power is not taken away from the
    excommunicate, as it were, perpetually, but only for a time, that they may
    mend; but the exercise is withdrawn from the degraded, as though condemned
    perpetually.<br />

    Whether it is permissible to receive communion from heretical,
    excommunicate, or sinful priests, and to hear mass said by them?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that one may lawfully receive Communion
    from heretical, excommunicate, or even sinful priests, and to hear mass said
    by them. Because, as Augustine says (Contra Petilian. iii), "we should not
    avoid God's sacraments, whether they be given by a good man or by a wicked
    one." But priests, even if they be sinful, or heretics, or excommunicate,
    perform a valid sacrament. Therefore it seems that one ought not to refrain
    from receiving Communion at their hands, or from hearing their mass.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's true body is figurative of His
    mystical body, as was said above (<a href="TP067.html#TPQ67OUTP1"
      >Question [67]</a
    >, <a href="TP067.html#TPQ67A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But Christ's true
    body is consecrated by the priests mentioned above. Therefore it seems that
    whoever belongs to His mystical body can communicate in their sacrifices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there are many sins graver than
    fornication. But it is not forbidden to hear the masses of priests who sin
    otherwise. Therefore, it ought not to be forbidden to hear the masses of
    priests guilty of this sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Canon says (Dist. 32): "Let no one hear
    the mass of a priest whom he knows without doubt to have a concubine."
    Moreover, Gregory says (Dial. iii) that "the faithless father sent an Arian
    bishop to his son, for him to receive sacrilegiously the consecrated
    Communion at his hands. But, when the Arian bishop arrived, God's devoted
    servant rebuked him, as was right for him to do."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP082.html#TPQ82ATHEP1"
      >Articles [5]</a
    >,7), heretical, schismatical, excommunicate, or even sinful priests,
    although they have the power to consecrate the Eucharist, yet they do not
    make a proper use of it; on the contrary, they sin by using it. But whoever
    communicates with another who is in sin, becomes a sharer in his sin. Hence
    we read in John's Second Canonical Epistle (11) that "He that saith unto
    him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works." Consequently, it
    is not lawful to receive Communion from them, or to assist at their mass.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Still there is a difference among the above, because heretics, schismatics,
    and excommunicates, have been forbidden, by the Church's sentence, to
    perform the Eucharistic rite. And therefore whoever hears their mass or
    receives the sacraments from them, commits sin. But not all who are sinners
    are debarred by the Church's sentence from using this power: and so,
    although suspended by the Divine sentence, yet they are not suspended in
    regard to others by any ecclesiastical sentence: consequently, until the
    Church's sentence is pronounced, it is lawful to receive Communion at their
    hands, and to hear their mass. Hence on 1 Cor. 5:11, "with such a one not so
    much as to eat," Augustine's gloss runs thus: "In saying this he was
    unwilling for a man to be judged by his fellow man on arbitrary suspicion,
    or even by usurped extraordinary judgment, but rather by God's law,
    according to the Church's ordering, whether he confess of his own accord, or
    whether he be accused and convicted."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By refusing to hear the masses of such
    priests, or to receive Communion from them, we are not shunning God's
    sacraments; on the contrary, by so doing we are giving them honor (hence a
    host consecrated by such priests is to be adored, and if it be reserved, it
    can be consumed by a lawful priest): but what we shun is the sin of the
    unworthy ministers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The unity of the mystical body is the
    fruit of the true body received. But those who receive or minister
    unworthily, are deprived of the fruit, as was said above (<a
      href="TP082.html#TPQ82A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >; <a href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>,
    <a href="TP080.html#TPQ80A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). And therefore, those who
    belong to the unity of the Faith are not to receive the sacrament from their
    dispensing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although fornication is not graver than
    other sins, yet men are more prone to it, owing to fleshly concupiscence.
    Consequently, this sin is specially inhibited to priests by the Church, lest
    anyone hear the mass of one living in concubinage. However, this is to be
    understood of one who is notorious, either from being convicted and
    sentenced, or from having acknowledged his guilt in legal form, or from it
    being impossible to conceal his guilt by any subterfuge.<br />

    Whether it is lawful for a priest to refrain entirely from consecrating the
    Eucharist?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems to be lawful for a priest to refrain
    entirely from consecrating the Eucharist. Because, as it is the priest's
    office to consecrate the Eucharist, so it is likewise to baptize and
    administer the other sacraments. But the priest is not bound to act as a
    minister of the other sacraments, unless he has undertaken the care of
    souls. Therefore, it seems that likewise he is not bound to consecrate the
    Eucharist except he be charged with the care of souls.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to do what is unlawful
    for him to do; otherwise he would be in two minds. But it is not lawful for
    the priest who is in a state of sin, or excommunicate, to consecrate the
    Eucharist, as was said above (<a href="TP082.html#TPQ82A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >). Therefore it seems that such men are not bound to celebrate, and so
    neither are the others; otherwise they would be gainers by their fault.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the priestly dignity is not lost by
    subsequent weakness: because Pope Gelasius I says (cf. Decretal, Dist. 55):
    "As the canonical precepts do not permit them who are feeble in body to
    approach the priesthood, so if anyone be disabled when once in that state,
    he cannot lose that he received at the time he was well." But it sometimes
    happens that those who are already ordained as priests incur defects whereby
    they are hindered from celebrating, such as leprosy or epilepsy, or the
    like. Consequently, it does not appear that priests are bound to
    celebrate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says in one of his Orations (xxxiii):
    "It is a grave matter if we do not approach Thy altar with clean heart and
    pure hands; but it is graver still if while shunning sins we also fail to
    offer our sacrifice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that a priest may lawfully
    refrain altogether from consecrating, except he be bound to do so, and to
    give the sacraments to the people, by reason of his being entrusted with the
    care of souls.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this is said quite unreasonably, because everyone is bound to use the
    grace entrusted to him, when opportunity serves, according to 2 Cor. 6:1:
    "We exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain." But the
    opportunity of offering sacrifice is considered not merely in relation to
    the faithful of Christ to whom the sacraments must be administered, but
    chiefly with regard to God to Whom the sacrifice of this sacrament is
    offered by consecrating. Hence, it is not lawful for the priest, even though
    he has not the care of souls, to refrain altogether from celebrating; and he
    seems to be bound to celebrate at least on the chief festivals, and
    especially on those days on which the faithful usually communicate. And
    hence it is that (2 Macc. 4:14) it is said against some priests that they
    "were not now occupied about the offices of the altar... despising the
    temple and neglecting the sacrifices."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The other sacraments are accomplished in
    being used by the faithful, and therefore he alone is bound to administer
    them who has undertaken the care of souls. But this sacrament is performed
    in the consecration of the Eucharist, whereby a sacrifice is offered to God,
    to which the priest is bound from the order he has received.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sinful priest, if deprived by the
    Church's sentence from exercising his order, simply or for a time, is
    rendered incapable of offering sacrifice; consequently, the obligation
    lapses. But if not deprived of the power of celebrating, the obligation is
    not removed; nor is he in two minds, because he can repent of his sin and
    then celebrate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Weakness or sickness contracted by a
    priest after his ordination does not deprive him of his orders; but hinders
    him from exercising them, as to the consecration of the Eucharist: sometimes
    by making it impossible to exercise them, as, for example, if he lose his
    sight, or his fingers, or the use of speech; and sometimes on account of
    danger, as in the case of one suffering from epilepsy, or indeed any disease
    of the mind; and sometimes, on account of loathsomeness, as is evident in
    the case of a leper, who ought not to celebrate in public: he can, however,
    say mass privately, unless the leprosy has gone so far that it has rendered
    him incapable owing to the wasting away of his limbs.<br />
