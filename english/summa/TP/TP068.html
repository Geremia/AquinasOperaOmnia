<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not all are bound to receive Baptism. For Christ 
did not narrow man's road to salvation. But before Christ's coming men 
could be saved without Baptism: therefore also after Christ's coming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism seems to have been instituted principally as a 
remedy for original sin. Now, since a man who is baptized is without 
original sin, it seems that he cannot transmit it to his children. 
Therefore it seems that the children of those who have been baptized, 
should not themselves be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism is given in order that a man may, through grace, 
be cleansed from sin. But those who are sanctified in the womb, obtain 
this without Baptism. Therefore they are not bound to receive Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++3%3A5">Jn. 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of 
water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Again 
it is stated in De Eccl. Dogm. xli, that "we believe the way of salvation 
to be open to those only who are  baptized."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Men are bound to that without which they cannot obtain 
salvation. Now it is manifest that no one can obtain salvation but 
through Christ; wherefore the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A18">Rm. 5:18</a>): "As by the offense 
of one unto all men unto condemnation; so also by the justice of one, 
unto all men unto justification of life." But for this end is Baptism 
conferred on a man, that being regenerated thereby, he may be 
incorporated in Christ, by becoming His member: wherefore it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A27">Gal. 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on 
Christ." Consequently it is manifest that all are bound to be baptized: 
and that without Baptism there is no salvation for men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> At no time, not even before the coming of Christ, could men 
be saved unless they became members of Christ: because, as it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+4%3A12">Acts 4:12</a>), "there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby 
we must be saved." But before Christ's coming, men were incorporated in 
Christ by faith in His future coming: of which faith circumcision was the 
"seal," as the Apostle calls it (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++4%3A11">Rm. 4:11</a>): whereas before circumcision 
was instituted, men were incorporated in Christ by "faith alone," as 
Gregory says (Moral. iv), together with the offering of sacrifices, by 
means of which the Fathers of old made profession of their faith. Again, 
since Christ's coming, men are incorporated in Christ by faith; according 
to Eph. 3:17: "That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts." But faith 
in a thing already present is manifested by a sign different from that by 
which it was manifested when that thing was yet in the future: just as we 
use other parts of the verb, to signify the present, the past, and the 
future. Consequently although the sacrament itself of Baptism was not 
always necessary for salvation, yet faith, of which Baptism is the 
sacrament, was always necessary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As we have stated in the FS, Question [81], Article [3], ad 2, those who 
are baptized are renewed in spirit by Baptism, while their body remains 
subject to the oldness of sin, according to Rm. 8:10: "The body, indeed, 
is dead because of sin, but the spirit liveth because of justification." 
Wherefore Augustine (Contra Julian. vi) proves that "not everything that 
is in man is baptized." Now it is manifest that in carnal generation man 
does not beget in respect of his soul, but in respect of his body. 
Consequently the children of those who are baptized are born with 
original sin; wherefore they need to be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are sanctified in the womb, receive indeed grace 
which cleanses them from original sin, but they do not therefore receive 
the character, by which they are conformed to Christ. Consequently, if 
any were to be sanctified in the womb now, they would need to be 
baptized, in order to be conformed to Christ's other members by receiving 
the character.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can be saved without Baptism? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no man can be saved without Baptism. For our Lord 
said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++3%3A5">Jn. 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, 
he cannot enter the kingdom of God." But those alone are saved who enter 
God's kingdom. Therefore none can be saved without Baptism, by which a 
man is born again of water and the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the book De Eccl. Dogm. xli, it is written: "We 
believe that no catechumen, though he die in his good works, will have 
eternal life, except he suffer martyrdom, which contains all the 
sacramental virtue of Baptism." But if it were possible for anyone to be 
saved without Baptism, this would be the case specially with catechumens 
who are credited with good works, for they seem to have the "faith that 
worketh by charity" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A6">Gal. 5:6</a>). Therefore it seems that none can be saved 
without Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the sacrament of 
Baptism is necessary for salvation. Now that is necessary "without which 
something cannot be" (Metaph. v). Therefore it seems that none can obtain 
salvation without Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Super Levit. lxxxiv) that "some have 
received the invisible sanctification without visible sacraments, and to 
their profit; but though it is possible to have the visible 
sanctification, consisting in a visible sacrament, without the invisible 
sanctification, it will be to no profit." Since, therefore, the sacrament 
of Baptism pertains to the visible sanctification, it seems that a man 
can obtain salvation without the sacrament of Baptism, by means of the 
invisible sanctification.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The sacrament or Baptism may be wanting to someone in two 
ways. First, both in reality and in desire; as is the case with those who 
neither are baptized, nor wished to be baptized: which clearly indicates 
contempt of the sacrament, in regard to those who have the use of the 
free-will. Consequently those to whom Baptism is wanting thus, cannot 
obtain salvation: since neither sacramentally nor mentally are they 
incorporated in Christ, through Whom alone can salvation be obtained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the sacrament of Baptism may be wanting to anyone in reality 
but not in desire: for instance, when a man wishes to be baptized, but by 
some ill-chance he is forestalled by death before receiving Baptism. And 
such a man can obtain salvation without being actually baptized, on 
account of his desire for Baptism, which desire is the outcome of "faith 
that worketh by charity," whereby God, Whose power is not tied to visible 
sacraments, sanctifies man inwardly. Hence Ambrose says of Valentinian, 
who died while yet a catechumen: "I lost him whom I was to regenerate: 
but he did not lose the grace he prayed for."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++16%3A7">1 Kgs. 16:7</a>), "man seeth those things 
that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart." Now a man who desires to 
be "born again of water and the Holy Ghost" by  Baptism, is regenerated 
in heart though not in body. thus the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++2%3A29">Rm. 2:29</a>) that "the 
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; 
whose praise is not of men but of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No man obtains eternal life unless he be free from all 
guilt and debt of punishment. Now this plenary absolution is given when a 
man receives Baptism, or suffers martyrdom: for which reason is it stated 
that martyrdom "contains all the sacramental virtue of Baptism," i.e. as 
to the full deliverance from guilt and punishment. Suppose, therefore, a 
catechumen to have the desire for Baptism (else he could not be said to 
die in his good works, which cannot be without "faith that worketh by 
charity"), such a one, were he to die, would not forthwith come to 
eternal life, but would suffer punishment for his past sins, "but he 
himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire" as is stated 1 Cor. 3:15.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is said to be necessary for 
salvation in so far as man cannot be saved without, at least, Baptism of 
desire; "which, with God, counts for the deed" (Augustine, Enarr. in Ps. 
57).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Baptism should be deferred?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism should be deferred. For Pope Leo says 
(Epist. xvi): "Two seasons," i.e. Easter and Whitsuntide, "are fixed by 
the Roman Pontiff for the celebration of Baptism. Wherefore we admonish 
your Beatitude not to add any other days to this custom." Therefore it 
seems that Baptism should be conferred not at once, but delayed until the 
aforesaid seasons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we read in the decrees of the Council of Agde (Can. 
xxxiv): "If Jews whose bad faith often "returns to the vomit," wish to 
submit to the Law of the Catholic Church, let them for eight months enter 
the porch of the church with the catechumens; and if they are found to 
come in good faith then at last they may deserve the grace of Baptism." 
Therefore men should not be baptized at once, and Baptism should be 
deferred for a certain fixed time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as we read in Is. 27:9, "this is all the fruit, that the 
sin . . . should be taken away." Now sin seems to be taken away, or at 
any rate lessened, if Baptism be deferred. First, because those who sin 
after Baptism, sin more grievously, according to Heb. 10:29: "How much 
more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath . . . 
esteemed the blood of the testament," i.e. Baptism, "unclean, by which he 
was sanctified?" Secondly, because Baptism takes away past, but not 
future, sins: wherefore the more it is deferred, the more sins it takes 
away. Therefore it seems that Baptism should be deferred for a long time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 5:8): "Delay not to be  
converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day." But the perfect 
conversion to God is of those who are regenerated in Christ by Baptism. 
Therefore Baptism should not be deferred from day to day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In this matter we must make a distinction and see whether 
those who are to be baptized are children or adults. For if they be 
children, Baptism should not be deferred. First, because in them we do 
not look for better instruction or fuller conversion. Secondly, because 
of the danger of death, for no other remedy is available for them besides 
the sacrament of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, adults have a remedy in the mere desire for Baptism, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And therefore Baptism should not be conferred on 
adults as soon as they are converted, but it should be deferred until 
some fixed time. First, as a safeguard to the Church, lest she be 
deceived through baptizing those who come to her under false pretenses, 
according to 1 Jn. 4:1: "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, 
if they be of God." And those who approach Baptism are put to this test, 
when their faith and morals are subjected to proof for a space of time. 
Secondly, this is needful as being useful for those who are baptized; for 
they require a certain space of time in order to be fully instructed in 
the faith, and to be drilled in those things that pertain to the 
Christian mode of life. Thirdly, a certain reverence for the sacrament 
demands a delay whereby men are admitted to Baptism at the principal 
festivities, viz. of Easter and Pentecost, the result being that they 
receive the sacrament with greater devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, however, two reasons for forgoing this delay. First, when 
those who are to be baptized appear to be perfectly instructed in the 
faith and ready for Baptism; thus, Philip baptized the Eunuch at once 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+8">Acts 8</a>); and Peter, Cornelius and those who were with him (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+10">Acts 10</a>). 
Secondly, by reason of sickness or some kind of danger of death. 
Wherefore Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): "Those who are threatened by death, 
sickness, siege, persecution, or shipwreck, should be baptized at any 
time." Yet if a man is forestalled by death, so as to have no time to 
receive the sacrament, while he awaits the season appointed by the 
Church, he is saved, yet "so as by fire," as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). 
Nevertheless he sins if he defer being baptized beyond the time appointed 
by the Church, except this be for an unavoidable cause and with the 
permission of the authorities of the Church. But even this sin, with his 
other sins, can be washed away by his subsequent contrition, which takes 
the place of Baptism, as stated above (<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This decree of Pope Leo, concerning the celebration of 
Baptism at two seasons, is to be understood "with the exception of the 
danger of death" (which is always to be feared in children) as stated 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This decree concerning the Jews was for a safeguard to the 
Church, lest they corrupt the faith of simple  people, if they be not 
fully converted. Nevertheless, as the same passage reads further on, "if 
within the appointed time they are threatened with danger of sickness, 
they should be baptized."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism, by the grace which it bestows, removes not only 
past sins, but hinders the commission of future sins. Now this is the 
point to be considered---that men may not sin: it is a secondary 
consideration that their sins be less grievous, or that their sins be 
washed away, according to 1 Jn. 2:1,2: "My little children, these things 
I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an 
advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just; and He is the 
propitiation for our sins."<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sinners should be baptized. For it is written 
(Zach. 13:1): "In that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of 
David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the sinner 
and of the unclean woman": and this is to be understood of the fountain 
of Baptism. Therefore it seems that the sacrament of Baptism should be 
offered even to sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->

not a physician, but they that are ill." But they that are ill are 
sinners. Therefore since Baptism is the remedy of Christ the physician of 
our souls, it seems that this sacrament should be offered to sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no assistance should be withdrawn from sinners. But 
sinners who have been baptized derive spiritual assistance from the very 
character of Baptism, since it is a disposition to grace. Therefore it 
seems that the sacrament of Baptism should be offered to sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Serm. clxix): "He Who created thee 
without thee, will not justify thee without thee." But since a sinner's 
will is ill-disposed, he does not co-operate with God. Therefore it is 
useless to employ Baptism as a means of justification.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A man may be said to be a sinner in two ways. First, on 
account of the stain and the debt of punishment incurred in the past: and 
on sinners in this sense the sacrament of Baptism should be conferred, 
since it is instituted specially for this purpose, that by it the 
uncleanness of sin may be washed away, according to Eph. 5:26: "Cleansing 
it by the laver of water in the word of life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a man may be called a sinner because he wills to sin and 
purposes to remain in sin: and on sinners in this sense the sacrament of 
Baptism should not be conferred. First, indeed, because by Baptism men 
are incorporated in Christ, according to Gal. 3:27: "As many of you as 
have been baptized in Christ, have  put on Christ." Now so long as a man 
wills to sin, he cannot be united to Christ, according to 2 Cor. 6:14: 
"What participation hath justice with injustice?" Wherefore Augustine 
says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli) that "no man who has the use of 
free-will can begin the new life, except he repent of his former life." 
Secondly, because there should be nothing useless in the works of Christ 
and of the Church. Now that is useless which does not reach the end to 
which it is ordained; and, on the other hand, no one having the will to 
sin can, at the same time, be cleansed from sin, which is the purpose of 
Baptism; for this would be to combine two contradictory things. Thirdly, 
because there should be no falsehood in the sacramental signs. Now a sign 
is false if it does not correspond with the thing signified. But the very 
fact that a man presents himself to be cleansed by Baptism, signifies 
that he prepares himself for the inward cleansing: while this cannot be 
the case with one who purposes to remain in sin. Therefore it is manifest 
that on such a man the sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted are to be understood of those sinners 
whose will is set on renouncing sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The physician of souls, i.e. Christ, works in two ways. 
First, inwardly, by Himself: and thus He prepares man's will so that it 
wills good and hates evil. Secondly, He works through ministers, by the 
outward application of the sacraments: and in this way His work consists 
in perfecting what was begun outwardly. Therefore the sacrament of 
Baptism is not to be conferred save on those in whom there appears some 
sign of their interior conversion: just as neither is bodily medicine 
given to a sick man, unless he show some sign of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism is the sacrament of faith. Now dead faith does not 
suffice for salvation; nor is it the foundation, but living faith alone, 
"that worketh by charity" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A6">Gal. 5:6</a>), as Augustine says (De Fide et 
oper.). Neither, therefore, can the sacrament of Baptism give salvation 
to a man whose will is set on sinning, and hence expels the form of 
faith. Moreover, the impression of the baptismal character cannot dispose 
a man for grace as long as he retains the will to sin; for "God compels 
no man to be virtuous," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners that have been baptized?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners 
that have been baptized. For God's justice seems to demand that a man 
should be punished for every sin of his, according to Eccles. 12:14: "All 
things that are done, God will bring into judgment." But works of 
satisfaction are enjoined on sinners in punishment of past sins. 
Therefore it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on 
sinners that have been baptized. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by means of works of satisfaction sinners recently 
converted are drilled into righteousness, and are made to avoid the 
occasions of sin: "for satisfaction consists in extirpating the causes of 
vice, and closing the doors to sin" (De Eccl. Dogm. iv). But this is most 
necessary in the case of those who have been baptized recently. Therefore 
it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man owes satisfaction to God not less than to his 
neighbor. But if those who were recently baptized have injured their 
neighbor, they should be told to make reparation to God by works of 
penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose commenting on Rm. 11:29: "The gifts and the 
calling of God are without repentance," says: "The grace of God requires 
neither sighs nor groans in Baptism, nor indeed any work at all, but 
faith alone; and remits all, gratis."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A3,4">Rm. 6:3,4</a>), "all we who are baptized 
in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death: for we are buried together 
with Him, by Baptism unto death"; which is to say that by Baptism man is 
incorporated in the very death of Christ. Now it is manifest from what 
has been said above (<A Href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="TP048.html#TPQ48ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4; <A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that Christ's death 
satisfied sufficiently for sins, "not for ours only, but also for those 
of the whole world," according to 1 Jn. 2:2. Consequently no kind of 
satisfaction should be enjoined on one who is being baptized, for any 
sins whatever: and this would be to dishonor the Passion and death of 
Christ, as being insufficient for the plenary satisfaction for the sins 
of those who were to be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says in his book on Infant Baptism (De Pecc. 
Merit. et Remiss. i), "the effect of Baptism is to make those, who are 
baptized, to be incorporated in Christ as His members." Wherefore the 
very pains of Christ were satisfactory for the sins of those who were to 
be baptized; just as the pain of one member can be satisfactory for the 
sin of another member. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++53%3A4">Is. 53:4</a>): "Surely He hath 
borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who have been lately baptized should be drilled into 
righteousness, not by penal, but by "easy works, so as to advance to 
perfection by taking exercise, as infants by taking milk," as a gloss 
says on Ps. 130:2: "As a child that is weaned is towards his mother." For 
this reason did our Lord excuse His disciples from fasting when they were 
recently converted, as we read in Mt. 9:14,15: and the same is written 1 
Pt. 2:2: "As new-born babes desire . . . milk . . . that thereby you may 
grow unto salvation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To restore what has been ill taken from one's neighbor, and 
to make satisfaction for wrong done to him, is to cease from sin: for the 
very fact of retaining what belongs to  another and of not being 
reconciled to one's neighbor, is a sin. Wherefore those who are baptized 
should be enjoined to make satisfaction to their neighbor, as also to 
desist from sin. But they are not to be enjoined to suffer any punishment 
for past sins.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sinners who are going to be baptized are bound to 
confess their sins. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++3%3A6">Mt. 3:6</a>) that many "were baptized" 
by John "in the Jordan confessing their sins." But Christ's Baptism is 
more perfect than John's. Therefore it seems that there is yet greater 
reason why they who are about to receive Christ's Baptism should confess 
their sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++28%3A13">Prov. 28:13</a>): "He that hideth his sins, 
shall not prosper; but he that shall confess and forsake them, shall 
obtain mercy." Now for this is a man baptized, that he may obtain mercy 
for his sins. Therefore those who are going to be baptized should confess 
their sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Penance is required before Baptism, according to Acts 
2:38: "Do penance and be baptized every one of you." But confession is a 
part of Penance. Therefore it seems that confession of sins should take 
place before Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Confession of sins should be sorrowful: thus Augustine 
says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. xiv): "All these circumstances should be 
taken into account and deplored." Now, as Ambrose says on Rm. 11:29, "the 
grace of God requires neither sighs nor groans in Baptism." Therefore 
confession of sins should not be required of those who are going to be 
baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Confession of sins is twofold. One is made inwardly to 
God: and such confession of sins is required before Baptism: in other 
words, man should call his sins to mind and sorrow for them; since "he 
cannot begin the new life, except he repent of his former life," as 
Augustine says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli). The other is the 
outward confession of sins, which is made to a priest; and such 
confession is not required before Baptism. First, because this 
confession, since it is directed to the person of the minister, belongs 
to the sacrament of Penance, which is not required before Baptism, which 
is the door of all the sacraments. Secondly, because the reason why a man 
makes outward confession to a priest, is that the priest may absolve him 
from his sins, and bind him to works of satisfaction, which should not be 
enjoined on the baptized, as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Moreover those who are 
being baptized do not need to be released from their sins by the keys of 
the Church, since all are forgiven them in Baptism. Thirdly, because the 
very act of confession made to a man is penal, by reason of the shame it 
inflicts on the one confessing: whereas no exterior punishment is 
enjoined on a man who is being baptized. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore no special confession of sins is required of those who are 
being baptized; but that general confession suffices which they make when 
in accordance with the Church's ritual they "renounce Satan and all his 
works." And in this sense a gloss explains Mt. 3:6, saying that in John's 
Baptism "those who are going to be baptized learn that they should 
confess their sins and promise to amend their life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, any persons about to be baptized, wish, out of devotion, to 
confess their sins, their confession should be heard; not for the purpose 
of enjoining them to do satisfaction, but in order to instruct them in 
the spiritual life as a remedy against their vicious habits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sins were not forgiven in John's Baptism, which, however, 
was the Baptism of Penance. Consequently it was fitting that those who 
went to receive that Baptism, should confess their sins, so that they 
should receive a penance in proportion to their sins. But Christ's 
Baptism is without outward penance, as Ambrose says (on Rm. 11:29); and 
therefore there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is enough that the baptized make inward confession to 
God, and also an outward general confession, for them to "prosper and 
obtain mercy": and they need no special outward confession, as stated 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Confession is a part of sacramental Penance, which is not 
required before Baptism, as stated above: but the inward virtue of 
Penance is required.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the intention of receiving the sacrament of Baptism 
is not required on the part of the one baptized. For the one baptized is, 
as it were, "patient" in the sacrament. But an intention is required not 
on the part of the patient but on the part of the agent. Therefore it 
seems that the intention of receiving Baptism is not required on the part 
of the one baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if what is necessary for Baptism be omitted, the Baptism 
must be repeated; for instance, if the invocation of the Trinity be 
omitted, as stated above (<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 3). But it does not seem that a 
man should be rebaptized through not having had the intention of 
receiving Baptism: else, since his intention cannot be proved, anyone 
might ask to be baptized again on account of his lack of intention. 
Therefore it seems that no intention is required on the part of the one 
baptized, in order that he receive the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism is given as a remedy for original sin. But 
original sin is contracted without the intention of the person  born. 
Therefore, seemingly, Baptism requires no intention on the part of the 
person baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the Church's ritual, those who are to be 
baptized ask of the Church that they may receive Baptism: and thus they 
express their intention of receiving the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By Baptism a man dies to the old life of sin, and begins 
a certain newness of life, according to Rm. 6:4: "We are buried together 
with" Christ "by Baptism into death; that, as Christ is risen from the 
dead . . . so we also may walk in newness of life." Consequently, just 
as, according to Augustine (Serm. cccli), he who has the use of 
free-will, must, in order to die to the old life, "will to repent of his 
former life"; so must he, of his own will, intend to lead a new life, the 
beginning of which is precisely the receiving of the sacrament. Therefore 
on the part of the one baptized, it is necessary for him to have the will 
or intention of receiving the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a man is justified by Baptism, his passiveness is not 
violent but voluntary: wherefore it is necessary for him to intend to 
receive that which is given him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If an adult lack the intention of receiving the sacrament,

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that faith is required on the part of the one baptized. 
For the sacrament of Baptism was instituted by Christ. But Christ, in 
giving the form of Baptism, makes faith to precede Baptism (Mk. 16:16): 
"He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved." Therefore it seems 
that without faith there can be no sacrament of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing useless is done in the sacraments of the Church. 
But according to the Church's ritual, the man who comes to be baptized is 
asked concerning his faith: "Dost thou believe in God the Father 
Almighty?" Therefore it seems that faith is required for Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intention of receiving the sacrament is required for 
Baptism. But this cannot be without right faith, since Baptism is the 
sacrament of right faith: for thereby men "are incorporated in Christ," 
as Augustine says in his book on Infant Baptism (De Pecc. Merit. et 
Remiss. i); and this cannot be without right faith, according to Eph. 
3:17: "That Christ may dwell by  faith in your hearts." Therefore it 
seems that a man who has not right faith cannot receive the sacrament of 
Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, unbelief is a most grievous sin, as we have shown in the 
SS, Question [10], Article [3]. But those who remain in sin should not be baptized: 
therefore neither should those who remain in unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory writing to the bishop Quiricus says: "We have 
learned from the ancient tradition of the Fathers that when heretics, 
baptized in the name of the Trinity, come back to Holy Church, they are 
to be welcomed to her bosom, either with the anointing of chrism, or the 
imposition of hands, or the mere profession of faith." But such would not 
be the case if faith were necessary for a man to receive Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what has been said above (<A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>) Baptism produces a twofold effect in the soul, viz. the 
character and grace. Therefore in two ways may a thing be necessary for 
Baptism. First, as something without which grace, which is the ultimate 
effect of the sacrament, cannot be had. And thus right faith is necessary 
for Baptism, because, as it appears from Rm. 3:22, the justice of God is 
by faith of Jesus Christ.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, something is required of necessity for Baptism, because 
without it the baptismal character cannot be imprinted And thus right 
faith is not necessary in the one baptized any more than in the one who 
baptizes: provided the other conditions are fulfilled which are essential 
to the sacrament. For the sacrament is not perfected by the righteousness 
of the minister or of the recipient of Baptism, but by the power of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord is speaking there of Baptism as bringing us to 
salvation by giving us sanctifying grace: which of course cannot be 
without right faith: wherefore He says pointedly: "He that believeth and 
is baptized, shall be saved."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Church's intention in Baptizing men is that they may be 
cleansed from sin, according to Is. 27:9: "This is all the fruit, that 
the sin . . . should be taken away." And therefore, as far as she is 
concerned, she does not intend to give Baptism save to those who have 
right faith, without which there is no remission of sins. And for this 
reason she asks those who come to be baptized whether they believe. If, 
on the contrary, anyone, without right faith, receive Baptism outside the 
Church, he does not receive it unto salvation. Hence Augustine says (De 
Baptism. contr. Donat. iv): "From the Church being compared to Paradise 
we learn that men can receive her Baptism even outside her fold, but that 
elsewhere none can receive or keep the salvation of the blessed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even he who has not right faith on other points, can have 
right faith about the sacrament of Baptism: and so he is not hindered 
from having the intention of receiving that sacrament. Yet even if he 
think not aright concerning this sacrament, it is  enough, for the 
receiving of the sacrament, that he should have a general intention of 
receiving Baptism, according as Christ instituted, and as the Church 
bestows it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Just as the sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred on 
a man who is unwilling to give up his other sins, so neither should it be 
given to one who is unwilling to renounce his unbelief. Yet each receives 
the sacrament if it be conferred on him, though not unto salvation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether children should be baptized?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that children should not be baptized. For the intention 
to receive the sacrament is required in one who is being baptized, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). But children cannot have such an intention, since 
they have not the use of free-will. Therefore it seems that they cannot 
receive the sacrament of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism is the sacrament of faith, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP039.html#TPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="TP039.html#TPQ39A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). But children have not faith, which 
demands an act of the will on the part of the believer, as Augustine says 
(Super Joan. xxvi). Nor can it be said that their salvation is implied in 
the faith of their parents; since the latter are sometimes unbelievers, 
and their unbelief would conduce rather to the damnation of their 
children. Therefore it seems that children cannot be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++3%3A21">1 Pt. 3:21</a>) that "Baptism saveth" men; 
"not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a 
good conscience towards God." But children have no conscience, either 
good or bad, since they have not the use of reason: nor can they be 
fittingly examined, since they understand not. Therefore children should 
not be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii): "Our heavenly 
guides," i.e. the Apostles, "approved of infants being admitted to 
Baptism."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A17">Rm. 5:17</a>), "if by one man's offense 
death reigned through one," namely Adam, "much more they who receive 
abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life 
through one, Jesus Christ." Now children contract original sin from the 
sin of Adam; which is made clear by the fact that they are under the ban 
of death, which "passed upon all" on account of the sin of the first man, 
as the Apostle says in the same passage (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A12">Rm. 5:12</a>). Much more, therefore, 
can children receive grace through Christ, so as to reign in eternal 
life. But our Lord Himself said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++3%3A5">Jn. 3:5</a>): "Unless a man be born again of 
water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." 
Consequently it became necessary to baptize children, that, as in birth 
they incurred damnation through Adam so in a second birth they might 
obtain salvation through Christ. Moreover it was fitting that children 
should receive Baptism, in  order that being reared from childhood in 
things pertaining to the Christian mode of life, they may the more easily 
persevere therein; according to Prov. 22:5: "A young man according to his 
way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it." This reason is 
also given by Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. iii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The spiritual regeneration effected by Baptism is somewhat 
like carnal birth, in this respect, that as the child while in the 
mother's womb receives nourishment not independently, but through the 
nourishment of its mother, so also children before the use of reason, 
being as it were in the womb of their mother the Church, receive 
salvation not by their own act, but by the act of the Church. Hence 
Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i): "The Church, our mother, 
offers her maternal mouth for her children, that they may imbibe the 
sacred mysteries: for they cannot as yet with their own hearts believe 
unto justice, nor with their own mouths confess unto salvation . . . And 
if they are rightly said to believe, because in a certain fashion they 
make profession of faith by the words of their sponsors, why should they 
not also be said to repent, since by the words of those same sponsors 
they evidence their renunciation of the devil and this world?" For the 
same reason they can be said to intend, not by their own act of 
intention, since at times they struggle and cry; but by the act of those 
who bring them to be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says, writing to Boniface (Cont. duas Ep. 
Pelag. i), "in the Church of our Saviour little children believe through 
others, just as they contracted from others those sins which are remitted 
in Baptism." Nor is it a hindrance to their salvation if their parents be 
unbelievers, because, as Augustine says, writing to the same Boniface 
(Ep. xcviii), "little children are offered that they may receive grace in 
their souls, not so much from the hands of those that carry them (yet 
from these too, if they be good and faithful) as from the whole company 
of the saints and the faithful. For they are rightly considered to be 
offered by those who are pleased at their being offered, and by whose 
charity they are united in communion with the Holy Ghost." And the 
unbelief of their own parents, even if after Baptism these strive to 
infect them with the worship of demons, hurts not the children. For as 
Augustine says (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i) "when once the child has been 
begotten by the will of others, he cannot subsequently be held by the 
bonds of another's sin so long as he consent not with his will, according 
to" Ezech. 18:4: "'As the soul of the Father, so also the soul of the son 
is mine; the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.' Yet he contracted 
from Adam that which was loosed by the grace of this sacrament, because 
as yet he was not endowed with a separate existence." But the faith of 
one, indeed of the whole Church, profits the child through the operation 
of the Holy Ghost, Who unites the Church together, and communicates the 
goods of one member to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as a child, when he is being baptized, believes not by 
himself but by others, so is he examined not by himself but through 
others, and these in answer confess the  Church's faith in the child's 
stead, who is aggregated to this faith by the sacrament of faith. And the 
child acquires a good conscience in himself, not indeed as to the act, 
but as to the habit, by sanctifying grace.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that children of Jews or other unbelievers should be 
baptized against the will of their parents. For it is a matter of greater 
urgency to rescue a man from the danger of eternal death than from the 
danger of temporal death. But one ought to rescue a child that is 
threatened by the danger of temporal death, even if its parents through 
malice try to prevent its being rescued. Therefore much more reason is 
there for rescuing the children of unbelievers from the danger of eternal 
death, even against their parents' will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> The children of slaves are themselves slaves, and in the power of 
their masters. But Jews and all other unbelievers are the slaves of kings 
and rulers. Therefore without any injustice rulers can have the children 
of Jews baptized, as well as those of other slaves who are unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every man belongs more to God, from Whom he has his 
soul, than to his carnal father, from whom he has his body. Therefore it 
is not unjust if the children of unbelievers are taken away from their 
carnal parents, and consecrated to God by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xlv), quoting the 
council of Toledo: "In regard to the Jews the holy synod commands that 
henceforward none of them be forced to believe: for such are not to be 
saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness may be 
without flaw."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The children of unbelievers either have the use of reason 
or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control their 
own actions, in things that are of Divine or natural law. And therefore 
of their own accord, and against the will of their parents, they can 
receive Baptism, just as they can contract marriage. Consequently such 
can lawfully be advised and persuaded to be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, they have not yet the use of free-will, according to the 
natural law they are under the care of their parents as long as they 
cannot look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the 
children of the ancients "were saved through the faith of their parents." 
Wherefore it would be contrary to natural justice if such children were 
baptized against their parents' will; just as it would be if one having 
the use of reason were baptized against his will. Moreover under the 
circumstances it would be dangerous to baptize the children of 
unbelievers; for they would be liable to lapse into unbelief, by reason 
of their natural affection for their  parents. Therefore it is not the 
custom of the Church to baptize the children of unbelievers against their 
parents' will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not right to rescue a man from death of the body 
against the order of civil law: for instance, if a man be condemned to 
death by the judge who has tried him, none should use force in order to 
rescue him from death. Consequently, neither should anyone infringe the 
order of the natural law, in virtue of which a child is under the care of 
its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of eternal death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jews are slaves of rulers by civil slavery, which does not 
exclude the order of the natural and Divine law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is ordained unto God through his reason, by which he 
can know God. Wherefore a child, before it has the use of reason, is 
ordained to God, by a natural order, through the reason of its parents, 
under whose care it naturally lies, and it is according to their ordering 
that things pertaining to God are to be done in respect of the child.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a child can be baptized while yet in its mother's 
womb. For the gift of Christ is more efficacious unto salvation than 
Adam's sin unto condemnation, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A15">Rm. 5:15</a>). But a child 
while yet in its mother's womb is under sentence of condemnation on 
account of Adam's sin. For much more reason, therefore, can it be saved 
through the gift of Christ, which is bestowed by means of Baptism. 
Therefore a child can be baptized while yet in its mother's womb.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a child, while yet in its mother's womb, seems to be 
part of its mother. Now, when the mother is baptized, whatever is in her 
and part of her, is baptized. Therefore it seems that when the mother is 
baptized, the child in her womb is baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, eternal death is a greater evil than death of the body. 
But of two evils the less should be chosen. If, therefore, the child in 
the mother's womb cannot be baptized, it would be better for the mother 
to be opened, and the child to be taken out by force and baptized, than 
that the child should be eternally damned through dying without Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it happens at times that some part of the child comes 
forth first, as we read in Gn. 38:27: "In the very delivery of the 
infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, 
saying: This shall come forth the first. But he drawing back his hand, 
the other came forth." Now sometimes in such cases there is danger of 
death. Therefore it seems that that part should be baptized, while the 
child is yet in its mother's womb. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Ep. ad Dardan.): "No one can be born a 
second time unless he be born first." But Baptism is a spiritual 
regeneration. Therefore no one should be baptized before he is born from 
the womb.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is essential to Baptism that some part of the body of 
the person baptized be in some way washed with water, since Baptism is a 
kind of washing, as stated above (<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But an infant's body, 
before being born from the womb, can nowise be washed with water; unless 
perchance it be said that the baptismal water, with which the mother's 
body is washed, reaches the child while yet in its mother's womb. But 
this is impossible: both because the child's soul, to the sanctification 
of which Baptism is ordained, is distinct from the soul of the mother; 
and because the body of the animated infant is already formed, and 
consequently distinct from the body of the mother. Therefore the Baptism 
which the mother receives does not overflow on to the child which is in 
her womb. Hence Augustine says (Cont. Julian. vi): "If what is conceived 
within a mother belonged to her body, so as to be considered a part 
thereof, we should not baptize an infant whose mother, through danger of 
death, was baptized while she bore it in her womb. Since, then, it," i.e. 
the infant, "is baptized, it certainly did not belong to the mother's 
body while it was in the womb." It follows, therefore, that a child can 
nowise be baptized while in its mother's womb.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Children while in the mother's womb have not yet come forth 
into the world to live among other men. Consequently they cannot be 
subject to the action of man, so as to receive the sacrament, at the 
hands of man, unto salvation. They can, however, be subject to the action 
of God, in Whose sight they live, so as, by a kind of privilege, to 
receive the grace of sanctification; as was the case with those who were 
sanctified in the womb.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An internal member of the mother is something of hers by 
continuity and material union of the part with the whole: whereas a child 
while in its mother's womb is something of hers through being joined 
with, and yet distinct from her. Wherefore there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We should "not do evil that there may come good" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++3%3A8">Rm. 3:8</a>). 
Therefore it is wrong to kill a mother that her child may be baptized. 
If, however, the mother die while the child lives yet in her womb, she 
should be opened that the child may be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[11] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Unless death be imminent, we should wait until the child 
has entirely come forth from the womb before baptizing it. If, however, 
the head, wherein the senses are rooted, appear first, it should be 
baptized, in cases of danger: nor should it be baptized again, if perfect 
birth should ensue. And seemingly the same should be done in cases of 
danger no matter what part of the body appear first. But as none of the 
exterior parts of the body  belong to its integrity in the same degree as 
the head, some hold that since the matter is doubtful, whenever any other 
part of the body has been baptized, the child, when perfect birth has 
taken place, should be baptized with the form: "If thou art not baptized, 
I baptize thee," etc.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that madmen and imbeciles should not be baptized. For in 
order to receive Baptism, the person baptized must have the intention, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). But since madmen and imbeciles lack the use of 
reason, they can have but a disorderly intention. Therefore they should 
not be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man excels irrational animals in that he has reason. But 
madmen and imbeciles lack the use of reason, indeed in some cases we do 
not expect them ever to have it, as we do in the case of children. It 
seems, therefore, that just as irrational animals are not baptized, so 
neither should madmen and imbeciles in those cases be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the use of reason is suspended in madmen and imbeciles 
more than it is in one who sleeps. But it is not customary to baptize 
people while they sleep. Therefore it should not be given to madmen and 
imbeciles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. iv) of his friend that "he was 
baptized when his recovery was despaired of": and yet Baptism was 
efficacious with him. Therefore Baptism should sometimes be given to 
those who lack the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the matter of madmen and imbeciles a distinction is to 
be made. For some are so from birth, and have no lucid intervals, and 
show no signs of the use of reason. And with regard to these it seems 
that we should come to the same decision as with regard to children who 
are baptized in the Faith of the Church, as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are others who have fallen from a state of sanity into a state 
of insanity. And with regard to these we must be guided by their wishes 
as expressed by them when sane: so that, if then they manifested a desire 
to receive Baptism, it should be given to them when in a state of madness 
or imbecility, even though then they refuse. If, on the other hand, while 
sane they showed no desire to receive Baptism, they must not be baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, there are some who, though mad or imbecile from birth, have, 
nevertheless, lucid intervals, in which they can make right use of 
reason. Wherefore, if then they express a desire for Baptism, they can be 
baptized though they be actually in a state of madness. And in this case 
the sacrament should be bestowed on them if there be fear of danger 
otherwise it is better to wait until the time when they are sane, so that 
they may receive the sacrament  more devoutly. But if during the interval 
of lucidity they manifest no desire to receive Baptism, they should not 
be baptized while in a state of insanity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly there are others who, though not altogether sane, yet can use 
their reason so far as to think about their salvation, and understand the 
power of the sacrament. And these are to be treated the same as those who 
are sane, and who are baptized if they be willing, but not against their 
will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Imbeciles who never had, and have not now, the use of 
reason, are baptized, according to the Church's intention, just as 
according to the Church's ritual, they believe and repent; as we have 
stated above of children (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad OBJ). But those who have had the use 
of reason at some time, or have now, are baptized according to their own 
intention, which they have now, or had when they were sane.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Madmen and imbeciles lack the use of reason accidentally, 
i.e. through some impediment in a bodily organ; but not like irrational 
animals through want of a rational soul. Consequently the comparison does 
not hold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[68] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A person should not be baptized while asleep, except he be 
threatened with the danger of death. In which case he should be baptized, 
if previously he has manifested a desire to receive Baptism, as we have 
stated in reference to imbeciles: thus Augustine relates of his friend 
that "he was baptized while unconscious," because he was in danger of 
death (Confess. iv).<br>
