  <h3 align="left">Whether all are bound to receive Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not all are bound to receive
    Baptism. For Christ did not narrow man's road to salvation. But before
    Christ's coming men could be saved without Baptism: therefore also after
    Christ's coming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism seems to have been instituted
    principally as a remedy for original sin. Now, since a man who is baptized
    is without original sin, it seems that he cannot transmit it to his
    children. Therefore it seems that the children of those who have been
    baptized, should not themselves be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism is given in order that a man
    may, through grace, be cleansed from sin. But those who are sanctified in
    the womb, obtain this without Baptism. Therefore they are not bound to
    receive Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    into the kingdom of God." Again it is stated in De Eccl. Dogm. xli, that "we
    believe the way of salvation to be open to those only who are baptized."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Men are bound to that without which they cannot
    obtain salvation. Now it is manifest that no one can obtain salvation but
    through Christ; wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A18"
      >Rm. 5:18</a
    >): "As by the offense of one unto all men unto condemnation; so also by the
    justice of one, unto all men unto justification of life." But for this end
    is Baptism conferred on a man, that being regenerated thereby, he may be
    incorporated in Christ, by becoming His member: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A27"
      >Gal. 3:27</a
    >): "As many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ."
    Consequently it is manifest that all are bound to be baptized: and that
    without Baptism there is no salvation for men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> At no time, not even before the coming
    of Christ, could men be saved unless they became members of Christ: because,
    as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+4%3A12"
      >Acts 4:12</a
    >), "there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be
    saved." But before Christ's coming, men were incorporated in Christ by faith
    in His future coming: of which faith circumcision was the "seal," as the
    Apostle calls it (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A11"
      >Rm. 4:11</a
    >): whereas before circumcision was instituted, men were incorporated in
    Christ by "faith alone," as Gregory says (Moral. iv), together with the
    offering of sacrifices, by means of which the Fathers of old made profession
    of their faith. Again, since Christ's coming, men are incorporated in Christ
    by faith; according to Eph. 3:17: "That Christ may dwell by faith in your
    hearts." But faith in a thing already present is manifested by a sign
    different from that by which it was manifested when that thing was yet in
    the future: just as we use other parts of the verb, to signify the present,
    the past, and the future. Consequently although the sacrament itself of
    Baptism was not always necessary for salvation, yet faith, of which Baptism
    is the sacrament, was always necessary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As we have stated in the FS, Question
    [81], Article [3], ad 2, those who are baptized are renewed in spirit by
    Baptism, while their body remains subject to the oldness of sin, according
    to Rm. 8:10: "The body, indeed, is dead because of sin, but the spirit
    liveth because of justification." Wherefore Augustine (Contra Julian. vi)
    proves that "not everything that is in man is baptized." Now it is manifest
    that in carnal generation man does not beget in respect of his soul, but in
    respect of his body. Consequently the children of those who are baptized are
    born with original sin; wherefore they need to be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are sanctified in the womb,
    receive indeed grace which cleanses them from original sin, but they do not
    therefore receive the character, by which they are conformed to Christ.
    Consequently, if any were to be sanctified in the womb now, they would need
    to be baptized, in order to be conformed to Christ's other members by
    receiving the character.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether a man can be saved without Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that no man can be saved without
    Baptism. For our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    the kingdom of God." But those alone are saved who enter God's kingdom.
    Therefore none can be saved without Baptism, by which a man is born again of
    water and the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the book De Eccl. Dogm. xli, it is
    written: "We believe that no catechumen, though he die in his good works,
    will have eternal life, except he suffer martyrdom, which contains all the
    sacramental virtue of Baptism." But if it were possible for anyone to be
    saved without Baptism, this would be the case specially with catechumens who
    are credited with good works, for they seem to have the "faith that worketh
    by charity" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A6"
      >Gal. 5:6</a
    >). Therefore it seems that none can be saved without Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="TP068.html#TPQ68A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the sacrament of Baptism
    is necessary for salvation. Now that is necessary "without which something
    cannot be" (Metaph. v). Therefore it seems that none can obtain salvation
    without Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Super Levit. lxxxiv) that
    "some have received the invisible sanctification without visible sacraments,
    and to their profit; but though it is possible to have the visible
    sanctification, consisting in a visible sacrament, without the invisible
    sanctification, it will be to no profit." Since, therefore, the sacrament of
    Baptism pertains to the visible sanctification, it seems that a man can
    obtain salvation without the sacrament of Baptism, by means of the invisible
    sanctification.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sacrament or Baptism may be wanting to
    someone in two ways. First, both in reality and in desire; as is the case
    with those who neither are baptized, nor wished to be baptized: which
    clearly indicates contempt of the sacrament, in regard to those who have the
    use of the free-will. Consequently those to whom Baptism is wanting thus,
    cannot obtain salvation: since neither sacramentally nor mentally are they
    incorporated in Christ, through Whom alone can salvation be obtained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the sacrament of Baptism may be wanting to anyone in reality but
    not in desire: for instance, when a man wishes to be baptized, but by some
    ill-chance he is forestalled by death before receiving Baptism. And such a
    man can obtain salvation without being actually baptized, on account of his
    desire for Baptism, which desire is the outcome of "faith that worketh by
    charity," whereby God, Whose power is not tied to visible sacraments,
    sanctifies man inwardly. Hence Ambrose says of Valentinian, who died while
    yet a catechumen: "I lost him whom I was to regenerate: but he did not lose
    the grace he prayed for."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++16%3A7"
      >1 Kgs. 16:7</a
    >), "man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart."
    Now a man who desires to be "born again of water and the Holy Ghost" by
    Baptism, is regenerated in heart though not in body. thus the Apostle says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++2%3A29">Rm. 2:29</a>)
    that "the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the
    letter; whose praise is not of men but of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No man obtains eternal life unless he be
    free from all guilt and debt of punishment. Now this plenary absolution is
    given when a man receives Baptism, or suffers martyrdom: for which reason is
    it stated that martyrdom "contains all the sacramental virtue of Baptism,"
    i.e. as to the full deliverance from guilt and punishment. Suppose,
    therefore, a catechumen to have the desire for Baptism (else he could not be
    said to die in his good works, which cannot be without "faith that worketh
    by charity"), such a one, were he to die, would not forthwith come to
    eternal life, but would suffer punishment for his past sins, "but he himself
    shall be saved, yet so as by fire" as is stated 1 Cor. 3:15.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is said to be
    necessary for salvation in so far as man cannot be saved without, at least,
    Baptism of desire; "which, with God, counts for the deed" (Augustine, Enarr.
    in Ps. 57).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Baptism should be deferred?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism should be deferred. For
    Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): "Two seasons," i.e. Easter and Whitsuntide, "are
    fixed by the Roman Pontiff for the celebration of Baptism. Wherefore we
    admonish your Beatitude not to add any other days to this custom." Therefore
    it seems that Baptism should be conferred not at once, but delayed until the
    aforesaid seasons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we read in the decrees of the Council of
    Agde (Can. xxxiv): "If Jews whose bad faith often "returns to the vomit,"
    wish to submit to the Law of the Catholic Church, let them for eight months
    enter the porch of the church with the catechumens; and if they are found to
    come in good faith then at last they may deserve the grace of Baptism."
    Therefore men should not be baptized at once, and Baptism should be deferred
    for a certain fixed time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as we read in Is. 27:9, "this is all the
    fruit, that the sin... should be taken away." Now sin seems to be taken
    away, or at any rate lessened, if Baptism be deferred. First, because those
    who sin after Baptism, sin more grievously, according to Heb. 10:29: "How
    much more, do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath...
    esteemed the blood of the testament," i.e. Baptism, "unclean, by which he
    was sanctified?" Secondly, because Baptism takes away past, but not future,
    sins: wherefore the more it is deferred, the more sins it takes away.
    Therefore it seems that Baptism should be deferred for a long time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 5:8): "Delay not to be
    converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day." But the perfect
    conversion to God is of those who are regenerated in Christ by Baptism.
    Therefore Baptism should not be deferred from day to day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In this matter we must make a distinction and
    see whether those who are to be baptized are children or adults. For if they
    be children, Baptism should not be deferred. First, because in them we do
    not look for better instruction or fuller conversion. Secondly, because of
    the danger of death, for no other remedy is available for them besides the
    sacrament of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, adults have a remedy in the mere desire for Baptism, as
    stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And
    therefore Baptism should not be conferred on adults as soon as they are
    converted, but it should be deferred until some fixed time. First, as a
    safeguard to the Church, lest she be deceived through baptizing those who
    come to her under false pretenses, according to 1 Jn. 4:1: "Believe not
    every spirit, but try the spirits, if they be of God." And those who
    approach Baptism are put to this test, when their faith and morals are
    subjected to proof for a space of time. Secondly, this is needful as being
    useful for those who are baptized; for they require a certain space of time
    in order to be fully instructed in the faith, and to be drilled in those
    things that pertain to the Christian mode of life. Thirdly, a certain
    reverence for the sacrament demands a delay whereby men are admitted to
    Baptism at the principal festivities, viz. of Easter and Pentecost, the
    result being that they receive the sacrament with greater devotion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There are, however, two reasons for forgoing this delay. First, when those
    who are to be baptized appear to be perfectly instructed in the faith and
    ready for Baptism; thus, Philip baptized the Eunuch at once (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+8"
      >Acts 8</a
    >); and Peter, Cornelius and those who were with him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10"
      >Acts 10</a
    >). Secondly, by reason of sickness or some kind of danger of death.
    Wherefore Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): "Those who are threatened by death,
    sickness, siege, persecution, or shipwreck, should be baptized at any time."
    Yet if a man is forestalled by death, so as to have no time to receive the
    sacrament, while he awaits the season appointed by the Church, he is saved,
    yet "so as by fire," as stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 2). Nevertheless he sins if he defer being baptized beyond the time
    appointed by the Church, except this be for an unavoidable cause and with
    the permission of the authorities of the Church. But even this sin, with his
    other sins, can be washed away by his subsequent contrition, which takes the
    place of Baptism, as stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This decree of Pope Leo, concerning the
    celebration of Baptism at two seasons, is to be understood "with the
    exception of the danger of death" (which is always to be feared in children)
    as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This decree concerning the Jews was for
    a safeguard to the Church, lest they corrupt the faith of simple people, if
    they be not fully converted. Nevertheless, as the same passage reads further
    on, "if within the appointed time they are threatened with danger of
    sickness, they should be baptized."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism, by the grace which it bestows,
    removes not only past sins, but hinders the commission of future sins. Now
    this is the point to be considered---that men may not sin: it is a secondary
    consideration that their sins be less grievous, or that their sins be washed
    away, according to 1 Jn. 2:1,2: "My little children, these things I write to
    you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the
    Father, Jesus Christ the just; and He is the propitiation for our sins."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether sinners should be baptized?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sinners should be baptized. For it
    is written (Zach. 13:1): "In that day there shall be a fountain open to the
    House of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the
    sinner and of the unclean woman": and this is to be understood of the
    fountain of Baptism. Therefore it seems that the sacrament of Baptism should
    be offered even to sinners.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++9%3A12"
      >Mt. 9:12</a
    >): "They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill."
    But they that are ill are sinners. Therefore since Baptism is the remedy of
    Christ the physician of our souls, it seems that this sacrament should be
    offered to sinners.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no assistance should be withdrawn from
    sinners. But sinners who have been baptized derive spiritual assistance from
    the very character of Baptism, since it is a disposition to grace. Therefore
    it seems that the sacrament of Baptism should be offered to sinners.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Serm. clxix): "He Who created
    thee without thee, will not justify thee without thee." But since a sinner's
    will is ill-disposed, he does not co-operate with God. Therefore it is
    useless to employ Baptism as a means of justification.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A man may be said to be a sinner in two ways.
    First, on account of the stain and the debt of punishment incurred in the
    past: and on sinners in this sense the sacrament of Baptism should be
    conferred, since it is instituted specially for this purpose, that by it the
    uncleanness of sin may be washed away, according to Eph. 5:26: "Cleansing it
    by the laver of water in the word of life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, a man may be called a sinner because he wills to sin and purposes
    to remain in sin: and on sinners in this sense the sacrament of Baptism
    should not be conferred. First, indeed, because by Baptism men are
    incorporated in Christ, according to Gal. 3:27: "As many of you as have been
    baptized in Christ, have put on Christ." Now so long as a man wills to sin,
    he cannot be united to Christ, according to 2 Cor. 6:14: "What participation
    hath justice with injustice?" Wherefore Augustine says in his book on
    Penance (Serm. cccli) that "no man who has the use of free-will can begin
    the new life, except he repent of his former life." Secondly, because there
    should be nothing useless in the works of Christ and of the Church. Now that
    is useless which does not reach the end to which it is ordained; and, on the
    other hand, no one having the will to sin can, at the same time, be cleansed
    from sin, which is the purpose of Baptism; for this would be to combine two
    contradictory things. Thirdly, because there should be no falsehood in the
    sacramental signs. Now a sign is false if it does not correspond with the
    thing signified. But the very fact that a man presents himself to be
    cleansed by Baptism, signifies that he prepares himself for the inward
    cleansing: while this cannot be the case with one who purposes to remain in
    sin. Therefore it is manifest that on such a man the sacrament of Baptism is
    not to be conferred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted are to be understood of
    those sinners whose will is set on renouncing sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The physician of souls, i.e. Christ,
    works in two ways. First, inwardly, by Himself: and thus He prepares man's
    will so that it wills good and hates evil. Secondly, He works through
    ministers, by the outward application of the sacraments: and in this way His
    work consists in perfecting what was begun outwardly. Therefore the
    sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred save on those in whom there
    appears some sign of their interior conversion: just as neither is bodily
    medicine given to a sick man, unless he show some sign of life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism is the sacrament of faith. Now
    dead faith does not suffice for salvation; nor is it the foundation, but
    living faith alone, "that worketh by charity" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A6"
      >Gal. 5:6</a
    >), as Augustine says (De Fide et oper.). Neither, therefore, can the
    sacrament of Baptism give salvation to a man whose will is set on sinning,
    and hence expels the form of faith. Moreover, the impression of the
    baptismal character cannot dispose a man for grace as long as he retains the
    will to sin; for "God compels no man to be virtuous," as Damascene says (De
    Fide Orth. ii).<br />

    Whether works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners that have been
    baptized?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that works of satisfaction should be
    enjoined on sinners that have been baptized. For God's justice seems to
    demand that a man should be punished for every sin of his, according to
    Eccles. 12:14: "All things that are done, God will bring into judgment." But
    works of satisfaction are enjoined on sinners in punishment of past sins.
    Therefore it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on sinners
    that have been baptized.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by means of works of satisfaction
    sinners recently converted are drilled into righteousness, and are made to
    avoid the occasions of sin: "for satisfaction consists in extirpating the
    causes of vice, and closing the doors to sin" (De Eccl. Dogm. iv). But this
    is most necessary in the case of those who have been baptized recently.
    Therefore it seems that works of satisfaction should be enjoined on
    sinners.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man owes satisfaction to God not less
    than to his neighbor. But if those who were recently baptized have injured
    their neighbor, they should be told to make reparation to God by works of
    penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose commenting on Rm. 11:29: "The gifts
    and the calling of God are without repentance," says: "The grace of God
    requires neither sighs nor groans in Baptism, nor indeed any work at all,
    but faith alone; and remits all, gratis."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A3,4"
      >Rm. 6:3,4</a
    >), "all we who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death: for
    we are buried together with Him, by Baptism unto death"; which is to say
    that by Baptism man is incorporated in the very death of Christ. Now it is
    manifest from what has been said above (<a href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1"
      >Question [48]</a
    >, <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4;
    <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
    <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that Christ's death
    satisfied sufficiently for sins, "not for ours only, but also for those of
    the whole world," according to 1 Jn. 2:2. Consequently no kind of
    satisfaction should be enjoined on one who is being baptized, for any sins
    whatever: and this would be to dishonor the Passion and death of Christ, as
    being insufficient for the plenary satisfaction for the sins of those who
    were to be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says in his book on Infant
    Baptism (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i), "the effect of Baptism is to make
    those, who are baptized, to be incorporated in Christ as His members."
    Wherefore the very pains of Christ were satisfactory for the sins of those
    who were to be baptized; just as the pain of one member can be satisfactory
    for the sin of another member. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A4"
      >Is. 53:4</a
    >): "Surely He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who have been lately baptized
    should be drilled into righteousness, not by penal, but by "easy works, so
    as to advance to perfection by taking exercise, as infants by taking milk,"
    as a gloss says on Ps. 130:2: "As a child that is weaned is towards his
    mother." For this reason did our Lord excuse His disciples from fasting when
    they were recently converted, as we read in Mt. 9:14,15: and the same is
    written 1 Pt. 2:2: "As new-born babes desire... milk... that thereby you may
    grow unto salvation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To restore what has been ill taken from
    one's neighbor, and to make satisfaction for wrong done to him, is to cease
    from sin: for the very fact of retaining what belongs to another and of not
    being reconciled to one's neighbor, is a sin. Wherefore those who are
    baptized should be enjoined to make satisfaction to their neighbor, as also
    to desist from sin. But they are not to be enjoined to suffer any punishment
    for past sins.<br />

    Whether sinners who are going to be baptized are bound to confess their
    sins?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sinners who are going to be
    baptized are bound to confess their sins. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A6"
      >Mt. 3:6</a
    >) that many "were baptized" by John "in the Jordan confessing their sins."
    But Christ's Baptism is more perfect than John's. Therefore it seems that
    there is yet greater reason why they who are about to receive Christ's
    Baptism should confess their sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++28%3A13"
      >Prov. 28:13</a
    >): "He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper; but he that shall confess
    and forsake them, shall obtain mercy." Now for this is a man baptized, that
    he may obtain mercy for his sins. Therefore those who are going to be
    baptized should confess their sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Penance is required before Baptism,
    according to Acts 2:38: "Do penance and be baptized every one of you." But
    confession is a part of Penance. Therefore it seems that confession of sins
    should take place before Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Confession of sins should be sorrowful: thus
    Augustine says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. xiv): "All these circumstances
    should be taken into account and deplored." Now, as Ambrose says on Rm.
    11:29, "the grace of God requires neither sighs nor groans in Baptism."
    Therefore confession of sins should not be required of those who are going
    to be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Confession of sins is twofold. One is made
    inwardly to God: and such confession of sins is required before Baptism: in
    other words, man should call his sins to mind and sorrow for them; since "he
    cannot begin the new life, except he repent of his former life," as
    Augustine says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli). The other is the
    outward confession of sins, which is made to a priest; and such confession
    is not required before Baptism. First, because this confession, since it is
    directed to the person of the minister, belongs to the sacrament of Penance,
    which is not required before Baptism, which is the door of all the
    sacraments. Secondly, because the reason why a man makes outward confession
    to a priest, is that the priest may absolve him from his sins, and bind him
    to works of satisfaction, which should not be enjoined on the baptized, as
    stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Moreover
    those who are being baptized do not need to be released from their sins by
    the keys of the Church, since all are forgiven them in Baptism. Thirdly,
    because the very act of confession made to a man is penal, by reason of the
    shame it inflicts on the one confessing: whereas no exterior punishment is
    enjoined on a man who is being baptized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore no special confession of sins is required of those who are being
    baptized; but that general confession suffices which they make when in
    accordance with the Church's ritual they "renounce Satan and all his works."
    And in this sense a gloss explains Mt. 3:6, saying that in John's Baptism
    "those who are going to be baptized learn that they should confess their
    sins and promise to amend their life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, any persons about to be baptized, wish, out of devotion, to
    confess their sins, their confession should be heard; not for the purpose of
    enjoining them to do satisfaction, but in order to instruct them in the
    spiritual life as a remedy against their vicious habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sins were not forgiven in John's
    Baptism, which, however, was the Baptism of Penance. Consequently it was
    fitting that those who went to receive that Baptism, should confess their
    sins, so that they should receive a penance in proportion to their sins. But
    Christ's Baptism is without outward penance, as Ambrose says (on Rm. 11:29);
    and therefore there is no comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is enough that the baptized make
    inward confession to God, and also an outward general confession, for them
    to "prosper and obtain mercy": and they need no special outward confession,
    as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Confession is a part of sacramental
    Penance, which is not required before Baptism, as stated above: but the
    inward virtue of Penance is required.<br />

    Whether the intention of receiving the sacrament of Baptism is required on
    the part of the one baptized?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the intention of receiving the
    sacrament of Baptism is not required on the part of the one baptized. For
    the one baptized is, as it were, "patient" in the sacrament. But an
    intention is required not on the part of the patient but on the part of the
    agent. Therefore it seems that the intention of receiving Baptism is not
    required on the part of the one baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if what is necessary for Baptism be
    omitted, the Baptism must be repeated; for instance, if the invocation of
    the Trinity be omitted, as stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 3). But it does not
    seem that a man should be rebaptized through not having had the intention of
    receiving Baptism: else, since his intention cannot be proved, anyone might
    ask to be baptized again on account of his lack of intention. Therefore it
    seems that no intention is required on the part of the one baptized, in
    order that he receive the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism is given as a remedy for
    original sin. But original sin is contracted without the intention of the
    person born. Therefore, seemingly, Baptism requires no intention on the part
    of the person baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the Church's ritual, those who
    are to be baptized ask of the Church that they may receive Baptism: and thus
    they express their intention of receiving the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By Baptism a man dies to the old life of sin,
    and begins a certain newness of life, according to Rm. 6:4: "We are buried
    together with" Christ "by Baptism into death; that, as Christ is risen from
    the dead... so we also may walk in newness of life." Consequently, just as,
    according to Augustine (Serm. cccli), he who has the use of free-will, must,
    in order to die to the old life, "will to repent of his former life"; so
    must he, of his own will, intend to lead a new life, the beginning of which
    is precisely the receiving of the sacrament. Therefore on the part of the
    one baptized, it is necessary for him to have the will or intention of
    receiving the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a man is justified by Baptism, his
    passiveness is not violent but voluntary: wherefore it is necessary for him
    to intend to receive that which is given him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If an adult lack the intention of
    receiving the sacrament, he must be rebaptized. But if there be doubt about
    this, the form to be used should be: "If thou art not baptized, I baptize
    thee."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism is a remedy not only against
    original, but also against actual sins, which are caused by our will and
    intention.<br />

    Whether faith is required on the part of the one baptized?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that faith is required on the part of
    the one baptized. For the sacrament of Baptism was instituted by Christ. But
    Christ, in giving the form of Baptism, makes faith to precede Baptism (Mk.
    16:16): "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved." Therefore it
    seems that without faith there can be no sacrament of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing useless is done in the
    sacraments of the Church. But according to the Church's ritual, the man who
    comes to be baptized is asked concerning his faith: "Dost thou believe in
    God the Father Almighty?" Therefore it seems that faith is required for
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intention of receiving the sacrament
    is required for Baptism. But this cannot be without right faith, since
    Baptism is the sacrament of right faith: for thereby men "are incorporated
    in Christ," as Augustine says in his book on Infant Baptism (De Pecc. Merit.
    et Remiss. i); and this cannot be without right faith, according to Eph.
    3:17: "That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts." Therefore it seems
    that a man who has not right faith cannot receive the sacrament of
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, unbelief is a most grievous sin, as we
    have shown in the SS, Question [10], Article [3]. But those who remain in
    sin should not be baptized: therefore neither should those who remain in
    unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory writing to the bishop Quiricus says:
    "We have learned from the ancient tradition of the Fathers that when
    heretics, baptized in the name of the Trinity, come back to Holy Church,
    they are to be welcomed to her bosom, either with the anointing of chrism,
    or the imposition of hands, or the mere profession of faith." But such would
    not be the case if faith were necessary for a man to receive Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what has been said above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1"
      >Question [63]</a
    >, <a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>;
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>,
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>) Baptism produces a
    twofold effect in the soul, viz. the character and grace. Therefore in two
    ways may a thing be necessary for Baptism. First, as something without which
    grace, which is the ultimate effect of the sacrament, cannot be had. And
    thus right faith is necessary for Baptism, because, as it appears from Rm.
    3:22, the justice of God is by faith of Jesus Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, something is required of necessity for Baptism, because without it
    the baptismal character cannot be imprinted And thus right faith is not
    necessary in the one baptized any more than in the one who baptizes:
    provided the other conditions are fulfilled which are essential to the
    sacrament. For the sacrament is not perfected by the righteousness of the
    minister or of the recipient of Baptism, but by the power of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord is speaking there of Baptism as
    bringing us to salvation by giving us sanctifying grace: which of course
    cannot be without right faith: wherefore He says pointedly: "He that
    believeth and is baptized, shall be saved."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Church's intention in Baptizing men
    is that they may be cleansed from sin, according to Is. 27:9: "This is all
    the fruit, that the sin... should be taken away." And therefore, as far as
    she is concerned, she does not intend to give Baptism save to those who have
    right faith, without which there is no remission of sins. And for this
    reason she asks those who come to be baptized whether they believe. If, on
    the contrary, anyone, without right faith, receive Baptism outside the
    Church, he does not receive it unto salvation. Hence Augustine says (De
    Baptism. contr. Donat. iv): "From the Church being compared to Paradise we
    learn that men can receive her Baptism even outside her fold, but that
    elsewhere none can receive or keep the salvation of the blessed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even he who has not right faith on other
    points, can have right faith about the sacrament of Baptism: and so he is
    not hindered from having the intention of receiving that sacrament. Yet even
    if he think not aright concerning this sacrament, it is enough, for the
    receiving of the sacrament, that he should have a general intention of
    receiving Baptism, according as Christ instituted, and as the Church bestows
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Just as the sacrament of Baptism is not
    to be conferred on a man who is unwilling to give up his other sins, so
    neither should it be given to one who is unwilling to renounce his unbelief.
    Yet each receives the sacrament if it be conferred on him, though not unto
    salvation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether children should be baptized?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that children should not be baptized.
    For the intention to receive the sacrament is required in one who is being
    baptized, as stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A7THEP1">Article [7]</a
    >). But children cannot have such an intention, since they have not the use
    of free-will. Therefore it seems that they cannot receive the sacrament of
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism is the sacrament of faith, as
    stated above (<a href="TP039.html#TPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>,
    <a href="TP039.html#TPQ39A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>;
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>,
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). But children have
    not faith, which demands an act of the will on the part of the believer, as
    Augustine says (Super Joan. xxvi). Nor can it be said that their salvation
    is implied in the faith of their parents; since the latter are sometimes
    unbelievers, and their unbelief would conduce rather to the damnation of
    their children. Therefore it seems that children cannot be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++3%3A21"
      >1 Pt. 3:21</a
    >) that "Baptism saveth" men; "not the putting away of the filth of the
    flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God." But children
    have no conscience, either good or bad, since they have not the use of
    reason: nor can they be fittingly examined, since they understand not.
    Therefore children should not be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii): "Our
    heavenly guides," i.e. the Apostles, "approved of infants being admitted to
    Baptism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A17"
      >Rm. 5:17</a
    >), "if by one man's offense death reigned through one," namely Adam, "much
    more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice,
    shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ." Now children contract
    original sin from the sin of Adam; which is made clear by the fact that they
    are under the ban of death, which "passed upon all" on account of the sin of
    the first man, as the Apostle says in the same passage (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A12"
      >Rm. 5:12</a
    >). Much more, therefore, can children receive grace through Christ, so as
    to reign in eternal life. But our Lord Himself said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    into the kingdom of God." Consequently it became necessary to baptize
    children, that, as in birth they incurred damnation through Adam so in a
    second birth they might obtain salvation through Christ. Moreover it was
    fitting that children should receive Baptism, in order that being reared
    from childhood in things pertaining to the Christian mode of life, they may
    the more easily persevere therein; according to Prov. 22:5: "A young man
    according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it." This
    reason is also given by Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. iii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The spiritual regeneration effected by
    Baptism is somewhat like carnal birth, in this respect, that as the child
    while in the mother's womb receives nourishment not independently, but
    through the nourishment of its mother, so also children before the use of
    reason, being as it were in the womb of their mother the Church, receive
    salvation not by their own act, but by the act of the Church. Hence
    Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i): "The Church, our mother,
    offers her maternal mouth for her children, that they may imbibe the sacred
    mysteries: for they cannot as yet with their own hearts believe unto
    justice, nor with their own mouths confess unto salvation... And if they are
    rightly said to believe, because in a certain fashion they make profession
    of faith by the words of their sponsors, why should they not also be said to
    repent, since by the words of those same sponsors they evidence their
    renunciation of the devil and this world?" For the same reason they can be
    said to intend, not by their own act of intention, since at times they
    struggle and cry; but by the act of those who bring them to be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says, writing to Boniface
    (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i), "in the Church of our Saviour little children
    believe through others, just as they contracted from others those sins which
    are remitted in Baptism." Nor is it a hindrance to their salvation if their
    parents be unbelievers, because, as Augustine says, writing to the same
    Boniface (Ep. xcviii), "little children are offered that they may receive
    grace in their souls, not so much from the hands of those that carry them
    (yet from these too, if they be good and faithful) as from the whole company
    of the saints and the faithful. For they are rightly considered to be
    offered by those who are pleased at their being offered, and by whose
    charity they are united in communion with the Holy Ghost." And the unbelief
    of their own parents, even if after Baptism these strive to infect them with
    the worship of demons, hurts not the children. For as Augustine says (Cont.
    duas Ep. Pelag. i) "when once the child has been begotten by the will of
    others, he cannot subsequently be held by the bonds of another's sin so long
    as he consent not with his will, according to" Ezech. 18:4: "'As the soul of
    the Father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, the
    same shall die.' Yet he contracted from Adam that which was loosed by the
    grace of this sacrament, because as yet he was not endowed with a separate
    existence." But the faith of one, indeed of the whole Church, profits the
    child through the operation of the Holy Ghost, Who unites the Church
    together, and communicates the goods of one member to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as a child, when he is being
    baptized, believes not by himself but by others, so is he examined not by
    himself but through others, and these in answer confess the Church's faith
    in the child's stead, who is aggregated to this faith by the sacrament of
    faith. And the child acquires a good conscience in himself, not indeed as to
    the act, but as to the habit, by sanctifying grace.<br />

    Whether children of Jews or other unbelievers be baptized against the will
    of their parents?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that children of Jews or other
    unbelievers should be baptized against the will of their parents. For it is
    a matter of greater urgency to rescue a man from the danger of eternal death
    than from the danger of temporal death. But one ought to rescue a child that
    is threatened by the danger of temporal death, even if its parents through
    malice try to prevent its being rescued. Therefore much more reason is there
    for rescuing the children of unbelievers from the danger of eternal death,
    even against their parents' will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> The children of slaves are themselves slaves, and
    in the power of their masters. But Jews and all other unbelievers are the
    slaves of kings and rulers. Therefore without any injustice rulers can have
    the children of Jews baptized, as well as those of other slaves who are
    unbelievers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every man belongs more to God, from Whom
    he has his soul, than to his carnal father, from whom he has his body.
    Therefore it is not unjust if the children of unbelievers are taken away
    from their carnal parents, and consecrated to God by Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xlv),
    quoting the council of Toledo: "In regard to the Jews the holy synod
    commands that henceforward none of them be forced to believe: for such are
    not to be saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness
    may be without flaw."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The children of unbelievers either have the use
    of reason or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control
    their own actions, in things that are of Divine or natural law. And
    therefore of their own accord, and against the will of their parents, they
    can receive Baptism, just as they can contract marriage. Consequently such
    can lawfully be advised and persuaded to be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, they have not yet the use of free-will, according to the
    natural law they are under the care of their parents as long as they cannot
    look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the children of the
    ancients "were saved through the faith of their parents." Wherefore it would
    be contrary to natural justice if such children were baptized against their
    parents' will; just as it would be if one having the use of reason were
    baptized against his will. Moreover under the circumstances it would be
    dangerous to baptize the children of unbelievers; for they would be liable
    to lapse into unbelief, by reason of their natural affection for their
    parents. Therefore it is not the custom of the Church to baptize the
    children of unbelievers against their parents' will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not right to rescue a man from
    death of the body against the order of civil law: for instance, if a man be
    condemned to death by the judge who has tried him, none should use force in
    order to rescue him from death. Consequently, neither should anyone infringe
    the order of the natural law, in virtue of which a child is under the care
    of its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of eternal death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jews are slaves of rulers by civil
    slavery, which does not exclude the order of the natural and Divine law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is ordained unto God through his
    reason, by which he can know God. Wherefore a child, before it has the use
    of reason, is ordained to God, by a natural order, through the reason of its
    parents, under whose care it naturally lies, and it is according to their
    ordering that things pertaining to God are to be done in respect of the
    child.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether a child can be baptized while yet in its mother's womb?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a child can be baptized while yet
    in its mother's womb. For the gift of Christ is more efficacious unto
    salvation than Adam's sin unto condemnation, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A15"
      >Rm. 5:15</a
    >). But a child while yet in its mother's womb is under sentence of
    condemnation on account of Adam's sin. For much more reason, therefore, can
    it be saved through the gift of Christ, which is bestowed by means of
    Baptism. Therefore a child can be baptized while yet in its mother's
    womb.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a child, while yet in its mother's womb,
    seems to be part of its mother. Now, when the mother is baptized, whatever
    is in her and part of her, is baptized. Therefore it seems that when the
    mother is baptized, the child in her womb is baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, eternal death is a greater evil than
    death of the body. But of two evils the less should be chosen. If,
    therefore, the child in the mother's womb cannot be baptized, it would be
    better for the mother to be opened, and the child to be taken out by force
    and baptized, than that the child should be eternally damned through dying
    without Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it happens at times that some part of
    the child comes forth first, as we read in Gn. 38:27: "In the very delivery
    of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet
    thread, saying: This shall come forth the first. But he drawing back his
    hand, the other came forth." Now sometimes in such cases there is danger of
    death. Therefore it seems that that part should be baptized, while the child
    is yet in its mother's womb.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Ep. ad Dardan.): "No one can
    be born a second time unless he be born first." But Baptism is a spiritual
    regeneration. Therefore no one should be baptized before he is born from the
    womb.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is essential to Baptism that some part of
    the body of the person baptized be in some way washed with water, since
    Baptism is a kind of washing, as stated above (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But an infant's body,
    before being born from the womb, can nowise be washed with water; unless
    perchance it be said that the baptismal water, with which the mother's body
    is washed, reaches the child while yet in its mother's womb. But this is
    impossible: both because the child's soul, to the sanctification of which
    Baptism is ordained, is distinct from the soul of the mother; and because
    the body of the animated infant is already formed, and consequently distinct
    from the body of the mother. Therefore the Baptism which the mother receives
    does not overflow on to the child which is in her womb. Hence Augustine says
    (Cont. Julian. vi): "If what is conceived within a mother belonged to her
    body, so as to be considered a part thereof, we should not baptize an infant
    whose mother, through danger of death, was baptized while she bore it in her
    womb. Since, then, it," i.e. the infant, "is baptized, it certainly did not
    belong to the mother's body while it was in the womb." It follows,
    therefore, that a child can nowise be baptized while in its mother's
    womb.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Children while in the mother's womb have
    not yet come forth into the world to live among other men. Consequently they
    cannot be subject to the action of man, so as to receive the sacrament, at
    the hands of man, unto salvation. They can, however, be subject to the
    action of God, in Whose sight they live, so as, by a kind of privilege, to
    receive the grace of sanctification; as was the case with those who were
    sanctified in the womb.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An internal member of the mother is
    something of hers by continuity and material union of the part with the
    whole: whereas a child while in its mother's womb is something of hers
    through being joined with, and yet distinct from her. Wherefore there is no
    comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We should "not do evil that there may
    come good" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A8"
      >Rm. 3:8</a
    >). Therefore it is wrong to kill a mother that her child may be baptized.
    If, however, the mother die while the child lives yet in her womb, she
    should be opened that the child may be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Unless death be imminent, we should wait
    until the child has entirely come forth from the womb before baptizing it.
    If, however, the head, wherein the senses are rooted, appear first, it
    should be baptized, in cases of danger: nor should it be baptized again, if
    perfect birth should ensue. And seemingly the same should be done in cases
    of danger no matter what part of the body appear first. But as none of the
    exterior parts of the body belong to its integrity in the same degree as the
    head, some hold that since the matter is doubtful, whenever any other part
    of the body has been baptized, the child, when perfect birth has taken
    place, should be baptized with the form: "If thou art not baptized, I
    baptize thee," etc.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether madmen and imbeciles should be baptized?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that madmen and imbeciles should not be
    baptized. For in order to receive Baptism, the person baptized must have the
    intention, as stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A7THEP1">Article [7]</a
    >). But since madmen and imbeciles lack the use of reason, they can have but
    a disorderly intention. Therefore they should not be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man excels irrational animals in that he
    has reason. But madmen and imbeciles lack the use of reason, indeed in some
    cases we do not expect them ever to have it, as we do in the case of
    children. It seems, therefore, that just as irrational animals are not
    baptized, so neither should madmen and imbeciles in those cases be
    baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the use of reason is suspended in madmen
    and imbeciles more than it is in one who sleeps. But it is not customary to
    baptize people while they sleep. Therefore it should not be given to madmen
    and imbeciles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. iv) of his friend
    that "he was baptized when his recovery was despaired of": and yet Baptism
    was efficacious with him. Therefore Baptism should sometimes be given to
    those who lack the use of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the matter of madmen and imbeciles a
    distinction is to be made. For some are so from birth, and have no lucid
    intervals, and show no signs of the use of reason. And with regard to these
    it seems that we should come to the same decision as with regard to children
    who are baptized in the Faith of the Church, as stated above (<a
      href="TP068.html#TPQ68A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >, ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But there are others who have fallen from a state of sanity into a state of
    insanity. And with regard to these we must be guided by their wishes as
    expressed by them when sane: so that, if then they manifested a desire to
    receive Baptism, it should be given to them when in a state of madness or
    imbecility, even though then they refuse. If, on the other hand, while sane
    they showed no desire to receive Baptism, they must not be baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, there are some who, though mad or imbecile from birth, have,
    nevertheless, lucid intervals, in which they can make right use of reason.
    Wherefore, if then they express a desire for Baptism, they can be baptized
    though they be actually in a state of madness. And in this case the
    sacrament should be bestowed on them if there be fear of danger otherwise it
    is better to wait until the time when they are sane, so that they may
    receive the sacrament more devoutly. But if during the interval of lucidity
    they manifest no desire to receive Baptism, they should not be baptized
    while in a state of insanity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly there are others who, though not altogether sane, yet can use their
    reason so far as to think about their salvation, and understand the power of
    the sacrament. And these are to be treated the same as those who are sane,
    and who are baptized if they be willing, but not against their will.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Imbeciles who never had, and have not
    now, the use of reason, are baptized, according to the Church's intention,
    just as according to the Church's ritual, they believe and repent; as we
    have stated above of children (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >, ad OBJ). But those who have had the use of reason at some time, or have
    now, are baptized according to their own intention, which they have now, or
    had when they were sane.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Madmen and imbeciles lack the use of
    reason accidentally, i.e. through some impediment in a bodily organ; but not
    like irrational animals through want of a rational soul. Consequently the
    comparison does not hold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A person should not be baptized while
    asleep, except he be threatened with the danger of death. In which case he
    should be baptized, if previously he has manifested a desire to receive
    Baptism, as we have stated in reference to imbeciles: thus Augustine relates
    of his friend that "he was baptized while unconscious," because he was in
    danger of death (Confess. iv).<br />
