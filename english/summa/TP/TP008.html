    OF THE GRACE OF CHRIST, AS HE IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the grace of Christ as the Head of the Church; and
    under this head there are eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ is the Head of the
    Church?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He is the Head of men as
    regards their bodies or only as regards their souls?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He is the Head of all men?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He is the Head of the
    angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the grace of Christ as Head
    of the Church is the same as His habitual grace as an individual man?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether to be Head of the Church is
    proper to Christ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the devil is the head of
    all the wicked?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether Anti-christ can be called
    the head of all the wicked?

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ is the Head of the Church?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it does not belong to Christ
    as man to be Head of the Church. For the head imparts sense and motion to
    the members. Now spiritual sense and motion which are by grace, are not
    imparted to us by the Man Christ, because, as Augustine says (De Trin. i,
    12; xv, 24), "not even Christ, as man, but only as God, bestows the Holy
    Ghost." Therefore it does not belong to Him as man to be Head of the
    Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not fitting for the head to have a
    head. But God is the Head of Christ, as man, according to 1 Cor. 11:3, "The
    Head of Christ is God." Therefore Christ Himself is not a head.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Furthermore, the head of a man is a particular
    member, receiving an influx from the heart. But Christ is the universal
    principle of the whole Church. Therefore He is not the Head of the
    Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A22"
      >Eph. 1:22</a
    >): "And He... hath made Him head over all the Church."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the whole Church is termed one mystic body
    from its likeness to the natural body of a man, which in divers members has
    divers acts, as the Apostle teaches (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12;+1+Cor++12"
      >Rm. 12; 1 Cor. 12</a
    >), so likewise Christ is called the Head of the Church from a likeness with
    the human head, in which we may consider three things, viz. order,
    perfection, and power: "Order," indeed; for the head is the first part of
    man, beginning from the higher part; and hence it is that every principle is
    usually called a head according to Ezech. 16:25: "At every head of the way,
    thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution"---"Perfection," inasmuch as in
    the head dwell all the senses, both interior and exterior, whereas in the
    other members there is only touch, and hence it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++9%3A15"
      >Is. 9:15</a
    >): "The aged and honorable, he is the head"---"Power," because the power
    and movement of the other members, together with the direction of them in
    their acts, is from the head, by reason of the sensitive and motive power
    there ruling; hence the ruler is called the head of a people, according to 1
    Kgs. 15:17: "When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made
    the head of the tribes of Israel?" Now these three things belong spiritually
    to Christ. First, on account of His nearness to God His grace is the highest
    and first, though not in time, since all have received grace on account of
    His grace, according to Rm. 8:29: "For whom He foreknew, He also
    predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son; that He might
    be the first-born amongst many brethren." Secondly, He had perfection as
    regards the fulness of all graces, according to Jn. 1:14, "We saw Him
    [Vulg.: 'His glory']... full of grace and truth," as was shown, Question
    [7], Article [9]. Thirdly, He has the power of bestowing grace on all the
    members of the Church, according to Jn. 1:16: "Of His fulness we have all
    received." And thus it is plain that Christ is fittingly called the Head of
    the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To give grace or the Holy Ghost belongs
    to Christ as He is God, authoritatively; but instrumentally it belongs also
    to Him as man, inasmuch as His manhood is the instrument of His Godhead. And
    hence by the power of the Godhead His actions were beneficial, i.e. by
    causing grace in us, both meritoriously and efficiently. But Augustine
    denies that Christ as man gives the Holy Ghost authoritatively. Even other
    saints are said to give the Holy Ghost instrumentally, or ministerially,
    according to Gal. 3:5: "He... who giveth to you the Spirit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In metaphorical speech we must not
    expect a likeness in all respects; for thus there would be not likeness but
    identity. Accordingly a natural head has not another head because one human
    body is not part of another; but a metaphorical body, i.e. an ordered
    multitude, is part of another multitude as the domestic multitude is part of
    the civil multitude; and hence the father who is head of the domestic
    multitude has a head above him, i.e. the civil governor. And hence there is
    no reason why God should not be the Head of Christ, although Christ Himself
    is Head of the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The head has a manifest pre-eminence
    over the other exterior members; but the heart has a certain hidden
    influence. And hence the Holy Ghost is likened to the heart, since He
    invisibly quickens and unifies the Church; but Christ is likened to the Head
    in His visible nature in which man is set over man.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ is the Head of men as to their bodies or only as to their
    souls?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ is not the Head of men
    as to their bodies. For Christ is said to be the Head of the Church inasmuch
    as He bestows spiritual sense and the movement of grace on the Church. But a
    body is not capable of this spiritual sense and movement. Therefore Christ
    is not the Head of men as regards their bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we share bodies with the brutes. If
    therefore Christ was the Head of men as to their bodies, it would follow
    that He was the Head of brute animals; and this is not fitting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ took His body from other men, as
    is clear from Mt. 1 and Luke 3. But the head is the first of the members, as
    was said above (<a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3).
    Therefore Christ is not the Head of the Church as regards bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++3%3A21"
      >Phil. 3:21</a
    >): "Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His
    glory."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The human body has a natural relation to the
    rational soul, which is its proper form and motor. Inasmuch as the soul is
    its form, it receives from the soul life and the other properties which
    belong specifically to man; but inasmuch as the soul is its motor, the body
    serves the soul instrumentally. Therefore we must hold that the manhood of
    Christ had the power of "influence," inasmuch as it is united to the Word of
    God, to Whom His body is united through the soul, as stated above (<a
      href="TP006.html#TPQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="TP006.html#TPQ6A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence the whole
    manhood of Christ, i.e. according to soul and body, influences all, both in
    soul and body; but principally the soul, and secondarily the body: First,
    inasmuch as the "members of the body are presented as instruments of
    justice" in the soul that lives through Christ, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A13"
      >Rm. 6:13</a
    >): secondly, inasmuch as the life of glory flows from the soul on to the
    body, according to Rm. 8:11: "He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall
    quicken also your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in
    you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The spiritual sense of grace does not
    reach to the body first and principally, but secondarily and instrumentally,
    as was said above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The body of an animal has no relation to
    a rational soul, as the human body has. Hence there is no parity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although Christ drew the matter of His
    body from other men, yet all draw from Him the immortal life of their body,
    according to 1 Cor. 15:22: "And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all
    shall be made alive."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ is the Head of all men?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ is not the Head of all
    men. For the head has no relation except to the members of its body. Now the
    unbaptized are nowise members of the Church which is the body of Christ, as
    it is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A23"
      >Eph. 1:23</a
    >). Therefore Christ is not the Head of all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle writes to the Ephesians
    (5:25,27): "Christ delivered Himself up for" the Church "that He might
    present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any
    such thing." But there are many of the faithful in whom is found the spot or
    the wrinkle of sin. Therefore Christ is not the Head of all the faithful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the Old Law are
    compared to Christ as the shadow to the body, as is written (Col. 2:17). But
    the fathers of the Old Testament in their day served unto these sacraments,
    according to Heb. 8:5: "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly
    things." Hence they did not pertain to Christ's body, and therefore Christ
    is not the Head of all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A10"
      >1 Tim. 4:10</a
    >): "Who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++2%3A2"
      >1 Jn. 2:2</a
    >): "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also
    for those of the whole world." Now to save men and to be a propitiation for
    their sins belongs to Christ as Head. Therefore Christ is the Head of all
    men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This is the difference between the natural body
    of man and the Church's mystical body, that the members of the natural body
    are all together, and the members of the mystical are not all
    together---neither as regards their natural being, since the body of the
    Church is made up of the men who have been from the beginning of the world
    until its end---nor as regards their supernatural being, since, of those who
    are at any one time, some there are who are without grace, yet will
    afterwards obtain it, and some have it already. We must therefore consider
    the members of the mystical body not only as they are in act, but as they
    are in potentiality. Nevertheless, some are in potentiality who will never
    be reduced to act, and some are reduced at some time to act; and this
    according to the triple class, of which the first is by faith, the second by
    the charity of this life, the third by the fruition of the life to come.
    Hence we must say that if we take the whole time of the world in general,
    Christ is the Head of all men, but diversely. For, first and principally, He
    is the Head of such as are united to Him by glory; secondly, of those who
    are actually united to Him by charity; thirdly, of those who are actually
    united to Him by faith; fourthly, of those who are united to Him merely in
    potentiality, which is not yet reduced to act, yet will be reduced to act
    according to Divine predestination; fifthly, of those who are united to Him
    in potentiality, which will never be reduced to act; such are those men
    existing in the world, who are not predestined, who, however, on their
    departure from this world, wholly cease to be members of Christ, as being no
    longer in potentiality to be united to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those who are unbaptized, though not
    actually in the Church, are in the Church potentially. And this potentiality
    is rooted in two things---first and principally, in the power of Christ,
    which is sufficient for the salvation of the whole human race; secondly, in
    free-will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To be "a glorious Church not having spot
    or wrinkle" is the ultimate end to which we are brought by the Passion of
    Christ. Hence this will be in heaven, and not on earth, in which "if we say
    we have no sin, we deceive ourselves," as is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++1%3A8"
      >1 Jn. 1:8</a
    >). Nevertheless, there are some, viz. mortal, sins from which they are free
    who are members of Christ by the actual union of charity; but such as are
    tainted with these sins are not members of Christ actually, but potentially;
    except, perhaps, imperfectly, by formless faith, which unites to God,
    relatively but not simply, viz. so that man partake of the life of grace.
    For, as is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+2%3A20"
      >James 2:20</a
    >): "Faith without works is dead." Yet such as these receive from Christ a
    certain vital act, i.e. to believe, as if a lifeless limb were moved by a
    man to some extent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The holy Fathers made use of the legal
    sacraments, not as realities, but as images and shadows of what was to come.
    Now it is the same motion to an image as image, and to the reality, as is
    clear from the Philosopher (De Memor. et Remin. ii). Hence the ancient
    Fathers, by observing the legal sacraments, were borne to Christ by the same
    faith and love whereby we also are borne to Him, and hence the ancient
    Fathers belong to the same Church as we.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ is the Head of the angels?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ as man is not the head
    of the angels. For the head and members are of one nature. But Christ as man
    is not of the same nature with the angels, but only with men, since, as is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A16"
      >Heb. 2:16</a
    >): "For nowhere doth He take hold of the angels, but of the seed of Abraham
    He taketh hold." Therefore Christ as man is not the head of the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ is the head of such as belong to
    the Church, which is His Body, as is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A23"
      >Eph. 1:23</a
    >). But the angels do not belong to the Church. For the Church is the
    congregation of the faithful: and in the angels there is no faith, for they
    do not "walk by faith" but "by sight," otherwise they would be "absent from
    the Lord," as the Apostle argues (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor+++5%3A6,7"
      >2 Cor. 5:6,7</a
    >). Therefore Christ as man is not head of the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Tract. xix; xxiii in
    Joan.), that as "the Word" which "was in the beginning with the Father"
    quickens souls, so the "Word made flesh" quickens bodies, which angels lack.
    But the Word made flesh is Christ as man. Therefore Christ as man does not
    give life to angels, and hence as man He is not the head of the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (Col. 2:10), "Who is the
    head of all Principality and Power," and the same reason holds good with the
    other orders of angels. Therefore Christ is the Head of the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2), where there is one body we must allow that there is one head. Now
    a multitude ordained to one end, with distinct acts and duties, may be
    metaphorically called one body. But it is manifest that both men and angels
    are ordained to one end, which is the glory of the Divine fruition. Hence
    the mystical body of the Church consists not only of men but of angels. Now
    of all this multitude Christ is the Head, since He is nearer God, and shares
    His gifts more fully, not only than man, but even than angels; and of His
    influence not only men but even angels partake, since it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++1%3A20-22"
      >Eph. 1:20-22</a
    >): that God the Father set "Him," namely Christ, "on His right hand in the
    heavenly places, above all Principality and Power and Virtue and Dominion
    and every name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which
    is to come. And He hath subjected all things under His feet." Therefore
    Christ is not only the Head of men, but of angels. Hence we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++4%3A11"
      >Mt. 4:11</a
    >) that "angels came and ministered to Him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's influence over men is chiefly
    with regard to their souls; wherein men agree with angels in generic nature,
    though not in specific nature. By reason of this agreement Christ can be
    said to be the Head of the angels, although the agreement falls short as
    regards the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Church, on earth, is the
    congregation of the faithful; but, in heaven, it is the congregation of
    comprehensors. Now Christ was not merely a wayfarer, but a comprehensor. And
    therefore He is the Head not merely of the faithful, but of comprehensors,
    as having grace and glory most fully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine here uses the similitude of
    cause and effect, i.e. inasmuch as corporeal things act on bodies, and
    spiritual things on spiritual things. Nevertheless, the humanity of Christ,
    by virtue of the spiritual nature, i.e. the Divine, can cause something not
    only in the spirits of men, but also in the spirits of angels, on account of
    its most close conjunction with God, i.e. by personal union.<br />

    Whether the grace of Christ, as Head of the Church, is the same as His
    habitual grace, inasmuch as He is Man?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the grace whereby Christ is
    Head of the Church and the individual grace of the Man are not the same. For
    the Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A15"
      >Rm. 5:15</a
    >): "If by the offense of one many died, much more the grace of God and the
    gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many." But
    the actual sin of Adam is distinct from original sin which he transmitted to
    his posterity. Hence the personal grace which is proper to Christ is
    distinct from His grace, inasmuch as He is the Head of the Church, which
    flows to others from Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, habits are distinguished by acts. But
    the personal grace of Christ is ordained to one act, viz. the sanctification
    of His soul; and the capital grace is ordained to another, viz. to
    sanctifying others. Therefore the personal grace of Christ is distinct from
    His grace as He is the Head of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as was said above (<a
      href="TP006.html#TPQ6OUTP1"
      >Question [6]</a
    >, <a href="TP006.html#TPQ6A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), in Christ we
    distinguish a threefold grace, viz. the grace of union, capital grace, and
    the individual grace of the Man. Now the individual grace of Christ is
    distinct from the grace of union. Therefore it is also distinct from the
    capital grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A16"
      >Jn. 1:16</a
    >): "Of His fulness we all have received." Now He is our Head, inasmuch as
    we receive from Him. Therefore He is our Head, inasmuch as He has the
    fulness of grace. Now He had the fulness of grace, inasmuch as personal
    grace was in Him in its perfection, as was said above (<a
      href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Hence His capital and
    personal grace are not distinct.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since everything acts inasmuch as it is a being
    in act, it must be the same act whereby it is in act and whereby it acts, as
    it is the same heat whereby fire is hot and whereby it heats. Yet not every
    act whereby anything is in act suffices for its being the principle of
    acting upon others. For since the agent is nobler than the patient, as
    Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16) and the Philosopher (De Anima iii,
    19), the agent must act on others by reason of a certain pre-eminence. Now
    it was said above (<a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>,
    <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>) grace was received by the
    soul of Christ in the highest way; and therefore from this pre-eminence of
    grace which He received, it is from Him that this grace is bestowed on
    others---and this belongs to the nature of head. Hence the personal grace,
    whereby the soul of Christ is justified, is essentially the same as His
    grace, as He is the Head of the Church, and justifies others; but there is a
    distinction of reason between them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Original sin in Adam, which is a sin of
    the nature, is derived from his actual sin, which is a personal sin, because
    in him the person corrupted the nature; and by means of this corruption the
    sin of the first man is transmitted to posterity, inasmuch as the corrupt
    nature corrupts the person. Now grace is not vouchsafed us by means of human
    nature, but solely by the personal action of Christ Himself. Hence we must
    not distinguish a twofold grace in Christ, one corresponding to the nature,
    the other to the person as in Adam we distinguish the sin of the nature and
    of the person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Different acts, one of which is the
    reason and the cause of the other, do not diversify a habit. Now the act of
    the personal grace which is formally to sanctify its subject, is the reason
    of the justification of others, which pertains to capital grace. Hence it is
    that the essence of the habit is not diversified by this difference.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Personal and capital grace are ordained
    to an act; but the grace of union is not ordained to an act, but to the
    personal being. Hence the personal and the capital grace agree in the
    essence of the habit; but the grace of union does not, although the personal
    grace can be called in a manner the grace of union, inasmuch as it brings
    about a fitness for the union; and thus the grace of union, the capital, and
    the personal grace are one in essence, though there is a distinction of
    reason between them.<br />

    Whether it is proper to Christ to be Head of the Church?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it is not proper to Christ to be
    Head of the Church. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++15%3A17"
      >1 Kgs. 15:17</a
    >): "When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the
    head of the tribes of Israel?" Now there is but one Church in the New and
    the Old Testament. Therefore it seems that with equal reason any other man
    than Christ might be head of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ is called Head of the Church from
    His bestowing grace on the Church's members. But it belongs to others also
    to grant grace to others, according to Eph. 4:29: "Let no evil speech
    proceed from your mouth; but that which is good to the edification of faith,
    that it may administer grace to the hearers." Therefore it seems to belong
    also to others than Christ to be head of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ by His ruling over the Church is
    not only called "Head," but also "Shepherd" and "Foundation." Now Christ did
    not retain for Himself alone the name of Shepherd, according to 1 Pt. 5:4,
    "And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a
    never-fading crown of glory"; nor the name of Foundation, according to Apoc.
    21:14: "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations." Therefore it seems
    that He did not retain the name of Head for Himself alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Col. 2:19): "The head" of the
    Church is that "from which the whole body, by joints and bands being
    supplied with nourishment and compacted groweth unto the increase of God."
    But this belongs only to Christ. Therefore Christ alone is Head of the
    Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The head influences the other members in two
    ways. First, by a certain intrinsic influence, inasmuch as motive and
    sensitive force flow from the head to the other members; secondly, by a
    certain exterior guidance, inasmuch as by sight and the senses, which are
    rooted in the head, man is guided in his exterior acts. Now the interior
    influx of grace is from no one save Christ, Whose manhood, through its union
    with the Godhead, has the power of justifying; but the influence over the
    members of the Church, as regards their exterior guidance, can belong to
    others; and in this way others may be called heads of the Church, according
    to Amos 6:1, "Ye great men, heads of the people"; differently, however, from
    Christ. First, inasmuch as Christ is the Head of all who pertain to the
    Church in every place and time and state; but all other men are called heads
    with reference to certain special places, as bishops of their Churches. Or
    with reference to a determined time as the Pope is the head of the whole
    Church, viz. during the time of his Pontificate, and with reference to a
    determined state, inasmuch as they are in the state of wayfarers. Secondly,
    because Christ is the Head of the Church by His own power and authority;
    while others are called heads, as taking Christ's place, according to 2 Cor.
    2:10, "For what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your sakes
    I have done it in the person of Christ," and 2 Cor. 5:20, "For Christ
    therefore we are ambassadors, God, as it were, exhorting by us."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word "head" is employed in that
    passage in regard to exterior government; as a king is said to be the head
    of his kingdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man does not distribute grace by
    interior influx, but by exteriorly persuading to the effects of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. xlvi in
    Joan.): "If the rulers of the Church are Shepherds, how is there one
    Shepherd, except that all these are members of one Shepherd?" So likewise
    others may be called foundations and heads, inasmuch as they are members of
    the one Head and Foundation. Nevertheless, as Augustine says (Tract. xlvii),
    "He gave to His members to be shepherds; yet none of us calleth himself the
    Door. He kept this for Himself alone." And this because by door is implied
    the principal authority, inasmuch as it is by the door that all enter the
    house; and it is Christ alone by "Whom also we have access... into this
    grace, wherein we stand" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A2"
      >Rm. 5:2</a
    >); but by the other names above-mentioned there may be implied not merely
    the principal but also the secondary authority.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the devil is the head of all the wicked?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the devil is not the head of
    the wicked. For it belongs to the head to diffuse sense and movement into
    the members, as a gloss says, on Eph. 1:22, "And made Him head," etc. But
    the devil has no power of spreading the evil of sin, which proceeds from the
    will of the sinner. Therefore the devil cannot be called the head of the
    wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by every sin a man is made evil. But not
    every sin is from the devil; and this is plain as regards the demons, who
    did not sin through the persuasion of another; so likewise not every sin of
    man proceeds from the devil, for it is said (De Eccles. Dogm. lxxxii): "Not
    all our wicked thoughts are always raised up by the suggestion of the devil;
    but sometimes they spring from the movement of our will." Therefore the
    devil is not the head of all the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one head is placed on one body. But the
    whole multitude of the wicked do not seem to have anything in which they are
    united, for evil is contrary to evil and springs from divers defects, as
    Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the devil cannot be called the head
    of all the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss [*St. Gregory, Moral. xiv] on Job
    18:17, "Let the memory of him perish from the earth," says: "This is said of
    every evil one, yet so as to be referred to the head," i.e. the devil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP008.html#TPQ8A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >), the head not only influences the members interiorly, but also governs
    them exteriorly, directing their actions to an end. Hence it may be said
    that anyone is the head of a multitude, either as regards both, i.e. by
    interior influence and exterior governance, and thus Christ is the Head of
    the Church, as was stated (<a href="TP008.html#TPQ8A6THEP1">Article [6]</a
    >); or as regards exterior governance, and thus every prince or prelate is
    head of the multitude subject to him. And in this way the devil is head of
    all the wicked. For, as is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+41%3A25"
      >Job 41:25</a
    >): "He is king over all the children of pride." Now it belongs to a
    governor to lead those whom he governs to their end. But the end of the
    devil is the aversion of the rational creature from God; hence from the
    beginning he has endeavored to lead man from obeying the Divine precept. But
    aversion from God has the nature of an end, inasmuch as it is sought for
    under the appearance of liberty, according to Jer. 2:20: "Of old time thou
    hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst, 'I will not
    serve.'" Hence, inasmuch as some are brought to this end by sinning, they
    fall under the rule and government of the devil, and therefore he is called
    their head.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the devil does not influence
    the rational mind interiorly, yet he beguiles it to evil by persuasion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A governor does not always suggest to
    his subjects to obey his will; but proposes to all the sign of his will, in
    consequence of which some are incited by inducement, and some of their own
    free-will, as is plain in the leader of an army, whose standard all the
    soldiers follow, though no one persuades them. Therefore in the same way,
    the first sin of the devil, who "sinneth from the beginning" (1 Jnn 3:8), is
    held out to all to be followed, and some imitate at his suggestion, and some
    of their own will without any suggestion. And hence the devil is the head of
    all the wicked, inasmuch as they imitate Him, according to Wis. 2:24,25: "By
    the envy of the devil, death came into the world. And they follow him that
    are of his side."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All sins agree in aversion from God,
    although they differ by conversion to different changeable goods.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Anti-christ may be called the head of all the wicked?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Antichrist is not the head of
    the wicked. For there are not several heads of one body. But the devil is
    the head of the multitude of the wicked. Therefore Anti-christ is not their
    head.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Anti-christ is a member of the devil.
    Now the head is distinguished from the members. Therefore Anti-christ is not
    the head of the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the head has an influence over the
    members. But Anti-christ has no influence over the wicked who have preceded
    him. Therefore Anti-christ is not the head of the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss [*St. Gregory, Moral. xv] on Job
    21:29, "Ask any of them that go by the way," says: "Whilst he was speaking
    of the body of all the wicked, suddenly he turned his speech to Anti-christ
    the head of all evil-doers."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), in the head are found three things: order, perfection, and the power of
    influencing. But as regards the order of the body, Anti-christ is not said
    to be the head of the wicked as if his sin had preceded, as the sin of the
    devil preceded. So likewise he is not called the head of the wicked from the
    power of influencing, although he will pervert some in his day by exterior
    persuasion; nevertheless those who were before him were not beguiled into
    wickedness by him nor have imitated his wickedness. Hence he cannot be
    called the head of all the wicked in this way, but of some. Therefore it
    remains to be said that he is the head of all the wicked by reason of the
    perfection of his wickedness. Hence, on 2 Thess. 2:4, "Showing himself as if
    he were God," a gloss says: "As in Christ dwelt the fulness of the Godhead,
    so in Anti-christ the fulness of all wickedness." Not indeed as if his
    humanity were assumed by the devil into unity of person, as the humanity of
    Christ by the Son of God; but that the devil by suggestion infuses his
    wickedness more copiously into him than into all others. And in this way all
    the wicked who have gone before are signs of Anti-christ, according to 2
    Thess. 2:7, "For the mystery of iniquity already worketh."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The devil and Anti-christ are not two
    heads, but one; since Anti-christ is called the head, inasmuch as the
    wickedness of the devil is most fully impressed on him. Hence, on 2 Thess.
    2:4, "Showing himself as if he were God," a gloss says: "The head of all the
    wicked, namely the devil, who is king over all the children of pride will be
    in him." Now he is said to be in him not by personal union, nor by
    indwelling, since "the Trinity alone dwells in the mind" (as is said De
    Eccles. Dogm. lxxxiii), but by the effect of wickedness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the head of Christ is God, and yet He
    is the Head of the Church, as was said above (<a
      href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2), so likewise Anti-christ is a member of the devil and yet is head
    of the wicked.<br />
  </p>

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Anti-christ is said to be the head of
    all the wicked not by a likeness of influence, but by a likeness of
    perfection. For in him the devil, as it were, brings his wickedness to a
    head, in the same way that anyone is said to bring his purpose to a head
    when he executes it.<br />
