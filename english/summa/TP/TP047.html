    OF THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF CHRIST'S PASSION (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We have now to consider the efficient cause of Christ's Passion, concerning
    which there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ was slain by
    others, or by Himself?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> From what motive did He deliver
    Himself up to the Passion?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the Father delivered Him
    up to suffer?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was fitting that He
    should suffer at the hands of the Gentiles, or rather of the Jews?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether His slayers knew who He
    was?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the sin of them who slew
    Christ.

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ was slain by another or by Himself?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not slain by
    another, but by Himself. For He says Himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++10%3A18"
      >Jn. 10:18</a
    >): "No men taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself." But he is
    said to kill another who takes away his life. Consequently, Christ was not
    slain by others, but by Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those slain by others sink gradually
    from exhausted nature, and this is strikingly apparent in the crucified:
    for, as Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "Those who were crucified were
    tormented with a lingering death." But this did not happen in Christ's case,
    since "crying out, with a loud voice, He yielded up the ghost" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++27%3A50"
      >Mt. 27:50</a
    >). Therefore Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those slain by others suffer a violent
    death, and hence die unwillingly, because violent is opposed to voluntary.
    But Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "Christ's spirit did not quit the flesh
    unwillingly, but because He willed it, when He willed it, and as He willed
    it." Consequently Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++18%3A33"
      >Lk. 18:33</a
    >): "After they have scourged Him, they will put him to death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may cause an effect in two ways: in the
    first instance by acting directly so as to produce the effect; and in this
    manner Christ's persecutors slew Him because they inflicted on Him what was
    a sufficient cause of death, and with the intention of slaying Him, and the
    effect followed, since death resulted from that cause. In another way
    someone causes an effect indirectly---that is, by not preventing it when he
    can do so; just as one person is said to drench another by not closing the
    window through which the shower is entering: and in this way Christ was the
    cause of His own Passion and death. For He could have prevented His Passion
    and death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in check, so that they would not
    have been eager to slay Him, or would have been powerless to do so.
    Secondly, because His spirit had the power of preserving His fleshly nature
    from the infliction of any injury; and Christ's soul had this power, because
    it was united in unity of person with the Divine Word, as Augustine says (De
    Trin. iv). Therefore, since Christ's soul did not repel the injury inflicted
    on His body, but willed His corporeal nature to succumb to such injury, He
    is said to have laid down His life, or to have died voluntarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When we hear the words, "No man taketh
    away My life from Me," we must understand "against My will": for that is
    properly said to be "taken away" which one takes from someone who is
    unwilling and unable to resist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In order for Christ to show that the
    Passion inflicted by violence did not take away His life, He preserved the
    strength of His bodily nature, so that at the last moment He was able to cry
    out with a loud voice: and hence His death should be computed among His
    other miracles. Accordingly it is written (Mk. 15:39): "And the centurion
    who stood over against Him, seeing that crying out in this manner, He had
    given up the ghost, said: Indeed, this man was the Son of God." It was also
    a subject of wonder in Christ's death that He died sooner than the others
    who were tormented with the same suffering. Hence John says (19:32) that
    "they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with
    Him," that they might die more speedily; "but after they were come to Jesus,
    when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs." Mark
    also states (15:44) that "Pilate wondered that He should be already dead."
    For as of His own will His bodily nature kept its vigor to the end, so
    likewise, when He willed, He suddenly succumbed to the injury inflicted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ at the same time suffered
    violence in order to die, and died, nevertheless, voluntarily; because
    violence was inflicted on His body, which, however, prevailed over His body
    only so far as He willed it.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ died out of obedience?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not die out of
    obedience. For obedience is referred to a command. But we do not read that
    Christ was commanded to suffer. Therefore He did not suffer out of
    obedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man is said to do from obedience what
    he does from necessity of precept. But Christ did not suffer necessarily,
    but voluntarily. Therefore He did not suffer out of obedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a more excellent virtue than
    obedience. But we read that Christ suffered out of charity, according to
    Eph. 5:2: "Walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and delivered Himself
    up for us." Therefore Christ's Passion ought to be ascribed rather to
    charity than to obedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A8"
      >Phil. 2:8</a
    >): "He became obedient" to the Father "unto death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was befitting that Christ should suffer out
    of obedience. First of all, because it was in keeping with human
    justification, that "as by the disobedience of one man, many were made
    sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just," as is
    written Rm. 5:19. Secondly, it was suitable for reconciling man with God:
    hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A10"
      >Rm. 5:10</a
    >): "We are reconciled to God by the death of His Son," in so far as
    Christ's death was a most acceptable sacrifice to God, according to Eph.
    5:2: "He delivered Himself for us an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an
    odor of sweetness." Now obedience is preferred to all sacrifices. according
    to 1 Kgs. 15:22: "Obedience is better than sacrifices." Therefore it was
    fitting that the sacrifice of Christ's Passion and death should proceed from
    obedience. Thirdly, it was in keeping with His victory whereby He triumphed
    over death and its author; because a soldier cannot conquer unless he obey
    his captain. And so the Man-Christ secured the victory through being
    obedient to God, according to Prov. 21:28: "An obedient man shall speak of
    victory."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ received a command from the
    Father to suffer. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++10%3A18"
      >Jn. 10:18</a
    >): "I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it up again:
    (and) this commandment have I received of My Father"---namely, of laying
    down His life and of resuming it again. "From which," as Chrysostom says
    (Hom. lix in Joan.), it is not to be understood "that at first He awaited
    the command, and that He had need to be told, but He showed the proceeding
    to be a voluntary one, and destroyed suspicion of opposition" to the Father.
    Yet because the Old Law was ended by Christ's death, according to His dying
    words, "It is consummated" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A30"
      >Jn. 19:30</a
    >), it may be understood that by His suffering He fulfilled all the precepts
    of the Old Law. He fulfilled those of the moral order which are founded on
    the precepts of charity, inasmuch as He suffered both out of love of the
    Father, according to Jn. 14:31: "That the world may know that I love the
    Father, and as the Father hath given Me commandment, so do I: arise, let us
    go hence"---namely, to the place of His Passion: and out of love of His
    neighbor, according to Gal. 2:20: "He loved me, and delivered Himself up for
    me." Christ likewise by His Passion fulfilled the ceremonial precepts of the
    Law, which are chiefly ordained for sacrifices and oblations, in so far as
    all the ancient sacrifices were figures of that true sacrifice which the
    dying Christ offered for us. Hence it is written (Col. 2:16,17): "Let no man
    judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new
    moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body
    is Christ's," for the reason that Christ is compared to them as a body is to
    a shadow. Christ also by His Passion fulfilled the judicial precepts of the
    Law, which are chiefly ordained for making compensation to them who have
    suffered wrong, since, as is written Ps. 68:5: He "paid that which" He "took
    not away," suffering Himself to be fastened to a tree on account of the
    apple which man had plucked from the tree against God's command.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although obedience implies necessity
    with regard to the thing commanded, nevertheless it implies free-will with
    regard to the fulfilling of the precept. And, indeed, such was Christ's
    obedience, for, although His Passion and death, considered in themselves,
    were repugnant to the natural will, yet Christ resolved to fulfill God's
    will with respect to the same, according to Ps. 39:9: "That I should do Thy
    will: O my God, I have desired it." Hence He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A42"
      >Mt. 26:42</a
    >): "If this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, Thy will be
    done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> For the same reason Christ suffered out
    of charity and out of obedience; because He fulfilled even the precepts of
    charity out of obedience only; and was obedient, out of love, to the
    Father's command.<br />

    Whether God the Father delivered up Christ to the Passion?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God the Father did not deliver
    up Christ to the Passion. For it is a wicked and cruel act to hand over an
    innocent man to torment and death. But, as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++32%3A4"
      >Dt. 32:4</a
    >): "God is faithful, and without any iniquity." Therefore He did not hand
    over the innocent Christ to His Passion and death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not likely that a man be given
    over to death by himself and by another also. But Christ gave Himself up for
    us, as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A12"
      >Is. 53:12</a
    >): "He hath delivered His soul unto death." Consequently it does not appear
    that God the Father delivered Him up.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Judas is held to be guilty because he
    betrayed Christ to the Jews, according to Jn. 6:71: "One of you is a devil,"
    alluding to Judas, who was to betray Him. The Jews are likewise reviled for
    delivering Him up to Pilate; as we read in Jn. 18:35: "Thy own nation, and
    the chief priests have delivered Thee up to me." Moreover, as is related in
    Jn. 19:16: Pilate "delivered Him to them to be crucified"; and according to
    2 Cor. 6:14: there is no "participation of justice with injustice." It
    seems, therefore, that God the Father did not deliver up Christ to His
    Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A32"
      >Rm. 8:32</a
    >): "God hath not spared His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As observed above (<a
      href="TP047.html#TPQ47A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), Christ suffered voluntarily out of obedience to the Father. Hence in
    three respects God the Father did deliver up Christ to the Passion. In the
    first way, because by His eternal will He preordained Christ's Passion for
    the deliverance of the human race, according to the words of Isaias (53:6):
    "The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us all"; and again (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A10"
      >Is. 53:10</a
    >): "The Lord was pleased to bruise Him in infirmity." Secondly, inasmuch
    as, by the infusion of charity, He inspired Him with the will to suffer for
    us; hence we read in the same passage: "He was offered because it was His
    own will" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A7"
      >Is. 53:7</a
    >). Thirdly, by not shielding Him from the Passion, but abandoning Him to
    His persecutors: thus we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++27%3A46"
      >Mt. 27:46</a
    >) that Christ, while hanging upon the cross, cried out: "My God, My God,
    why hast Thou forsaken Me?" because, to wit, He left Him to the power of His
    persecutors, as Augustine says (Ep. cxl).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is indeed a wicked and cruel act to
    hand over an innocent man to torment and to death against his will. Yet God
    the Father did not so deliver up Christ, but inspired Him with the will to
    suffer for us. God's "severity" (cf. Rm. 11:22) is thereby shown, for He
    would not remit sin without penalty: and the Apostle indicates this when (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A32"
      >Rm. 8:32</a
    >) he says: "God spared not even His own Son." Likewise His "goodness" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++11%3A22"
      >Rm. 11:22</a
    >) shines forth, since by no penalty endured could man pay Him enough
    satisfaction: and the Apostle denotes this when he says: "He delivered Him
    up for us all": and, again (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A25"
      >Rm. 3:25</a
    >): "Whom"---that is to say, Christ---God "hath proposed to be a
    propitiation through faith in His blood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ as God delivered Himself up to
    death by the same will and action as that by which the Father delivered Him
    up; but as man He gave Himself up by a will inspired of the Father.
    Consequently there is no contrariety in the Father delivering Him up and in
    Christ delivering Himself up.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same act, for good or evil, is
    judged differently, accordingly as it proceeds from a different source. The
    Father delivered up Christ, and Christ surrendered Himself, from charity,
    and consequently we give praise to both: but Judas betrayed Christ from
    greed, the Jews from envy, and Pilate from worldly fear, for he stood in
    fear of Caesar; and these accordingly are held guilty.<br />

    Whether it was fitting for Christ to suffer at the hands of the Gentiles?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that Christ should suffer
    at the hands of the Gentiles. For since men were to be freed from sin by
    Christ's death, it would seem fitting that very few should sin in His death.
    But the Jews sinned in His death, on whose behalf it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++21%3A38"
      >Mt. 21:38</a
    >): "This is the heir; come, let us kill him." It seems fitting, therefore,
    that the Gentiles should not be implicated in the sin of Christ's
    slaying.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the truth should respond to the figure.
    Now it was not the Gentiles but the Jews who offered the figurative
    sacrifices of the Old Law. Therefore neither ought Christ's Passion, which
    was a true sacrifice, to be fulfilled at the hands of the Gentiles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as related Jn. 5:18, "the Jews sought to
    kill" Christ because "He did not only break the sabbath, but also said God
    was His Father, making Himself equal to God." But these things seemed to be
    only against the Law of the Jews: hence they themselves said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A7"
      >Jn. 19:7</a
    >): "According to the Law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of
    God." It seems fitting, therefore, that Christ should suffer, at the hands
    not of the Gentiles, but of the Jews, and that what they said was untrue:
    "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death," since many sins are
    punishable with death according to the Law, as is evident from Lev. 20.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord Himself says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++20%3A19"
      >Mt. 20:19</a
    >): "They shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and
    crucified."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of Christ's Passion was foreshown by
    the very manner of His death. For Christ's Passion wrought its effect of
    salvation first of all among the Jews, very many of whom were baptized in
    His death, as is evident from Acts 2:41 and Acts 4:4. Afterwards, by the
    preaching of Jews, Christ's Passion passed on to the Gentiles. Consequently
    it was fitting that Christ should begin His sufferings at the hands of the
    Jews, and, after they had delivered Him up, finish His Passion at the hands
    of the Gentiles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In order to demonstrate the fulness of
    His love, on account of which He suffered, Christ upon the cross prayed for
    His persecutors. Therefore, that the fruits of His petition might accrue to
    Jews and Gentiles, Christ willed to suffer from both.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's Passion was the offering of a
    sacrifice, inasmuch as He endured death of His own free-will out of charity:
    but in so far as He suffered from His persecutors it was not a sacrifice,
    but a most grievous sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. cxiv in
    Joan.): "The Jews said that 'it is not lawful for us to put any man to
    death,' because they understood that it was not lawful for them to put any
    man to death" owing to the sacredness of the feast-day, which they had
    already begun to celebrate. or, as Chrysostom observes (Hom. lxxxiii in
    Joan.), because they wanted Him to be slain, not as a transgressor of the
    Law, but as a public enemy, since He had made Himself out to be a king, of
    which it was not their place to judge. Or, again, because it was not lawful
    for them to crucify Him (as they wanted to), but to stone Him, as they did
    to Stephen. Better still is it to say that the power of putting to death was
    taken from them by the Romans, whose subjects they were.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ's persecutors knew who He was?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's persecutors did know
    who He was. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++21%3A38"
      >Mt. 21:38</a
    >) that the husbandmen seeing the son said within themselves: "This is the
    heir; come, let us kill him." On this Jerome remarks: "Our Lord proves most
    manifestly by these words that the rulers of the Jews crucified the Son of
    God, not from ignorance, but out of envy: for they understood that it was He
    to whom the Father says by the Prophet: 'Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the
    Gentiles for Thy inheritance.'" It seems, therefore, that they knew Him to
    be Christ or the Son of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++15%3A24"
      >Jn. 15:24</a
    >): "But now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father." Now what
    is seen is known manifestly. Therefore the Jews, knowing Christ, inflicted
    the Passion on Him out of hatred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is said in a sermon delivered in the
    Council of Ephesus (P. iii, cap. x): "Just as he who tears up the imperial
    message is doomed to die, as despising the prince's word; so the Jew, who
    crucified Him whom he had seen, will pay the penalty for daring to lay his
    hands on God the Word Himself." Now this would not be so had they not known
    Him to be the Son of God, because their ignorance would have excused them.
    Therefore it seems that the Jews in crucifying Christ knew Him to be the Son
    of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 2:8</a
    >): "If they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of
    glory." And (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+3%3A17"
      >Acts 3:17</a
    >), Peter, addressing the Jews, says: "I know that you did it through
    ignorance, as did also your rulers." Likewise the Lord hanging upon the
    cross said: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A34"
      >Lk. 23:34</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Among the Jews some were elders, and others of
    lesser degree. Now according to the author of De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu.
    lxvi, the elders, who were called "rulers, knew," as did also the devils,
    "that He was the Christ promised in the Law: for they saw all the signs in
    Him which the prophets said would come to pass: but they did not know the
    mystery of His Godhead." Consequently the Apostle says: "If they had known
    it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory." It must, however, be
    understood that their ignorance did not excuse them from crime, because it
    was, as it were, affected ignorance. For they saw manifest signs of His
    Godhead; yet they perverted them out of hatred and envy of Christ; neither
    would they believe His words, whereby He avowed that He was the Son of God.
    Hence He Himself says of them (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++15%3A22"
      >Jn. 15:22</a
    >): "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now
    they have no excuse for their sin." And afterwards He adds (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++15%3A24"
      >Jn. 15:24</a
    >): "If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done,
    they would not have sin." And so the expression employed by Job (21:14) can
    be accepted on their behalf: "(Who) said to God: depart from us, we desire
    not the knowledge of Thy ways."
  </p>
  <p>
    But those of lesser degree---namely, the common folk---who had not grasped
    the mysteries of the Scriptures, did not fully comprehend that He was the
    Christ or the Son of God. For although some of them believed in Him, yet the
    multitude did not; and if they doubted sometimes whether He was the Christ,
    on account of the manifold signs and force of His teaching, as is stated Jn.
    7:31,41, nevertheless they were deceived afterwards by their rulers, so that
    they did not believe Him to be the Son of God or the Christ. Hence Peter
    said to them: "I know that you did it through ignorance, as did also your
    rulers"---namely, because they were seduced by the rulers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those words are spoken by the husbandmen
    of the vineyard; and these signify the rulers of the people, who knew Him to
    be the heir, inasmuch as they knew Him to be the Christ promised in the Law,
    but the words of Ps. 2:8 seem to militate against this answer: "Ask of Me,
    and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance"; which are addressed
    to Him of whom it is said: "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee."
    If, then, they knew Him to be the one to whom the words were addressed: "Ask
    of Me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance," it follows
    that they knew Him to be the Son of God. Chrysostom, too, says upon the same
    passage that "they knew Him to be the Son of God." Bede likewise, commenting
    on the words, "For they know not what they do" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A34"
      >Lk. 23:34</a
    >), says: "It is to be observed that He does not pray for them who,
    understanding Him to be the Son of God, preferred to crucify Him rather than
    acknowledge Him." But to this it may be replied that they knew Him to be the
    Son of God, not from His Nature, but from the excellence of His singular
    grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet we may hold that they are said to have known also that He was verily the
    Son of God, in that they had evident signs thereof: yet out of hatred and
    envy, they refused credence to these signs, by which they might have known
    that He was the Son of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The words quoted are preceded by the
    following: "If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath
    done, they would not have sin"; and then follow the words: "But now they
    have both seen and hated both Me and My Father." Now all this shows that
    while they beheld Christ's marvelous works, it was owing to their hatred
    that they did not know Him to be the Son of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Affected ignorance does not excuse from
    guilt, but seems, rather, to aggravate it: for it shows that a man is so
    strongly attached to sin that he wishes to incur ignorance lest he avoid
    sinning. The Jews therefore sinned, as crucifiers not only of the
    Man-Christ, but also as of God.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the sin of those who crucified Christ was most grievous?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of Christ's crucifiers
    was not the most grievous. Because the sin which has some excuse cannot be
    most grievous. But our Lord Himself excused the sin of His crucifiers when
    He said: "Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A34"
      >Lk. 23:34</a
    >). Therefore theirs was not the most grievous sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord said to Pilate (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A11"
      >Jn. 19:11</a
    >): "He that hath delivered Me to thee hath the greater sin." But it was
    Pilate who caused Christ to be crucified by his minions. Therefore the sin
    of Judas the traitor seems to be greater than that of those who crucified
    Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v):
    "No one suffers injustice willingly"; and in the same place he adds: "Where
    no one suffers injustice, nobody works injustice." Consequently nobody
    wreaks injustice upon a willing subject. But Christ suffered willingly, as
    was shown above (<a href="TP047.html#TPQ47ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).
    Therefore those who crucified Christ did Him no injustice; and hence their
    sin was not the most grievous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom, commenting on the words, "Fill ye
    up, then, the measure of your fathers" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++23%3A32"
      >Mt. 23:32</a
    >), says: "In very truth they exceeded the measure of their fathers; for
    these latter slew men, but they crucified God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP047.html#TPQ47A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), the rulers of the Jews knew that He was the Christ: and if there was any
    ignorance in them, it was affected ignorance, which could not excuse them.
    Therefore their sin was the most grievous, both on account of the kind of
    sin, as well as from the malice of their will. The Jews also of the common
    order sinned most grievously as to the kind of their sin: yet in one respect
    their crime was lessened by reason of their ignorance. Hence Bede,
    commenting on Lk. 23:34, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
    do," says: "He prays for them who know not what they are doing, as having
    the zeal of God, but not according to knowledge." But the sin of the
    Gentiles, by whose hands He was crucified, was much more excusable, since
    they had no knowledge of the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, the excuse made by our
    Lord is not to be referred to the rulers among the Jews, but to the common
    people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Judas did not deliver up Christ to
    Pilate, but to the chief priests who gave Him up to Pilate, according to Jn.
    18:35: "Thy own nation and the chief priests have delivered Thee up to me."
    But the sin of all these was greater than that of Pilate, who slew Christ
    from fear of Caesar; and even greater than the sin of the soldiers who
    crucified Him at the governor's bidding, not out of cupidity like Judas, nor
    from envy and hate like the chief priests.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ, indeed willed His Passion just
    as the Father willed it; yet He did not will the unjust action of the Jews.
    Consequently Christ's slayers are not excused of their injustice.
    Nevertheless, whoever slays a man not only does a wrong to the one slain,
    but likewise to God and to the State; just as he who kills himself, as the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. v). Hence it was that David condemned to death the
    man who "did not fear to lay hands upon the Lord's anointed," even though he
    (Saul) had requested it, as related 2 Kgs. 1:5-14.<br />
