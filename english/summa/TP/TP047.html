<H3 Align="Center">OF THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF CHRIST'S PASSION (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the efficient cause of Christ's Passion, 
concerning which there are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ was slain by others, or by Himself?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> From what motive did He deliver Himself up to the Passion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the Father delivered Him up to suffer?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was fitting that He should suffer at the hands of the 
Gentiles, or rather of the Jews?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether His slayers knew who He was?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the sin of them who slew Christ.

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not slain by another, but by 
Himself. For He says Himself (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A18">Jn. 10:18</a>): "No men taketh My life from Me, 
but I lay it down of Myself." But he is said to kill another who takes 
away his life. Consequently, Christ was not slain by others, but by 
Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those slain by others sink gradually from exhausted 
nature, and this is strikingly apparent in the crucified: for, as 
Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "Those who were crucified were tormented 
with a lingering death." But this did not happen in Christ's case, since 
"crying out, with a loud voice, He yielded up the ghost" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++27%3A50">Mt. 27:50</a>). 
Therefore Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those slain by others suffer a violent death, and hence 
die unwillingly, because violent is opposed to voluntary. But Augustine 
says (De Trin. iv): "Christ's spirit did not quit the flesh unwillingly, 
but because He willed it, when He willed it, and as He willed it." 
Consequently Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++18%3A33">Lk. 18:33</a>): "After they have scourged 
Him, they will put him to death."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may cause an effect in two ways: in the first 
instance by acting directly so as to produce the effect; and in this 
manner Christ's persecutors slew Him because they inflicted on Him what 
was a sufficient cause of death, and with the intention  of slaying Him, 
and the effect followed, since death resulted from that cause. In another 
way someone causes an effect indirectly---that is, by not preventing it 
when he can do so; just as one person is said to drench another by not 
closing the window through which the shower is entering: and in this way 
Christ was the cause of His own Passion and death. For He could have 
prevented His Passion and death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in 
check, so that they would not have been eager to slay Him, or would have 
been powerless to do so. Secondly, because His spirit had the power of 
preserving His fleshly nature from the infliction of any injury; and 
Christ's soul had this power, because it was united in unity of person 
with the Divine Word, as Augustine says (De Trin. iv). Therefore, since 
Christ's soul did not repel the injury inflicted on His body, but willed 
His corporeal nature to succumb to such injury, He is said to have laid 
down His life, or to have died voluntarily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When we hear the words, "No man taketh away My life from 
Me," we must understand "against My will": for that is properly said to 
be "taken away" which one takes from someone who is unwilling and unable 
to resist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In order for Christ to show that the Passion inflicted by 
violence did not take away His life, He preserved the strength of His 
bodily nature, so that at the last moment He was able to cry out with a 
loud voice: and hence His death should be computed among His other 
miracles. Accordingly it is written (Mk. 15:39): "And the centurion who 
stood over against Him, seeing that crying out in this manner, He had 
given up the ghost, said: Indeed, this man was the Son of God." It was 
also a subject of wonder in Christ's death that He died sooner than the 
others who were tormented with the same suffering. Hence John says 
(19:32) that "they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was 
crucified with Him," that they might die more speedily; "but after they 
were come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not 
break His legs." Mark also states (15:44) that "Pilate wondered that He 
should be already dead." For as of His own will His bodily nature kept 
its vigor to the end, so likewise, when He willed, He suddenly succumbed 
to the injury inflicted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ at the same time suffered violence in order to die, 
and died, nevertheless, voluntarily; because violence was inflicted on 
His body, which, however, prevailed over His body only so far as He 
willed it.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ died out of obedience?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not die out of obedience. For 
obedience is referred to a command. But we do not read that Christ was 
commanded to suffer. Therefore He did not suffer out of obedience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man is said to do from obedience what he  does from 
necessity of precept. But Christ did not suffer necessarily, but 
voluntarily. Therefore He did not suffer out of obedience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a more excellent virtue than obedience. But 
we read that Christ suffered out of charity, according to Eph. 5:2: "Walk 
in love, as Christ also has loved us, and delivered Himself up for us." 
Therefore Christ's Passion ought to be ascribed rather to charity than to 
obedience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A8">Phil. 2:8</a>): "He became obedient" to the 
Father "unto death."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was befitting that Christ should suffer out of 
obedience. First of all, because it was in keeping with human 
justification, that "as by the disobedience of one man, many were made 
sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just," as is 
written Rm. 5:19. Secondly, it was suitable for reconciling man with God: 
hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A10">Rm. 5:10</a>): "We are reconciled to God by the death of 
His Son," in so far as Christ's death was a most acceptable sacrifice to 
God, according to Eph. 5:2: "He delivered Himself for us an oblation and 
a sacrifice to God for an odor of sweetness." Now obedience is preferred 
to all sacrifices. according to 1 Kgs. 15:22: "Obedience is better than 
sacrifices." Therefore it was fitting that the sacrifice of Christ's 
Passion and death should proceed from obedience. Thirdly, it was in 
keeping with His victory whereby He triumphed over death and its author; 
because a soldier cannot conquer unless he obey his captain. And so the 
Man-Christ secured the victory through being obedient to God, according 
to Prov. 21:28: "An obedient man shall speak of victory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ received a command from the Father to suffer. For it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A18">Jn. 10:18</a>): "I have power to lay down My life, and I have 
power to take it up again: (and) this commandment have I received of My 
Father"---namely, of laying down His life and of resuming it again. "From 
which," as Chrysostom says (Hom. lix in Joan.), it is not to be 
understood "that at first He awaited the command, and that He had need to 
be told, but He showed the proceeding to be a voluntary one, and 
destroyed suspicion of opposition" to the Father. Yet because the Old Law 
was ended by Christ's death, according to His dying words, "It is 
consummated" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A30">Jn. 19:30</a>), it may be understood that by His suffering He 
fulfilled all the precepts of the Old Law. He fulfilled those of the 
moral order which are founded on the precepts of charity, inasmuch as He 
suffered both out of love of the Father, according to Jn. 14:31: "That 
the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given 
Me commandment, so do I: arise, let us go hence"---namely, to the place 
of His Passion: and out of love of His neighbor, according to Gal. 2:20: 
"He loved me, and delivered Himself up for me." Christ likewise by His 
Passion fulfilled the ceremonial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly 
ordained for sacrifices and oblations, in so far as all the ancient 
sacrifices were figures of that true sacrifice which the dying Christ 
offered  for us. Hence it is written (Col. 2:16,17): "Let no man judge 
you in meat or drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new 
moon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the 
body is Christ's," for the reason that Christ is compared to them as a 
body is to a shadow. Christ also by His Passion fulfilled the judicial 
precepts of the Law, which are chiefly ordained for making compensation 
to them who have suffered wrong, since, as is written Ps. 68:5: He "paid 
that which" He "took not away," suffering Himself to be fastened to a 
tree on account of the apple which man had plucked from the tree against 
God's command.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although obedience implies necessity with regard to the 
thing commanded, nevertheless it implies free-will with regard to the 
fulfilling of the precept. And, indeed, such was Christ's obedience, for, 
although His Passion and death, considered in themselves, were repugnant 
to the natural will, yet Christ resolved to fulfill God's will with 
respect to the same, according to Ps. 39:9: "That I should do Thy will: O 
my God, I have desired it." Hence He said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A42">Mt. 26:42</a>): "If this chalice 
may not pass away, but I must drink it, Thy will be done."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> For the same reason Christ suffered out of charity and out 
of obedience; because He fulfilled even the precepts of charity out of 
obedience only; and was obedient, out of love, to the Father's command.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God the Father delivered up Christ to the Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God the Father did not deliver up Christ to 
the Passion. For it is a wicked and cruel act to hand over an innocent 
man to torment and death. But, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++32%3A4">Dt. 32:4</a>): "God is 
faithful, and without any iniquity." Therefore He did not hand over the 
innocent Christ to His Passion and death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not likely that a man be given over to death by 
himself and by another also. But Christ gave Himself up for us, as it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++53%3A12">Is. 53:12</a>): "He hath delivered His soul unto death." 
Consequently it does not appear that God the Father delivered Him up.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Judas is held to be guilty because he betrayed Christ to 
the Jews, according to Jn. 6:71: "One of you is a devil," alluding to 
Judas, who was to betray Him. The Jews are likewise reviled for 
delivering Him up to Pilate; as we read in Jn. 18:35: "Thy own nation, 
and the chief priests have delivered Thee up to me." Moreover, as is 
related in Jn. 19:16: Pilate "delivered Him to them to be crucified"; and 
according to 2 Cor. 6:14: there is no "participation of justice with 
injustice." It seems, therefore, that God the Father did not deliver up 
Christ to His Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A32">Rm. 8:32</a>): "God hath not spared His own 
Son, but delivered Him up for us all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As observed above (<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), Christ suffered voluntarily out 
of obedience to the Father. Hence in three respects God the Father did 
deliver up Christ to the Passion. In the first way, because by His 
eternal will He preordained Christ's Passion for the deliverance of the 
human race, according to the words of Isaias (53:6): "The Lord hath laid 
on Him the iniquities of us all"; and again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++53%3A10">Is. 53:10</a>): "The Lord was 
pleased to bruise Him in infirmity." Secondly, inasmuch as, by the 
infusion of charity, He inspired Him with the will to suffer for us; 
hence we read in the same passage: "He was offered because it was His own 
will" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++53%3A7">Is. 53:7</a>). Thirdly, by not shielding Him from the Passion, but 
abandoning Him to His persecutors: thus we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++27%3A46">Mt. 27:46</a>) that Christ, 
while hanging upon the cross, cried out: "My God, My God, why hast Thou 
forsaken Me?" because, to wit, He left Him to the power of His 
persecutors, as Augustine says (Ep. cxl).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is indeed a wicked and cruel act to hand over an 
innocent man to torment and to death against his will. Yet God the Father 
did not so deliver up Christ, but inspired Him with the will to suffer 
for us. God's "severity" (cf. Rm. 11:22) is thereby shown, for He would 
not remit sin without penalty: and the Apostle indicates this when (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A32">Rm. 8:32</a>) he says: "God spared not even His own Son." Likewise His "goodness" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11%3A22">Rm. 11:22</a>) shines forth, since by no penalty endured could man pay Him 
enough satisfaction: and the Apostle denotes this when he says: "He 
delivered Him up for us all": and, again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++3%3A25">Rm. 3:25</a>): "Whom"---that is to 
say, Christ---God "hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith in 
His blood."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ as God delivered Himself up to death by the same 
will and action as that by which the Father delivered Him up; but as man 
He gave Himself up by a will inspired of the Father. Consequently there 
is no contrariety in the Father delivering Him up and in Christ 
delivering Himself up.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The same act, for good or evil, is judged differently, 
accordingly as it proceeds from a different source. The Father delivered 
up Christ, and Christ surrendered Himself, from charity, and consequently 
we give praise to both: but Judas betrayed Christ from greed, the Jews 
from envy, and Pilate from worldly fear, for he stood in fear of Caesar; 
and these accordingly are held guilty.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was fitting for Christ to suffer at the hands of the Gentiles?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that Christ should suffer at the hands of 
the Gentiles. For since men were to be freed from sin by Christ's death, 
it would seem fitting that very few should sin in His death. But the Jews 
sinned in His death, on whose behalf it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++21%3A38">Mt. 21:38</a>): "This is the 
heir; come, let us kill him." It seems fitting, therefore, that the 
Gentiles should not be implicated in the sin of Christ's slaying.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the truth should respond to the figure. Now it was not 
the Gentiles but the Jews who offered the figurative sacrifices of the 
Old Law. Therefore neither ought Christ's Passion, which was a true 
sacrifice, to be fulfilled at the hands of the Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as related Jn. 5:18, "the Jews sought to kill" Christ 
because "He did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was His 
Father, making Himself equal to God." But these things seemed to be only 
against the Law of the Jews: hence they themselves said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A7">Jn. 19:7</a>): 
"According to the Law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of 
God." It seems fitting, therefore, that Christ should suffer, at the 
hands not of the Gentiles, but of the Jews, and that what they said was 
untrue: "It is not lawful for us to put any man to death," since many 
sins are punishable with death according to the Law, as is evident from 
Lev. 20.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord Himself says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++20%3A19">Mt. 20:19</a>): "They shall deliver 
Him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of Christ's Passion was foreshown by the very 
manner of His death. For Christ's Passion wrought its effect of salvation 
first of all among the Jews, very many of whom were baptized in His 
death, as is evident from Acts 2:41 and Acts 4:4. Afterwards, by the 
preaching of Jews, Christ's Passion passed on to the Gentiles. 
Consequently it was fitting that Christ should begin His sufferings at 
the hands of the Jews, and, after they had delivered Him up, finish His 
Passion at the hands of the Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In order to demonstrate the fulness of His love, on account 
of which He suffered, Christ upon the cross prayed for His persecutors. 
Therefore, that the fruits of His petition might accrue to Jews and 
Gentiles, Christ willed to suffer from both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's Passion was the offering of a sacrifice, inasmuch 
as He endured death of His own free-will out of charity: but in so far as 
He suffered from His persecutors it was not a sacrifice, but a most 
grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. cxiv in Joan.): "The Jews said 
that 'it is not lawful for us to put any man to death,' because they 
understood that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death" owing 
to the sacredness of the feast-day, which they had already begun to 
celebrate. or, as Chrysostom observes (Hom. lxxxiii in Joan.), because 
they wanted Him to be slain, not as a transgressor of the Law, but as a 
public enemy, since He had made Himself out to be a king, of which it was 
not their place to judge. Or, again, because it was not lawful for them 
to crucify Him (as they wanted to), but to stone Him, as they did to 
Stephen. Better still is it to say that the power of putting to death was 
taken from them by the Romans, whose subjects they were.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's persecutors did know who He was. For 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++21%3A38">Mt. 21:38</a>) that the husbandmen seeing the son said within 
themselves: "This is the heir; come, let us kill him." On this Jerome 
remarks: "Our Lord proves most manifestly by these words that the rulers 
of the Jews crucified the Son of God, not from ignorance, but out of 
envy: for they understood that it was He to whom the Father says by the 
Prophet: 'Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy 
inheritance.'" It seems, therefore, that they knew Him to be Christ or 
the Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++15%3A24">Jn. 15:24</a>): "But now they have both seen 
and hated both Me and My Father." Now what is seen is known manifestly. 
Therefore the Jews, knowing Christ, inflicted the Passion on Him out of 
hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is said in a sermon delivered in the Council of 
Ephesus (P. iii, cap. x): "Just as he who tears up the imperial message 
is doomed to die, as despising the prince's word; so the Jew, who 
crucified Him whom he had seen, will pay the penalty for daring to lay 
his hands on God the Word Himself." Now this would not be so had they not 
known Him to be the Son of God, because their ignorance would have 
excused them. Therefore it seems that the Jews in crucifying Christ knew 
Him to be the Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2%3A8">1 Cor. 2:8</a>): "If they had known it, they 
would never have crucified the Lord of glory." And (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+3%3A17">Acts 3:17</a>), Peter, 
addressing the Jews, says: "I know that you did it through ignorance, as 
did also your rulers." Likewise the Lord hanging upon the cross said: 
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++23%3A34">Lk. 23:34</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Among the Jews some were elders, and others of lesser 
degree. Now according to the author of De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. 
lxvi, the elders, who were called "rulers, knew," as did also the devils, 
"that He was the Christ promised in the Law: for they saw all the signs 
in Him which the prophets said would come to pass: but they did not know 
the mystery of His Godhead." Consequently the Apostle says: "If they had 
known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory." It must, 
however, be understood that their ignorance did not excuse them from 
crime, because it was, as it were, affected ignorance. For they saw 
manifest signs of His Godhead; yet they perverted them out of hatred and 
envy of Christ; neither would they believe His words, whereby He avowed 
that He was the Son of God. Hence He Himself says of them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++15%3A22">Jn. 15:22</a>): 
"If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now 
they have no excuse for their sin." And afterwards He adds (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++15%3A24">Jn. 15:24</a>): 
"If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they 
would not have sin." And so the expression employed by Job (21:14) can be 
accepted on their behalf: "(Who) said to God: depart from us, we desire 
not the knowledge of Thy ways." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But those of lesser degree---namely, the common folk---who had not 
grasped the mysteries of the Scriptures, did not fully comprehend that He 
was the Christ or the Son of God. For although some of them believed in 
Him, yet the multitude did not; and if they doubted sometimes whether He 
was the Christ, on account of the manifold signs and force of His 
teaching, as is stated Jn. 7:31,41, nevertheless they were deceived 
afterwards by their rulers, so that they did not believe Him to be the 
Son of God or the Christ. Hence Peter said to them: "I know that you did 
it through ignorance, as did also your rulers"---namely, because they 
were seduced by the rulers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those words are spoken by the husbandmen of the vineyard; 
and these signify the rulers of the people, who knew Him to be the heir, 
inasmuch as they knew Him to be the Christ promised in the Law, but the 
words of Ps. 2:8 seem to militate against this answer: "Ask of Me, and I 
will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance"; which are addressed to 
Him of whom it is said: "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee." 
If, then, they knew Him to be the one to whom the words were addressed: 
"Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance," it 
follows that they knew Him to be the Son of God. Chrysostom, too, says 
upon the same passage that "they knew Him to be the Son of God." Bede 
likewise, commenting on the words, "For they know not what they do" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++23%3A34">Lk. 23:34</a>), says: "It is to be observed that He does not pray for them who, 
understanding Him to be the Son of God, preferred to crucify Him rather 
than acknowledge Him." But to this it may be replied that they knew Him 
to be the Son of God, not from His Nature, but from the excellence of His 
singular grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet we may hold that they are said to have known also that He was verily 
the Son of God, in that they had evident signs thereof: yet out of hatred 
and envy, they refused credence to these signs, by which they might have 
known that He was the Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The words quoted are preceded by the following: "If I had 
not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not 
have sin"; and then follow the words: "But now they have both seen and 
hated both Me and My Father." Now all this shows that while they beheld 
Christ's marvelous works, it was owing to their hatred that they did not 
know Him to be the Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Affected ignorance does not excuse from guilt, but seems, 
rather, to aggravate it: for it shows that a man is so strongly attached 
to sin that he wishes to incur ignorance lest he avoid sinning. The Jews 
therefore sinned, as crucifiers not only of the Man-Christ, but also as 
of God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sin of those who crucified Christ was most grievous?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of Christ's crucifiers was not the 
most grievous. Because the sin which has some excuse cannot  be most 
grievous. But our Lord Himself excused the sin of His crucifiers when He 
said: "Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++23%3A34">Lk. 23:34</a>). 
Therefore theirs was not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, our Lord said to Pilate (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A11">Jn. 19:11</a>): "He that hath 
delivered Me to thee hath the greater sin." But it was Pilate who caused 
Christ to be crucified by his minions. Therefore the sin of Judas the 
traitor seems to be greater than that of those who crucified Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v): "No one suffers 
injustice willingly"; and in the same place he adds: "Where no one 
suffers injustice, nobody works injustice." Consequently nobody wreaks 
injustice upon a willing subject. But Christ suffered willingly, as was 
shown above (<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore those who crucified Christ did Him no 
injustice; and hence their sin was not the most grievous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom, commenting on the words, "Fill ye up, then, 
the measure of your fathers" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++23%3A32">Mt. 23:32</a>), says: "In very truth they 
exceeded the measure of their fathers; for these latter slew men, but 
they crucified God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP047.html#TPQ47A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the rulers of the Jews knew that 
He was the Christ: and if there was any ignorance in them, it was 
affected ignorance, which could not excuse them. Therefore their sin was 
the most grievous, both on account of the kind of sin, as well as from 
the malice of their will. The Jews also of the common order sinned most 
grievously as to the kind of their sin: yet in one respect their crime 
was lessened by reason of their ignorance. Hence Bede, commenting on Lk. 
23:34, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," says: "He 
prays for them who know not what they are doing, as having the zeal of 
God, but not according to knowledge." But the sin of the Gentiles, by 
whose hands He was crucified, was much more excusable, since they had no 
knowledge of the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, the excuse made by our Lord is not to be 
referred to the rulers among the Jews, but to the common people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Judas did not deliver up Christ to Pilate, but to the chief 
priests who gave Him up to Pilate, according to Jn. 18:35: "Thy own 
nation and the chief priests have delivered Thee up to me." But the sin 
of all these was greater than that of Pilate, who slew Christ from fear 
of Caesar; and even greater than the sin of the soldiers who crucified 
Him at the governor's bidding, not out of cupidity like Judas, nor from 
envy and hate like the chief priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[47] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ, indeed willed His Passion just as the Father willed 
it; yet He did not will the unjust action of the Jews. Consequently 
Christ's slayers are not excused of their  injustice. Nevertheless, 
whoever slays a man not only does a wrong to the one slain, but likewise 
to God and to the State; just as he who kills himself, as the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. v). Hence it was that David condemned to death the man who 
"did not fear to lay hands upon the Lord's anointed," even though he 
(Saul) had requested it, as related 2 Kgs. 1:5-14.<br>
