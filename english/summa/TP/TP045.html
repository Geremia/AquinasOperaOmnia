  <p>
    We now consider Christ's transfiguration; and here there are four points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP045.html#TPQ45A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it was fitting that Christ
    should be transfigured?
  </p>

    transfiguration was the clarity of glory?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP045.html#TPQ45A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the witnesses of the
    transfiguration;
  </p>
  <p>

    Whether it was fitting that Christ should be transfigured?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that Christ
    should be transfigured. For it is not fitting for a true body to be changed
    into various shapes [figuras], but only for an imaginary body. Now Christ's
    body was not imaginary, but real, as stated above (<a
      href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"
      >Question [5]</a
    >, <a href="TP005.html#TPQ5A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore it seems
    that it should not have been transfigured.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, figure is in the fourth species of
    quality, whereas clarity is in the third, since it is a sensible quality.
    Therefore Christ's assuming clarity should not be called a
    transfiguration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a glorified body has four gifts, as we
    shall state farther on (<a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP082.html#XPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>), viz.
    impassibility, agility, subtlety, and clarity. Therefore His transfiguration
    should not have consisted in an assumption of clarity rather than of the
    other gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++17%3A2"
      >Mt. 17:2</a
    >) that Jesus "was transfigured" in the presence of three of His
    disciples.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Our Lord, after foretelling His Passion to His
    disciples, had exhorted them to follow the path of His sufferings (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++16%3A21,24"
      >Mt. 16:21,24</a
    >). Now in order that anyone go straight along a road, he must have some
    knowledge of the end: thus an archer will not shoot the arrow straight
    unless he first see the target. Hence Thomas said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A5"
      >Jn. 14:5</a
    >): "Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
    Above all is this necessary when hard and rough is the road, heavy the
    going, but delightful the end. Now by His Passion Christ achieved glory, not
    only of His soul, not only of His soul, which He had from the first moment
    of His conception, but also of His body; according to Luke (24:26): "Christ
    ought [Vulg.: 'ought not Christ'] to have suffered these things, and so to
    enter into His glory (?)." To which glory He brings those who follow the
    footsteps of His Passion, according to Acts 14:21: "Through many
    tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore it was
    fitting that He should show His disciples the glory of His clarity (which is
    to be transfigured), to which He will configure those who are His; according
    to Phil. 3:21: "(Who) will reform the body of our lowness configured [Douay:
    'made like'] to the body of His glory." Hence Bede says on Mk. 8:39: "By His
    loving foresight He allowed them to taste for a short time the contemplation
    of eternal joy, so that they might bear persecution bravely."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Jerome says on Mt. 17:2: "Let no one
    suppose that Christ," through being said to be transfigured, "laid aside His
    natural shape and countenance, or substituted an imaginary or aerial body
    for His real body. The Evangelist describes the manner of His
    transfiguration when he says: 'His face did shine as the sun, and His
    garments became white as snow.' Brightness of face and whiteness of garments
    argue not a change of substance, but a putting on of glory."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Figure is seen in the outline of a body,
    for it is "that which is enclosed by one or more boundaries" [*Euclid, bk i,
    def. xiv]. Therefore whatever has to do with the outline of a body seems to
    pertain to the figure. Now the clarity, just as the color, of a
    non-transparent body is seen on its surface, and consequently the assumption
    of clarity is called transfiguration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Of those four gifts, clarity alone is a
    quality of the very person in himself; whereas the other three are not
    perceptible, save in some action or movement, or in some passion. Christ,
    then, did show in Himself certain indications of those three gifts---of
    agility, for instance, when He walked on the waves of the sea; of subtlety,
    when He came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; of impassibility,
    when He escaped unhurt from the hands of the Jews who wished to hurl Him
    down or to stone Him. And yet He is not said, on account of this, to be
    transfigured, but only on account of clarity, which pertains to the aspect
    of His Person.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether this clarity was the clarity of glory?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this clarity was not the
    clarity of glory. For a gloss of Bede on Mt. 17:2, "He was transfigured
    before them," says: "In His mortal body He shows forth, not the state of
    immortality, but clarity like to that of future immortality." But the
    clarity of glory is the clarity of immortality. Therefore the clarity which
    Christ showed to His disciples was not the clarity of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on Lk. 9:27 "(That) shall not taste
    death unless [Vulg.: 'till'] they see the kingdom of God," Bede's gloss
    says: "That is, the glorification of the body in an imaginary vision of
    future beatitude." But the image of a thing is not the thing itself.
    Therefore this was not the clarity of beatitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the clarity of glory is only in a human
    body. But this clarity of the transfiguration was seen not only in Christ's
    body, but also in His garments, and in "the bright cloud" which "overshaded"
    the disciples. Therefore it seems that this was not the clarity of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says on the words "He was transfigured
    before them" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++17%3A2"
      >Mt. 17:2</a
    >): "He appeared to the Apostles such as He will appear on the day of
    judgment." And on Mt. 16:28, "Till they see the Son of Man coming in His
    kingdom," Chrysostom says: "Wishing to show with what kind of glory He is
    afterwards to come, so far as it was possible for them to learn it, He
    showed it to them in their present life, that they might not grieve even
    over the death of their Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The clarity which Christ assumed in His
    transfiguration was the clarity of glory as to its essence, but not as to
    its mode of being. For the clarity of the glorified body is derived from
    that of the soul, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Diosc. cxviii). And in like
    manner the clarity of Christ's body in His transfiguration was derived from
    His God. head, as Damascene says (Orat. de Transfig.) and from the glory of
    His soul. That the glory of His soul did not overflow into His body from the
    first moment of Christ's conception was due to a certain Divine
    dispensation, that, as stated above (<a href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), He might fulfil
    the mysteries of our redemption in a passible body. This did not, however,
    deprive Christ of His power of outpouring the glory of His soul into His
    body. And this He did, as to clarity, in His transfiguration, but otherwise
    than in a glorified body. For the clarity of the soul overflows into a
    glorified body, by way of a permanent quality affecting the body. Hence
    bodily refulgence is not miraculous in a glorified body. But in Christ's
    transfiguration clarity overflowed from His Godhead and from His soul into
    His body, not as an immanent quality affecting His very body, but rather
    after the manner of a transient passion, as when the air is lit up by the
    sun. Consequently the refulgence, which appeared in Christ's body then, was
    miraculous: just as was the fact of His walking on the waves of the sea.
    Hence Dionysius says (Ep. ad Cai. iv): "Christ excelled man in doing that
    which is proper to man: this is shown in His supernatural conception of a
    virgin and in the unstable waters bearing the weight of material and earthly
    feet."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherefore we must not say, as Hugh of St. Victor [*Innocent III, De Myst.
    Miss. iv] said, that Christ assumed the gift of clarity in the
    transfiguration, of agility in walking on the sea, and of subtlety in coming
    forth from the Virgin's closed womb: because the gifts are immanent
    qualities of a glorified body. On the contrary, whatever pertained to the
    gifts, that He had miraculously. The same is to be said, as to the soul, of
    the vision in which Paul saw God in a rapture, as we have stated in the SS,
    Question [175], Article [3], ad 2.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted prove, not that the
    clarity of Christ was not that of glory, but that it was not the clarity of
    a glorified body, since Christ's body was not as yet immortal. And just as
    it was by dispensation that in Christ the glory of the soul should not
    overflow into the body so was it possible that by dispensation it might
    overflow as to the gift of clarity and not as to that of impassibility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This clarity is said to have been
    imaginary, not as though it were not really the clarity of glory, but
    because it was a kind of image representing that perfection of glory, in
    virtue of which the body will be glorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the clarity which was in
    Christ's body was a representation of His body's future clarity, so the
    clarity which was in His garments signified the future clarity of the
    saints, which will be surpassed by that of Christ, just as the brightness of
    the snow is surpassed by that of the sun. Hence Gregory says (Moral. xxxii)
    that Christ's garments became resplendent, "because in the height of
    heavenly clarity all the saints will cling to Him in the refulgence of
    righteousness. For His garments signify the righteous, because He will unite
    them to Himself," according to Is. 49:18: "Thou shalt be clothed with all
    these as with an ornament."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The bright cloud signifies the glory of the Holy Ghost or the "power of the
    Father," as Origen says (Tract. iii in Matth.), by which in the glory to
    come the saints will be covered. Or, again, it may be said fittingly that it
    signifies the clarity of the world redeemed, which clarity will cover the
    saints as a tent. Hence when Peter proposed to make tents, "a bright cloud
    overshaded" the disciples.<br />

    Whether the witnesses of the transfiguration were fittingly chosen?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the witnesses of the
    transfiguration were unfittingly chosen. For everyone is a better witness of
    things that he knows. But at the time of Christ's transfiguration no one but
    the angels had as yet any knowledge from experience of the glory to come.
    Therefore the witnesses of the transfiguration should have been angels
    rather than men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, truth, not fiction, is becoming in a
    witness of the truth. Now, Moses and Elias were there, not really, but only
    in appearance; for a gloss on Lk. 9:30, "They were Moses and Elias," says:
    "It must be observed that Moses and Elias were there neither in body nor in
    soul"; but that those bodies were formed "of some available matter. It is
    also credible that this was the result of the angelic ministries, through
    the angels impersonating them." Therefore it seems that they were unsuitable
    witnesses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A43"
      >Acts 10:43</a
    >) that "all the prophets give testimony" to Christ. Therefore not only
    Moses and Elias, but also all the prophets, should have been present as
    witnesses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Christ's glory is promised as a reward
    to all the faithful (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3%3A18;+Phil++3:21"
      >2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 3:21</a
    >), in whom He wished by His transfiguration to enkindle a desire of that
    glory. Therefore He should have taken not only Peter, James, and John, but
    all His disciples, to be witnesses of His transfiguration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>On the contrary is the authority of the Gospel.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ wished to be transfigured in order to
    show men His glory, and to arouse men to a desire of it, as stated above (<a
      href="TP045.html#TPQ45A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now men are brought to the glory of eternal beatitude by Christ---not
    only those who lived after Him, but also those who preceded Him; therefore,
    when He was approaching His Passion, both "the multitude that followed" and
    that "which went before, cried saying: 'Hosanna,'" as related Mt. 21:9,
    beseeching Him, as it were, to save them. Consequently it was fitting that
    witnesses should be present from among those who preceded Him---namely,
    Moses and Elias---and from those who followed after Him---namely, Peter,
    James, and John---that "in the mouth of two or three witnesses" this word
    might stand.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By His transfiguration Christ manifested
    to His disciples the glory of His body, which belongs to men only. It was
    therefore fitting that He should choose men and not angels as witnesses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This gloss is said to be taken from a
    book entitled On the Marvels of Holy Scripture. It is not an authentic work,
    but is wrongly ascribed to St. Augustine; consequently we need not stand by
    it. For Jerome says on Mt. 17:3: "Observe that when the Scribes and
    Pharisees asked for a sign from heaven, He refused to give one; whereas here
    in order to increase the apostles' faith, He gives a sign from heaven, Elias
    coming down thence, whither he had ascended, and Moses arising from the
    nether world." This is not to be understood as though the soul of Moses was
    reunited to his body, but that his soul appeared through some assumed body,
    just as the angels do. But Elias appeared in his own body, not that he was
    brought down from the empyrean heaven, but from some place on high whither
    he was taken up in the fiery chariot.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says on Mt. 17:3: "Moses
    and Elias are brought forward for many reasons." And, first of all, "because
    the multitude said He was Elias or Jeremias or one of the prophets, He
    brings the leaders of the prophets with Him; that hereby at least they might
    see the difference between the servants and their Lord." Another reason was
    "... that Moses gave the Law... while Elias... was jealous for the glory of
    God." Therefore by appearing together with Christ, they show how falsely the
    Jews "accused Him of transgressing the Law, and of blasphemously
    appropriating to Himself the glory of God." A third reason was "to show that
    He has power of death and life, and that He is the judge of the dead and the
    living; by bringing with Him Moses who had died, and Elias who still lived."
    A fourth reason was because, as Luke says (9:31), "they spoke" with Him "of
    His decease that He should accomplish in Jerusalem," i.e. of His Passion and
    death. Therefore, "in order to strengthen the hearts of His disciples with a
    view to this," He sets before them those who had exposed themselves to death
    for God's sake: since Moses braved death in opposing Pharaoh, and Elias in
    opposing Achab. A fifth reason was that "He wished His disciples to imitate
    the meekness of Moses and the zeal of Elias." Hilary adds a sixth
    reason---namely, in order to signify that He had been foretold by the Law,
    which Moses gave them, and by the prophets, of whom Elias was the
    principal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Lofty mysteries should not be
    immediately explained to everyone, but should be handed down through
    superiors to others in their proper turn. Consequently, as Chrysostom says
    (on Mt. 17:3), "He took these three as being superior to the rest." For
    "Peter excelled in the love" he bore to Christ and in the power bestowed on
    him; John in the privilege of Christ's love for him on account of his
    virginity, and, again, on account of his being privileged to be an
    Evangelist; James on account of the privilege of martyrdom. Nevertheless He
    did not wish them to tell others what they had seen before His Resurrection;
    "lest," as Jerome says on Mt. 17:19, "such a wonderful thing should seem
    incredible to them; and lest, after hearing of so great glory, they should
    be scandalized at the Cross" that followed; or, again, "lest [the Cross]
    should be entirely hindered by the people" [*Bede, Hom. xviii; cf. Catena
    Aurea]; and "in order that they might then be witnesses of spiritual things
    when they should be filled with the Holy Ghost" [*Hilary, in Matth.
    xvii].<br />

    Whether the testimony of the Father's voice, saying, "This is My beloved

  </h3>
  <br />

    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the testimony of the Father's
    voice, saying, "This is My beloved Son," was not fittingly added; for, as it
    is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+33%3A14"
      >Job 33:14</a
    >), "God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second
    time." But the Father's voice had testified to this at the time of
    (Christ's) baptism. Therefore it was not fitting that He should bear witness
    to it a second time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, at the baptism the Holy Ghost appeared
    under the form of a dove at the same time as the Father's voice was heard.
    But this did not happen at the transfiguration. Therefore it seems that the
    testimony of the Father was made in an unfitting manner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ began to teach after His baptism.
    Nevertheless, the Father's voice did not then command men to hear him.
    Therefore neither should it have so commanded at the transfiguration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, things should not be said to those who
    cannot bear them, according to Jn. 16:12: "I have yet many things to say to
    you, but you cannot bear them now." But the disciples could not bear the
    Father's voice; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++17%3A6"
      >Mt. 17:6</a
    >) that "the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much
    afraid." Therefore the Father's voice should not have been addressed to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>On the contrary is the authority of the Gospel.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The adoption of the sons of God is through a
    certain conformity of image to the natural Son of God. Now this takes place
    in two ways: first, by the grace of the wayfarer, which is imperfect
    conformity; secondly, by glory, which is perfect conformity, according to 1
    Jn. 3:2: "We are now the sons of God, and it hath not yet appeared what we
    shall be: we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him,
    because we shall see Him as He is." Since, therefore, it is in baptism that
    we acquire grace, while the clarity of the glory to come was foreshadowed in
    the transfiguration, therefore both in His baptism and in His
    transfiguration the natural sonship of Christ was fittingly made known by
    the testimony of the Father: because He alone with the Son and Holy Ghost is
    perfectly conscious of that perfect generation.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted are to be understood of
    God's eternal speaking, by which God the Father uttered the only-begotten
    and co-eternal Word. Nevertheless, it can be said that God uttered the same
    thing twice in a bodily voice, yet not for the same purpose, but in order to
    show the divers modes in which men can be partakers of the likeness of the
    eternal Sonship.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as in the Baptism, where the
    mystery of the first regeneration was proclaimed, the operation of the whole
    Trinity was made manifest, because the Son Incarnate was there, the Holy
    Ghost appeared under the form of a dove, and the Father made Himself known
    in the voice; so also in the transfiguration, which is the mystery of the
    second regeneration, the whole Trinity appears---the Father in the voice,
    the Son in the man, the Holy Ghost in the bright cloud; for just as in
    baptism He confers innocence, signified by the simplicity of the dove, so in
    the resurrection will He give His elect the clarity of glory and refreshment
    from all sorts of evil, which are signified by the bright cloud.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ came to give grace actually, and
    to promise glory by His words. Therefore it was fitting at the time of His
    transfiguration, and not at the time of His baptism, that men should be
    commanded to hear Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It was fitting that the disciples should
    be afraid and fall down on hearing the voice of the Father, to show that the
    glory which was then being revealed surpasses in excellence the sense and
    faculty of all mortal beings; according to Ex. 33:20: "Man shall not see Me
    and live." This is what Jerome says on Mt. 17:6: "Such is human frailty that
    it cannot bear to gaze on such great glory." But men are healed of this
    frailty by Christ when He brings them into glory. And this is signified by
    what He says to them: "Arise, and fear not."<br />
