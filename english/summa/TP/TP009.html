  <h3 align="center">OF CHRIST'S KNOWLEDGE IN GENERAL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider Christ's knowledge; concerning which the consideration
    will be twofold. First, of Christ's knowledge in general; secondly, of each
    particular kind of knowledge He had.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ had any knowledge
    besides the Divine?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He had the knowledge which
    the blessed or comprehensors have?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He had an imprinted or
    infused knowledge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He had any acquired
    knowledge?

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ had any knowledge besides the Divine?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was no
    knowledge except the Divine. For knowledge is necessary that things may be
    known thereby. But by His Divine knowledge Christ knew all things. Therefore
    any other knowledge would have been superfluous in Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the lesser light is dimmed by the
    greater. But all created knowledge in comparison with the uncreated
    knowledge of God is as the lesser to the greater light. Therefore there
    shone in Christ no other knowledge except the Divine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the union of the human nature with the
    Divine took place in the Person, as is clear from Question [2], Article [2].
    Now, according to some there is in Christ a certain "knowledge of the
    union," whereby Christ knew what belongs to the mystery of the Incarnation
    more fully than anyone else. Hence, since the personal union contains two
    natures, it would seem that there are not two knowledges in Christ, but one
    only, pertaining to both natures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Incarnat. vii): "God assumed
    the perfection of human nature in the flesh; He took upon Himself the sense
    of man, but not the swollen sense of the flesh." But created knowledge
    pertains to the sense of man. Therefore in Christ there was created
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As said above (<a href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"
      >Question [5]</a
    >), the Son of God assumed an entire human nature, i.e. not only a body, but
    also a soul, and not only a sensitive, but also a rational soul. And
    therefore it behooved Him to have created knowledge, for three reasons.
    First, on account of the soul's perfection. For the soul, considered in
    itself, is in potentiality to knowing intelligible things. since it is like
    "a tablet on which nothing is written," and yet it may be written upon
    through the possible intellect, whereby it may become all things, as is said
    De Anima iii, 18. Now what is in potentiality is imperfect unless reduced to
    act. But it was fitting that the Son of God should assume, not an imperfect,
    but a perfect human nature, since the whole human race was to be brought
    back to perfection by its means. Hence it behooved the soul of Christ to be
    perfected by a knowledge, which would be its proper perfection. And
    therefore it was necessary that there should be another knowledge in Christ
    besides the Divine knowledge, otherwise the soul of Christ would have been
    more imperfect than the souls of the rest of men. Secondly, because, since
    everything is on account of its operation, as stated De Coel. ii, 17, Christ
    would have had an intellective soul to no purpose if He had not understood
    by it; and this pertains to created knowledge. Thirdly, because some created
    knowledge pertains to the nature of the human soul, viz. that whereby we
    naturally know first principles; since we are here taking knowledge for any
    cognition of the human intellect. Now nothing natural was wanting to Christ,
    since He took the whole human nature, as stated above (<a
      href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"
      >Question [5]</a
    >). And hence the Sixth Council [*Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 4]
    condemned the opinion of those who denied that in Christ there are two
    knowledges or wisdoms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ knew all things with the Divine
    knowledge by an uncreated operation which is the very Essence of God; since
    God's understanding is His substance, as the Philosopher proves (Metaph.
    xii, text. 39). Hence this act could not belong to the human soul of Christ,
    seeing that it belongs to another nature. Therefore, if there had been no
    other knowledge in the soul of Christ, it would have known nothing; and thus
    it would have been assumed to no purpose, since everything is on account of
    its operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the two lights are supposed to be in
    the same order, the lesser is dimmed by the greater, as the light of the sun
    dims the light of a candle, both being in the class of illuminants. But if
    we suppose two lights, one of which is in the class of illuminants and the
    other in the class of illuminated, the lesser light is not dimmed by the
    greater, but rather is strengthened, as the light of the air by the light of
    the sun. And in this manner the light of knowledge is not dimmed, but rather
    is heightened in the soul of Christ by the light of the Divine knowledge,
    which is "the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this
    world," as is written Jn. 1:9.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> On the part of what are united we hold
    there is a knowledge in Christ, both as to His Divine and as to His human
    nature; so that, by reason of the union whereby there is one hypostasis of
    God and man, the things of God are attributed to man, and the things of man
    are attributed to God, as was said above (<a href="TP003.html#TPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="TP003.html#TPQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,6). But on the part of
    the union itself we cannot admit any knowledge in Christ. For this union is
    in personal being, and knowledge belongs to person only by reason of a
    nature.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ had the knowledge which the blessed or comprehensors have?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was not the
    knowledge of the blessed or comprehensors. For the knowledge of the blessed
    is a participation of Divine light, according to Ps. 35:10: "In Thy light we
    shall see light." Now Christ had not a participated light, but He had the
    Godhead Itself substantially abiding in Him, according to Col. 2:9: "For in
    Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally." Therefore in
    Christ there was not the knowledge of the blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the knowledge of the blessed makes them
    blessed, according to Jn. 17:3: "This is eternal life: that they may know
    Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent." But this Man
    was blessed through being united to God in person, according to Ps. 64:5:
    "Blessed is He Whom Thou hast chosen and taken to Thee." Therefore it is not
    necessary to suppose the knowledge of the blessed in Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to man belongs a double knowledge---one
    by nature, one above nature. Now the knowledge of the blessed, which
    consists in the vision of God, is not natural to man, but above his nature.
    But in Christ there was another and much higher supernatural knowledge, i.e.
    the Divine knowledge. Therefore there was no need of the knowledge of the
    blessed in Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The knowledge of the blessed consists in the
    knowledge of God. But He knew God fully, even as He was man, according to
    Jn. 8:55: "I do know Him, and do keep His word." Therefore in Christ there
    was the knowledge of the blessed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> What is in potentiality is reduced to act by
    what is in act; for that whereby things are heated must itself be hot. Now
    man is in potentiality to the knowledge of the blessed, which consists in
    the vision of God; and is ordained to it as to an end; since the rational
    creature is capable of that blessed knowledge, inasmuch as he is made in the
    image of God. Now men are brought to this end of beatitude by the humanity
    of Christ, according to Heb. 2:10: "For it became Him, for Whom are all
    things, and by Whom are all things, Who had brought many children unto
    glory, to perfect the author of their salvation by His passion." And hence
    it was necessary that the beatific knowledge, which consists in the vision
    of God, should belong to Christ pre-eminently, since the cause ought always
    to be more efficacious than the effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Godhead is united to the manhood of
    Christ in Person, not in essence or nature; yet with the unity of Person
    remains the distinction of natures. And therefore the soul of Christ, which
    is a part of human nature, through a light participated from the Divine
    Nature, is perfected with the beatific knowledge whereby it sees God in
    essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the union this Man is blessed with
    the uncreated beatitude, even as by the union He is God; yet besides the
    uncreated beatitude it was necessary that there should be in the human
    nature of Christ a created beatitude, whereby His soul was established in
    the last end of human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The beatific vision and knowledge are to
    some extent above the nature of the rational soul, inasmuch as it cannot
    reach it of its own strength; but in another way it is in accordance with
    its nature, inasmuch as it is capable of it by nature, having been made to
    the likeness of God, as stated above. But the uncreated knowledge is in
    every way above the nature of the human soul.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ had an imprinted or infused knowledge?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was not in Christ
    another infused knowledge besides the beatific knowledge. For all other
    knowledge compared to the beatific knowledge is like imperfect to perfect.
    But imperfect knowledge is removed by the presence of perfect knowledge, as
    the clear "face-to-face" vision removes the enigmatical vision of faith, as
    is plain from 1 Cor. 13:10,12. Since, therefore, in Christ there was the
    beatific knowledge, as stated above (<a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), it would seem that there could not be any other imprinted knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an imperfect mode of cognition disposes
    towards a more perfect, as opinion, the result of dialectical syllogisms,
    disposes towards science, which results from demonstrative syllogisms. Now,
    when perfection is reached, there is no further need of the disposition,
    even as on reaching the end motion is no longer necessary. Hence, since
    every created cognition is compared to beatific cognition, as imperfect to
    perfect and as disposition to its term, it seems that since Christ had
    beatific knowledge, it was not necessary for Him to have any other
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as corporeal matter is in potentiality
    to sensible forms, so the possible intellect is in potentiality to
    intelligible forms. Now corporeal matter cannot receive two forms at once!
    one more perfect and the other less perfect. Therefore neither can the soul
    receive a double knowledge at once, one more perfect and the other less
    perfect; and hence the same conclusion as above.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Col. 2:3) that in Christ "are
    hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP009.html#TPQ9A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it was fitting that the human nature assumed by the Word of God should
    not be imperfect. Now everything in potentiality is imperfect unless it be
    reduced to act. But the passive intellect of man is in potentiality to all
    intelligible things. and it is reduced to act by intelligible species, which
    are its completive forms, as is plain from what is said De Anima iii, 32,38.
    And hence we must admit in the soul of Christ an infused knowledge, inasmuch
    as the Word of God imprinted upon the soul of Christ, which is personally
    united to Him, intelligible species of all things to which the possible
    intellect is in potentiality; even as in the beginning of the creation of
    things, the Word of God imprinted intelligible species upon the angelic
    mind, as is clear from Augustine (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). And therefore, even
    as in the angels, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,24,30), there
    is a double knowledge---one the morning knowledge, whereby they know things
    in the Word; the other the evening knowledge, whereby they know things in
    their proper natures by infused species; so likewise, besides the Divine and
    uncreated knowledge in Christ, there is in His soul a beatific knowledge,
    whereby He knows the Word, and things in the Word; and an infused or
    imprinted knowledge, whereby He knows things in their proper nature by
    intelligible species proportioned to the human mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The imperfect vision of faith is
    essentially opposed to manifest vision, seeing that it is of the essence of
    faith to have reference to the unseen, as was said above (<a
      href="../SS.html"
      >SS</a
    >, <a href="../SS/SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../SS/SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But cognition by
    infused species includes no opposition to beatific cognition. Therefore
    there is no parity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Disposition is referred to perfection in
    two ways: first, as a way leading to perfection; secondly, as an effect
    proceeding from perfection; thus matter is disposed by heat to receive the
    form of fire, and, when this comes, the heat does not cease, but remains as
    an effect of this form. So, too, opinion caused by a dialectical syllogism
    is a way to knowledge, which is acquired by demonstration, yet, when this
    has been acquired, there may still remain the knowledge gained by the
    dialectical syllogism, following, so to say, the demonstrative knowledge,
    which is based on the cause, since he who knows the cause is thereby enabled
    the better to understand the probable signs from which dialectical
    syllogisms proceed. So likewise in Christ, together with the beatific
    knowledge, there still remains infused knowledge, not as a way to beatitude,
    but as strengthened by beatitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The beatific knowledge is not by a
    species, that is a similitude of the Divine Essence, or of whatever is known
    in the Divine Essence, as is plain from what has been said in the FP,
    Question [12], Article [2]; but it is a knowledge of the Divine Essence
    immediately, inasmuch as the Divine Essence itself is united to the
    beatified mind as an intelligible to an intelligent being; and the Divine
    Essence is a form exceeding the capacity of any creature whatsoever. Hence,
    together with this super-exceeding form, there is nothing to hinder from
    being in the rational mind, intelligible species, proportioned to its
    nature.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ had any acquired knowledge?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was no empiric
    and acquired knowledge. For whatever befitted Christ, He had most perfectly.
    Now Christ did not possess acquired knowledge most perfectly, since He did
    not devote Himself to the study of letters, by which knowledge is acquired
    in its perfection; for it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++7%3A15"
      >Jn. 7:15</a
    >): "The Jews wondered, saying: How doth this Man know letters, having never
    learned?" Therefore it seems that in Christ there was no acquired
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing can be added to what is full.
    But the power of Christ's soul was filled with intelligible species divinely
    infused, as was said above (A. 3). Therefore no acquired species could
    accrue to His soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he who already has the habit of
    knowledge, acquires no new habit, through what he receives from the senses
    (otherwise two forms of the same species would be in the same thing
    together); but the habit which previously existed is strengthened and
    increased. Therefore, since Christ had the habit of infused knowledge, it
    does not seem that He acquired a new knowledge through what He perceived by
    the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++5%3A8"
      >Heb. 5:8</a
    >): "Whereas... He was the Son of God, He learned obedience by the things
    which He suffered," i.e. "experienced," says a gloss. Therefore there was in
    the soul of Christ an empiric knowledge, which is acquired knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is plain from Article [1], nothing that God
    planted in our nature was wanting to the human nature assumed by the Word of
    God. Now it is manifest that God planted in human nature not only a passive,
    but an active intellect. Hence it is necessary to say that in the soul of
    Christ there was not merely a passive, but also an active intellect. But if
    in other things God and nature make nothing in vain, as the Philosopher says
    (De Coel. i, 31; ii, 59), still less in the soul of Christ is there anything
    in vain. Now what has not its proper operation is useless, as is said in De
    Coel. ii, 17. Now the proper operation of the active intellect is to make
    intelligible species in act, by abstracting them from phantasms; hence, it
    is said (De Anima iii, 18) that the active intellect is that "whereby
    everything is made actual." And thus it is necessary to say that in Christ
    there were intelligible species received in the passive intellect by the
    action of the active intellect---which means that there was acquired
    knowledge in Him, which some call empiric. And hence, although I wrote
    differently (Sent. iii, D, xiv,
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; D, xviii,
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it must be said that in
    Christ there was acquired knowledge, which is properly knowledge in a human
    fashion, both as regards the subject receiving and as regards the active
    cause. For such knowledge springs from Christ's active intellect, which is
    natural to the human soul. But infused knowledge is attributed to the soul,
    on account of a light infused from on high, and this manner of knowing is
    proportioned to the angelic nature. But the beatific knowledge, whereby the
    very Essence of God is seen, is proper and natural to God alone, as was said
    in the FP, Question [12], Article [4].<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since there is a twofold way of
    acquiring knowledge---by discovery and by being taught---the way of
    discovery is the higher, and the way of being taught is secondary. Hence it
    is said (Ethic. i, 4): "He indeed is the best who knows everything by
    himself: yet he is good who obeys him that speaks aright." And hence it was
    more fitting for Christ to possess a knowledge acquired by discovery than by
    being taught, especially since He was given to be the Teacher of all,
    according to Joel 2:23: "Be joyful in the Lord your God, because He hath
    given you a Teacher of justice."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The human mind has two relations---one
    to higher things, and in this respect the soul of Christ was full of the
    infused knowledge. The other relation is to lower things, i.e. to phantasms,
    which naturally move the human mind by virtue of the active intellect. Now
    it was necessary that even in this respect the soul of Christ should be
    filled with knowledge, not that the first fulness was insufficient for the
    human mind in itself, but that it behooved it to be also perfected with
    regard to phantasms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Acquired and infused habits are not to
    be classed together; for the habit of knowledge is acquired by the relation
    of the human mind to phantasms; hence, another habit of the same kind cannot
    be again acquired. But the habit of infused knowledge is of a different
    nature, as coming down to the soul from on high, and not from phantasms. And
    hence there is no parity between these habits.<br />
