<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not all sins are taken away by Baptism. For Baptism 
is a spiritual regeneration, which corresponds to  carnal generation. But 
by carnal generation man contracts none but original sin. Therefore none 
but original sin is taken away by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Penance is a sufficient cause of the remission of actual 
sins. But penance is required in adults before Baptism, according to Acts 
2:38: "Do penance and be baptized every one of you." Therefore Baptism 
has nothing to do with the remission of actual sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, various diseases demand various remedies: because as 
Jerome says on Mk. 9:27,28: "What is a cure for the heel is no cure for 
the eye." But original sin, which is taken away by Baptism, is 
generically distinct from actual sin. Therefore not all sins are taken 
away by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ezech. 36:25): "I will pour upon you 
clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A3">Rm. 6:3</a>), "all we, who are baptized 
in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death." And further on he concludes 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A11">Rm. 6:11</a>): "So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive 
unto God in Christ Jesus our Lord." Hence it is clear that by Baptism man 
dies unto the oldness of sin, and begins to live unto the newness of 
grace. But every sin belongs to the primitive oldness. Consequently every 
sin is taken away by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A15,16">Rm. 5:15,16</a>), the sin of Adam was not 
so far-reaching as the gift of Christ, which is bestowed in Baptism: "for 
judgment was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offenses, 
unto justification." Wherefore Augustine says in his book on Infant 
Baptism (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i), that "in carnal generation, 
original sin alone is contracted; but when we are born again of the 
Spirit, not only original sin but also wilful sin is forgiven."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No sin can be forgiven save by the power of Christ's 
Passion: hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++9%3A22">Heb. 9:22</a>) that "without shedding of 
blood there is no remission." Consequently no movement of the human will 
suffices for the remission of sin, unless there be faith in Christ's 
Passion, and the purpose of participating in it, either by receiving 
Baptism, or by submitting to the keys of the Church. Therefore when an 
adult approaches Baptism, he does indeed receive the forgiveness of all 
his sins through his purpose of being baptized, but more perfectly 
through the actual reception of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is true of special remedies. But Baptism 
operates by the power of Christ's Passion, which is the universal remedy 
for all sins; and so by Baptism all sins are loosed.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man is freed by Baptism from all debt of punishment due to sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that man is not freed by Baptism from all debt of 
punishment due to sin. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13%3A1">Rm. 13:1</a>): "Those things 
that are of God are well ordered [Vulg.: 'Those that are, are ordained of 
God']." But guilt is not set in order save by punishment, as Augustine 
says (Ep. cxl). Therefore Baptism does not take away the debt of 
punishment due to sins already committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the effect of a sacrament has a certain likeness to the 
sacrament itself; since the sacraments of the New Law "effect what they 
signify," as stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). But the washing of Baptism 
has indeed a certain likeness with the cleansing from the stain of sin, 
but none, seemingly, with the remission of the debt of punishment. 
Therefore the debt of punishment is not taken away by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when the debt of punishment has been remitted, a man no 
longer deserves to be punished, and so it would be unjust to punish him. 
If, therefore, the debt of punishment be remitted by Baptism, it would be 
unjust, after Baptism, to hang a thief who had committed murder before. 
Consequently the severity of human legislation would be relaxed on 
account of Baptism; which is undesirable. Therefore Baptism does not 
remit the debt of punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose, commenting on Rm. 11:29, "The gifts and the 
calling of God ate without repentance," says: "The grace of God in 
Baptism remits all, gratis."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4,5) by 
Baptism a man is incorporated in the Passion and death of Christ, 
according to Rm. 6:8: "If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we 
shall live also together with Christ." Hence it is clear that the Passion 
of Christ is communicated to every baptized person, so that he is healed 
just as if he himself had suffered and died. Now Christ's Passion, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), is a sufficient satisfaction for all the sins 
of all men. Consequently he who is baptized, is freed from the debt of 
all punishment due to him for his sins, just as if he himself had offered 
sufficient satisfaction for all his sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the pains of Christ's Passion are communicated to the 
person baptized, inasmuch as he is made a member of Christ, just as if he 
himself had borne those pains, his sins are set in order by the pains of 
Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Water not only cleanses but also refreshes. And thus by 
refreshing it signifies the remission of the debt of punishment, just as 
by cleansing it signifies the washing away of guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In punishments inflicted by a human tribunal, we have to 
consider not only what punishment a man deserves in respect of God, but 
also to what extent he is indebted to men who are hurt and scandalized by 
another's sin. Consequently, although a murderer is freed by Baptism from 
his debt of punishment in respect of God, he remains, nevertheless, in 
debt to men; and it is right that they should be edified at his 
punishment, since they were scandalized at his sin. But the sovereign may 
remit the penalty to such like out of kindness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Baptism should take away the penalties of sin that belong to this life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism should take away the penalties of sin that 
belong to this life. For as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A15">Rm. 5:15</a>), the gift of 
Christ is farther-reaching than the sin of Adam. But through Adam's sin, 
as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A12">Rm. 5:12</a>), "death entered into this world," and, 
consequently, all the other penalties of the present life. Much more, 
therefore, should man be freed from the penalties of the present life, by 
the gift of Christ which is received in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism takes away the guilt of both original and actual 
sin. Now it takes away the guilt of actual sin in such a way as to free 
man from all debt of punishment resulting therefrom. Therefore it also 
frees man from the penalties of the present life, which are a punishment 
of original sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the cause be removed, the effect is removed. But the 
cause of these penalties is original sin, which is taken away by Baptism. 
Therefore such like penalties should not remain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> on Rm. 6:6, "that the body of sin may be destroyed," a 
gloss says: "The effect of Baptism is that the old man is crucified, and 
the body of sin destroyed, not as though the living flesh of man were 
delivered by the destruction of that concupiscence with which it has been 
bespattered from its birth; but that it may not hurt him, when dead, 
though it was in him when he was born." Therefore for the same reason 
neither are the other penalties taken away by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Baptism has the power to take away the penalties of the 
present life yet it does not take them away during the present life, but 
by its power they will be taken away from the just in the resurrection 
when "this mortal hath put on immortality" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A54">1 Cor. 15:54</a>). And this is 
reasonable. First, because, by Baptism, man is incorporated in Christ, 
and is made His member, as stated above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Consequently 
it is fitting that what takes place in the Head should take place also in 
the member incorporated. Now, from the very beginning of His conception 
Christ was "full of grace and truth," yet He had a passible body, which 
through His Passion and death was raised up to a life of glory.  
Wherefore a Christian receives grace in Baptism, as to his soul; but he 
retains a passible body, so that he may suffer for Christ therein: yet at 
length he will be raised up to a life of impassibility. Hence the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A11">Rm. 8:11</a>): "He that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall 
quicken also our [Vulg.: 'your'] mortal bodies, because of His Spirit 
that dwelleth in us [Vulg.: 'you']": and further on in the same chapter 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A17">Rm. 8:17</a>): "Heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if 
we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified with Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this is suitable for our spiritual training: namely, in order 
that, by fighting against concupiscence and other defects to which he is 
subject, man may receive the crown of victory. Wherefore on Rm. 6:6, 
"that the body of sin may be destroyed," a gloss says: "If a man after 
Baptism live in the flesh, he has concupiscence to fight against, and to 
conquer by God's help." In sign of which it is written (Judges 3:1,2): 
"These are the nations which the Lord left, that by them He might 
instruct Israel . . . that afterwards their children might learn to fight 
with their enemies, and to be trained up to war."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this was suitable, lest men might seek to be baptized for the 
sake of impassibility in the present life, and not for the sake of the 
glory of life eternal. Wherefore the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A19">1 Cor. 15:19</a>): "If in 
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As a gloss says on Rm. 6:6, "that we may serve sin no 
longer---Like a man who, having captured a redoubtable enemy, slays him 
not forthwith, but suffers him to live for a little time in shame and 
suffering; so did Christ first of all fetter our punishment, but at a 
future time He will destroy it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the gloss says on the same passage (cf. ad 1), "the 
punishment of sin is twofold, the punishment of hell, and temporal 
punishment. Christ entirely abolished the punishment of hell, so that 
those who are baptized and truly repent, should not be subject to it. He 
did not, however, altogether abolish temporal punishment yet awhile; for 
hunger, thirst, and death still remain. But He overthrew its kingdom and 
power" in the sense that man should no longer be in fear of them: "and at 
length He will altogether exterminate it at the last day."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As we stated in the FS, Question [81], Article [1]; FS, Question [82], Article [1], ad 2 
original sin spread in this way, that at first the person infected the 
nature, and afterwards the nature infected the person. Whereas Christ in 
reverse order at first repairs what regards the person, and afterwards 
will simultaneously repair what pertains to the nature in all men. 
Consequently by Baptism He takes away from man forthwith the guilt of 
original sin and the punishment of being deprived of the heavenly vision. 
But the penalties of the present life, such as death, hunger, thirst, and 
the like, pertain to the nature, from the principles of which they arise, 
inasmuch as it is deprived of original justice. Therefore these defects 
will not be  taken away until the ultimate restoration of nature through 
the glorious resurrection.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether grace and virtues are bestowed on man by Baptism?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that grace and virtues are not bestowed on man by 
Baptism. Because, as stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), the sacraments of 
the New Law "effect what they signify." But the baptismal cleansing 
signifies the cleansing of the soul from guilt, and not the fashioning of 
the soul with grace and virtues. Therefore it seems that grace and 
virtues are not bestowed on man by Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one does not need to receive what one has already 
acquired. But some approach Baptism who have already grace and virtues: 
thus we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+10%3A1,2">Acts 10:1,2</a>): "There was a certain man in Cesarea, named 
Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band, a 
religious man and fearing God"; who, nevertheless, was afterwards 
baptized by Peter. Therefore grace and virtues are not bestowed by 
Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtue is a habit: which is defined as a "quality not 
easily removed, by which one may act easily and pleasurably." But after 
Baptism man retains proneness to evil which removes virtue; and 
experiences difficulty in doing good, in which the act of virtue 
consists. Therefore man does not acquire grace and virtue in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+3%3A5,6">Titus 3:5,6</a>): "He saved us by the 
laver of regeneration," i.e. by Baptism, "and renovation of the Holy 
Ghost, Whom He hath poured forth upon us abundantly," i.e. "unto the 
remission of sins and the fulness of virtues," as a gloss expounds. 
Therefore the grace of the Holy Ghost and the fulness of virtues are 
given in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says in the book on Infant Baptism (De Pecc. 
Merit. et Remiss. i) "the effect of Baptism is that the baptized are 
incorporated in Christ as His members." Now the fulness of grace and 
virtues flows from Christ the Head to all His members, according to Jn. 
1:16: "Of His fulness we all have received." Hence it is clear that man 
receives grace and virtues in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the baptismal water by its cleansing signifies the 
washing away of guilt, and by its refreshment the remission of 
punishment, so by its natural clearness it signifies the splendor of 
grace and virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) man receives the 
forgiveness of sins before Baptism in so far as he has Baptism of desire, 
explicitly or implicitly; and yet when he actually receives Baptism, he 
receives a fuller remission, as to the remission of the entire 
punishment. So also before Baptism  Cornelius and others like him receive 
grace and virtues through their faith in Christ and their desire for 
Baptism, implicit or explicit: but afterwards when baptized, they receive 
a yet greater fulness of grace and virtues. Hence in Ps. 22:2, "He hath 
brought me up on the water of refreshment," a gloss says: "He has brought 
us up by an increase of virtue and good deeds in Baptism."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Difficulty in doing good and proneness to evil are in the 
baptized, not through their lacking the habits of the virtues, but 
through concupiscence which is not taken away in Baptism. But just as 
concupiscence is diminished by Baptism, so as not to enslave us, so also 
are both the aforesaid defects diminished, so that man be not overcome by 
them.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that certain acts of the virtues are unfittingly set 
down as effects of Baptism, to wit---"incorporation in Christ, 
enlightenment, and fruitfulness." For Baptism is not given to an adult, 
except he believe; according to Mk. 16:16: "He that believeth and is 
baptized, shall be saved." But it is by faith that man is incorporated in 
Christ, according to Eph. 3:17: "That Christ may dwell by faith in your 
hearts." Therefore no one is baptized except he be already incorporated 
in Christ. Therefore incorporation with Christ is not the effect of 
Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, enlightenment is caused by teaching, according to Eph. 
3:8,9: "To me the least of all the saints, is given this grace . . . to 
enlighten all men," etc. But teaching by the catechism precedes Baptism. 
Therefore it is not the effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fruitfulness pertains to active generation. But a man is 
regenerated spiritually by Baptism. Therefore fruitfulness is not an 
effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in the book on Infant Baptism (De Pecc. 
Merit. et Remiss. i) that "the effect of Baptism is that the baptized are 
incorporated in Christ." And Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. ii) ascribes 
enlightenment to Baptism. And on Ps. 22:2, "He hath brought me up on the 
water of refreshment," a gloss says that "the sinner's soul, sterilized 
by drought, is made fruitful by Baptism."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By Baptism man is born again unto the spiritual life, 
which is proper to the faithful of Christ, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++2%3A20">Gal. 2:20</a>): "And that I live now in the flesh; I live in the faith of the Son 
of God." Now life is only in those members that are united to the head, 
from which they derive sense and movement. And therefore it follows of 
necessity that by Baptism man is  incorporated in Christ, as one of His 
members. Again, just as the members derive sense and movement from the 
material head, so from their spiritual Head, i.e. Christ, do His members 
derive spiritual sense consisting in the knowledge Of truth, and 
spiritual movement which results from the instinct of grace. Hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1%3A14,16">Jn. 1:14,16</a>): "We have seen Him . . . full of grace and truth; 
and of His fulness we all have received." And it follows from this that 
the baptized are enlightened by Christ as to the knowledge of truth, and 
made fruitful by Him with the fruitfulness of good works by the infusion 
of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Adults who already believe in Christ are incorporated in 
Him mentally. But afterwards, when they are baptized, they are 
incorporated in Him, corporally, as it were, i.e. by the visible 
sacrament; without the desire of which they could not have been 
incorporated in Him even mentally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The teacher enlightens outwardly and ministerially by 
catechizing: but God enlightens the baptized inwardly, by preparing their 
hearts for the reception of the doctrines of truth, according to Jn. 
6:45: "It is written in the prophets . . . They shall all be taught of 
God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fruitfulness which i ascribed as an effect of Baptism 
is that by which man brings forth good works; not that by which he begets 
others in Christ, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++4%3A15">1 Cor. 4:15</a>): "In Christ Jesus by 
the Gospel I have begotten you."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether children receive grace and virtue in Baptism?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that children do not receive grace and virtues in 
Baptism. For grace and virtues are not possessed without faith and 
charity. But faith, as Augustine says (Ep. xcviii), "depends on the will 
of the believer": and in like manner charity depends on the will of the 
lover. Now children have not the use of the will, and consequently they 
have neither faith nor charity. Therefore children do not receive grace 
and virtues in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on Jn. 14:12, "Greater than these shall he do," 
Augustine says that in order for the ungodly to be made righteous "Christ 
worketh in him, but not without him." But a child, through not having the 
use of free-will, does not co-operate with Christ unto its justification: 
indeed at times it does its best to resist. Therefore it is not justified 
by grace and virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++4%3A5">Rm. 4:5</a>): "To him that worketh not, yet 
believing in Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to 
justice according to the purpose of the grace of God." But a child 
believeth not "in Him that justifieth the ungodly." Therefore a child 
receives neither sanctifying grace nor virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is done with a carnal intention does not seem to 
have a spiritual effect. But sometimes children are taken  to Baptism 
with a carnal intention, to wit, that their bodies may be healed. 
Therefore they do not receive the spiritual effect consisting in grace 
and virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Enchiridion lii): "When little children 
are baptized, they die to that sin which they contracted in birth: so 
that to them also may be applied the words: 'We are buried together with 
Him by Baptism unto death'": (and he continues thus) "'that as Christ is 
risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in 
newness of life.'" Now newness of life is through grace and virtues. 
Therefore children receive grace and virtues in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some of the early writers held that children do not 
receive grace and virtues in Baptism, but that they receive the imprint 
of the character of Christ, by the power of which they receive grace and 
virtue when they arrive at the perfect age. But this is evidently false, 
for two reasons. First, because children, like adults, are made members 
of Christ in Baptism; hence they must, of necessity, receive an influx of 
grace and virtues from the Head. Secondly, because, if this were true, 
children that die after Baptism, would not come to eternal life; since 
according to Rm. 6:23, "the grace of God is life everlasting." And 
consequently Baptism would not have profited them unto salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the source of their error was that they did not recognize the 
distinction between habit and act. And so, seeing children to be 
incapable of acts of virtue, they thought that they had no virtues at all 
after Baptism. But this inability of children to act is not due to the 
absence of habits, but to an impediment on the part of the body: thus 
also when a man is asleep, though he may have the habits of virtue, yet 
is he hindered from virtuous acts through being asleep.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Faith and charity depend on man's will, yet so that the 
habits of these and other virtues require the power of the will which is 
in children; whereas acts of virtue require an act of the will, which is 
not in children. In this sense Augustine says in the book on Infant 
Baptism (Ep. xcviii): "The little child is made a believer, not as yet by 
that faith which depends on the will of the believer, but by the 
sacrament of faith itself," which causes the habit of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in his book on Charity (Ep. Joan. ad 
Parth. iii), "no man is born of water and the Holy Ghost unwillingly 
which is to be understood not of little children but of adults." In like 
manner we are to understand as applying to adults, that man "without 
himself is not justified by Christ." Moreover, if little children who are 
about to be baptized resist as much as they can, "this is not imputed to 
them, since so little do they know what they do, that they seem not to do 
it at all": as Augustine says in a book on the Presence of God, addressed 
to Dardanus (Ep. clxxxvii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Serm. clxxvi): "Mother Church lends 
other feet to the little children that they may come; another heart that 
they may believe; another tongue that they may confess." So that children 
believe, not by their own act, but by the faith of the Church, which is 
applied to them: by the power of which faith, grace and virtues are 
bestowed on them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The carnal intention of those who take children to be 
baptized does not hurt the latter, as neither does one's sin hurt 
another, unless he consent. Hence Augustine says in his letter to 
Boniface (Ep. xcviii): "Be not disturbed because some bring children to 
be baptized, not in the hope that they may be born again to eternal life 
by the spiritual grace, but because they think it to be a remedy whereby 
they may preserve or recover health. For they are not deprived of 
regeneration, through not being brought for this intention."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it is not the effect of Baptism, to open the gates 
of the heavenly kingdom. For what is already opened needs no opening. But 
the gates of the heavenly kingdom were opened by Christ's Passion: hence 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++4%3A1">Apoc. 4:1</a>): "After these things I looked and behold (a 
great) door was opened in heaven." Therefore it is not the effect of 
Baptism, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism has had its effects ever since it was 
instituted. But some were baptized with Christ's Baptism, before His 
Passion, according to Jn. 3:22,26: and if they had died then, the gates 
of the heavenly kingdom would not have been opened to them, since none 
entered therein before Christ, according to Mic. 2:13: "He went up 
[Vulg.: 'shall go up'] that shall open the way before them." Therefore it 
is not the effect of Baptism, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the baptized are still subject to death and the other 
penalties of the present life, as stated above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But entrance to 
the heavenly kingdom is opened to none that are subject to punishment: as 
is clear in regard to those who are in purgatory. Therefore it is not the 
effect of Baptism, to open the gates of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> on Lk. 3:21, "Heaven was opened," the gloss of Bede 
says: "We see here the power of Baptism; from which when a man comes 
forth, the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened unto him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To open the gates of the heavenly kingdom is to remove 
the obstacle that prevents one from entering therein. Now this obstacle 
is guilt and the debt of punishment. But it has been shown above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) that all guilt and also all debt of punishment  are taken away by 
Baptism. It follows, therefore, that the effect of Baptism is to open the 
gates of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Baptism opens the gates of the heavenly kingdom to the 
baptized in so far as it incorporates them in the Passion of Christ, by 
applying its power to man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When Christ's Passion was not as yet consummated actually 
but only in the faith of believers, Baptism proportionately caused the 
gates to be opened, not in fact but in hope. For the baptized who died 
then looked forward, with a sure hope, to enter the heavenly kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The baptized are subject to death and the penalties of the 
present life, not by reason of a personal debt of punishment but by 
reason of the state of their nature. And therefore this is no bar to 
their entrance to the heavenly kingdom, when death severs the soul from 
the body; since they have paid, as it were, the debt of nature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Baptism has an equal effect in all?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism has not an equal effect in all. For the 
effect of Baptism is to remove guilt. But in some it takes away more sins 
than in others; for in children it takes away only original sins, whereas 
in adults it takes away actual sins, in some many, in others few. 
Therefore Baptism has not an equal effect in all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, grace and virtues are bestowed on man by Baptism. But 
some, after Baptism, seem to have more grace and more perfect virtue than 
others who have been baptized. Therefore Baptism has not an equal effect 
in all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nature is perfected by grace, as matter by form. But a 
form is received into matter according to its capacity. Therefore, since 
some of the baptized, even children, have greater capacity for natural 
gifts than others have, it seems that some receive greater grace than 
others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in Baptism some receive not only spiritual, but also 
bodily health; thus Constantine was cleansed in Baptism from leprosy. But 
all the infirm do not receive bodily health in Baptism. Therefore it has 
not an equal effect in all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++4%3A5">Eph. 4:5</a>): "One Faith, one Baptism." But 
a uniform cause has a uniform effect. Therefore Baptism has an equal 
effect in all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of Baptism is twofold, the essential effect, 
and the accidental. The essential effect of Baptism is that for which 
Baptism was instituted, namely, the begetting of men unto spiritual life. 
Therefore, since all children are equally disposed  to Baptism, because 
they are baptized not in their own faith, but in that of the Church, they 
all receive an equal effect in Baptism. Whereas adults, who approach 
Baptism in their own faith, are not equally disposed to Baptism; for some 
approach thereto with greater, some with less, devotion. And therefore 
some receive a greater, some a smaller share of the grace of newness; 
just as from the same fire, he receives more heat who approaches nearest 
to it, although the fire, as far as it is concerned, sends forth its heat 
equally to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the accidental effect of Baptism, is that to which Baptism is not 
ordained, but which the Divine power produces miraculously in Baptism: 
thus on Rm. 6:6, "that we may serve sin no longer," a gloss says: "this 
is not bestowed in Baptism, save by an ineffable miracle of the Creator, 
so that the law of sin, which is in our members, be absolutely 
destroyed." And such like effects are not equally received by all the 
baptized, even if they approach with equal devotion: but they are 
bestowed according to the ordering of Divine providence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The least baptismal grace suffices to blot out all sins. 
Wherefore that in some more sins are loosed than in others is not due to 
the greater efficacy of Baptism, but to the condition of the recipient: 
for in each one it looses whatever it finds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That greater or lesser grace appears in the baptized, may 
occur in two ways. First, because one receives greater grace in Baptism 
than another, on account of his greater devotion, as stated above. 
Secondly, because, though they receive equal grace, they do not make an 
equal use of it, but one applies himself more to advance therein, while 
another by his negligence baffles grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The various degrees of capacity in men arise, not from a 
variety in the mind which is renewed by Baptism (since all men, being of 
one species, are of one form), but from the diversity of bodies. But it 
is otherwise with the angels, who differ in species. And therefore 
gratuitous gifts are bestowed on the angels according to their diverse 
capacity for natural gifts, but not on men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Bodily health is not the essential effect of Baptism, but a

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that insincerity does not hinder the effect of Baptism. 
For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A27">Gal. 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been baptized 
in Christ Jesus, have put on Christ." But all that receive the Baptism of 
Christ, are baptized in Christ. Therefore they all put on Christ: and 
this is to receive the effect of Baptism. Consequently insincerity does 
not hinder the effect of  Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Divine power which can change man's will to that 
which is better, works in Baptism. But the effect of the efficient cause 
cannot be hindered by that which can be removed by that cause. Therefore 
insincerity cannot hinder the effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the effect of Baptism is grace, to which sin is in 
opposition. But many other sins are more grievous than insincerity, which 
are not said to hinder the effect of Baptism. Therefore neither does 
insincerity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 1:5): "The Holy Spirit of 
discipline will flee from the deceitful." But the effect of Baptism is 
from the Holy Ghost. Therefore insincerity hinders the effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii), "God does not 
compel man to be righteous." Consequently in order that a man be 
justified by Baptism, his will must needs embrace both Baptism and the 
baptismal effect. Now, a man is said to be insincere by reason of his 
will being in contradiction with either Baptism or its effect. For, 
according to Augustine (De Bapt. cont. Donat. vii), a man is said to be 
insincere, in four ways: first, because he does not believe, whereas 
Baptism is the sacrament of Faith; secondly, through scorning the 
sacrament itself; thirdly, through observing a rite which differs from 
that prescribed by the Church in conferring the sacrament; fourthly, 
through approaching the sacrament without devotion. Wherefore it is 
manifest that insincerity hinders the effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "To be baptized in Christ," may be taken in two ways. 
First, "in Christ," i.e. "in conformity with Christ." And thus whoever is 
baptized in Christ so as to be conformed to Him by Faith and Charity, 
puts on Christ by grace. Secondly, a man is said to be baptized in 
Christ, in so far as he receives Christ's sacrament. And thus all put on 
Christ, through being configured to Him by the character, but not through 
being conformed to Him by grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When God changes man's will from evil to good, man does not 
approach with insincerity. But God does not always do this. Nor is this 
the purpose of the sacrament, that an insincere man be made sincere; but 
that he who comes in sincerity, be justified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man is said to be insincere who makes a show of willing 
what he wills not. Now whoever approaches Baptism, by that very fact 
makes a show of having right faith in Christ, of veneration for this 
sacrament, and of wishing to conform to the Church, and to renounce sin. 
Consequently, to whatever sin a man wishes to cleave, if he approach 
Baptism, he approaches insincerely, which is the same as to approach 
without devotion. But  this must be understood of mortal sin, which is in 
opposition to grace: but not of venial sin. Consequently, here 
insincerity includes, in a way, every sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Baptism produces its effect when the insincerity ceases?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism does not produce its effect, when the 
insincerity ceases. For a dead work, which is void of charity, can never 
come to life. But he who approaches Baptism insincerely, receives the 
sacrament without charity. Therefore it can never come to life so as to 
bestow grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, insincerity seems to be stronger than Baptism, because 
it hinders its effect. But the stronger is not removed by the weaker. 
Therefore the sin of insincerity cannot be taken away by Baptism which 
has been hindered by insincerity. And thus Baptism will not receive its 
full effect, which is the remission of all sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man approach Baptism insincerely, 
and afterwards commit a number of sins. And yet these sins will not be 
taken away by Baptism; because Baptism washes away past, not future, 
sins. Such a Baptism, therefore, will never have its effect, which is the 
remission of all sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Bapt. cont. Donat. i): "Then does 
Baptism begin to have its salutary effect, when truthful confession takes 
the place of that insincerity which hindered sins from being washed away, 
so long as the heart persisted in malice and sacrilege."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), Baptism is a spiritual 
regeneration. Now when a thing is generated, it receives together with 
the form, the form's effect, unless there be an obstacle; and when this 
is removed, the form of the thing generated produces its effect: thus at 
the same time as a weighty body is generated, it has a downward movement, 
unless something prevent this; and when the obstacle is removed, it 
begins forthwith to move downwards. In like manner when a man is 
baptized, he receives the character, which is like a form; and he 
receives in consequence its proper effect, which is grace whereby all his 
sins are remitted. But this effect is sometimes hindered by insincerity. 
Wherefore, when this obstacle is removed by Penance, Baptism forthwith 
produces its effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is the work of God, not of man. 
Consequently, it is not dead in the man, who being insincere, is baptized 
without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Insincerity is not removed by Baptism but by Penance: and 
when it is removed, Baptism takes away all guilt, and all debt of 
punishment due to sins, whether committed before Baptism, or even 
co-existent with Baptism. Hence Augustine says (De  Bapt. cont. Donat. 
i): "Yesterday is blotted out, and whatever remains over and above, even 
the very last hour and moment preceding Baptism, the very moment of 
Baptism. But from that moment forward he is bound by his obligations." 
And so both Baptism and Penance concur in producing the effect of 
Baptism, but Baptism as the direct efficient cause, Penance as the 
indirect cause, i.e. as removing the obstacle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[69] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The effect of Baptism is to take away not future, but 
present and past sins. And consequently, when the insincerity passes 
away, subsequent sins are indeed remitted, but by Penance, not by 
Baptism. Wherefore they are not remitted, like the sins which preceded 
Baptism, as to the whole debt of punishment.<br>
