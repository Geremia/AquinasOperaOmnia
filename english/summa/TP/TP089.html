<H3 Align="Center">OF THE RECOVERY OF VIRTUE BY MEANS OF PENANCE (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the recovery of virtues by means of Penance, under 
which head there are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether virtues are restored through Penance?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether they are restored in equal measure?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether equal dignity is restored to the penitent?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether works of virtue are deadened by subsequent sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether works deadened by sin revive through Penance?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether dead works, i.e. works that are done without charity, are 
quickened by Penance?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the virtues are not restored through penance. 
Because lost virtue cannot be restored by penance, unless penance be the 
cause of virtue. But, since penance is itself a virtue, it cannot be the 
cause of all the virtues, and all the more, since some virtues naturally 
precede penance, viz., faith, hope, and charity, as stated above (<A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore the virtues are not restored through penance.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Penance consists in certain acts of the penitent. But 
the gratuitous virtues are not caused through any act of ours: for 
Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18: In Ps. 118) that "God forms the 
virtues in us without us." Therefore it seems that  the virtues are not 
restored through Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he that has virtue performs works of virtue with ease 
and pleasure: wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 8) that "a man is 
not just if he does not rejoice in just deeds." Now many penitents find 
difficulty in performing deeds of virtue. Therefore the virtues are not 
restored through Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++15%3A22">Lk. 15:22</a>) that the father commanded his 
penitent son to be clothed in "the first robe," which, according to 
Ambrose (Expos. in Luc. vii), is the "mantle of wisdom," from which all 
the virtues flow together, according to Wis. 8:7: "She teacheth 
temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such 
things as men can have nothing more profitable in life." Therefore all 
the virtues are restored through Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sins are pardoned through Penance, as stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But there can be no remission of sins except through the 
infusion of grace. Wherefore it follows that grace is infused into man 
through Penance. Now all the gratuitous virtues flow from grace, even as 
all the powers result from the essence of the soul; as stated in the FS, 
Question [110], Article [4], ad 1. Therefore all the virtues are restored through 
Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Penance restores the virtues in the same way as it causes 
grace, as stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now it is a cause of grace, in so 
far as it is a sacrament, because, in so far as it is a virtue, it is 
rather an effect of grace. Consequently it does not follow that penance, 
as a virtue, needs to be the cause of all the other virtues, but that the 
habit of penance together with the habits of the other virtues is caused 
through the sacrament of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the sacrament of Penance human acts stand as matter, 
while the formal power of this sacrament is derived from the power of the 
keys. Consequently the power of the keys causes grace and virtue 
effectively indeed, but instrumentally; and the first act of the 
penitent, viz., contrition, stands as ultimate disposition to the 
reception of grace, while the subsequent acts of Penance proceed from the 
grace and virtues which are already there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), sometimes after the first 
act of Penance, which is contrition, certain remnants of sin remain, viz. 
dispositions caused by previous acts, the result being that the penitent 
finds difficulty in doing deeds of virtue. Nevertheless, so far as the 
inclination itself of charity and of the other virtues is concerned, the 
penitent performs works of virtue with pleasure and ease. even as a 
virtuous man may accidentally find it hard to do an act of virtue, on 
account of sleepiness or some indisposition of the body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether, after Penance, man rises again to equal virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that, after Penance, man rises again to equal 
virtue. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A28">Rm. 8:28</a>): "To them that love God all 
things work together unto good," whereupon a gloss of Augustine says that 
"this is so true that, if any such man goes astray and wanders from the 
path, God makes even this conduce to his good." But this would not be 
true if he rose again to lesser virtue. Therefore it seems that a 
penitent never rises again to lesser virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says [*Cf. Hypognosticon iii, an anonymous work 
falsely ascribed to St. Augustine] that "Penance is a very good thing, 
for it restores every defect to a state of perfection." But this would 
not be true unless virtues were recovered in equal measure. Therefore 
equal virtue is always recovered through Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on Gn. 1:5: "There was evening and morning, one day," a 
gloss says: "The evening light is that from which we fall the morning 
light is that to which we rise again." Now the morning light is greater 
than the evening light. Therefore a man rises to greater grace or charity 
than that which he had before; which is confirmed by the Apostle's words 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A20">Rm. 5:20</a>): "Where sin abounded, grace did more abound."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Charity whether proficient or perfect is greater than 
incipient charity. But sometimes a man falls from proficient charity, and 
rises again to incipient charity. Therefore man always rises again to 
less virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>, <A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), 
the movement of the free-will, in the justification of the ungodly, is 
the ultimate disposition to grace; so that in the same instant there is 
infusion of grace together with the aforesaid movement of the free-will, 
as stated in the FS, Question [113], Articles [5],7, which movement includes an act of 
penance, as stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But it is evident that forms 
which admit of being more or less, become intense or remiss, according to 
the different dispositions of the subject, as stated in the FS, Question [52], 
Articles [1],2; FS, Question [66], Article [1]. Hence it is that, in Penance, according to the 
degree of intensity or remissness in the movement of the free-will, the 
penitent receives greater or lesser grace. Now the intensity of the 
penitent's movement may be proportionate sometimes to a greater grace 
than that from which man fell by sinning, sometimes to an equal grace, 
sometimes to a lesser. Wherefore the penitent sometimes arises to a 
greater grace than that which he had before, sometimes to an equal, 
sometimes to a lesser grace: and the same applies to the virtues, which 
flow from grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The very fact of falling away from the love of God by sin, 
does not work unto the good of all those who love God, which is evident 
in the case of those who fall and never rise again, or who rise and fall 
yet again; but only to the good of "such as according to His purpose are 
called to be saints," viz. the predestined, who, however often they may 
fall, yet rise again  finally. Consequently good comes of their falling, 
not that they always rise again to greater grace, but that they rise to 
more abiding grace, not indeed on the part of grace itself, because the 
greater the grace, the more abiding it is, but on the part of man, who, 
the more careful and humble he is, abides the more steadfastly in grace. 
Hence the same gloss adds that "their fall conduces to their good, 
because they rise more humble and more enlightened."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Penance, considered in itself, has the power to bring all 
defects back to perfection, and even to advance man to a higher state; 
but this is sometimes hindered on the part of man, whose movement towards 
God and in detestation of sin is too remiss, just as in Baptism adults 
receive a greater or a lesser grace, according to the various ways in 
which they prepare themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This comparison of the two graces to the evening and 
morning light is made on account of a likeness of order, since the 
darkness of night follows after the evening light, and the light of day 
after the light of morning, but not on account of a likeness of greater 
or lesser quantity. Again, this saying of the Apostle refers to the grace 
of Christ, which abounds more than any number of man's sins. Nor is it 
true of all, that the more their sins abound, the more abundant grace 
they receive, if we measure habitual grace by the quantity. Grace is, 
however, more abundant, as regards the very notion of grace, because to 
him who sins more a more "gratuitous" favor is vouchsafed by his pardon; 
although sometimes those whose sins abound, abound also in sorrow, so 
that they receive a more abundant habit of grace and virtue, as was the 
case with Magdalen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the argument advanced in the contrary sense it must be replied that 
in one and the same man proficient grace is greater than incipient grace, 
but this is not necessarily the case in different men, for one begins 
with a greater grace than another has in the state of proficiency: thus 
Gregory says (Dial. ii, 1): "Let all, both now and hereafter, acknowledge 
how perfectly the boy Benedict turned to the life of grace from the very 
beginning."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether, by Penance, man is restored to his former dignity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man is not restored by Penance to his former 
dignity: because a gloss on Amos 5:2, "The virgin of Israel is cast 
down," observes: "It is not said that she cannot rise up, but that the 
virgin of Israel shall not rise; because the sheep that has once strayed, 
although the shepherd bring it back on his shoulder, has not the same 
glory as if it had never strayed." Therefore man does not, through 
Penance, recover his former dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Jerome says: "Whoever fail to preserve the dignity of 
the sacred order, must be content with saving their souls; for it is a 
difficult thing to return to their former degree." Again, Pope Innocent I 
says (Ep. vi ad Agapit.) that "the  canons framed at the council of 
Nicaea exclude penitents from even the lowest orders of clerics." 
Therefore man does not, through Penance, recover his former dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, before sinning a man can advance to a higher sacred 
order. But this is not permitted to a penitent after his sin, for it is 
written (Ezech. 44:10,13): "The Levites that went away . . . from Me . . 
. shall never [Vulg.: 'not'] come near to Me, to do the office of 
priest": and as laid down in the Decretals (Dist. 1, ch. 52), and taken 
from the council of Lerida: "If those who serve at the Holy Altar fall 
suddenly into some deplorable weakness of the flesh, and by God's mercy 
do proper penance, let them return to their duties, yet so as not to 
receive further promotion." Therefore Penance does not restore man to his 
former dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As we read in the same Distinction, Gregory writing to 
Secundinus (Regist. vii) says: "We consider that when a man has made 
proper satisfaction, he may return to his honorable position": and 
moreover we read in the acts of the council of Agde: "Contumacious 
clerics, so far as their position allows, should be corrected by their 
bishops. so that when Penance has reformed them, they may recover their 
degree and dignity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By sin, man loses a twofold dignity, one in respect of 
God, the other in respect of the Church. In respect of God he again loses 
a twofold dignity. one is his principal dignity, whereby he was counted 
among the children of God, and this he recovers by Penance, which is 
signified (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++15">Lk. 15</a>) in the prodigal son, for when he repented, his father 
commanded that the first garment should be restored to him, together with 
a ring and shoes. The other is his secondary dignity, viz. innocence, of 
which, as we read in the same chapter, the elder son boasted saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++15%3A29">Lk. 15:29</a>): "Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never 
transgressed thy commandments": and this dignity the penitent cannot 
recover. Nevertheless he recovers something greater sometimes; because as 
Gregory says (Hom. de centum Ovibus, 34 in Evang.), "those who 
acknowledge themselves to have strayed away from God, make up for their 
past losses, by subsequent gains: so that there is more joy in heaven on 
their account, even as in battle, the commanding officer thinks more of 
the soldier who, after running away, returns and bravely attacks the foe, 
than of one who has never turned his back, but has done nothing brave."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; By sin man loses his ecclesiastical dignity, because thereby he becomes 
unworthy of those things which appertain to the exercise of the 
ecclesiastical dignity. This he is debarred from recovering: first, 
because he fails to repent; wherefore Isidore wrote to the bishop Masso, 
and as we read in the Distinction quoted above (Objection [3]): "The canons 
order those to be restored to their former degree, who by repentance have 
made satisfaction for their sins, or have made worthy confession of them. 
On the other hand, those who do not mend their corrupt and wicked ways 
are neither allowed to exercise their order, nor received to the grace of 
communion." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because he does penance negligently, wherefore it is written 
in the same Distinction (OBJ 3): "We can be sure that those who show no 
signs of humble compunction, or of earnest prayer, who avoid fasting or 
study, would exercise their former duties with great negligence if they 
were restored to them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if he has committed a sin to which an irregularity is attached; 
wherefore it is said in the same Distinction (Objection [3]), quoting the 
council of Pope Martin [*Martin, bishop of Braga]: "If a man marry a 
widow or the relict of another, he must not be admitted to the ranks of 
the clergy: and if he has succeeded in creeping in, he must be turned 
out. In like manner, if anyone after Baptism be guilty of homicide, 
whether by deed, or by command, or by counsel, or in self-defense." But 
this is in consequence not of sin, but of irregularity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, on account of scandal, wherefore it is said in the same 
Distinction (Objection [3]): "Those who have been publicly convicted or caught 
in the act of perjury, robbery, fornication, and of such like crimes, 
according to the prescription of the sacred canons must be deprived of 
the exercise of their respective orders, because it is a scandal to God's 
people that such persons should be placed over them. But those who commit 
such sins occultly and confess them secretly to a priest, may be retained 
in the exercise of their respective orders, with the assurance of God's 
merciful forgiveness, provided they be careful to expiate their sins by 
fasts and alms, vigils and holy deeds." The same is expressed (Extra, De 
Qual. Ordinand.): "If the aforesaid crimes are not proved by a judicial 
process, or in some other way made notorious, those who are guilty of 
them must not be hindered, after they have done penance, from exercising 
the orders they have received, or from receiving further orders, except 
in cases of homicide."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The same is to be said of the recovery of virginity as of 
the recovery of innocence which belongs to man's secondary dignity in the 
sight of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In these words Jerome does not say that it is impossible, 
but that it is difficult, for man to recover his former dignity after 
having sinned, because this is allowed to none but those who repent 
perfectly, as stated above. To those canonical statutes, which seem to 
forbid this, Augustine replies in his letter to Boniface (Ep. clxxxv): 
"If the law of the Church forbids anyone, after doing penance for a 
crime, to become a cleric, or to return to his clerical duties, or to 
retain them the intention was not to deprive him of the hope of pardon, 
but to preserve the rigor of discipline; else we should have to deny the 
keys given to the Church, of which it was said: 'Whatsoever you shall 
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.'" And further on he adds: "For 
holy David did penance for his deadly crimes, and yet he retained his 
dignity; and Blessed Peter by shedding most bitter tears did indeed 
repent him of having denied his Lord, and yet he remained an apostle. 
Nevertheless we must not deem the care of later teachers  excessive, who 
without endangering a man's salvation, exacted more from his humility, 
having, in my opinion, found by experience, that some assumed a pretended 
repentance through hankering after honors and power."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This statute is to be understood as applying to those who 
do public penance, for these cannot be promoted to a higher order. For 
Peter, after his denial, was made shepherd of Christ's sheep, as appears 
from Jn. 21:21, where Chrysostom comments as follows: "After his denial 
and repentance Peter gives proof of greater confidence in Christ: for 
whereas, at the supper, he durst not ask Him, but deputed John to ask in 
his stead, afterwards he was placed at the head of his brethren, and not 
only did not depute another to ask for him, what concerned him, but 
henceforth asks the Master instead of John."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virtuous deeds done in charity cannot be 
deadened. For that which is not cannot be changed. But to be deadened is 
to be changed from life to death. Since therefore virtuous deeds, after 
being done, are no more, it seems that they cannot afterwards be deadened.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by virtuous deeds done in charity, man merits eternal 
life. But to take away the reward from one who has merited it is an 
injustice, which cannot be ascribed to God. Therefore it is not possible 
for virtuous deeds done in charity to be deadened by a subsequent sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the strong is not corrupted by the weak. Now works of 
charity are stronger than any sins, because, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++10%3A12">Prov. 10:12</a>), "charity covereth all sins." Therefore it seems that deeds done 
in charity cannot be deadened by a subsequent mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ezech. 18:24): "If the just man turn 
himself away from his justice . . . all his justices which he hath done 
shall not be remembered."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A living thing, by dying, ceases to have vital 
operations: for which reason, by a kind of metaphor, a thing is said to 
be deadened when it is hindered from producing its proper effect or 
operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the effect of virtuous works, which are done in charity, is to bring 
man to eternal life; and this is hindered by a subsequent mortal sin, 
inasmuch as it takes away grace. Wherefore deeds done in charity are said 
to be deadened by a subsequent mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as sinful deeds pass as to the act but remain as to 
guilt, so deeds done in charity, after passing, as to  the act, remain as 
to merit, in so far as they are acceptable to God. It is in this respect 
that they are deadened, inasmuch as man is hindered from receiving his 
reward.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no injustice in withdrawing the reward from him 
who has deserved it, if he has made himself unworthy by his subsequent 
fault, since at times a man justly forfeits through his own fault, even 
that which he has already received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not on account of the strength of sinful deeds that 
deeds, previously done in charity, are deadened, but on account of the 
freedom of the will which can be turned away from good to evil.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether deeds deadened by sin, are revived by Penance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that deeds deadened by sin are not revived by 
Penance. Because just as past sins are remitted by subsequent Penance, so 
are deeds previously done in charity, deadened by subsequent sin. But 
sins remitted by Penance do not return, as stated above (<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88OUTP1">Question [88]</a>, <A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). 
Therefore it seems that neither are dead deeds revived by charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, deeds are said to be deadened by comparison with animals 
who die, as stated above (<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But a dead animal cannot be revived. 
Therefore neither can dead works be revived by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, deeds done in charity are deserving of glory according 
to the quantity of grace or charity. But sometimes man arises through 
Penance to lesser grace or charity. Therefore he does not receive glory 
according to the merit of his previous works; so that it seems that deeds 
deadened by sin are not revived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> on Joel 2:25, "I will restore to you the years, which 
the locust . . . hath eaten," a gloss says: "I will not suffer to perish 
the fruit which you lost when your soul was disturbed." But this fruit is 
the merit of good works which was lost through sin. Therefore meritorious 
deeds done before are revived by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that meritorious works deadened by 
subsequent sin are not revived by the ensuing Penance, because they 
deemed such works to have passed away, so that they could not be revived. 
But that is no reason why they should not be revived: because they are 
conducive to eternal life (wherein their life consists) not only as 
actually existing, but also after they cease to exist actually, and as 
abiding in the Divine acceptance. Now, they abide thus, so far as they 
are concerned, even after they have been deadened by sin, because those 
works, according as they were done, will ever be acceptable to God and 
give joy to the saints, according to Apoc. 3:11: "Hold fast that which 
thou hast, that no man take thy crown." That they fail in their efficacy 
to bring the  man, who did them, to eternal life, is due to the 
impediment of the supervening sin whereby he is become unworthy of 
eternal life. But this impediment is removed by Penance, inasmuch as sins 
are taken away thereby. Hence it follows that deeds previously deadened, 
recover, through Penance, their efficacy in bringing him, who did them, 
to eternal life, and, in other words, they are revived. It is therefore 
evident that deadened works are revived by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The very works themselves of sin are removed by Penance, so 
that, by God's mercy, no further stain or debt of punishment is incurred 
on their account: on the other hand, works done in charity are not 
removed by God, since they abide in His acceptance, but they are hindered 
on the part of the man who does them; wherefore if this hindrance, on the 
part of the man who does those works, be removed, God on His side 
fulfills what those works deserved.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Deeds done in charity are not in themselves deadened, as 
explained above, but only with regard to a supervening impediment on the 
part of the man who does them. On the other hand, an animal dies in 
itself, through being deprived of the principle of life: so that the 
comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who, through Penance, arises to lesser charity, will 
receive the essential reward according to the degree of charity in which 
he is found. Yet he will have greater joy for the works he had done in 
his former charity, than for those which he did in his subsequent 
charity: and this joy belongs to the accidental reward.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the effect of subsequent Penance is to quicken even dead works?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the effect of subsequent Penance is to quicken 
even dead works, those, namely, that were not done in charity. For it 
seems more difficult to bring to life that which has been deadened, since 
this is never done naturally, than to quicken that which never had life, 
since certain living things are engendered naturally from things without 
life. Now deadened works are revived by Penance, as stated above (<A Href="TP089.html#TPQ89A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). 
Much more, therefore, are dead works revived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if the cause be removed, the effect is removed. But the 
cause of the lack of life in works generically good done without charity, 
was the lack of charity and grace. which lack is removed by Penance. 
Therefore dead works are quickened by charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome in commenting on Agg. i, 6: "You have sowed 
much," says: "If at any time you find a sinner, among his many evil 
deeds, doing that which is right, God is not so unjust as to forget the 
few good deeds on account of his many evil deeds." Now this seems to be 
the case chiefly when past evil "deeds" are  removed by Penance. 
Therefore it seems that through Penance, God rewards the former deeds 
done in the state of sin, which implies that they are quickened.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A3">1 Cor. 13:3</a>): "If I should distribute 
all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be 
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." But this would 
not be true, if, at least by subsequent Penance, they were quickened. 
Therefore Penance does not quicken works which before were dead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A work is said to be dead in two ways: first, 
effectively, because, to wit, it is a cause of death, in which sense 
sinful works are said to be dead, according to Heb. 9:14: "The blood of 
Christ . . . shall cleanse our conscience from dead works." These dead 
works are not quickened but removed by Penance, according to Heb. 6:1: 
"Not laying again the foundation of Penance from dead works." Secondly, 
works are said to be dead privatively, because, to wit, they lack 
spiritual life, which is founded on charity, whereby the soul is united 
to God, the result being that it is quickened as the body by the soul: in 
which sense too, faith, if it lack charity, is said to be dead, according 
to James 2:20: "Faith without works is dead." In this way also, all works 
that are generically good, are said to be dead, if they be done without 
charity, inasmuch as they fail to proceed from the principle of life; 
even as we might call the sound of a harp, a dead voice. Accordingly, the 
difference of life and death in works is in relation to the principle 
from which they proceed. But works cannot proceed a second time from a 
principle, because they are transitory, and the same identical deed 
cannot be resumed. Therefore it is impossible for dead works to be 
quickened by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the physical order things whether dead or deadened lack 
the principle of life. But works are said to be deadened, not in relation 
to the principle whence they proceeded, but in relation to an extrinsic 
impediment; while they are said to be dead in relation to a principle. 
Consequently there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Works generically good done without charity are said to be 
dead on account of the lack of grace and charity, as principles. Now the 
subsequent Penance does not supply that want, so as to make them proceed 
from such a principle. Hence the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[89] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God remembers the good deeds a man does when in a state of 
sin, not by rewarding them in eternal life, which is due only to living 
works, i.e. those done from charity, but by a temporal reward: thus 
Gregory declares (Hom. de Divite et Lazaro, 41 in Evang.) that "unless 
that rich man had done some good deed, and had received his reward in 
this world, Abraham would certainly not have said to him: 'Thou didst 
receive good things in thy lifetime.'" Or again, this may mean that he 
will be judged less  severely: wherefore Augustine says (De Patientia 
xxvi): "We cannot say that it would be better for the schismatic that by 
denying Christ he should suffer none of those things which he suffered by 
confessing Him; but we must believe that he will be judged with less 
severity, than if by denying Christ, he had suffered none of those 
things. Thus the words of the Apostle, 'If I should deliver my body to be 
burned and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing,' refer to the 
obtaining of the kingdom of heaven, and do not exclude the possibility of 
being sentenced with less severity at the last judgment."<br>
