</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider unity as regards the will; and under this head 
there are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the Divine will and the human are distinct in Christ?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in Christ's human nature the will of sensuality is distinct 
from the will of reason?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether as regards the reason there were several wills in Christ?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether there was free-will in Christ?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether Christ's human will was always conformed to the Divine will 
in the thing willed?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether there was any contrariety of wills in Christ?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there are not two wills, one Divine, 
the other human. For the will is the first mover and first commander in 
whoever wills. But in Christ the first mover and  commander was the 
Divine will, since in Christ everything human was moved by the Divine 
will. Hence it seems that in Christ there was only one will, viz. the 
Divine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an instrument is not moved by its own will but by the 
will of its mover. Now the human nature of Christ was the instrument of 
His Godhead. Hence the human nature of Christ was not moved by its own 
will, but by the Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that alone is multiplied in Christ which belongs to the 
nature. But the will does not seem to pertain to nature: for natural 
things are of necessity; whereas what is voluntary is not of necessity. 
Therefore there is but one will in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) that "to will in 
this or that way belongs not to our nature but to our intellect," i.e. 
our personal intellect. But every will is this or that will, since there 
is nothing in a genus which is not at the same time in some one of its 
species. Therefore all will belongs to the person. But in Christ there 
was and is but one person. Therefore in Christ there is only one will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++22:42">Lk. 22:42</a>): "Father, if Thou wilt, 
remove this chalice from Me. But yet not My will but Thine be done." And 
Ambrose, quoting this to the Emperor Gratian (De Fide ii, 7) says: "As He 
assumed my will, He assumed my sorrow;" and on Lk. 22:42 he says: "His 
will, He refers to the Man---the Father's, to the Godhead. For the will 
of man is temporal, and the will of the Godhead eternal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some placed only one will in Christ; but they seem to 
have had different motives for holding this. For Apollinaris did not hold 
an intellectual soul in Christ, but maintained that the Word was in place 
of the soul, or even in place of the intellect. Hence since "the will is 
in the reason," as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 9), it followed 
that in Christ there was no human will; and thus there was only one will 
in Him. So, too, Eutyches and all who held one composite nature in Christ 
were forced to place one will in Him. Nestorius, too, who maintained that 
the union of God and man was one of affection and will, held only one 
will in Christ. But later on, Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch, Cyrus of 
Alexandria, and Sergius of Constantinople and some of their followers, 
held that there is one will in Christ, although they held that in Christ 
there are two natures united in a hypostasis; because they believed that 
Christ's human nature never moved with its own motion, but only inasmuch 
as it was moved by the Godhead, as is plain from the synodical letter of 
Pope Agatho [*Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 4].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And hence in the sixth Council held at Constantinople [*Act. 18] it was 
decreed that it must be said that there are two wills in Christ, in the 
following passage: "In accordance with what the Prophets of old taught us 
concerning Christ, and as He taught us  Himself, and the Symbol of the 
Holy Fathers has handed down to us, we confess two natural wills in Him 
and two natural operations." And this much it was necessary to say. For 
it is manifest that the Son of God assumed a perfect human nature, as was 
shown above (<A Href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>; <A Href="TP009.html#TPQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="TP009.html#TPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the will pertains to the perfection 
of human nature, being one of its natural powers, even as the intellect, 
as was stated in the FP, Questions [79],80. Hence we must say that the Son of God 
assumed a human will, together with human nature. Now by the assumption 
of human nature the Son of God suffered no diminution of what pertains to 
His Divine Nature, to which it belongs to have a will, as was said in the 
FP, Question [19], Article [1]. Hence it must be said that there are two wills in 
Christ, i.e. one human, the other Divine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Whatever was in the human nature of Christ was moved at the 
bidding of the Divine will; yet it does not follow that in Christ there 
was no movement of the will proper to human nature, for the good wills of 
other saints are moved by God's will, "Who worketh" in them "both to will 
and to accomplish," as is written Phil. 2:13. For although the will 
cannot be inwardly moved by any creature, yet it can be moved inwardly by 
God, as was said in the FP, Question [105], Article [4]. And thus, too, Christ by His 
human will followed the Divine will according to Ps. 39:9; "That I should 
do Thy will, O my God, I have desired it." Hence Augustine says (Contra 
Maxim. ii, 20): "Where the Son says to the Father, 'Not what I will, but 
what Thou willest,' what do you gain by adding your own words and saying 
'He shows that His will was truly subject to His Father,' as if we denied 
that man's will ought to be subject to God's will?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is proper to an instrument to be moved by the principal 
agent, yet diversely, according to the property of its nature. For an 
inanimate instrument, as an axe or a saw, is moved by the craftsman with 
only a corporeal movement; but an instrument animated by a sensitive soul 
is moved by the sensitive appetite, as a horse by its rider; and an 
instrument animated with a rational soul is moved by its will, as by the 
command of his lord the servant is moved to act, the servant being like 
an animate instrument, as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2,4; Ethic. 
viii, 11). And hence it was in this manner that the human nature of 
Christ was the instrument of the Godhead, and was moved by its own will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of the will is natural, and necessarily follows 
upon the nature; but the movement or act of this power---which is also 
called will---is sometimes natural and necessary, e.g. with respect to 
beatitude; and sometimes springs from free-will and is neither necessary 
nor natural, as is plain from what has been stated in the FS, Question [10], 
Articles [1],[2] [*Cf. FP, Question [82], Article [2]]. And yet even reason itself, which is 
the principle of this movement, is natural. Hence besides the Divine will 
it is necessary to place in Christ a human will, not merely as a natural 
power, or a natural movement, but even as a rational movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When we say "to will in a certain way," we  signify a 
determinate mode of willing. Now a determinate mode regards the thing of 
which it is the mode. Hence since the will pertains to the nature, "to 
will in a certain way" belongs to the nature, not indeed considered 
absolutely, but as it is in the hypostasis. Hence the human will of 
Christ had a determinate mode from the fact of being in a Divine 
hypostasis, i.e. it was always moved in accordance with the bidding of 
the Divine will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in Christ there was a will of sensuality besides the will of reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was no will of sensuality 
besides the will of reason. For the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 
42) that "the will is in the reason, and in the sensitive appetite are 
the irascible and concupiscible parts." Now sensuality signifies the 
sensitive appetite. Hence in Christ there was no will of sensuality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12,13) the 
sensuality is signified by the serpent. But there was nothing 
serpent-like in Christ; for He had the likeness of a venomous animal 
without the venom, as Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 32). 
Hence in Christ there was no will of sensuality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, will is consequent upon nature, as was said (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But 
in Christ there was only one nature besides the Divine. Hence in Christ 
there was only one human will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Fide ii, 7): "Mine is the will which 
He calls His own; because as Man He assumed my sorrow." From this we are 
given to understand that sorrow pertains to the human will of Christ. Now 
sorrow pertains to the sensuality, as was said in the FS, Question [23], Article [1]; 
FS, Question [25], Article [1]. Therefore, seemingly, in Christ there is a will of 
sensuality besides the will of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said (<A Href="TP009.html#TPQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="TP009.html#TPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the Son of God assumed human 
nature together with everything pertaining to the perfection of human 
nature. Now in human nature is included animal nature, as the genus in 
its species. Hence the Son of God must have assumed together with the 
human nature whatever belongs to animal nature; one of which things is 
the sensitive appetite, which is called the sensuality. Consequently it 
must be allowed that in Christ there was a sensual appetite, or 
sensuality. But it must be borne in mind that sensuality or the sensual 
appetite, inasmuch as it naturally obeys reason, is said to be "rational 
by participation," as is clear from the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 13). And 
because "the will is in the reason," as stated above, it may equally be 
said that the sensuality is "a will by participation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is based on the will, essentially so called, 
which is only in the intellectual part; but the will by participation can 
be in the sensitive part, inasmuch as it obeys reason. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sensuality is signified by the serpent---not as regards 
the nature of the sensuality, which Christ assumed, but as regards the 
corruption of the "fomes," which was not in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Where there is one thing on account of another, there 
seems to be only one" (Aristotle, Topic. iii); thus a surface which is 
visible by color is one visible thing with the color. So, too, because 
the sensuality is called the will, only because it partakes of the 
rational will, there is said to be but one human will in Christ, even as 
there is but one human nature.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there were two wills as regards the 
reason. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that there is a double 
will in man, viz. the natural will which is called {thelesis}, and the 
rational will which is called {boulesis}. Now Christ in His human nature 
had whatever belongs to the perfection of human nature. Hence both the 
foregoing wills were in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the appetitive power is diversified in man by the 
difference of the apprehensive power, and hence according to the 
difference of sense and intellect is the difference of sensitive and 
intellective appetite in man. But in the same way as regards man's 
apprehension, we hold the difference of reason and intellect; both of 
which were in Christ. Therefore there was a double will in Him, one 
intellectual and the other rational.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some [*Hugh of St. Victor, De Quat. Volunt. Christ.] 
ascribe to Christ "a will of piety," which can only be on the part of 
reason. Therefore in Christ on the part of reason there are several wills.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In every order there is one first mover. But the will 
is the first mover in the genus of human acts. Therefore in one man there 
is only one will, properly speaking, which is the will of reason. But 
Christ is one man. Therefore in Christ there is only one human will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), the will is sometimes taken 
for the power, and sometimes for the act. Hence if the will is taken for 
the act, it is necessary to place two wills, i.e. two species of acts of 
the will in Christ on the part of the reason. For the will, as was said 
in the FS, Question [8], Articles [2],3, regards both the end and the means; and is 
affected differently towards both. For towards the end it is borne simply 
and absolutely, as towards what is good in itself; but towards the means 
it is borne under a certain relation, as the goodness of the means 
depends on something else. Hence the act of the will, inasmuch as it is 
drawn to anything desired of itself, as health, which act is called by 
Damascene {thelesis}---i.e. simple will, and by the masters "will  as 
nature," is different from the act of the will as it is drawn to anything 
that is desired only in order to something else, as to take medicine; and 
this act of the will Damascene calls {boulesis}---i.e. counseling will, 
and the masters, "will as reason." But this diversity of acts does not 
diversify the power, since both acts regard the one common ratio of the 
object, which is goodness. Hence we must say that if we are speaking of 
the power of the will, in Christ there is but one human will, essentially 
so called and not by participation; but if we are speaking of the will as 
an act, we thus distinguish in Christ a will as nature, which is called 
{thelesis}, and a will as reason, which is called {boulesis}.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These two wills do not diversify the power but only the 
act, as we have said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The intellect and the reason are not distinct powers, as 
was said in the FP, Question [79], Article [8].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The "will of piety" would not seem to be distinct from the 
will considered as nature, inasmuch as it shrinks from another's evil, 
absolutely considered.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there was free-will in Christ?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was no free-will. For 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 14) that {gnome}, i.e. opinion, 
thinking or cogitation, and {proairesis}, i.e. choice, "cannot possibly 
be attributed to our Lord, if we wish to speak with propriety." But in 
the things of faith especially we must speak with propriety. Therefore 
there was no choice in Christ and consequently no free-will, of which 
choice is the act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) that choice is "a 
desire of something after taking counsel." Now counsel does not appear to 
be in Christ, because we do not take counsel concerning such things as we 
are certain of. But Christ was certain of everything. Hence there was no 
counsel and consequently no free-will in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, free-will is indifferent. But Christ's will was 
determined to good, since He could not sin; as stated above (<A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Hence there was no free-will in Christ.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++7:15">Is. 7:15</a>): "He shall eat butter and 
honey, that He may know to refuse the evil and to choose the good," which 
is an act of the free-will. Therefore there was free-will in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), there was a twofold act of the 
will in Christ; one whereby He was drawn to anything willed in itself, 
which implies the nature of an end; the other whereby His will was drawn 
to anything willed on account of its being  ordained to another---which 
pertains to the nature of means. Now, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. 
iii, 2) choice differs from will in this, that will of itself regards the 
end, while choice regards the means. And thus simple will is the same as 
the "will as nature"; but choice is the same as the "will as reason," and 
is the proper act of free-will, as was said in the FP, Question [83], Article [3]. 
Hence, since "will as reason" is placed in Christ, we must also place 
choice, and consequently free-will, whose act is choice, as was said in 
the FP, Question [83], Article [3]; FS, Question [13], Article [1].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene excludes choice from Christ, in so far as he 
considers that doubt is implied in the word choice. Nevertheless doubt is 
not necessary to choice, since it belongs even to God Himself to choose, 
according to Eph. 1:4: "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the 
world," although in God there is no doubt. Yet doubt is accidental to 
choice when it is in an ignorant nature. We may also say the same of 
whatever else is mentioned in the passage quoted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Choice presupposes counsel; yet it follows counsel only as 
determined by judgment. For what we judge to be done, we choose, after 
the inquiry of counsel, as is stated (Ethic. iii, 2,3). Hence if anything 
is judged necessary to be done, without any preceding doubt or inquiry, 
this suffices for choice. Therefore it is plain that doubt or inquiry 
belong to choice not essentially, but only when it is in an ignorant 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The will of Christ, though determined to good, is not 
determined to this or that good. Hence it pertains to Christ, even as to 
the blessed, to choose with a free-will confirmed in good.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the human will of Christ was altogether conformed to the Divine will in the thing willed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human will in Christ did not will anything 
except what God willed. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++39:9">Ps. 39:9</a>) in the person of 
Christ: "That I should do Thy will: O my God, I have desired it." Now he 
who desires to do another's will, wills what the other wills. Hence it 
seems that Christ's human will willed nothing but what was willed by His 
Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's soul had most perfect charity, which, indeed, 
surpasses the comprehension of all our knowledge, according to Eph. 3:19, 
"the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge." Now charity 
makes men will what God wills; hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 4) 
that one mark of friendship is "to will and choose the same." Therefore 
the human will in Christ willed nothing else than was willed by His 
Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ was a true comprehensor. But the Saints who are 
comprehensors in heaven will only what God wills, otherwise they would 
not be happy, because they would not obtain whatever  they will, for 
"blessed is he who has what he wills, and wills nothing amiss," as 
Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 5). Hence in His human will Christ wills 
nothing else than does the Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Maxim. ii, 20): "When Christ 
says 'Not what I will, but what Thou wilt' He shows Himself to have 
willed something else than did His Father; and this could only have been 
by His human heart, since He did not transfigure our weakness into His 
Divine but into His human will."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3), in Christ according to His human 
nature there is a twofold will, viz. the will of sensuality, which is 
called will by participation, and the rational will, whether considered 
after the manner of nature, or after the manner of reason. Now it was 
said above (<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2) that by a certain 
dispensation the Son of God before His Passion "allowed His flesh to do 
and suffer what belonged to it." And in like manner He allowed all the 
powers of His soul to do what belonged to them. Now it is clear that the 
will of sensuality naturally shrinks from sensible pains and bodily hurt. 
In like manner, the will as nature turns from what is against nature and 
what is evil in itself, as death and the like; yet the will as reason may 
at time choose these things in relation to an end, as in a mere man the 
sensuality and the will absolutely considered shrink from burning, which, 
nevertheless, the will as reason may choose for the sake of health. Now 
it was the will of God that Christ should undergo pain, suffering, and 
death, not that these of themselves were willed by God, but for the sake 
of man's salvation. Hence it is plain that in His will of sensuality and 
in His rational will considered as nature, Christ could will what God did 
not; but in His will as reason He always willed the same as God, which 
appears from what He says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++26:39">Mt. 26:39</a>): "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt." 
For He willed in His reason that the Divine will should be fulfilled 
although He said that He willed something else by another will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By His rational will Christ willed the Divine will to be 
fulfilled; but not by His will of sensuality, the movement of which does 
not extend to the will of God---nor by His will considered as nature 
which regards things absolutely considered and not in relation to the 
Divine will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The conformity of the human will to the Divine regards the 
will of reason: according to which the wills even of friends agree, 
inasmuch as reason considers something willed in its relation to the will 
of a friend.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ was at once comprehensor and wayfarer, inasmuch as 
He was enjoying God in His mind and had a passible body. Hence things 
repugnant to His natural will and to His sensitive appetite could happen 
to Him in His passible flesh.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there was contrariety of wills in Christ? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was contrariety of wills in Christ. For 
contrariety of wills regards contrariety of objects, as contrariety of 
movements springs from contrariety of termini, as is plain from the 
Philosopher (Phys. v, text. 49, seq.). Now Christ in His different wills 
wished contrary things. For in His Divine will He wished for death, from 
which He shrank in His human will, hence Athanasius says [*De Incarnat. 
et Cont. Arianos, written against Apollinarius]: "When Christ says 
'Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from Me; yet not My 
will, but Thine be done,' and again, 'The spirit indeed is willing, but 
the flesh weak,' He denotes two wills---the human, which through the 
weakness of the flesh shrank from the passion---and His Divine will eager 
for the passion." Hence there was contrariety of wills in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++5:17">Gal. 5:17</a>) that "the flesh lusteth 
against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh." Now when the 
spirit desires one thing, and the flesh another, there is contrariety of 
wills. But this was in Christ; for by the will of charity which the Holy 
Spirit was causing in His mind, He willed the passion, according to Is. 
53:7: "He was offered because it was His own will," yet in His flesh He 
shrank from the passion. Therefore there was contrariety of wills in Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++22:43">Lk. 22:43</a>) that "being in an agony, He 
prayed the longer." Now agony seems to imply a certain struggle [*Greek, 
{agonia}] in a soul drawn to contrary things. Hence it seems that there 
was contrariety of will in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In the decisions of the Sixth Council [*Third Council 
of Constantinople, Act. 18] it is said: "We confess two natural wills, 
not in opposition, as evil-minded heretics assert, but following His 
human will, and neither withstanding nor striving against, but rather 
being subject to, His Divine and omnipotent will."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Contrariety can exist only where there is opposition in 
the same and as regards the same. For if the diversity exists as regards 
diverse things, and in diverse subjects, this would not suffice for the 
nature of contrariety, nor even for the nature of contradiction, e.g. if 
a man were well formed or healthy as regards his hand, but not as regards 
his foot. Hence for there to be contrariety of wills in anyone it is 
necessary, first, that the diversity of wills should regard the same. For 
if the will of one regards the doing of something with reference to some 
universal reason, and the will of another regards the not doing the same 
with reference to some particular reason, there is not complete 
contrariety of will, e.g. when a judge wishes a brigand to be hanged for 
the good of the commonwealth, and one of the latter's kindred wishes him 
not to be hanged on account of a private love, there is no contrariety of 
wills; unless, indeed, the desire of the private good went so far as to 
wish to hinder the public good for the private good---in that case the 
opposition of wills would regard the same. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, for contrariety of wills it is necessary that it should be in 
the same will. For if a man wishes one thing with his rational appetite, 
and wishes another thing with his sensitive appetite, there is no 
contrariety, unless the sensitive appetite so far prevailed as to change 
or at least keep back the rational appetite; for in this case something 
of the contrary movement of the sensitive appetite would reach the 
rational will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And hence it must be said that although the natural and the sensitive 
will in Christ wished what the Divine will did not wish, yet there was no 
contrariety of wills in Him. First, because neither the natural will nor 
the will of sensuality rejected the reason for which the Divine will and 
the will of the human reason in Christ wished the passion. For the 
absolute will of Christ wished the salvation of the human race, although 
it did not pertain to it to will this for the sake of something further; 
but the movement of sensuality could nowise extend so far. Secondly, 
because neither the Divine will nor the will of reason in Christ was 
impeded or retarded by the natural will or the appetite of sensuality. 
So, too, on the other hand, neither the Divine will nor the will of 
reason in Christ shrank from or retarded the movement of the natural 
human will and the movement of the sensuality in Christ. For it pleased 
Christ, in His Divine will, and in His will of reason, that His natural 
will and will of sensuality should be moved according to the order of 
their nature. Hence it is clear that in Christ there was no opposition or 
contrariety of wills.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fact of any will in Christ willing something else than 
did the Divine will, proceeded from the Divine will, by whose permission 
the human nature in Christ was moved by its proper movements, as 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15,18,19).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In us the desires of the spirit are impeded or retarded by 
the desires of the flesh: this did not occur in Christ. Hence in Christ 
there was no contrariety of flesh and spirit, as in us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[18] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The agony in Christ was not in the rational soul, in as far 
as it implies a struggle in the will arising from a diversity of motives, 
as when anyone, on his reason considering one, wishes one thing, and on 
its considering another, wishes the contrary. For this springs from the 
weakness of the reason, which is unable to judge which is the best 
simply. Now this did not occur in Christ, since by His reason He judged 
it best that the Divine will regarding the salvation of the human race 
should be fulfilled by His passion. Nevertheless, there was an agony in 
Christ as regards the sensitive part, inasmuch as it implied a dread of 
coming trial, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15; iii, 18,23).<br>
