<H3 Align="Center">OF THE MATTER OF THIS SACRAMENT (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the matter of this sacrament: and first of all 
as to its species; secondly, the change of the bread and wine into the 
body of Christ; thirdly, the manner in which Christ's body exists in this 
sacrament; fourthly, the accidents of bread and wine which continue in 
this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first heading there are eight points for inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether bread and wine are the matter of this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a determinate quantity of the same is required for the 
matter of this sacrament?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the matter of this sacrament is wheaten bread?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is unleavened or fermented bread?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the matter of this sacrament is wine from the grape?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether water should be mixed with it?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether water is of necessity for this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of the quantity of the water added.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the matter of this sacrament is not bread and wine. 
Because this sacrament ought to represent Christ's Passion more fully 
than did the sacraments of the Old Law. But the flesh of animals, which 
was the matter of the sacraments under the Old Law, shows forth Christ's 
Passion more fully than bread and wine. Therefore the matter of this 
sacrament ought rather to be the flesh of animals than bread and wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is to be celebrated in every  place. But 
in many lands bread is not to be found, and in many places wine is not to 
be found. Therefore bread and wine are not a suitable matter for this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is for both hale and weak. But to some 
weak persons wine is hurtful. Therefore it seems that wine ought not to 
be the matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Alexander I says (Ep. ad omnes orth. i): "In 
oblations of the sacraments only bread and wine mixed with water are to 
be offered."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have fallen into various errors about the matter of 
this sacrament. Some, known as the Artotyrytae, as Augustine says (De 
Haeres. xxviii), "offer bread and cheese in this sacrament, contending 
that oblations were celebrated by men in the first ages, from fruits of 
the earth and sheep." Others, called Cataphrygae and Pepuziani, "are 
reputed to have made their Eucharistic bread with infants' blood drawn 
from tiny punctures over the entire body, and mixed with flour." Others, 
styled Aquarii, under guise of sobriety, offer nothing but water in this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all these and similar errors are excluded by the fact that Christ 
instituted this sacrament under the species of bread and wine, as is 
evident from Mt. 26. Consequently, bread and wine are the proper matter 
of this sacrament. And the reasonableness of this is seen first, in the 
use of this sacrament, which is eating: for, as water is used in the 
sacrament of Baptism for the purpose of spiritual cleansing, since bodily 
cleansing is commonly done with water; so bread and wine, wherewith men 
are commonly fed, are employed in this sacrament for the use of spiritual 
eating.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in relation to Christ's Passion, in which the blood was 
separated from the body. And therefore in this sacrament, which is the 
memorial of our Lord's Passion, the bread is received apart as the 
sacrament of the body, and the wine as the sacrament of the blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, as to the effect, considered in each of the partakers. For, as 
Ambrose (Mag. Sent. iv, D, xi) says on 1 Cor. 11:20, this sacrament 
"avails for the defense of soul and body"; and therefore "Christ's body 
is offered" under the species of bread "for the health of the body, and 
the blood" under the species of wine "for the health of the soul," 
according to Lev. 17:14: "The life of the animal [Vulg.: 'of all flesh'] 
is in the blood."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, as to the effect with regard to the whole Church, which is 
made up of many believers, just "as bread is composed of many grains, and 
wine flows from many grapes," as the gloss observes on 1 Cor. 10:17: "We 
being many are . . . one body," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the flesh of slaughtered animals represents the 
Passion more forcibly, nevertheless it is less  suitable for the common 
use of this sacrament, and for denoting the unity of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although wheat and wine are not produced in every country, 
yet they can easily be conveyed to every land, that is, as much as is 
needful for the use of this sacrament: at the same time one is not to be 
consecrated when the other is lacking, because it would not be a complete 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Wine taken in small quantity cannot do the sick much harm: 
yet if there be fear of harm, it is not necessary for all who take 
Christ's body to partake also of His blood, as will be stated later 
(<A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a determinate quantity of bread and wine is required for the matter of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a determinate quantity of bread and wine is 
required for the matter of this sacrament. Because the effects of grace 
are no less set in order than those of nature. But, "there is a limit set 
by nature upon all existing things, and a reckoning of size and 
development" (De Anima ii). Consequently, in this sacrament, which is 
called "Eucharist," that is, "a good grace," a determinate quantity of 
the bread and wine is required.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ gave no power to the ministers of the Church 
regarding matters which involve derision of the faith and of His 
sacraments, according to 2 Cor. 10:8: "Of our power which the Lord hath 
given us unto edification, and not for your destruction." But it would 
lead to mockery of this sacrament if the priest were to wish to 
consecrate all the bread which is sold in the market and all the wine in 
the cellar. Therefore he cannot do this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if anyone be baptized in the sea, the entire sea-water 
is not sanctified by the form of baptism, but only the water wherewith 
the body of the baptized is cleansed. Therefore, neither in this 
sacrament can a superfluous quantity of bread be consecrated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Much is opposed to little, and great to small. But 
there is no quantity, however small, of the bread and wine which cannot 
be consecrated. Therefore, neither is there any quantity, however great, 
which cannot be consecrated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have maintained that the priest could not consecrate 
an immense quantity of bread and wine, for instance, all the bread in the 
market or all the wine in a cask. But this does not appear to be true, 
because in all things containing matter, the reason for the determination 
of the matter is drawn from its disposition to an end, just as the matter 
of a saw is iron, so as to adapt it for cutting. But the end of this 
sacrament is the use of the faithful. Consequently, the quantity of the 
matter of this sacrament must be determined by comparison with the use of 
the  faithful. But this cannot be determined by comparison with the use 
of the faithful who are actually present; otherwise the parish priest 
having few parishioners could not consecrate many hosts. It remains, 
then, for the matter of this sacrament to be determined in reference to 
the number of the faithful absolutely. But the number of the faithful is 
not a determinate one. Hence it cannot be said that the quantity of the 
matter of this sacrament is restricted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The matter of every natural object has its determinate 
quantity by comparison with its determinate form. But the number of the 
faithful, for whose use this sacrament is ordained, is not a determinate 
one. Consequently there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The power of the Church's ministers is ordained for two 
purposes: first for the proper effect, and secondly for the end of the 
effect. But the second does not take away the first. Hence, if the priest 
intends to consecrate the body of Christ for an evil purpose, for 
instance, to make mockery of it, or to administer poison through it, he 
commits sin by his evil intention, nevertheless, on account of the power 
committed to him, he accomplishes the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is perfected in the use of the 
matter: and therefore no more of the water is hallowed than what is used. 
But this sacrament is wrought in the consecration of the matter. 
Consequently there is no parallel.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether wheaten bread is required for the matter of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that wheaten bread is not requisite for the matter of 
this sacrament, because this sacrament is a reminder of our Lord's 
Passion. But barley bread seems to be more in keeping with the Passion 
than wheaten bread, as being more bitter, and because Christ used it to 
feed the multitudes upon the mountain, as narrated in Jn. 6. Therefore 
wheaten bread is not the proper matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in natural things the shape is a sign of species. But 
some cereals resemble wheat, such as spelt and maize, from which in some 
localities bread is made for the use of this sacrament. Therefore wheaten 
bread is not the proper matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, mixing dissolves species. But wheaten flour is hardly to 
be found unmixed with some other species of grain, except in the instance 
of specially selected grain. Therefore it does not seem that wheaten 
bread is the proper matter for this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is corrupted appears to be of another species. But 
some make the sacrament from bread which is corrupted, and which no 
longer seems to be wheaten bread. Therefore, it seems that such bread is 
not the proper matter of this sacrament. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Christ is contained in this sacrament, and He compares 
Himself to a grain of wheat, saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++12%3A24">Jn. 12:24</a>): "Unless the grain of 
wheat falling into the ground die, itself remaineth alone." Therefore 
bread from corn, i.e. wheaten bread, is the matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), for the use of the sacraments 
such matter is adopted as is commonly made use of among men. Now among 
other breads wheaten bread is more commonly used by men; since other 
breads seem to be employed when this fails. And consequently Christ is 
believed to have instituted this sacrament under this species of bread. 
Moreover this bread strengthens man, and so it denotes more suitably the 
effect of this sacrament. Consequently, the proper matter for this 
sacrament is wheaten bread.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Barley bread serves to denote the hardness of the Old Law; 
both on account of the hardness of the bread, and because, as Augustine 
says (<A Href="TP083.html#TPQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>): "The flour within the barley, wrapped up as it is within a 
most tenacious fibre, denotes either the Law itself, which was given in 
such manner as to be vested in bodily sacraments; or else it denotes the 
people themselves, who were not yet despoiled of carnal desires, which 
clung to their hearts like fibre." But this sacrament belongs to Christ's 
"sweet yoke," and to the truth already manifested, and to a spiritual 
people. Consequently barley bread would not be a suitable matter for this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A begetter begets a thing like to itself in species. yet 
there is some unlikeness as to the accidents, owing either to the matter, 
or to weakness within the generative power. And therefore, if there be 
any cereals which can be grown from the seed of the wheat (as wild wheat 
from wheat seed grown in bad ground), the bread made from such grain can 
be the matter of this sacrament: and this does not obtain either in 
barley, or in spelt, or even in maize, which is of all grains the one 
most resembling the wheat grain. But the resemblance as to shape in such 
seems to denote closeness of species rather than identity; just as the 
resemblance in shape between the dog and the wolf goes to show that they 
are allied but not of the same species. Hence from such grains, which 
cannot in any way be generated from wheat grain, bread cannot be made 
such as to be the proper matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A moderate mixing does not alter the species, because that 
little is as it were absorbed by the greater. Consequently, then, if a 
small quantity of another grain be mixed with a much greater quantity of 
wheat, bread may be made therefrom so as to be the proper matter of this 
sacrament; but if the mixing be notable, for instance, half and half; or 
nearly so, then such mixing alters the species; consequently, bread made 
therefrom will not be the proper matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Sometimes there is such corruption of the bread that the 
species of bread is lost, as when the continuity of its parts is 
destroyed, and the taste, color, and other accidents are changed; hence 
the body of Christ may not be made from such matter. But sometimes there 
is not such corruption as to alter the species, but merely disposition 
towards corruption, which a slight change in the savor betrays, and from 
such bread the body of Christ may be made: but he who does so, sins from 
irreverence towards the sacrament. And because starch comes of corrupted 
wheat, it does not seem as if the body of Christ could be made of the 
bread made therefrom, although some hold the contrary.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this sacrament ought to be made of unleavened bread?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this sacrament ought not to be made of unleavened 
bread. because in this sacrament we ought to imitate Christ's 
institution. But Christ appears to have instituted this sacrament in 
fermented bread, because, as we have read in Ex. 12, the Jews, according 
to the Law, began to use unleavened bread on the day of the Passover 
which is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the moon; and Christ 
instituted this sacrament at the supper which He celebrated "before the 
festival day of the Pasch" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13%3A1,4">Jn. 13:1,4</a>). Therefore we ought likewise to 
celebrate this sacrament with fermented bread.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, legal observances ought not to be continued in the time 
of grace. But the use of unleavened bread was a ceremony of the Law, as 
is clear from Ex. 12. Therefore we ought not to use unfermented bread in 
this sacrament of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the 
Eucharist is the sacrament of charity just as Baptism is the sacrament of 
faith. But the fervor of charity is signified by fermented bread, as is 
declared by the gloss on Mt. 13:33: "The kingdom of heaven is like unto 
leaven," etc. Therefore this sacrament ought to be made of leavened bread.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, leavened or unleavened are mere accidents of bread, 
which do not vary the species. But in the matter for the sacrament of 
Baptism no difference is observed regarding the variation of the 
accidents, as to whether it be salt or fresh, warm or cold water. 
Therefore neither ought any distinction to be observed, as to whether the 
bread be unleavened or leavened.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the Decretals (Extra, De Celebr. Miss.), a 
priest is punished "for presuming to celebrate, using fermented bread and 
a wooden cup."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered touching the matter of this 
sacrament namely, what is necessary, and what is suitable. It is 
necessary that the bread be wheaten, without which the sacrament is not 
valid, as stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). It is not, however, necessary for the 
sacrament that the bread be unleavened  or leavened, since it can be 
celebrated in either.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is suitable that every priest observe the rite of his Church in 
the celebration of the sacrament. Now in this matter there are various 
customs of the Churches: for, Gregory says: "The Roman Church offers 
unleavened bread, because our Lord took flesh without union of sexes: but 
the Greek Churches offer leavened bread, because the Word of the Father 
was clothed with flesh; as leaven is mixed with the flour." Hence, as a 
priest sins by celebrating with fermented bread in the Latin Church, so a 
Greek priest celebrating with unfermented bread in a church of the Greeks 
would also sin, as perverting the rite of his Church. Nevertheless the 
custom of celebrating with unleavened bread is more reasonable. First, on 
account of Christ's institution: for He instituted this sacrament "on the 
first day of the Azymes" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A17;+Mk++14:12;+Lk++22:7">Mt. 26:17; Mk. 14:12; Lk. 22:7</a>), on which day 
there ought to be nothing fermented in the houses of the Jews, as is 
stated in Ex. 12:15,19. Secondly, because bread is properly the sacrament 
of Christ's body, which was conceived without corruption, rather than of 
His Godhead, as will be seen later (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). Thirdly, because 
this is more in keeping with the sincerity of the faithful, which is 
required in the use of this sacrament, according to 1 Cor. 5:7: "Christ 
our Pasch is sacrificed: therefore let us feast . . . with the unleavened 
bread of sincerity and truth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this custom of the Greeks is not unreasonable both on account 
of its signification, to which Gregory refers, and in detestation of the 
heresy of the Nazarenes, who mixed up legal observances with the Gospel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we read in Ex. 12, the paschal solemnity began on the 
evening of the fourteenth day of the moon. So, then, after immolating the 
Paschal Lamb, Christ instituted this sacrament: hence this day is said by 
John to precede the day of the Pasch, while the other three Evangelists 
call it "the first day of the Azymes," when fermented bread was not found 
in the houses of the Jews, as stated above. Fuller mention was made of 
this in the treatise on our Lord's Passion (<A Href="TP046.html#TPQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="TP046.html#TPQ46A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who celebrate the sacrament with unleavened bread do 
not intend to follow the ceremonial of the Law, but to conform to 
Christ's institution; so they are not Judaizing; otherwise those 
celebrating in fermented bread would be Judaizing, because the Jews 
offered up fermented bread for the first-fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Leaven denotes charity on account of one single effect, 
because it makes the bread more savory and larger; but it also signifies 
corruption from its very nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since whatever is fermented partakes of corruption, this 
sacrament may not be made from corrupt bread, as stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 4); consequently, there is a wider difference between unleavened and 
leavened bread than between warm and cold baptismal water: because there 
might be such corruption of  fermented bread that it could not be validly 
used for the sacrament.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether wine of the grape is the proper matter of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that wine of the grape is not the proper matter of this 
sacrament. Because, as water is the matter of Baptism, so is wine the 
matter of this sacrament. But Baptism can be conferred with any kind of 
water. Therefore this sacrament can be celebrated in any kind of wine, 
such as of pomegranates, or of mulberries; since vines do not grow in 
some countries.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, vinegar is a kind of wine drawn from the grape, as 
Isidore says (Etym. xx). But this sacrament cannot be celebrated with 
vinegar. Therefore, it seems that wine from the grape is not the proper 
matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the clarified wine is drawn from grapes, so also 
are the juice of unripe grapes and must. But it does not appear that this 
sacrament may be made from such, according to what we read in the Sixth 
Council (Trull., Can. 28): "We have learned that in some churches the 
priests add grapes to the sacrifice of the oblation; and so they dispense 
both together to the people. Consequently we give order that no priest 
shall do this in future." And Pope Julius I rebukes some priests "who 
offer wine pressed from the grape in the sacrament of the Lord's 
chalice." Consequently, it seems that wine from the grape is not the 
proper matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As our Lord compared Himself to the grain of wheat, so 
also He compared Himself to the vine, saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++15%3A1">Jn. 15:1</a>): "I am the true 
vine." But only bread from wheat is the matter of this sacrament, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore, only wine from the grape is the proper 
matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament can only be performed with wine from the 
grape. First of all on account of Christ's institution, since He 
instituted this sacrament in wine from the grape, as is evident from His 
own words, in instituting this sacrament (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A29">Mt. 26:29</a>): "I will not drink 
from henceforth of this fruit of the vine." Secondly, because, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), that is adopted as the matter of the sacraments which is 
properly and universally considered as such. Now that is properly called 
wine, which is drawn from the grape, whereas other liquors are called 
wine from resemblance to the wine of the grape. Thirdly, because the wine 
from the grape is more in keeping with the effect of this sacrament, 
which is spiritual; because it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++103%3A15">Ps. 103:15</a>): "That wine may 
cheer the heart of man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such liquors are called wine, not properly but only from 
their resemblance thereto. But genuine wine can be conveyed to such 
countries wherein the grape-vine does not flourish, in a quantity 
sufficient for this sacrament. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Wine becomes vinegar by corruption; hence there is no 
returning from vinegar to wine, as is said in Metaph. viii. And 
consequently, just as this sacrament may not be made from bread which is 
utterly corrupt, so neither can it be made from vinegar. It can, however, 
be made from wine which is turning sour, just as from bread turning 
corrupt, although he who does so sins, as stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The juice of unripe grapes is at the stage of incomplete 
generation, and therefore it has not yet the species of wine: on which 
account it may not be used for this sacrament. Must, however, has already 
the species of wine, for its sweetness [*"Aut dulcis musti Vulcano 
decoquit humorem"; Virgil, Georg. i, 295] indicates fermentation which is 
"the result of its natural heat" (Meteor. iv); consequently this 
sacrament can be made from must. Nevertheless entire grapes ought not to 
be mixed with this sacrament, because then there would be something else 
besides wine. It is furthermore forbidden to offer must in the chalice, 
as soon as it has been squeezed from the grape, since this is unbecoming 
owing to the impurity of the must. But in case of necessity it may be 
done: for it is said by the same Pope Julius, in the passage quoted in 
the argument: "If necessary, let the grape be pressed into the chalice."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that water ought not to be mixed with the wine, since 
Christ's sacrifice was foreshadowed by that of Melchisedech, who (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++14%3A18">Gn. 14:18</a>) is related to have offered up bread and wine only. Consequently it 
seems that water should not be added in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the various sacraments have their respective matters. 
But water is the matter of Baptism. Therefore it should not be employed 
as the matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, bread and wine are the matter of this sacrament. But 
nothing is added to the bread. Therefore neither should anything be added 
to the wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Alexander I writes (Ep. 1 ad omnes orth.): "In the 
sacramental oblations which in mass are offered to the Lord, only bread 
and wine mixed with water are to be offered in sacrifice."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Water ought to be mingled with the wine which is offered 
in this sacrament. First of all on account of its institution: for it is 
believed with probability that our Lord instituted this sacrament in wine 
tempered with water according to the custom of that country: hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++9%3A5">Prov. 9:5</a>): "Drink the wine which I have mixed for you." 
Secondly, because it harmonizes with the representation of our Lord's 
Passion: hence  Pope Alexander I says (Ep. 1 ad omnes orth.): "In the 
Lord's chalice neither wine only nor water only ought to be offered, but 
both mixed because we read that both flowed from His side in the 
Passion." Thirdly, because this is adapted for signifying the effect of 
this sacrament, since as Pope Julius says (Concil. Bracarens iii, Can. 
1): "We see that the people are signified by the water, but Christ's 
blood by the wine. Therefore when water is mixed with the wine in the 
chalice, the people is made one with Christ." Fourthly, because this is 
appropriate to the fourth effect of this sacrament, which is the entering 
into everlasting life: hence Ambrose says (De Sacram. v): "The water 
flows into the chalice, and springs forth unto everlasting life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Ambrose says (De Sacram. v), just as Christ's sacrifice 
is denoted by the offering of Melchisedech, so likewise it is signified 
by the water which flowed from the rock in the desert, according to 1 
Cor. 10:4: "But they drank of the spiritual rock which came after them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In Baptism water is used for the purpose of ablution: but 
in this sacrament it is used by way of refreshment, according to Ps. 
22:3: "He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Bread is made of water and flour; and therefore, since 
water is mixed with the wine, neither is without water.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the mixing with water is essential to this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the mixing with water is essential to this 
sacrament. Because Cyprian says to Cecilius (Ep. lxiii): "Thus the Lord's 
chalice is not water only and wine only, but both must be mixed together: 
in the same way as neither the Lord's body be of flour only, except 
both," i.e. the flour and the water "be united as one." But the admixture 
of water with the flour is necessary for this sacrament. Consequently, 
for the like reason, so is the mixing of water with the wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, at our Lord's Passion, of which this is the memorial, 
water as well as blood flowed from His side. But wine, which is the 
sacrament of the blood, is necessary for this sacrament. For the same 
reason, therefore, so is water.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if water were not essential to this sacrament, it would 
not matter in the least what kind of water was used; and so water 
distilled from roses, or any other kind might be employed; which is 
contrary to the usage of the Church. Consequently water is essential to 
this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Cyprian says (Ep. lxiii): "If any of our predecessors, 
out of ignorance or simplicity, has not kept this usage," i.e. of mixing 
water with the wine, "one may pardon his simplicity"; which would not be 
the case if water were essential to  the sacrament, as the wine or the 
bread. Therefore the mingling of water with the wine is not essential to 
the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment concerning a sign is to be drawn from the thing 
signified. Now the adding of water to the wine is for the purpose of 
signifying the sharing of this sacrament by the faithful, in this respect 
that by the mixing of the water with the wine is signified the union of 
the people with Christ, as stated (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Moreover, the flowing of water 
from the side of Christ hanging on the cross refers to the same, because 
by the water is denoted the cleansing from sins, which was the effect of 
Christ's Passion. Now it was observed above (<A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), that 
this sacrament is completed in the consecration of the matter: while the 
usage of the faithful is not essential to the sacrament, but only a 
consequence thereof. Consequently, then, the adding of water is not 
essential to the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Cyprian's expression is to be taken in the same sense in 
which we say that a thing cannot be, which cannot be suitably. And so the 
comparison refers to what ought to be done, not to what is essential to 
be done; since water is of the essence of bread, but not of the essence 
of wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The shedding of the blood belonged directly to Christ's 
Passion: for it is natural for blood to flow from a wounded human body. 
But the flowing of the water was not necessary for the Passion; but 
merely to show its effect, which is to wash away sins, and to refresh us 
from the heat of concupiscence. And therefore the water is not offered 
apart from the wine in this sacrament, as the wine is offered apart from 
the bread; but the water is offered mixed with the wine to show that the 
wine belongs of itself to this sacrament, as of its very essence; but the 
water as something added to the wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the mixing of water with the wine is not necessary 
for the sacrament, it does not matter, as to the essence of the 
sacrament, what kind of water is added to the wine, whether natural 
water, or artificial, as rose-water, although, as to the propriety of the 
sacrament, he would sin who mixes any other than natural and true water, 
because true water flowed from the side of Christ hanging on the cross, 
and not phlegm, as some have said, in order to show that Christ's body 
was truly composed of the four elements; as by the flowing blood, it was 
shown to be composed of the four humors, as Pope Innocent III says in a 
certain Decree. But because the mixing of water with flour is essential 
to this sacrament, as making the composition of bread, if rose-water, or 
any other liquor besides true water, be mixed with the flour, the 
sacrament would not be valid, because it would not be true bread.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether water should be added in great quantity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that water ought to be added in great quantity, because 
as blood flowed sensibly from Christ's side, so  did water: hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A35">Jn. 19:35</a>): "He that saw it, hath given testimony." But water 
could not be sensibly present in this sacrament except it were used in 
great quantity. Consequently it seems that water ought to be added in 
great quantity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a little water mixed with much wine is corrupted. But 
what is corrupted no longer exists. Therefore, it is the same thing to 
add a little water in this sacrament as to add none. But it is not lawful 
to add none. Therefore, neither is it lawful to add a little.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it sufficed to add a little, then as a consequence it 
would suffice to throw one drop of water into an entire cask. But this 
seems ridiculous. Therefore it does not suffice for a small quantity to 
be added.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in the Decretals (Extra, De Celeb. Miss.): 
"The pernicious abuse has prevailed in your country of adding water in 
greater quantity than the wine, in the sacrifice, where according to the 
reasonable custom of the entire Church more wine than water ought to be 
employed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is a threefold opinion regarding the water added to 
the wine, as Pope Innocent III says in a certain Decretal. For some say 
that the water remains by itself when the wine is changed into blood: but 
such an opinion cannot stand, because in the sacrament of the altar after 
the consecration there is nothing else save the body and the blood of 
Christ. Because, as Ambrose says in De Officiis (De Mysteriis ix): 
"Before the blessing it is another species that is named, after the 
blessing the Body is signified; otherwise it would not be adored with 
adoration of latria." And therefore others have said that as the wine is 
changed into blood, so the water is changed into the water which flowed 
from Christ's side. But this cannot be maintained reasonably, because 
according to this the water would be consecrated apart from the wine, as 
the wine is from the bread.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore as he (Innocent III, Decretals, Extra, De Celeb. Miss.) 
says, the more probable opinion is that which holds that the water is 
changed into wine, and the wine into blood. Now, this could not be done 
unless so little water was used that it would be changed into wine. 
Consequently, it is always safer to add little water, especially if the 
wine be weak, because the sacrament could not be celebrated if there were 
such addition of water as to destroy the species of the wine. Hence Pope 
Julius I reprehends some who "keep throughout the year a linen cloth 
steeped in must, and at the time of sacrifice wash a part of it with 
water, and so make the offering."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[74] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> For the signification of this sacrament it suffices for the 
water to be appreciable by sense when it is mixed with the wine: but it
