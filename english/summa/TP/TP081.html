<H3 Align="Center">OF THE USE WHICH CHRIST MADE OF THIS SACRAMENT AT ITS INSTITUTION (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the use which Christ made of this  sacrament at 
its institution; under which heading there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ received His own body and blood?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He gave it to Judas?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A3THEP1">(3)</a> What kind of body did He receive or give, namely, was it passible or 
impassible?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A4THEP1">(4)</a> What would have been the condition of Christ's body under this 
sacrament, if it had been reserved or consecrated during the three days 
He lay dead?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ did not receive His own body and blood, 
because nothing ought to be asserted of either Christ's doings or 
sayings, which is not handed down by the authority of Sacred Scripture. 
But it is not narrated in the gospels that He ate His own body or drank 
His own blood. Therefore we must not assert this as a fact.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing can be within itself except perchance by reason 
of its parts, for instance. as one part is in another, as is stated in 
Phys. iv. But what is eaten and drunk is in the eater and drinker. 
Therefore, since the entire Christ is under each species of the 
sacrament, it seems impossible for Him to have received this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the receiving of this sacrament is twofold, namely, 
spiritual and sacramental. But the spiritual was unsuitable for Christ, 
as He derived no benefit from the sacrament. and in consequence so was 
the sacramental, since it is imperfect without the spiritual, as was 
observed above (<A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="TP080.html#TPQ80A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently, in no way did Christ partake 
of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says (Ad Hedib., Ep. xxx), "The Lord Jesus 
Christ, Himself the guest and banquet, is both the partaker and what is 
eaten."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that Christ during the supper gave His 
body and blood to His disciples, but did not partake of it Himself. But 
this seems improbable. Because Christ Himself was the first to fulfill 
what He required others to observe: hence He willed first to be baptized 
when imposing Baptism upon others: as we read in Acts 1:1: "Jesus began 
to do and to teach." Hence He first of all took His own body and blood, 
and afterwards gave it to be taken by the disciples. And hence the gloss 
upon Ruth 3:7, "When he had eaten and drunk, says: Christ ate and drank 
at the supper, when He gave to the disciples the sacrament of His body 
and blood. Hence, 'because the children partook [*Vulg.: 'are partakers' 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++2:14">Heb. 2:14</a>)] of His flesh and blood, He also hath been partaker in the 
same.'"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We read in the Gospels how Christ "took the bread . . . and 
the chalice"; but it is not to be understood that He took  them merely 
into His hands, as some say. but that He took them in the same way as He 
gave them to others to take. Hence when He said to the disciples, "Take 
ye and eat," and again, "Take ye and drink," it is to be understood that 
He Himself, in taking it, both ate and drank. Hence some have composed 
this rhyme:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  "The King at supper sits,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The twelve as guests He greets,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Clasping Himself in His hands,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The food Himself now eats."
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), Christ as contained under 
this sacrament stands in relation to place, not according to His own 
dimensions, but according to the dimensions of the sacramental species; 
so that Christ is Himself in every place where those species are. And 
because the species were able to be both in the hands and the mouth of 
Christ, the entire Christ could be in both His hands and mouth. Now this 
could not come to pass were His relation to place to be according to His 
proper dimensions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was stated above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), the effect of this 
sacrament is not merely an increase of habitual grace, but furthermore a 
certain actual delectation of spiritual sweetness. But although grace was 
not increased in Christ through His receiving this sacrament, yet He had 
a certain spiritual delectation from the new institution of this 
sacrament. Hence He Himself said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++22:15">Lk. 22:15</a>): "With desire I have desired 
to eat this Pasch with you," which words Eusebius explains of the new 
mystery of the New Testament, which He gave to the disciples. And 
therefore He ate it both spiritually and sacramentally, inasmuch as He 
received His own body under the sacrament which sacrament of His own body 
He both understood and prepared; yet differently from others who partake 
of it both sacramentally and spiritually, for these receive an increase 
of grace, and they have need of the sacramental signs for perceiving its 
truth.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ gave His body to Judas?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ did not give His body to Judas. Because, as 
we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26:29">Mt. 26:29</a>), our Lord, after giving His body and blood to the 
disciples, said to them: "I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit 
of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the 
kingdom of My Father." From this it appears that those to whom He had 
given His body and blood were to drink of it again with Him. But Judas 
did not drink of it afterwards with Him. Therefore he did not receive 
Christ's body and blood with the other disciples.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what the Lord commanded, He Himself fulfilled, as is 
said in Acts 1:1: "Jesus began to do and to teach." But He gave the 
command (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++7:6">Mt. 7:6</a>): "Give not that which is holy to dogs." Therefore, 
knowing Judas to be a sinner, seemingly He did not give  him His body and 
blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is distinctly related (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13:26">Jn. 13:26</a>) that Christ gave 
dipped bread to Judas. Consequently, if He gave His body to him, it 
appears that He gave it him in the morsel, especially since we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13:26">Jn. 13:26</a>) that "after the morsel, Satan entered into him." And on this 
passage Augustine says (Tract. lxii in Joan.): "From this we learn how we 
should beware of receiving a good thing in an evil way . . . For if he be 
'chastised' who does 'not discern,' i.e. distinguish, the body of the 
Lord from other meats, how must he be 'condemned' who, feigning himself a 
friend, comes to His table a foe?" But (Judas) did not receive our Lord's 
body with the dipped morsel; thus Augustine commenting on Jn. 13:26, 
"When He had dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas, the son of Simon the 
Iscariot [Vulg.: 'to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon]," says (Tract. 
lxii in Joan.): "Judas did not receive Christ's body then, as some think 
who read carelessly." Therefore it seems that Judas did not receive the 
body of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom says (Hom. lxxxii in Matth.): "Judas was not 
converted while partaking of the sacred mysteries: hence on both sides 
his crime becomes the more heinous, both because imbued with such a 
purpose he approached the mysteries, and because he became none the 
better for approaching, neither from fear, nor from the benefit received, 
nor from the honor conferred on him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hilary, in commenting on Mt. 26:17, held that Christ did 
not give His body and blood to Judas. And this would have been quite 
proper, if the malice of Judas be considered. But since Christ was to 
serve us as a pattern of justice, it was not in keeping with His teaching 
authority to sever Judas, a hidden sinner, from Communion with the others 
without an accuser and evident proof. lest the Church's prelates might 
have an example for doing the like, and lest Judas himself being 
exasperated might take occasion of sinning. Therefore, it remains to be 
said that Judas received our Lord's body and blood with the other 
disciples, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), and Augustine (Tract. 
lxii in Joan.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This is Hilary's argument, to show that Judas did not 
receive Christ's body. But it is not cogent; because Christ is speaking 
to the disciples, from whose company Judas separated himself: and it was 
not Christ that excluded him. Therefore Christ for His part drinks the 
wine even with Judas in the kingdom of God; but Judas himself repudiated 
this banquet.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The wickedness of Judas was known to Christ as God; but it 
was unknown to Him, after the manner in which men know it. Consequently, 
Christ did not repel Judas from Communion; so as to furnish an example 
that such secret sinners are not to be repelled by other priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Without any doubt Judas did not receive Christ's  body in 
the dipped bread; he received mere bread. Yet as Augustine observes 
(Tract. lxii in Joan.), "perchance the feigning of Judas is denoted by 
the dipping of the bread; just as some things are dipped to be dyed. If, 
however, the dipping signifies here anything good" (for instance, the 
sweetness of the Divine goodness, since bread is rendered more savory by 
being dipped), "then, not undeservedly, did condemnation follow his 
ingratitude for that same good." And owing to that ingratitude, "what is 
good became evil to him, as happens to them who receive Christ's body 
unworthily."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And as Augustine says (Tract. lxii in Joan.), "it must be understood 
that our Lord had already distributed the sacrament of His body and blood 
to all His disciples, among whom was Judas also, as Luke narrates: and 
after that, we came to this, where, according to the relation of John, 
our Lord, by dipping and handing the morsel, does most openly declare His 
betrayer."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ received and gave to the disciples His impassible body?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ both received and gave to the disciples His 
impassible body. Because on Mt. 17:2, "He was transfigured before them," 
the gloss says: "He gave to the disciples at the supper that body which 
He had through nature, but neither mortal nor passible." And again, on 
Lev. 2:5, "if thy oblation be from the frying-pan," the gloss says: "The 
Cross mightier than all things made Christ's flesh fit for being eaten, 
which before the Passion did not seem so suited." But Christ gave His 
body as suited for eating. Therefore He gave it just as it was after the 
Passion, that is, impassible and immortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every passible body suffers by contact and by being 
eaten. Consequently, if Christ's body was passible, it would have 
suffered both from contact and from being eaten by the disciples.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacramental words now spoken by the priest in the 
person of Christ are not more powerful than when uttered by Christ 
Himself. But now by virtue of the sacramental words it is Christ's 
impassible and immortal body which is consecrated upon the altar. 
Therefore, much more so was it then.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As Innocent III says (De Sacr. Alt. Myst. iv), "He 
bestowed on the disciples His body such as it was." But then He had a 
passible and a mortal body. Therefore, He gave a passible and mortal body 
to the disciples.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hugh of Saint Victor (Innocent III, De Sacr. Alt. Myst. 
iv), maintained, that before the Passion, Christ assumed at various times 
the four properties of a glorified body ---namely, subtlety in His birth, 
when He came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin; agility, when He 
walked dryshod upon the sea; clarity, in the Transfiguration; and 
impassibility at the Last Supper, when  He gave His body to the disciples 
to be eaten. And according to this He gave His body in an impassible and 
immortal condition to His disciples.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But whatever may be the case touching the other qualities, concerning 
which we have already stated what should be held (<A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP045.html#TPQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="TP045.html#TPQ45A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), nevertheless the above opinion regarding impassibility is 
inadmissible. For it is manifest that the same body of Christ which was 
then seen by the disciples in its own species, was received by them under 
the sacramental species. But as seen in its own species it was not 
impassible; nay more, it was ready for the Passion. Therefore, neither 
was Christ's body impassible when given under the sacramental species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet there was present in the sacrament, in an impassible manner, that 
which was passible of itself; just as that was there invisibly which of 
itself was visible. For as sight requires that the body seen be in 
contact with the adjacent medium of sight, so does passion require 
contact of the suffering body with the active agents. But Christ's body, 
according as it is under the sacrament, as stated above (<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), is not compared with its surroundings through the 
intermediary of its own dimensions, whereby bodies touch each other, but 
through the dimensions of the bread and wine; consequently, it is those 
species which are acted upon and are seen, but not Christ's own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ is said not to have given His mortal and passible 
body at the supper, because He did not give it in mortal and passible 
fashion. But the Cross made His flesh adapted for eating, inasmuch as 
this sacrament represents Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument would hold, if Christ's body, as it was 
passible, were also present in a passible manner in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the accidents of Christ's 
body are in this sacrament by real concomitance, but not by the power of 
the sacrament, whereby the substance of Christ's body comes to be there. 
And therefore the power of the sacramental words extends to this, that 
the body, i.e. Christ's, is under this sacrament, whatever accidents 
really exist in it.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that if this sacrament had been reserved in a pyx at the 
moment of Christ's death, or had then been consecrated by one of the 
apostles, that Christ would not have died there. For Christ's death 
happened through His Passion. But even then He was in this sacrament in 
an impassible manner. Therefore, He could not die in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on the death of Christ, His blood was separated from the 
body. But His flesh and blood are together in this sacrament. Therefore 
He could not die in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, death ensues from the separation of the soul from the 
body. But both the body and the soul of Christ are contained in this 
sacrament. Therefore Christ could not die in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The same Christ Who was upon the cross would have been 
in this sacrament. But He died upon the cross. Therefore, if this 
sacrament had been reserved, He would have died therein.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's body is substantially the same in this 
sacrament, as in its proper species, but not after the same fashion; 
because in its proper species it comes in contact with surrounding bodies 
by its own dimensions: but it does not do so as it is in this sacrament, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP081.html#TPQ81A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). And therefore, all that belongs to Christ, as He 
is in Himself, can be attributed to Him both in His proper species, and 
as He exists in the sacrament; such as to live, to die, to grieve, to be 
animate or inanimate, and the like; while all that belongs to Him in 
relation to outward bodies, can be attributed to Him as He exists in His 
proper species, but not as He is in this sacrament; such as to be mocked, 
to be spat upon, to be crucified, to be scourged, and the rest. Hence 
some have composed this verse:<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Our Lord can grieve beneath the sacramental veils But cannot feel the 
piercing of the thorns and nails."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As was stated above, suffering belongs to a body that 
suffers in respect of some extrinsic body. And therefore Christ, as in 
this sacrament, cannot suffer; yet He can die.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), in virtue of the 
consecration, the body of Christ is under the species of bread, while His 
blood is under the species of wine. But now that His blood is not really 
separated from His body; by real concomitance, both His blood is present 
with the body under the species of the bread, and His body together with 
the blood under the species of the wine. But at the time when Christ 
suffered, when His blood was really separated from His body, if this 
sacrament had been consecrated, then the body only would have been 
present under the species of the bread, and the blood only under the 
species of the wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[81] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was observed above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), Christ's soul is 
in this sacrament by real concomitance; because it is not without the 
body: but it is not there in virtue of the consecration. And therefore, 
if this sacrament had been consecrated then, or reserved, when His soul 
was really separated from His body, Christ's soul would not have been 
under this sacrament, not from any defect in the form of the words, but 
owing to the different dispositions of the thing contained.
