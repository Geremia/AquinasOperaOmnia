concerning which there are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether we were freed from sin by Christ's Passion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether we were thereby delivered from the power of the devil?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not delivered from sin through 
Christ's Passion. For to deliver from sin belongs to God alone, according 
to Is. 43:25: "I am He who blot out your iniquities for My own sake." But 
Christ did not suffer as God, but as man. Therefore Christ's Passion did 
not free us from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is corporeal does not act upon what is spiritual. 
But Christ's Passion is corporeal, whereas sin exists in the soul, which 
is a spiritual creature. Therefore Christ's Passion could not cleanse us 
from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one cannot be purged from a sin not yet committed, but 
which shall be committed hereafter. Since, then, many sins have been 
committed since Christ's death, and are being committed daily, it seems 
that we were not delivered from sin by Christ's death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, given an efficient cause, nothing else is required for 
producing the effect. But other things besides are required for the 
forgiveness of sins, such as baptism and penance. Consequently it seems 
that Christ's Passion is not the sufficient cause of the forgiveness of 
sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++10:12">Prov. 10:12</a>): "Charity covereth all 
sins"; and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++15:27">Prov. 15:27</a>): "By mercy and faith, sins are purged away." But 
there are many other things of which we have faith, and which excite 
charity. Therefore Christ's Passion is not the proper cause of the 
forgiveness of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rev+++1:5">Apoc. 1:5</a>): "He loved us, and washed us 
from our sins in His own blood."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's Passion is the proper cause of the forgiveness 
of sins in three ways. First of all, by way of exciting our charity, 
because, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:8">Rm. 5:8</a>): "God commendeth His charity 
towards us: because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time, 
Christ died for us." But it is by  charity that we procure pardon of our 
sins, according to Lk. 7:47: "Many sins are forgiven her because she hath 
loved much." Secondly, Christ's Passion causes forgiveness of sins by way 
of redemption. For since He is our head, then, by the Passion which He 
endured from love and obedience, He delivered us as His members from our 
sins, as by the price of His Passion: in the same way as if a man by the 
good industry of his hands were to redeem himself from a sin committed 
with his feet. For, just as the natural body is one though made up of 
diverse members, so the whole Church, Christ's mystic body, is reckoned 
as one person with its head, which is Christ. Thirdly, by way of 
efficiency, inasmuch as Christ's flesh, wherein He endured the Passion, 
is the instrument of the Godhead, so that His sufferings and actions 
operate with Divine power for expelling sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although Christ did not suffer as God, nevertheless His 
flesh is the instrument of the Godhead; and hence it is that His Passion 
has a kind of Divine Power of casting out sin, as was said above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although Christ's Passion is corporeal, still it derives a 
kind of spiritual energy from the Godhead, to which the flesh is united 
as an instrument: and according to this power Christ's Passion is the 
cause of the forgiveness of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ by His Passion delivered us from our sins 
causally---that is, by setting up the cause of our deliverance, from 
which cause all sins whatsoever, past, present, or to come, could be 
forgiven: just as if a doctor were to prepare a medicine by which all 
sicknesses can be cured even in future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above, since Christ's Passion preceded, as a kind 
of universal cause of the forgiveness of sins, it needs to be applied to 
each individual for the cleansing of personal sins. Now this is done by 
baptism and penance and the other sacraments, which derive their power 
from Christ's Passion, as shall be shown later (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Christ's Passion is applied to us even through faith, that 
we may share in its fruits, according to Rm. 3:25: "Whom God hath 
proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood." But the faith 
through which we are cleansed from sin is not "lifeless faith," which can 
exist even with sin, but "faith living" through charity; that thus 
Christ's Passion may be applied to us, not only as to our minds, but also 
as to our hearts. And even in this way sins are forgiven through the 
power of the Passion of Christ.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we were delivered from the devil's power through Christ's Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not delivered from the power of the 
devil through Christ's Passion. For he has no power over  others, who can 
do nothing to them without the sanction of another. But without the 
Divine permission the devil could never do hurt to any man, as is evident 
in the instance of Job (1,2), where, by power received from God, the 
devil first injured him in his possessions, and afterwards in his body. 
In like manner it is stated (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++8:31,32">Mt. 8:31,32</a>) that the devils could not enter 
into the swine except with Christ's leave. Therefore the devil never had 
power over men: and hence we are not delivered from his power through 
Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the devil exercises his power over men by tempting them 
and molesting their bodies. But even after the Passion he continues to do 
the same to men. Therefore we are not delivered from his power through 
Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the might of Christ's Passion endures for ever, as, 
according to Heb. 10:14: "By one oblation He hath perfected for ever them 
that are sanctified." But deliverance rom the devil's power is not found 
everywhere, since there are still idolaters in many regions of the world; 
nor will it endure for ever, because in the time of Antichrist he will be 
especially active in using his power to the hurt of men; because it is 
said of him (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Thess++2:9">2 Thess. 2:9</a>): "Whose coming is according to the working of 
Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and in all seduction 
of iniquity." Consequently it seems that Christ's Passion is not the 
cause of the human race being delivered from the power of the devil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++12:31">Jn. 12:31</a>), when His Passion was drawing 
nigh: "Now shall the prince of this world be cast out; and I, if I be 
lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to Myself." Now He was 
lifted up from the earth by His Passion on the cross. Therefore by His 
Passion the devil was deprived of his power over man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are three things to be considered regarding the 
power which the devil exercised over men previous to Christ's Passion. 
The first is on man's own part, who by his sin deserved to be delivered 
over to the devil's power, and was overcome by his tempting. Another 
point is on God's part, whom man had offended by sinning, and who with 
justice left man under the devil's power. The third is on the devil's 
part, who out of his most wicked will hindered man from securing his 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first point, by Christ's Passion man was delivered from the 
devil's power, in so far as the Passion is the cause of the forgiveness 
of sins, as stated above (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). As to the second, it must be said that 
Christ's Passion freed us from the devil's power, inasmuch as it 
reconciled us with God, as shall be shown later (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But as to the 
third, Christ's Passion delivered us from the devil, inasmuch as in 
Christ's Passion he exceeded the limit of power assigned him by God, by 
conspiring to bring about Christ's death, Who, being sinless, did not 
deserve to die. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, cap. xiv): "The 
devil was vanquished by  Christ's justice: because, while discovering in 
Him nothing deserving of death, nevertheless he slew Him. And it is 
certainly just that the debtors whom he held captive should be set at 
liberty since they believed in Him whom the devil slew, though He was no 
debtor."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The devil is said to have had such power over men not as 
though he were able to injure them without God's sanction, but because he 
was justly permitted to injure men whom by tempting he had induced to 
give consent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God so permitting it, the devil can still tempt men's souls 
and harass their bodies: yet there is a remedy provided for man through 
Christ's Passion, whereby he can safeguard himself against the enemy's 
assaults, so as not to be dragged down into the destruction of 
everlasting death. And all who resisted the devil previous to the Passion 
were enabled to do so through faith in the Passion, although it was not 
yet accomplished. Yet in one respect no one was able to escape the 
devil's hands, i.e. so as not to descend into hell. But after Christ's 
Passion, men can defend themselves from this by its power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God permits the devil to deceive men by certain persons, 
and in times and places, according to the hidden motive of His judgments; 
still, there is always a remedy provided through Christ's Passion, for 
defending themselves against the wicked snares of the demons, even in 
Antichrist's time. But if any man neglect to make use of this remedy, it 
detracts nothing from the efficacy of Christ's Passion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether men were freed from the punishment of sin through Christ's Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men were not freed from the punishment of sin 
by Christ's Passion. For the chief punishment of sin is eternal 
damnation. But those damned in hell for their sins were not set free by 
Christ's Passion, because "in hell there is no redemption" [*Office of 
the Dead, Resp. vii]. It seems, therefore, that Christ's Passion did not 
deliver men from the punishment of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no punishment should be imposed upon them who are 
delivered from the debt of punishment. But a satisfactory punishment is 
imposed upon penitents. Consequently, men were not freed from the debt of 
punishment by Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, death is a punishment of sin, according to Rm. 6:23: 
"The wages of sin is death." But men still die after Christ's Passion. 
Therefore it seems that we have not been delivered from the debt of 
punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++53:4">Is. 53:4</a>): "Surely He hath borne our 
iniquities and carried our sorrows." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Through Christ's Passion we have been delivered from the 
debt of punishment in two ways. First of all, directly---namely, inasmuch 
as Christ's Passion was sufficient and superabundant satisfaction for the 
sins of the whole human race: but when sufficient satisfaction has been 
paid, then the debt of punishment is abolished. In another 
way---indirectly, that is to say---in so far as Christ's Passion is the 
cause of the forgiveness of sin, upon which the debt of punishment rests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's Passion works its effect in them to whom it is 
applied, through faith and charity and the sacraments of faith. And, 
consequently, the lost in hell cannot avail themselves of its effects, 
since they are not united to Christ in the aforesaid manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4,5), in order to secure the 
effects of Christ's Passion, we must be likened unto Him. Now we are 
likened unto Him sacramentally in Baptism, according to Rm. 6:4: "For we 
are buried together with Him by baptism into death." Hence no punishment 
of satisfaction is imposed upon men at their baptism, since they are 
fully delivered by Christ's satisfaction. But because, as it is written 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Pt++3:18">1 Pt. 3:18</a>), "Christ died" but "once for our sins," therefore a man 
cannot a second time be likened unto Christ's death by the sacrament of 
Baptism. Hence it is necessary that those who sin after Baptism be 
likened unto Christ suffering by some form of punishment or suffering 
which they endure in their own person; yet, by the co-operation of 
Christ's satisfaction, much lighter penalty suffices than one that is 
proportionate to the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's satisfaction works its effect in us inasmuch as we 
are incorporated with Him, as the members with their head, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the members must be conformed to their head. 
Consequently, as Christ first had grace in His soul with bodily 
passibility, and through the Passion attained to the glory of 
immortality, so we likewise, who are His members, are freed by His 
Passion from all debt of punishment, yet so that we first receive in our 
souls "the spirit of adoption of sons," whereby our names are written 
down for the inheritance of immortal glory, while we yet have a passible 
and mortal body: but afterwards, "being made conformable" to the 
sufferings and death of Christ, we are brought into immortal glory, 
according to the saying of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:17">Rm. 8:17</a>): "And if sons, heirs 
also: heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ; yet so if we 
suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified with Him."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we were reconciled to God through Christ's Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not reconciled to God through Christ's 
Passion. For there is no need of reconciliation between friends. But God 
always loved us, according to Wis. 11:25: "Thou lovest all the things 
that are, and hatest none of the things which Thou hast made." Therefore 
Christ's Passion did not reconcile  us to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be cause and effect: hence grace, 
which is the cause of meriting, does not come under merit. But God's love 
is the cause of Christ's Passion, according to Jn. 3:16: "God so loved 
the world, as to give His only-begotten Son." It does not appear, then, 
that we were reconciled to God through Christ's Passion, so that He began 
to love us anew.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ's Passion was completed by men slaying Him; and 
thereby they offended God grievously. Therefore Christ's Passion is 
rather the cause of wrath than of reconciliation to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:10">Rm. 5:10</a>): "We are reconciled to God 
by the death of His Son."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's Passion is in two ways the cause of our 
reconciliation to God. In the first way, inasmuch as it takes away sin by 
which men became God's enemies, according to Wis. 14:9: "To God the 
wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike"; and Ps. 5:7: "Thou hatest 
all the workers of iniquity." In another way, inasmuch as it is a most 
acceptable sacrifice to God. Now it is the proper effect of sacrifice to 
appease God: just as man likewise overlooks an offense committed against 
him on account of some pleasing act of homage shown him. Hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Sam++26:19">1 Kgs. 26:19</a>): "If the Lord stir thee up against me, let Him 
accept of sacrifice." And in like fashion Christ's voluntary suffering 
was such a good act that, because of its being found in human nature, God 
was appeased for every offense of the human race with regard to those who 
are made one with the crucified Christ in the aforesaid manner (<A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God loves all men as to their nature, which He Himself 
made; yet He hates them with respect to the crimes they commit against 
Him, according to Ecclus. 12:3: "The Highest hateth sinners."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ is not said to have reconciled us with God, as if 
God had begun anew to love us, since it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++31:3">Jer. 31:3</a>): "I have 
loved thee with an everlasting love"; but because the source of hatred 
was taken away by Christ's Passion, both through sin being washed away 
and through compensation being made in the shape of a more pleasing 
offering.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Christ's slayers were men, so also was the Christ slain. 
Now the charity of the suffering Christ surpassed the wickedness of His 
slayers. Accordingly Christ's Passion prevailed more in reconciling God 
to the whole human race than in provoking Him to wrath.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ opened the gate of heaven to us by His Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not open the gate of  heaven to us 
by His Passion. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++11:18">Prov. 11:18</a>): "To him that soweth 
justice, there is a faithful reward." But the reward of justice is the 
entering into the kingdom of heaven. It seems, therefore, that the holy 
Fathers who wrought works of justice, obtained by faith the entering into 
the heavenly kingdom even without Christ's Passion. Consequently Christ's 
Passion is not the cause of the opening of the gate of the kingdom of 
heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Elias was caught up to heaven previous to Christ's 
Passion (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Kgs++2">4 Kgs. 2</a>). But the effect never precedes the cause. Therefore it 
seems that the opening of heaven's gate is not the result of Christ's 
Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++3:16">Mt. 3:16</a>), when Christ was baptized 
the heavens were opened to Him. But His baptism preceded the Passion. 
Consequently the opening of heaven is not the result of Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written (Mic. 2:13): "For He shall go up that 
shall open the way before them." But to open the way to heaven seems to 
be nothing else than to throw open its gate. Therefore it seems that the 
gate of heaven was opened to us, not by Christ's Passion, but by His 
Ascension.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> is the saying of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++10:19">Heb. 10:19</a>): "We have 
[Vulg.: 'having a'] confidence in the entering into the Holies"---that 
is, of the heavenly places---"through the blood of Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders 
men from entering in. But it is on account of sin that men were prevented 
from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since, according to Is. 35:8: 
"It shall be called the holy way, and the unclean shall not pass over 
it." Now there is a twofold sin which prevents men from entering into the 
kingdom of heaven. The first is common to the whole race, for it is our 
first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's entrance is closed to man. 
Hence we read in Gn. 3:24 that after our first parents' sin God "placed . 
. . cherubim and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of 
the tree of life." The other is the personal sin of each one of us, 
committed by our personal act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now by Christ's Passion we have been delivered not only from the common 
sin of the whole human race, both as to its guilt and as to the debt of 
punishment, for which He paid the penalty on our behalf; but, 
furthermore, from the personal sins of individuals, who share in His 
Passion by faith and charity and the sacraments of faith. Consequently, 
then the gate of heaven's kingdom is thrown open to us through Christ's 
Passion. This is precisely what the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++9:11,12">Heb. 9:11,12</a>): "Christ 
being come a high-priest of the good things to come . . . by His own 
blood entered once into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption." 
And this is foreshadowed (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++35:25,28">Num. 35:25,28</a>), where it is said that the 
slayer* "shall abide there"---that is to say, in the city of  
refuge---"until the death of the high-priest, that is anointed with the 
holy oil: but after he is dead, then shall he return home." [*The 
Septuagint has 'slayer', the Vulgate, 'innocent'---i.e. the man who has 
slain 'without hatred and enmity'.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The holy Fathers, by doing works of justice, merited to 
enter into the heavenly kingdom, through faith in Christ's Passion, 
according to Heb. 11:33: The saints "by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought 
justice," and each of them was thereby cleansed from sin, so far as the 
cleansing of the individual is concerned. Nevertheless the faith and 
righteousness of no one of them sufficed for removing the barrier arising 
from the guilt of the whole human race: but this was removed at the cost 
of Christ's blood. Consequently, before Christ's Passion no one could 
enter the kingdom of heaven by obtaining everlasting beatitude, which 
consists in the full enjoyment of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Elias was taken up into the atmospheric heaven, but not in 
to the empyrean heaven, which is the abode of the saints: and likewise 
Enoch was translated into the earthly paradise, where he is believed to 
live with Elias until the coming of Antichrist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was stated above (<A Href="TP039.html#TPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="TP039.html#TPQ39A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the heavens were opened 
at Christ's baptism, not for Christ's sake, to whom heaven was ever open, 
but in order to signify that heaven is opened to the baptized, through 
Christ's baptism, which has its efficacy from His Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Christ by His Passion merited for us the opening of the 
kingdom of heaven, and removed the obstacle; but by His ascension He, as 
it were, brought us to the possession of the heavenly kingdom. And 
consequently it is said that by ascending He "opened the way before them."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether by His Passion Christ merited to be exalted?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ did not merit to be exalted on account of 
His Passion. For eminence of rank belongs to God alone, just as knowledge 
of truth, according to Ps. 112:4: "The Lord is high above all nations, 
and His glory above the heavens." But Christ as man had the knowledge of 
all truth, not on account of any preceding merit, but from the very union 
of God and man, according to Jn. 1:14: "We saw His glory . . . as it were 
of the only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and of truth." 
Therefore neither had He exaltation from the merit of the Passion but 
from the union alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ merited for Himself from the first instant of His 
conception, as stated above (<A Href="TP034.html#TPQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>, <A Href="TP034.html#TPQ34A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But His love was no greater 
during the Passion than before. Therefore, since charity is the principle 
of merit, it seems that He did not merit exaltation from the Passion more 
than before. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the glory of the body comes from the glory of the soul, 
as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor.). But by His Passion Christ did not 
merit exaltation as to the glory of His soul, because His soul was 
beatified from the first instant of His conception. Therefore neither did 
He merit exaltation, as to the glory of His body, from the Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++2:8">Phil. 2:8</a>): "He became obedient unto 
death, even the death of the cross; for which cause God also exalted Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Merit implies a certain equality of justice: hence the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++4:4">Rm. 4:4</a>): "Now to him that worketh, the reward is reckoned 
according to debt." But when anyone by reason of his unjust will ascribes 
to himself something beyond his due, it is only just that he be deprived 
of something else which is his due; thus, "when a man steals a sheep he 
shall pay back four" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++22:1">Ex. 22:1</a>). And he is said to deserve it, inasmuch 
as his unjust will is chastised thereby. So likewise when any man through 
his just will has stripped himself of what he ought to have, he deserves 
that something further be granted to him as the reward of his just will. 
And hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++14:11">Lk. 14:11</a>): "He that humbleth himself shall be 
exalted."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in His Passion Christ humbled Himself beneath His dignity in four 
respects. In the first place as to His Passion and death, to which He was 
not bound; secondly, as to the place, since His body was laid in a 
sepulchre and His soul in hell; thirdly, as to the shame and mockeries He 
endured; fourthly, as to His being delivered up to man's power, as He 
Himself said to Pilate (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++19:11">Jn. 19:11</a>): "Thou shouldst not have any power 
against Me, unless it were given thee from above." And, consequently, He 
merited a four-fold exaltation from His Passion. First of all, as to His 
glorious Resurrection: hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++138:1">Ps. 138:1</a>): "Thou hast known 
my sitting down"---that is, the lowliness of My Passion---"and My rising 
up." Secondly, as to His ascension into heaven: hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++4:9">Eph. 4:9</a>): "Now that He ascended, what is it, but because He also descended 
first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same 
also that ascended above all the heavens." Thirdly, as to the sitting on 
the right hand of the Father and the showing forth of His Godhead, 
according to Is. 52:13: "He shall be exalted and extolled, and shall be 
exceeding high: as many have been astonished at him, so shall His visage 
be inglorious among men." Moreover (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++2:8">Phil. 2:8</a>) it is written: "He humbled 
Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross: 
for which cause also God hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a name 
which is above all names"---that is to say, so that He shall be hailed as 
God by all; and all shall pay Him homage as God. And this is expressed in 
what follows: "That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those 
that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth." Fourthly, as to His 
judiciary power: for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+36:17">Job 36:17</a>): "Thy cause hath been 
judged as that of the wicked cause and judgment Thou shalt recover." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The source of meriting comes of the soul, while the body is 
the instrument of the meritorious work. And consequently the perfection 
of Christ's soul, which was the source of meriting, ought not to be 
acquired in Him by merit, like the perfection of the body, which was the 
subject of suffering, and was thereby the instrument of His merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ by His previous merits did merit exaltation on 
behalf of His soul, whose will was animated with charity and the other 
virtues; but in the Passion He merited His exaltation by way of 
recompense even on behalf of His body: since it is only just that the 
body, which from charity was subjected to the Passion, should receive 
recompense in glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[49] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It was owing to a special dispensation in Christ that 
before the Passion the glory of His soul did not shine out in His body, 
in order that He might procure His bodily glory with greater honor, when 
He had merited it by His Passion. But it was not beseeming for the glory 
of His soul to be postponed, since the soul was united immediately with 
the Word; hence it was beseeming that its glory should be filled by the 
Word Himself. But the body was united with the Word through the soul.<br>
