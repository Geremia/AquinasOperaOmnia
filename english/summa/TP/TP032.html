    OF THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE IN CHRIST'S CONCEPTION (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We shall now consider the active principle in Christ's conception:
    concerning which there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the Holy Ghost was the
    active principle of Christ's conception?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it can be said that Christ
    was conceived of the Holy Ghost?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it can be said that the
    Holy Ghost is Christ's father according to the flesh?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the Blessed Virgin
    cooperated actively in Christ's conception?<br />

    Whether the accomplishment of Christ's conception should be attributed to
    the Holy Ghost?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the accomplishment of Christ's
    conception should not be attributed to the Holy Ghost, because. as Augustine
    says (De Trin. i), "The works of the Trinity are indivisible, just as the
    Essence of the Trinity is indivisible." But the accomplishment of Christ's
    conception was the work of God. Therefore it seems that it should not be
    attributed to the Holy Ghost any more than to the Father or the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A4"
      >Gal. 4:4</a
    >): "When the fulness of time was come, God sent His Son, made of a woman";
    which words Augustine expounds by saying (De Trin. iv): "Sent, in so far as
    made of a woman." But the sending of the Son is especially attributed to the
    Father, as stated in the FP, Question [43], Article [8]. Therefore His
    conception also, by reason of which He was "made of a woman," should be
    attributed principally to the Father.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++9%3A1"
      >Prov. 9:1</a
    >): "Wisdom hath built herself a house." Now, Christ is Himself the Wisdom
    of God; according to 1 Cor. 1:24: "Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of
    God." And the house of this Wisdom is Christ's body, which is also called
    His temple, according to Jn. 2:21: "But He spoke of the temple of His body."
    Therefore it seems that the accomplishment of Christ's conception should be
    attributed principally to the Son, and not, therefore, to the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A35"
      >Lk. 1:35</a
    >): "The Holy Ghost shall come upon Thee."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The whole Trinity effected the conception of
    Christ's body: nevertheless, this is attributed to the Holy Ghost, for three
    reasons. First, because this is befitting to the cause of the Incarnation,
    considered on the part of God. For the Holy Ghost is the love of Father and
    Son, as stated in the FP, Question [37], Article [1]. Now, that the Son of
    God took to Himself flesh from the Virgin's womb was due to the exceeding
    love of God: wherefore it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A16"
      >Jn. 3:16</a
    >): "God so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, this is befitting to the cause of the Incarnation, on the part of
    the nature assumed. Because we are thus given to understand that human
    nature was assumed by the Son of God into the unity of Person, not by reason
    of its merits, but through grace alone; which is attributed to the Holy
    Ghost, according to 1 Cor. 12:4: "There are diversities of graces, but the
    same Spirit." Wherefore Augustine says (Enchiridion xl): "The manner in
    which Christ was born of the Holy Ghost... suggests to us the grace of God,
    whereby man, without any merits going before, in the very beginning of his
    nature when he began to exist was joined to God the Word, into so great
    unity of Person, that He Himself should be the Son of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, because this is befitting the term of the Incarnation. For the term
    of the Incarnation was that that man, who was being conceived, should be the
    Holy one and the Son of God. Now, both of these are attributed to the Holy
    Ghost. For by Him men are made to be sons of God, according to Gal. 4:6:
    "Because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your [Vulg.:
    'our'] hearts, crying: Abba, Father." Again, He is the "Spirit of
    sanctification," according to Rm. 1:4. Therefore, just as other men are
    sanctified spiritually by the Holy Ghost; so as to be the adopted sons of
    God, so was Christ conceived in sanctity by the Holy Ghost, so as to be the
    natural Son of God. Hence, according to a gloss on Rm. 1:4, the words, "Who
    was predestinated the Son of God, in power," are explained by what
    immediately follows: "According to the Spirit of sanctification, i.e.
    through being conceived of the Holy Ghost." And the Angel of the
    Annunciation himself, after saying, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,"
    draws the conclusion: "Therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee
    shall be called the Son of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The work of the conception is indeed
    common to the whole Trinity; yet in some way it is attributed to each of the
    Persons. For to the Father is attributed authority in regard to the Person
    of the Son, who by this conception took to Himself (human nature). The
    taking itself (of human nature) is attributed to the Son: but the formation
    of the body taken by the Son is attributed to the Holy Ghost. For the Holy
    Ghost is the Spirit of the Son, according to Gal. 4:6: "God sent the Spirit
    of His Son." For just as the power of the soul which is in the semen,
    through the spirit enclosed therein, fashions the body in the generation of
    other men, so the Power of God, which is the Son Himself, according to 1
    Cor. 1:24: "Christ, the Power of God," through the Holy Ghost formed the
    body which He assumed. This is also shown by the words of the angel: "The
    Holy Ghost shall come upon thee," as it were, in order to prepare and
    fashion the matter of Christ's body; "and the Power of the Most High," i.e.
    Christ, "shall overshadow thee---that is to say, the incorporeal Light of
    the Godhead shall in thee take the corporeal substance of human nature: for
    a shadow is formed by light and body," as Gregory says (Moral. xviii). The
    "Most High" is the Father, whose Power is the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The mission refers to the Person
    assuming, who is sent by the Father; but the conception refers to the body
    assumed, which is formed by the operation of the Holy Ghost. And therefore,
    though mission and conception are in the same subject; since they differ in
    our consideration of them, mission is attributed to the Father, but the
    accomplishment of the conception to the Holy Ghost; whereas the assumption
    of flesh is attributed to the Son.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et
    Nov. Test., qu. 52): "This may be understood in two ways. For, first,
    Christ's house is the Church, which He built with His blood. Secondly, His
    body may be called His house, just as it is called His temple... and what is
    done by the Holy Ghost is done by the Son of God, because Theirs is one
    Nature and one Will."<br />

    Whether it should be said that Christ was conceived of [de] the Holy
    Ghost?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we should not say that Christ
    was conceived of [de] the Holy Ghost. Because on Rm. 11:36: "For of Him [ex
    ipso] and by Him, and in Him, are all things," the gloss of Augustine says:
    "Notice that he does not say, 'of Him' [de ipso], but 'of Him' [ex ipso].
    For of Him [ex ipso], are heaven and earth, since He made them: but not of
    Him [de ipso], since they are not made of His substance." But the Holy Ghost
    did not form Christ's body of [de] His own substance. Therefore we should
    not say that Christ was conceived of [de] the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the active principle of [de] which
    something is conceived is as the seed in generation. But the Holy Ghost did
    not take the place of seed in Christ's conception. For Jerome says (Expos.
    Cathol. Fidei) [*Written by Pelagius]: "We do not say, as some wicked
    wretches hold, that the Holy Ghost took the place of seed: but we say that
    Christ's body was wrought," i.e. formed, "by the power and might of the
    Creator." Therefore we should not say that Christ's body was conceived of
    [de] the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one thing is made of two, except they
    be in some way mingled. But Christ's body was formed of [de] the Virgin
    Mary. If therefore we say that Christ was conceived of [de] the Holy Ghost,
    it seems that a mingling took place of the Holy Ghost with the matter
    supplied by the Virgin: and this is clearly false. Therefore we should not
    say that Christ was conceived of [de] the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++1%3A18"
      >Mt. 1:18</a
    >): "Before they came together, she was found with child, of [de] the Holy
    Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Conception is not attributed to Christ's body
    alone, but also to Christ Himself by reason of His body. Now, in the Holy
    Ghost we may observe a twofold habitude to Christ. For to the Son of God
    Himself, who is said to have been conceived, He has a habitude of
    consubstantiality: while to His body He has the habitude of efficient cause.
    And this preposition of [de] signifies both habitudes: thus we say that a
    certain man is "of [de] his father." And therefore we can fittingly say that
    Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost in such a way that the efficiency of
    the Holy Ghost be referred to the body assumed, and the consubstantiality to
    the Person assuming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's body, through not being
    consubstantial with the Holy Ghost, cannot properly be said to be conceived
    "of" [de] the Holy Ghost, but rather "from [ex] the Holy Ghost," as Ambrose
    says (De Spir. Sanct. ii.): "What is from someone is either from his
    substance or from his power: from his substance, as the Son who is from the
    Father; from his power, as all things are from God, just as Mary conceived
    from the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It seems that on this point there is a
    difference of opinion between Jerome and certain other Doctors, who assert
    that the Holy Ghost took the place of seed in this conception. For
    Chrysostom says (Hom. i in Matth. [*Opus Imperf., among the supposititious
    writings]): "When God's Only-Begotten was about to enter into the Virgin,
    the Holy Ghost preceded Him; that by the previous entrance of the Holy
    Ghost, Christ might be born unto sanctification according to His body, the
    Godhead entering instead of the seed." And Damascene says (De Fide Orth.
    iii): "God's wisdom and power overshadowed her, like unto a Divine seed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But these expressions are easily explained. Because Chrysostom and Damascene
    compare the Holy Ghost, or also the Son, who is the Power of the Most High,
    to seed, by reason of the active power therein; while Jerome denies that the
    Holy Ghost took the place of seed, considered as a corporeal substance which
    is transformed in conception.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Enchiridion xl),
    Christ is said to be conceived or born of the Holy Ghost in one sense; of
    the Virgin Mary in another---of the Virgin Mary materially; of the Holy
    Ghost efficiently. Therefore there was no mingling here.<br />

    Whether the Holy Ghost should be called Christ's father in respect of His
    humanity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Holy Ghost should be
    called Christ's father in respect of His humanity. Because, according to the
    Philosopher (De Gener. Animal. i): "The Father is the active principle in
    generation, the Mother supplies the matter." But the Blessed Virgin is
    called Christ's Mother, by reason of the matter which she supplied in His
    conception. Therefore it seems that the Holy Ghost can be called His father,
    through being the active principle in His conception.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the minds of other holy men are
    fashioned by the Holy Ghost, so also was Christ's body fashioned by the Holy
    Ghost. But other holy men, on account of the aforesaid fashioning, are
    called the children of the whole Trinity, and consequently of the Holy
    Ghost. Therefore it seems that Christ should be called the Son of the Holy
    Ghost, forasmuch as His body was fashioned by the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God is called our Father by reason of
    His having made us, according to Dt. 32:6: "Is not He thy Father, that hath
    possessed thee, and made thee and created thee?" But the Holy Ghost made
    Christ's body, as stated above (<a href="TP032.html#TPQ32ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2). Therefore the Holy Ghost should be called Christ's Father in respect
    of the body fashioned by Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Enchiridion xl): "Christ was
    born of the Holy Ghost not as a Son, and of the Virgin Mary as a Son."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The words "fatherhood," "motherhood," and
    "sonship," result from generation; yet not from any generation, but from
    that of living things, especially animals. For we do not say that fire
    generated is the son of the fire generating it, except, perhaps,
    metaphorically; we speak thus only of animals in whom generation is more
    perfect. Nevertheless, the word "son" is not applied to everything generated
    in animals, but only to that which is generated into likeness of the
    generator. Wherefore, as Augustine says (Enchiridion xxxix), we do not say
    that a hair which is generated in a man is his son; nor do we say that a man
    who is born is the son of the seed; for neither is the hair like the man nor
    is the man born like the seed, but like the man who begot him. And if the
    likeness be perfect, the sonship is perfect, whether in God or in man. But
    if the likeness be imperfect, the sonship is imperfect. Thus in man there is
    a certain imperfect likeness to God, both as regards his being created to
    God's image and as regards His being created unto the likeness of grace.
    Therefore in both ways man can be called His son, both because he is created
    to His image and because he is likened to Him by grace. Now, it must be
    observed that what is said in its perfect sense of a thing should not be
    said thereof in its imperfect sense: thus, because Socrates is said to be
    naturally a man, in the proper sense of "man," never is he called man in the
    sense in which the portrait of a man is called a man, although, perhaps, he
    may resemble another man. Now, Christ is the Son of God in the perfect sense
    of sonship. Wherefore, although in His human nature He was created and
    justified, He ought not to be called the Son of God, either in respect of
    His being created or of His being justified, but only in respect of His
    eternal generation, by reason of which He is the Son of the Father alone.
    Therefore nowise should Christ be called the Son of the Holy Ghost, nor even
    of the whole Trinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ was conceived of the Virgin Mary,
    who supplied the matter of His conception unto likeness of species. For this
    reason He is called her Son. But as man He was conceived of the Holy Ghost
    as the active principle of His conception, but not unto likeness of species,
    as a man is born of his father. Therefore Christ is not called the Son of
    the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Men who are fashioned spiritually by the
    Holy Ghost cannot be called sons of God in the perfect sense of sonship. And
    therefore they are called sons of God in respect of imperfect sonship, which
    is by reason of the likeness of grace, which flows from the whole
    Trinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>But with Christ it is different, as stated above.</p>
  <p>The same reply avails for the Third Objection.</p>

    Whether the Blessed Virgin cooperated actively in the conception of Christ's
    body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Blessed Virgin cooperated
    actively in the conception of Christ's body. For Damascene says (De Fide
    Orth. iii) that "the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, purifying her, and
    bestowing on her the power to receive and to bring forth the Word of God."
    But she had from nature the passive power of generation, like any other
    woman. Therefore He bestowed on her an active power of generation. And thus
    she cooperated actively in Christ's conception.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the powers of the vegetative soul
    are active, as the Commentator says (De Anima ii). But the generative power,
    in both man and woman, belongs to the vegetative soul. Therefore, both in
    man and woman, it cooperates actively in the conception of the child.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the conception of a child the woman
    supplies the matter from which the child's body is naturally formed. But
    nature is an intrinsic principle of movement. Therefore it seems that in the
    very matter supplied by the Blessed Virgin there was an active principle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The active principle in generation is called
    the "seminal virtue." But, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x), Christ's body
    "was taken from the Virgin, only as to corporeal matter, by the Divine power
    of conception and formation, but not by any human seminal virtue." Therefore
    the Blessed Virgin did not cooperate actively in, the conception of Christ's
    body.<br />

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some say that the Blessed Virgin cooperated
    actively in Christ's conception, both by natural and by a supernatural
    power. By natural power, because they hold that in all natural matter there
    is an active principle. otherwise they believe that there would be no such
    thing as natural transformation. But in this they are deceived. Because a
    transformation is said to be natural by reason not only of an active but
    also of a passive intrinsic principle: for the Philosopher says expressly
    (Phys. viii) that in heavy and light things there is a passive, and not an
    active, principle of natural movement. Nor is it possible for matter to be
    active in its own formation, since it is not in act. Nor, again, is it
    possible for anything to put itself in motion except it be divided into two
    parts, one being the mover, the other being moved: which happens in animate
    things only, as is proved Phys. viii.<br />

    By a supernatural power, because they say that the mother requires not only
    to supply the matter, which is the menstrual blood, but also the semen,
    which, being mingled with that of the male, has an active power in
    generation. And since in the Blessed Virgin there was no resolution of
    semen, by reason of her inviolate virginity, they say that the Holy Ghost
    supernaturally bestowed on her an active power in the conception of Christ's
    body, which power other mothers have by reason of the semen resolved. But
    this cannot stand, because, since "each thing is on account of its
    operation" (De Coel. ii), nature would not, for the purpose of the act of
    generation, distinguish the male and female sexes, unless the action of the
    male were distinct from that of the female. Now, in generation there are two
    distinct operations---that of the agent and that of the patient. Wherefore
    it follows that the entire active operation is on the part of the male, and
    the passive on the part of the female. For this reason in plants, where both
    forces are mingled, there is no distinction of male and female.<br />

    Since, therefore, the Blessed Virgin was not Christ's Father, but His
    Mother, it follows that it was not given to her to exercise an active power
    in His conception: whether to cooperate actively so as to be His Father, or
    not to cooperate at all, as some say. whence it would follow that this
    active power was bestowed on her to no purpose. We must therefore say that
    in Christ's conception itself she did not cooperate actively, but merely
    supplied the matter thereof. Nevertheless, before the conception she
    cooperated actively in the preparation of the matter so that it should be
    apt for the conception.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This conception had three
    privileges---namely, that it was without original sin; that it was not that
    of a man only, but of God and man; and that it was a virginal conception.
    And all three were effected by the Holy Ghost. Therefore Damascene says, as
    to the first, that the Holy Ghost "came upon the Virgin, purifying
    her"---that is, preserving her from conceiving with original sin. As to the
    second, he says: "And bestowing on her the power to receive," i.e. to
    conceive, "the Word of God." As to the third, he says: "And to give birth"
    to Him, i.e. that she might, while remaining a virgin, bring Him forth, not
    actively, but passively, just as other mothers achieve this through the
    action of the male seed.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The generative power of the female is
    imperfect compared to that of the male. And, therefore, just as in the arts
    the inferior art gives a disposition to the matter to which the higher art
    gives the form, as is stated Phys. ii, so also the generative power of the
    female prepares the matter, which is then fashioned by the active power of
    the male.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In order for a transformation to be
    natural, there is no need for an active principle in matter, but only for a
    passive principle, as stated above.<br />
