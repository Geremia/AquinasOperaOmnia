</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider Christ's doctrine, about which there are four 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP042.html#TPQ42A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews only, or to the 
Gentiles also?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP042.html#TPQ42A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in preaching He should have avoided the opposition of the 
Jews?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP042.html#TPQ42A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He should have preached in an open or in a hidden manner?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP042.html#TPQ42A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He should have preached by word only, or also by writing?
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the time when He began to teach, we have spoken above when 
treating of His baptism (Question [29], Article [3]).<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should have preached not only to the 
Jews, but also to the Gentiles. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++49%3A6">Is. 49:6</a>): "It is a 
small thing that thou shouldst be My servant to raise up the tribes of 
Israel [Vulg.: 'Jacob'] and to convert the dregs of Jacob [Vulg.: 
'Israel']: behold, I have given thee to be the light of the Gentiles, 
that thou mayest be my salvation even to the farthest part of the earth." 
But Christ gave light and salvation through His doctrine. Therefore it 
seems that it was "a small thing" that He preached to Jews alone, and not 
to the Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++7%3A29">Mt. 7:29</a>): "He was teaching them as 
one having power." Now the power of doctrine is made more manifest in the 
instruction of those who, like the Gentiles, have received no tidings 
whatever; hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++15%3A20">Rm. 15:20</a>): "I have so preached the 
[Vulg.: 'this'] gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build 
upon another man's foundation." Therefore much rather should Christ have 
preached to the Gentiles than to the Jews.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is more useful to instruct many than one. But Christ 
instructed some individual Gentiles, such as the Samaritan woman (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4">Jn. 4</a>) 
and the Chananaean woman (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15">Mt. 15</a>). Much more reason, therefore, was there 
for Christ to preach to the Gentiles in general.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A24">Mt. 15:24</a>): "I was not sent but to the 
sheep that are lost of the house of Israel." And (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++10%3A15">Rm. 10:15</a>) it is 
written: "How shall they preach unless they be sent?" Therefore Christ 
should not have preached to the Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting that Christ's preaching, whether through 
Himself or through His apostles, should be directed at first to the Jews 
alone. First, in order to show that by His coming the promises were 
fulfilled which had been made to the Jews of old, and not to the 
Gentiles. Thus the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++15%3A8">Rm. 15:8</a>): "I say that Christ . . . was 
minister of the circumcision," i.e. the apostle and preacher of the Jews, 
"for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, in order to show that His coming was of God; because, as is 
written Rm. 13:1: "Those things which are of God are well ordered [Vulg.: 
'those that are, are ordained of God']" [*See Scriptural Index on this 
passage]. Now the right order demanded that the doctrine of Christ should 
be made known first to the Jews, who, by believing in and worshiping one 
God, were nearer to God, and that it should be transmitted through them 
to the Gentiles: just as in the heavenly hierarchy the Divine 
enlightenment comes to the lower angels through the higher. Hence on Mt. 
15:24, "I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost in the house of 
Israel," Jerome  says: "He does not mean by this that He was not sent to 
the Gentiles, but that He was sent to the Jews first." And so we read 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++66%3A19">Is. 66:19</a>): "I will send of them that shall be saved," i.e. of the Jews, 
"to the Gentiles . . . and they shall declare My glory unto the Gentiles."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, in order to deprive the Jews of ground for quibbling. Hence on 
Mt. 10:5, "Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles." Jerome says: "It 
behooved Christ's coming to be announced to the Jews first, lest they 
should have a valid excuse, and say that they had rejected our Lord 
because He had sent His apostles to the Gentiles and Samaritans."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, because it was through the triumph of the cross that Christ 
merited power and lordship over the Gentiles. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++2%3A26,28">Apoc. 2:26,28</a>): "He that shall overcome . . . I will give him power over the 
nations . . . as I also have received of My Father"; and that because He 
became "obedient unto the death of the cross, God hath exalted Him . . . 
that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . ." and that "every 
tongue should confess Him" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A8-11">Phil. 2:8-11</a>). Consequently He did not wish 
His doctrine to be preached to the Gentiles before His Passion: it was 
after His Passion that He said to His disciples (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++28%3A19">Mt. 28:19</a>): "Going, 
teach ye all nations." For this reason it was that when, shortly before 
His Passion, certain Gentiles wished to see Jesus, He said: "Unless the 
grain of wheat falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone: but 
if it die it bringeth forth much fruit" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++12%3A20-25">Jn. 12:20-25</a>); and as Augustine 
says, commenting on this passage: "He called Himself the grain of wheat 
that must be mortified by the unbelief of the Jews, multiplied by the 
faith of the nations."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ was given to be the light and salvation of the 
Gentiles through His disciples, whom He sent to preach to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is a sign, not of lesser, but of greater power to do 
something by means of others rather than by oneself. And thus the Divine 
power of Christ was specially shown in this, that He bestowed on the 
teaching of His disciples such a power that they converted the Gentiles 
to Christ, although these had heard nothing of Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the power of Christ's teaching is to be considered in the miracles 
by which He confirmed His doctrine, in the efficacy of His persuasion, 
and in the authority of His words, for He spoke as being Himself above 
the Law when He said: "But I say to you" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A22,28,32,34,39,44">Mt. 5:22,28,32,34,39,44</a>); and, 
again, in the force of His righteousness shown in His sinless manner of 
life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as it was unfitting that Christ should at the outset 
make His doctrine known to the Gentiles equally with the Jews, in order 
that He might appear as being sent to the Jews, as to the first-born 
people; so neither was it fitting for Him to neglect the Gentiles 
altogether, lest they should be deprived of the hope of salvation. For 
this reason certain individual Gentiles  were admitted, on account of the 
excellence of their faith and devotedness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews without offending them?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should have preached to the Jews 
without offending them. For, as Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xi): "In 
the Man Jesus Christ, a model of life is given us by the Son of God." But 
we should avoid offending not only the faithful, but even unbelievers, 
according to 1 Cor. 10:32: "Be without offense to the Jews, and to the 
Gentiles, and to the Church of God." Therefore it seems that, in His 
teaching, Christ should also have avoided giving offense to the Jews.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no wise man should do anything that will hinder the 
result of his labor. Now through the disturbance which His teaching 
occasioned among the Jews, it was deprived of its results; for it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++11%3A53,54">Lk. 11:53,54</a>) that when our Lord reproved the Pharisees and 
Scribes, they "began vehemently to urge Him, end to oppress His mouth 
about many things; lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch something 
from His mouth, that they might accuse Him." It seems therefore unfitting 
that He should have given them offense by His teaching.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++5%3A1">1 Tim. 5:1</a>): "An ancient man rebuke 
not; but entreat him as a father." But the priests and princes of the 
Jews were the elders of that people. Therefore it seems that they should 
not have been rebuked with severity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It was foretold (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++8%3A14">Is. 8:14</a>) that Christ would be "for a 
stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to the two houses of Israel."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The salvation of the multitude is to be preferred to the 
peace of any individuals whatsoever. Consequently, when certain ones, by 
their perverseness, hinder the salvation of the multitude, the preacher 
and the teacher should not fear to offend those men, in order that he may 
insure the salvation of the multitude. Now the Scribes and Pharisees and 
the princes of the Jews were by their malice a considerable hindrance to 
the salvation of the people, both because they opposed themselves to 
Christ's doctrine, which was the only way to salvation, and because their 
evil ways corrupted the morals of the people. For which reason our Lord, 
undeterred by their taking offense, publicly taught the truth which they 
hated, and condemned their vices. Hence we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A12,14">Mt. 15:12,14</a>) that when 
the disciples of our Lord said: "Dost Thou know that the Pharisees, when 
they heard this word, were scandalized?" He answered: "Let them alone: 
they are blind and leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, 
both fall into the pit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man ought so to avoid giving offense, as neither by wrong 
deed or word to be the occasion of anyone's  downfall. "But if scandal 
arise from truth, the scandal should be borne rather than the truth be 
set aside," as Gregory says (Hom. vii in Ezech.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By publicly reproving the Scribes and Pharisees, Christ 
promoted rather than hindered the effect of His teaching. Because when 
the people came to know the vices of those men, they were less inclined 
to be prejudiced against Christ by hearing what was said of Him by the 
Scribes and Pharisees, who were ever withstanding His doctrine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This saying of the Apostle is to be understood of those 
elders whose years are reckoned not only in age and authority, but also 
in probity; according to Num. 11:16: "Gather unto Me seventy men of the 
ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients . . . of the 
people." But if by sinning openly they turn the authority of their years 
into an instrument of wickedness, they should be rebuked openly and 
severely, as also Daniel says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++13%3A52">Dan. 13:52</a>): "O thou that art grown old in 
evil days," etc.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ should have taught all things openly?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should not have taught all things 
openly. For we read that He taught many things to His disciples apart: as 
is seen clearly in the sermon at the Supper. Wherefore He said: "That 
which you heard in the ear in the chambers shall be preached on the 
housetops" [*St. Thomas, probably quoting from memory, combines Mt. 10:27 
with Lk. 12:3]. Therefore He did not teach all things openly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the depths of wisdom should not be expounded save to the 
perfect, according to 1 Cor. 2:6: "We speak wisdom among the perfect." 
Now Christ's doctrine contained the most profound wisdom. Therefore it 
should not have been made known to the imperfect crowd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it comes to the same, to hide the truth, whether by 
saying nothing or by making use of a language that is difficult to 
understand. Now Christ, by speaking to the multitudes a language they 
would not understand, hid from them the truth that He preached; since 
"without parables He did not speak to them" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++13%3A34">Mt. 13:34</a>). In the same way, 
therefore, He could have hidden it from them by saying nothing at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> He says Himself (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++18%3A20">Jn. 18:20</a>): "In secret I have spoken 
nothing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Anyone's doctrine may be hidden in three ways. First, on 
the part of the intention of the teacher, who does not wish to make his 
doctrine known to many, but rather to hide it. And this may happen in two 
ways---sometimes through envy on the part of the teacher, who desires to 
excel in his knowledge, wherefore he is unwilling to communicate it to 
others. But this was not the case  with Christ, in whose person the 
following words are spoken (Wis. 7:13): "Which I have learned without 
guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not." But 
sometimes this happens through the vileness of the things taught; thus 
Augustine says on Jn. 16:12: "There are some things so bad that no sort 
of human modesty can bear them." Wherefore of heretical doctrine it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++9%3A17">Prov. 9:17</a>): "Stolen waters are sweeter." Now, Christ's doctrine 
is "not of error nor of uncleanness" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Thess++2%3A3">1 Thess. 2:3</a>). Wherefore our Lord 
says (Mk. 4:21): "Doth a candle," i.e. true and pure doctrine, "come in 
to be put under a bushel?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, doctrine is hidden because it is put before few. And thus, 
again, did Christ teach nothing in secret: for He propounded His entire 
doctrine either to the whole crowd or to His disciples gathered together. 
Hence Augustine says on Jn. 18:20: "How can it be said that He speaks in 
secret when He speaks before so many men? . . . especially if what He 
says to few He wishes through them to be made known to many?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, doctrine is hidden, as to the manner in which it is propounded. 
And thus Christ spoke certain things in secret to the crowds, by 
employing parables in teaching them spiritual mysteries which they were 
either unable or unworthy to grasp: and yet it was better for them to be 
instructed in the knowledge of spiritual things, albeit hidden under the 
garb of parables, than to be deprived of it altogether. Nevertheless our 
Lord expounded the open and unveiled truth of these parables to His 
disciples, so that they might hand it down to others worthy of it; 
according to 2 Tim. 2:2: "The things which thou hast heard of me by many 
witnesses, the same command to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach 
others." This is foreshadowed, Num. 4, where the sons of Aaron are 
commanded to wrap up the sacred vessels that were to be carried by the 
Levites.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Hilary says, commenting on the passage quoted, "we do 
not read that our Lord was wont to preach at night, and expound His 
doctrine in the dark: but He says this because His speech is darkness to 
the carnal-minded, and His words are night to the unbeliever. His 
meaning, therefore, is that whatever He said we also should say in the 
midst of unbelievers, by openly believing and professing it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, according to Jerome, He speaks comparatively---that is to say, 
because He was instructing them in Judea, which was a small place 
compared with the whole world, where Christ's doctrine was to be 
published by the preaching of the apostles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By His doctrine our Lord did not make known all the depths 
of His wisdom, neither to the multitudes, nor, indeed, to His disciples, 
to whom He said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++16%3A12">Jn. 16:12</a>): "I have yet many things to say to you, but 
you cannot bear them now." Yet whatever things out of His wisdom He 
judged it right to make known to others, He expounded, not in secret, but 
openly; although He was not understood by all. Hence Augustine says on 
Jn. 18:20: "We must understand this, 'I have spoken openly to the world,' 
as though our  Lord had said, 'Many have heard Me' . . . and, again, it 
was not 'openly,' because they did not understand."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, our Lord spoke to the multitudes in 
parables, because they were neither able nor worthy to receive the naked 
truth, which He revealed to His disciples.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And when it is said that "without parables He did not speak to them," 
according to Chrysostom (Hom. xlvii in Matth.), we are to understand this 
of that particular sermon, since on other occasions He said many things 
to the multitude without parables. Or, as Augustine says (De Qq. Evang., 
qu. xvii), this means, "not that He spoke nothing literally, but that He 
scarcely ever spoke without introducing a parable, although He also spoke 
some things in the literal sense."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ should have committed His doctrine to writing?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should have committed His doctrine to 
writing. For the purpose of writing is to hand down doctrine to 
posterity. Now Christ's doctrine was destined to endure for ever, 
according to Lk. 21:33: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words 
shall not pass away." Therefore it seems that Christ should have 
committed His doctrine to writing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Old Law was a foreshadowing of Christ, according to 
Heb. 10:1: "The Law has [Vulg.: 'having'] a shadow of the good things to 
come." Now the Old Law was put into writing by God, according to Ex. 
24:12: "I will give thee" two "tables of stone and the law, and the 
commandments which I have written." Therefore it seems that Christ also 
should have put His doctrine into writing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to Christ, who came to enlighten them that sit in 
darkness (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++1%3A79">Lk. 1:79</a>), it belonged to remove occasions of error, and to 
open out the road to faith. Now He would have done this by putting His 
teaching into writing: for Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. i) that 
"some there are who wonder why our Lord wrote nothing, so that we have to 
believe what others have written about Him. Especially do those pagans 
ask this question who dare not blame or blaspheme Christ, and who ascribe 
to Him most excellent, but merely human, wisdom. These say that the 
disciples made out the Master to be more than He really was when they 
said that He was the Son of God and the Word of God, by whom all things 
were made." And farther on he adds: "It seems as though they were 
prepared to believe whatever He might have written of Himself, but not 
what others at their discretion published about Him." Therefore it seems 
that Christ should have Himself committed His doctrine to writing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No books written by Him were to be found in the canon 
of Scripture.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting that Christ should not commit  His 
doctrine to writing. First, on account of His dignity: for the more 
excellent the teacher, the more excellent should be his manner of 
teaching. Consequently it was fitting that Christ, as the most excellent 
of teachers, should adopt that manner of teaching whereby His doctrine is 
imprinted on the hearts of His hearers; wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++7%3A29">Mt. 7:29</a>) that "He was teaching them as one having power." And so it was that 
among the Gentiles, Pythagoras and Socrates, who were teachers of great 
excellence, were unwilling to write anything. For writings are ordained, 
as to an end, unto the imprinting of doctrine in the hearts of the 
hearers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on account of the excellence of Christ's doctrine, which 
cannot be expressed in writing; according to Jn. 21:25: "There are also 
many other things which Jesus did: which, if they were written everyone, 
the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that 
should be written." Which Augustine explains by saying: "We are not to 
believe that in respect of space the world could not contain them . . . 
but that by the capacity of the readers they could not be comprehended." 
And if Christ had committed His doctrine to writing, men would have had 
no deeper thought of His doctrine than that which appears on the surface 
of the writing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, that His doctrine might reach all in an orderly manner: Himself 
teaching His disciples immediately, and they subsequently teaching 
others, by preaching and writing: whereas if He Himself had written, His 
doctrine would have reached all immediately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is said of Wisdom (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++9%3A3">Prov. 9:3</a>) that "she hath sent her maids to 
invite to the tower." It is to be observed, however, that, as Augustine 
says (De Consensu Evang. i), some of the Gentiles thought that Christ 
wrote certain books treating of the magic art whereby He worked miracles: 
which art is condemned by the Christian learning. "And yet they who claim 
to have read those books of Christ do none of those things which they 
marvel at His doing according to those same books. Moreover, it is by a 
Divine judgment that they err so far as to assert that these books were, 
as it were, entitled as letters to Peter and Paul, for that they found 
them in several places depicted in company with Christ. No wonder that 
the inventors were deceived by the painters: for as long as Christ lived 
in the mortal flesh with His disciples, Paul was no disciple of His."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says in the same book: "Christ is the head of 
all His disciples who are members of His body. Consequently, when they 
put into writing what He showed forth and said to them, by no means must 
we say that He wrote nothing: since His members put forth that which they 
knew under His dictation. For at His command they, being His hands, as it 
were, wrote whatever He wished us to read concerning His deeds and words."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the old Law was given under the form of sensible 
signs, therefore also was it fittingly written with  sensible signs. But 
Christ's doctrine, which is "the law of the spirit of life" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A2">Rm. 8:2</a>), 
had to be "written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; 
not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart," as the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++3%3A3">2 Cor. 3:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[42] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who were unwilling to believe what the apostles wrote 
of Christ would have refused to believe the writings of Christ, whom they 
deemed to work miracles by the magic art.<br>
